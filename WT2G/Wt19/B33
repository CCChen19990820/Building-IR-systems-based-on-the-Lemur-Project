<h2>Media Violence</h2>


<i><blockquote>


A new report from Focus on the Family charges that the content of our  
popular media is becoming increasingly violent.
 </blockquote></i>

<P>

"Three decades ago, not one popular song encouraged robbery, rape,  
murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle disputes," says Focus on the  
Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "In today's popular music,  
all these themes can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo.  
Unfortunately, America's streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect  
this fact. What's more, since violent lyrics are a relatively new  
phenomenon, no one knows the results of raising a generation on this  
type of musical diet. In addition, teenagers have greater access to (and  
are listening to) far more music than they have in past generations." By  
the end of high school, the average teenager has listened to more than  
10,000 hours of rock music. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Waliszewski argues that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence,  
and sexualized violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its  
early pioneers." But ugliness and depravity are pervasive on television  
today, and "TV talk shows are just the tip of the iceberg." Waliszewski  
warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to those being  
taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message to believe."  
Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem to suggest  
that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the lion's share  
of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most impressionable  
years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average American child  
graduates high school, he or she will have spent nearly 20,000 hours in  
front of a television" -- twice the amount of time spent in school. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood.  
Waliszewski notes that films like "Natural Born Killers" and "Menace II  
Society" have encouraged impressionable viewers to imitate the  
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there.  
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a  
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws  
and lawkeepers." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Jerry Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family cites research identifying "a  
short-term relationship between playing violent video games and  
increased aggressive behavior in younger children." The data suggest  
that "the ill effects of video games are worse than those of TV because  
children actively control the violence rather than passively view it. In  
other words, the more children practice violent acts, the more likely they  
are to perform violent acts." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only  
noneducational diversion available to them. Pornographers and  
pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse possibilities of electronic  
mail. Waliszewski and Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family warn that  
"parents must not look to the government to protect their children. They  
must take an active role in monitoring" the content of the various  
popular media available in their own homes.

<h2> Truth About Communism </h2>


<i><blockquote>



John T. Flynn did not have access to the Venona documents, but he did 
have plenty of other evidence, when he tried to convince his skeptical 
countrymen of the truly insidious nature of the Communist conspiracy.
</blockquote></i><P>

John T. Flynn knew that "one of the greatest difficulties in explaining 
this menace is the inability of the normal, decent American to fully 
understand the peculiar nature of Communist methods." Nevertheless, in 
a nationally syndicated radio broadcast in 1954, Flynn charged that 
"among us is a sizable number of people [who] hate our American way. 
They want to end our free system and introduce a system more nearly 
resembling that of Russia. The State . . . will be supreme. It will own all 
the large industries . . . and, eventually, everything. This is socialism."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn pointed out that Communists "seldom get elected to office. They 
cannot get power to act, at least not so long as they admit they are 
Communists. So their policy is to deny they are Communists or socialists 
and to insert themselves into influential positions in the Democratic or 
Republican parties and to get into bureaus where decisions on policy are 
made." Once they've weaseled their way in, "they use their weight to 
influence those policies of the government which will serve their ends 
and the ends of Soviet Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn charged that "secret cells began to operate in the important 
agencies of our government" in 1933. By the time of his broadcast, 
eleven years later, "thousands of these Reds had made their way into 
almost all of the most important spots in our government." Ensconced in 
positions of influence, "they took their orders directly from agents of the 
Russian espionage system stationed in New York and Washington."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The alarming extent of this penetration of our government was "brought 
out in a series of investigations in which the members of the House and 
the Senate who made the investigations were pilloried and denounced by 
the same newspapers and political leaders who [later denounced] Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. It was the influence of these cells which enabled the 
Soviet government, when World War II ended, to take over all of Eastern 
Europe and most of the continent of Asia, to penetrate our colleges, our 
public school system, many of our leading magazines and newspapers 
and news services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn recalled Senator McCarthy's famous 1950 speech in which "he 
charged that Communists in the State Department were helping to shape 
our policy in Asia and he put the number of Communists in a position to 
do this at 57. But he did not name them publicly. For this and a 
subsequent speech he was greeted by a storm of abuse." Flynn argued 
that "it takes a brave man to stand up against the savage abuse and the 
underground assaults which these Red conspirators pour out upon any 
loyal American who attempts to oppose them." He expressed intense 
admiration for "the undaunted stand [McCarthy took] against the 
malignant defenders of Russia and their confederates and dupes in the 
United States."

<H3><I> A NATIONAL SECURITY AGENDA FOR THE NEW SECRETARY OF DEFENSE </I></H3>

Backgrounder #214<BR>
 2/10/94<BR>

<P>

(Updating Backgrounder 957, "Thumbs Down to the Bottom-Up Review,"
September 22, 1993)
<P>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

The uncontentious confirmation hearings and unanimous Senate approval
of Secretary of Defense   William Perry last week belie the challenges
that face him as President Clinton's third choice to head the
Pentagon. It remains an open question whether he can do what Les Aspin
was unable to: develop a defense policy to address America's global
interests despite the low priority the Administration places on
defense. It is unlikely that Secretary Perry will be any more
successful than his predecessor unless the President fundamentally
alters his Administration's approach to national security planning.

<P>
Scrapping the "Bottom-Up Review" 
<P>
     The first among Perry's priorities should be to dispense with
Aspin's Bottom-Up Review of United States defense strategy and
requirements. Conducted last year by the Department of Defense, this
review was an attempt by Aspin to establish a new force structure for
the U.S. military following the Cold War. 
<P>
     The findings of the review, released on September 1, were based
on faulty assumptions. For example, Aspin asserted that the U.S. must
be able to address four dangers to American interests around the
world. Two of these dangers -- the threats posed by the spread of
weapons of mass destruction and regional aggressors -- are relevant
and deserve the attention of the Secretary of Defense. The other two
-- threats to democracy in various countries around the globe and slow
economic growth at home -- have no place in military or security
planning and will lead to the inappropriate application of military
force. The threat to democracy was cited as a reason for engaging in
"peacemaking" operations in places such as Somalia and Haiti. But
Americans saw in 1993 how faulty that rationale was for deploying
troops overseas. As a result of poorly conceived military operations
based on the flawed assumptions of the Bottom-Up Review, for example,
about two dozen U.S. soldiers died in Somalia while trying
unsuccessfully to establish democracy in that war-ravaged nation.
<P>
     In addition to flawed assumptions, the Bottom-Up Review is marred
by contradictory findings. The Heritage Foundation conducted a
detailed analysis of the Bottom-Up Review and identified a number of
shortcomings. (See Lawrence T.  DiRita, et al., "Thumbs Down To The
Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  957,
September 22, 1993.) The two principal ones, which alone justify
scrapping the Bottom-Up Review, are:

     <P>
1)   The force outlined in the Bottom-Up Review is too large to be
     purchased under President Clinton's five-year defense budget.
     This fact seemed to have been an issue in Aspin's departure. The
     week before his resignation, he was embroiled in a public dispute
     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget over the
     need for an additional $30 billion to $50 billion over five years
     to pay for the Bottom-Up Review force.
<P>
2)   The force is too small to address the two "nearly simultaneous"
     major regional conflicts it is expected to handle. Once the
     forces for each conflict were allocated as outlined in the
     Bottom-Up Review, the U.S. would be left with no forces in
     reserve for a crisis of any size anywhere else in the world. Nor
     would there be additional forces to relieve those engaged in the
     two major regional conflicts which Aspin says the U.S. must be
     prepared to face. 
<P>
     As Perry develops a new blueprint for the nation's defense to
replace the Bottom-Up Review, he must start with a new assessment of
militarily significant U.S. vital interests. Those interests are to: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     protect America's territory, borders, and airspace; 
<P>
     prevent a hostile, hegemonic power from arising in East Asia,
     Europe, the Persian Gulf, or Latin America;
<P>
     defend access to foreign trade; 
<P>
     protect the lives and well-being of individual Americans against
     such threats as drug trafficking and terrorism; and 
<P>
     maintain access to resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Perry must build a military force adequate to defend these vital
interests. He should establish a minimum strength or "floor force"
below which U.S. forces will not be allowed to fall. This minimum
force, as determined by Heritage Foundation analysts in their
comprehensive review of national security priorities, consists of 16
Army divisions, 21 Air Force tactical wings, 400 Navy ships, and
177,000 active-duty Marines. (See Kim R.  Holmes, ed., A Safe and
Prosperous America:  A U.S.  Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint
(Washington, D.C.:  The Heritage Foundation, 1993).) By fielding a
force of this size and providing necessary funding, Perry can avoid
the contradictions found in the Bottom-Up Review.

<P>
Regaining Control of the Defense Budget
<P>
     Another priority for Perry should be to regain control of defense
spending. Many in Congress are expressing concern that the Clinton
Administration is cutting defense too quickly. Three senior Republican
Senators -- Bob Dole of Kansas, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina -- stated in a December 13 letter to
President Clinton: "As Commander-in-Chief, we know you will not
delegate responsibility for our national security to those responsible
solely for budget matters."
<P>
     The Senators are alarmed that Clinton's Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) is exercising too much influence over defense spending
and is thus becoming the main bureaucratic force behind defense
reductions. A major reason for the failure of the Bottom-Up Review was
the insistence by OMB Director Leon Panetta that Aspin not exceed
annual spending limits regardless of the findings of his comprehensive
review of force requirements. Thus, instead of a "bottom-up" review,
Aspin actually conducted a "top down" review, starting with the budget
he was allocated and determining a strategy and force structure to
satisfy that budget.
<P>
     Perry should heed the Senators' warning and commit himself to a
defense budget that will fund the "floor force" outlined by Heritage
analysts. Only a force at least this size is adequate to defend
America's interests around the world. To do so, Perry should seek a
defense budget that will average $280 billion per year over the next
five years.
<P>
     To do this, of course, President Clinton must abandon one of the
assumptions of the Bottom-Up Review: that the primary cause of the
country's fiscal woes is a bloated defense budget. That assumption is
hard to justify. Defense spending has declined steadily since its peak
in 1986; it would have declined by 40 percent by 1997 even with the
much smaller cuts proposed by the Bush Administration. With defense
spending falling at such a rate, it cannot reasonably be argued that
defense spending is the cause of America's economic troubles.

<P>
Reversing the Downward Spiral of Military Readiness
<P>
     Yet another priority for Perry should be to prevent budget cuts
from endangering the combat readiness of U.S. forces. In May 1993,
Secretary Aspin observed that "right now, we've got the best, most
ready force in the world.... To keep it that way, we're going to have
to do something that has proved very, very difficult in the past, and
that is we're going to have to maintain readiness during a major
drawdown of our forces." (David C.  Morrison, "Ringing Hollow,"
National Journal, September 18, 1993, p.  2242.) 
<P>
     Aspin's promise to maintain the combat readiness of U.S. forces
has been echoed by Secretary Perry, who declared during his
confirmation hearings that "readiness is my first priority." (United
States Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Answers to Advance
Questions by Dr.  William J.  Perry, reprinted in Inside the Pentagon
Special Report, February 3, 1994, p.  10.) But there is evidence that
Aspin's earlier promises are already being broken. For example:
The Army's budget for modernizing its forces, based on requirements
identified during the Persian Gulf war, is under-funded by $1 billion.
("$1 Billion of Army Modernization Plans Unfunded," Inside the
Pentagon, July 7, 1993, p.  5.) 
<P>
For the first time in ten years, less than 90 percent of the Marine
Corps' equipment is ready to go to war; 
(General Carl E.  Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the Marine Corps,
statement for the record for the Senate Armed Services Committee, May
19, 1993.) the Marines' backlog in some maintenance categories has
gone from zero to $160 million in just two years. (Margo MacFarland,
"Nunn Warns That Outlay Problem in '95 Could Be Even Worse Than '94,"
Inside the Navy, June 21, 1993, p.  17.)
<P>
Because of a budget shortfall of $765 million, the Navy has a backlog
of 150 aircraft and 250 aircraft engines in need of maintenance.
(Admiral Frank B.  Kelso, II, statement for the record for the Senate
Armed Services Committee, May 19, 1993.) 
<P>
     These figures reflect the declining combat readiness of U.S.
forces, and these forces will become even weaker if the Bottom-Up
Review is implemented. (For a full discussion of U.S.  military
readiness, see John Luddy, "Stop the Slide Toward A Hollow Military,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No.  209, January 14, 1994.)
As already noted, the Bottom-Up Review Force (BURF) will be spread too
thin for its size and capability, and will not be sufficient to defend
America's global interests. Worse yet, the Clinton Administration
hopes to find budget savings in critical procurement and development
accounts, which will slow the modernization of the force by delaying
the purchase of advanced weapons and technology. In the fiscal 1993
budget, for example, procurement spending was reduced by 17 percent.
This will have an impact on military readiness. 
<P>
     On top of this procurement reduction, Congress imposed a steep 11
percent real reduction in the research and development (R&D) budget in
fiscal 1994, a reduction far larger than that proposed by the
Administration. The deep cuts in procurement and R&D, combined with
the overcommitment of forces embodied in the Bottom-Up Review, is a
recipe for military disaster and the needless loss of American lives. 
<P>
     With his considerable experience managing several defense
technology companies, Perry should know first hand how important it is
for the U.S. to maintain its lead in military technology. The military
must not return to the "hollow force" of the 1970s, when U.S. forces
looked strong on paper but were nonetheless unable to respond
effectively if called to war. To avoid a weakening of America's combat
capability, the Clinton Administration and Congress together must:
<P>
Budget $1.4 trillion for defense from fiscal 1993 to 1997, or
approximately $280 billion per year.
<P>
Restore the proven ratio of two procurement dollars for every one
dollar spent on research and development.  This balances the
modernization of today's force with the development of the force of
tomorrow.
<P>
Scrap Aspin's Readiness Task Force. This group is composed of eight
retired senior officers who are supposed to warn if spending cuts are
having an adverse impact on readiness. This merely creates another
layer of bureaucracy where none is necessary. The service chiefs have
statutory responsibilities for leadership of their respective
services, and it is they who should warn the Secretary if readiness is
being sacrificed.
<P>
Reversing Decisions That Weaken U.S. Missile Defenses 
<P>
     Aspin established anti-missile defense priorities that are both
misdirected and under-funded. By focusing almost all funding on
developing defenses against short-range ballistic missiles, the
Administration is ignoring the importance of defending U.S. territory
against long-range ballistic missiles. Moreover, Aspin has proposed
reducing the budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion, or by
over 50 percent, during the period from fiscal 1995 through fiscal
1999. Even high-priority "theater" defenses against short-range
missiles will be cut by $4.5 billion over the same period.
<P>
     The U.S. has only the most limited anti-missile capability, and
U.S. territory is defenseless against long-range missile attacks. This
comes at a time when a prominent Russian politician, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky -- whose party won the largest share of the vote in
Russia's December 12 parliamentary election -- has begun rattling the
nuclear saber. Zhirinovsky, for example, identifies Los Angeles and
Washington as potential nuclear targets if the U.S. challenges
Russia's "right" to "carry out its great historic mission and free the
world of wars." (For a discussion of Zhirinovsky's writings, see Ariel
Cohen and Melana Zyla, "Zhirinovsky in His Own Words:  Excerpts from
The Final Thrust South," Heritage Foundation FYI, February 4, 1994.)
Although Boris Yeltsin still controls the nuclear arsenal of the
former Soviet Union, Zhirinovsky may be a candidate for the Russian
presidency in the next election. Without U.S. missile defenses to
deter him, a future President Zhirinovsky may present an American
President with a cruel dilemma: pay the extortion he has threatened or
sacrifice cities like Los Angeles and Washington. Removing this
vulnerability will at a minimum require that Perry restore full
funding to the anti-missile effort and proceed quickly with the most
promising technologies for effective missile defense: space-based
systems.
<P>
Restoring Strength to U.S. Naval Forces 
<P>
     The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union
have made the world a somewhat safer place. With no other single power
able to challenge it on the battlefield or on the high seas, America's
need for an Army, Air Force, and Navy designed to fight a large and
extended campaign is greatly reduced. 
<P>
     At the same time, there remains greater uncertainty on the
geopolitical landscape. This puts a premium on mobile, flexible
forces. Such forces can be tailored to a specific crisis, transported
to it quickly, and reinforced with heavier forces if necessary. Naval
forces provide this combination of forward presence, mobility, and
flexibility. 
<P>
     A strategy that rests on the ability to project military power to
important regions of the world depends on a strong Navy. But the Aspin
plan for naval forces is inadequate. The Bottom-Up Review force
envisions 346 ships and 11 carriers, but overcommits that smaller
number to two "nearly simultaneous" regional conflicts and an
aggressive peacekeeping agenda. Put simply, Aspin's Navy could not
cover all of the contingencies envisioned in his Bottom-Up Review.
Perry can resolve this problem by declaring that he supports a 400-
ship Navy with 12 active aircraft carriers. 

<P>
 Ending Use of the Military for Social Experiments
<P>
     Secretary Perry will have to deal with the consequences of
Clinton's ill-advised campaign to end the military's ban on
homosexuals in the armed forces. Since a stricter version of the ban
was passed into law last fall, the Clinton Justice Department has been
timid in exercising its responsibility to prosecute open homosexuals
in uniform. For example, after a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit
Court ruled, in a case last November involving a homosexual former
Naval Academy midshipman, that the homosexual ban was
unconstitutional, the Clinton Justice Department refused to appeal the
case to the full circuit court. 
<P>
     At least three prominent Senators on the Armed Services Committee
-- Chairman Sam Nunn (D-GA), Dan Coats (R-IN), and Strom Thurmond (R-
SC) -- have indicated that they may re-open debate in the Senate if
the Administration fails to fully enforce the ban. (Rowan Scarborough,
"Two GOP Senators Set To Revive Debate on Gays in Military," The
Washington Times, January 7, 1993, p.  3.) The American people, the
Administration, and above all the armed forces do not need a new fight
on this issue. Perry, therefore, must reaffirm the Defense
Department's sound arguments for the ban, and pressure the
Administration to enforce it to the utmost. 
<P>
     As for assigning women to combat positions, much damage has
already been done. To accommodate the career aspirations of women
officers, restrictions on women combat pilots in the Navy and Air
Force have been lifted; the Pentagon is still considering allowing
women into ground combat assignments in infantry, artillery, and tank
units. Experience has shown that the introduction of women into combat
units reduces military readiness for a variety of reasons, including
the innate physiological differences between the sexes. Moreover, in
the one historical case where women were deliberately placed in combat
-- in Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War -- they were removed
within weeks. The reason: It was clear that men reacted to the
presence of women by trying to protect them and aiding them when they
became casualties instead of continuing to attack. The Israelis also
learned that unit morale was seriously damaged when men saw women
killed and injured on the battlefield. (Presidential Commission on the
Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, International Trip Report,
September 14-27, 1992.)
<P>
     There is not a single argument based on national security or
military readiness which supports the idea of placing women in combat
units; until one is made, this social experiment must be reversed. As
Secretary of Defense, Perry must take this message to the President.
Within the Defense Department, he should also:
<P>
Overturn Secretary Aspin's decision to rescind the "risk rule," which
prevents the assignment of women to military units where there is
substantial risk of direct contact with the enemy; 
<P>
Postpone any further action regarding women until full Senate hearings
are held on this issue;
<P>
Review the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the
Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended against
assigning women to combat aircraft and ground units; 
<P>
Review physical and performance requirements to ensure that men and
women are held to the same high standards; and
<P>
Ensure that women and men are subject to equal disciplinary standards.
<P>


CONCLUSION
<P>
     The very fact that Secretary Perry was Clinton's third choice for
the post in one year indicates much disarray in the Administration's
national security policy. The President's discomfort and lack of
interest toward the military is palpable. The press widely reported
the comment of one Administration adviser, who wished to remain
unnamed, who noted the obvious during the selection process for
Aspin's replacement:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     They really just wanted to get the Pentagon off the screen.
     Every time it was on, it was trouble that interfered with
     the President's agenda. Their attitude was, if they could
     subcontract out the Pentagon, they would. (Ann Devroy and
     Barton Gellman, "How Search Finally Led To Perry," The
     Washington Post, January 25, 1994, p.  A1.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The President's responsibility as Commander in Chief is enshrined
in the Constitution. No other duty is more important for a U.S.
President -- not reforming health care, welfare, or even stopping
domestic crime, as important as these issues are to the American
people. History will hold the President, not his secretary of defense,
accountable for the type of disaster seen last year in Somalia. More
such disasters surely will come unless Secretary Perry can convince
the President to turn around his defense policies. If the events of
1993 failed to teach the President this lesson, then tyrants around
the world such as North Korea's Kim Il-Sung and even Russia's Vladimir
Zhirinovsky may do so.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
China's July 21-26 missile test about 100 miles north of Taiwan
was a blatant act of intimidation. Armed with nuclear warheads,
these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases
or naval formations in Asia, which lack adequate missile defenses.
China's attempt to threaten the Republic of China challenges the
United States to provide its forces and friends with appropriate
defenses. Unless America responds, China's future nuclear intimidation
could destabilize Asia by driving others in the region to seek
their own nuclear deterrent.
<P>
To avoid this, the U.S. should incorporate missile defenses into
its strategy to deter aggression in Asia. At the same time, Washington
should emphasize missile defense cooperation as an effective alternative
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's
focus on short-range, theater-based missile defense (TMD) systems
is inadequate. The Administration can enhance security in Asia
by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile
attack and extending that umbrella to America's allies and friends
in the region. Such a strategy should include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Building and deploying</B> a missile defense system for the United
States. In order to defend its allies, America itself must
be defended from missile attack.
<P>
<LI><B>Improving</B> the defense of U.S. forces in Asia by accelerating
development and deployment of the Navy's Upper Tier system to
the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD system to U.S. forces in
South Korea and Japan.
<P>
<LI><B>Encouraging</B> Australia, Japan, and South Korea to acquire
advanced U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense
cooperation.
<P>
<LI><B>Telling</B> China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.
<P>
<LI><B>Selling</B> advanced theater missile defense systems to Taiwan,
consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval
TMD forces to help defend Taiwan.
<P>
<LI><B>Offering</B> India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.
</ul>
<P>
<b>ASIAN MISSILE THREATS AND PROLIFERATION DANGERS</b>
<P>
<B>China's Global and Regional Threat. </B>China's nuclear missile
program dates back to the mid-1950s and has grown to include several
classes of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. China is believed
to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. <sup>1</sup> By
the year 2120, according to one estimate, China could have 50
to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching
the United States from bases in China. <sup>2</sup>  Two mobile ICBMs are under
development  the 5,000-mile-range DF-31 and the 7,500-mile-range
DF-41. The DF-31, tested on May 29, 1995, could reach the Western
U.S. if fired from Northern China. China deploys four DF-5 missiles
which can carry a 4 to 5 megaton warhead over 8,000 miles and
10 DF-4 missiles with a 3,000-mile range. China has one to two
nuclear missile submarines which can carry 12 of the 1,000-mile
Julang-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The 5,000-mile-range
<I>Julang-2</I>, a variant of the DF-31, is under development.
<P>
China also possesses several intermediate-range and tactical nuclear-capable
missiles. Since the mid-1980s it has build over 30 DF-21 missiles
with a 1,125-mile range. It also may have more than 60 older and
less accurate DF-3 1,700-mile-range missiles. Chinese nuclear-capable
tactical missiles include the 185-mile-range DF-11 (M-11) and
the 375-mile-range DF-15 (M-9). According to Chinese military
analyst Dr. Chong Pin Lin, China has hired Russian technicians
and may have purchased a complete missile plant from Russia, to
produce long-range cruise missiles similar to the U.S. <I>Tomahawk.</I> <sup>3</sup>
 China is developing Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) that
emit precise navigation signals. With such a capability, Chinese
ballistic and cruise missiles could acquire high degrees of accuracy. <sup>4</sup>

<P>
In 1993 China reportedly purchased 60 Russian S-300s, comparable
in capability to the U.S. Patriot missile, which can intercept
tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Russian Scud, in flight. <sup>5</sup>
 Thus, China already has a limited anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) capability.
<P>
China's nuclear strategy against the United States and Russia
is often described as one of &quot;minimum deterrence,&quot; targeting
its small number of ICBMs on U.S. or Russian cities. However,
Beijing clearly employs a more active strategy with its intermediate
and tactical missiles. The &quot;testing&quot; of DF-21s and M-9s
near Taiwan was China's first high-profile use of missiles to
intimidate an opponent. The M-9 missiles were fired from Leping
Military Base in the Jaingxi Province west of Taiwan; Taipei is
just at the edge of the M-9's 370-mile range from this base. <sup>6</sup> 
DF-21 missiles are deployed from bases where they can threaten
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. <sup>7</sup>
 With the assistance of PLA Navy tracking ships, DF-21 missiles
also could be used to attack U.S. Navy carrier task groups. From
China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, DF-21 missiles could
counter U.S. naval forces transiting the Straits of Malacca.
<P>
<B>North Korea's Current and Future Threat. </B>North Korea's
extensive missile program is often overshadowed by its nuclear
weapons development program. <sup>8</sup>  But its ballistic missile program
deserves equal attention. It was revealed in 1994 that North Korea
was developing two long-range missiles, dubbed the Taepo Dong-1
&amp; 2 with estimated ranges of 1,200 miles and 2,000 miles,
respectively. These missiles would give North Korea the capability
to target U.S. forces in Guam. According to recent South Korean
and Russian estimates, the Taepo Dong-2 could have a 6,200-mile
range, which would cover about half the continental U.S. <sup>9</sup>  At this
estimated range, the Taepo Dong-2 also could reach Europe, all
of East Asia, and Australia. Some U.S. estimates, however, give
this missile only a 2,500-mile range, and it is not expected to
be operational before the year 2000. In a June 1994 statement,
the head of U.S. Naval Intelligence estimated a North Korean missile
could carry a nuclear warhead by the year 2000, or possibly as
early as this year. <sup>10</sup>
<P>
North Korea tested a variant of the Scud in May 1993. Called the
<I>Nodong-1 </I>, it has an estimated 625-mile range and is capable
of threatening U.S. forces in Japan. North Korea was reported
to have had 12 to 18 <I>Nodong-1 </I> missiles in early 1994. <sup>11</sup>
 There are also reports that the North is developing a solid-fueled
930-mile transportable variant, the Nodong-2, with the help of
Russian technicians. <sup>12</sup> 
<P>
Pyongyang began producing the 185-mile-range Scud-B in the mid-1980s,
after gaining advanced missile design knowledge from China and
from copying a <I>Scud-B</I> obtained from Egypt, most likely
in 1981. <sup>13</sup>  Pyongyang began production of the improved 300-mile-range
Scud-C in 1991 and is now estimated to be producing that missile
at a rate of 100 a year. The Scud-C is a mobile missile capable
of carrying high explosive, biological, or chemical warheads.
It has a range enabling it to reach all of South Korea. The North
is believed to maintain a total of 24 to 36 Scud-Cs in its Army.

<P>
According to Robert D. Walpole, Deputy Director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, &quot;North Korea is the largest proliferator [in the
world] of ballistic missiles.&quot; <sup>14</sup>   Pyongyang uses missile sales
to earn hard cash for oil. By one estimate North Korea has sold
Iran and Syria a total of 320 Scud-Cs. <sup>15</sup>  It also has enhanced Iran's
missile production capability. In turn, Iran may be providing
North Korea with missile test facilities. <sup>16</sup>  Although North Korea
has discussed missile sales with Libya, Walpole believes that
Iran probably will be the first to purchase <I>Nodong</I> missiles.
<P>
<B>India and Pakistan. </B>India and Pakistan have fought each
other in 1947, 1966, and 1971. In recent years both countries
have almost come to blows over the disputed state of Kashmir in
Northern India. Their nuclear competition dates from the 1970s.
Although claiming not to be a nuclear state, India is believed
to have exploded a 12-kiloton nuclear device in 1974, and Shekhar
Gupta, Senior Editor of<I> India Today</I>, estimates India has
enough fissile material to build 60 bombs. <sup>17</sup>  The opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) is committed to building a nuclear arsenal
and may lead the government after national elections early in
1996. Meanwhile, Pakistan is believed to have enough plutonium
for seven crude nuclear weapons. <sup>18</sup>  Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD)
charged in April of this year that he believes Pakistan has five
nuclear weapons and India possesses between five and ten. <sup>19</sup>  The
inability of the Bush Administration in 1990 to certify that Pakistan
lacked a nuclear weapon triggered provisions of the 1986 Pressler
Amendment barring U.S. military sales to Pakistan.
<P>
Both states are developing missiles that could be nuclear armed.
India is deploying the indigenously developed 150-mile-range Prithvi
 to reserve Army units. <sup>20</sup>  This is a liquid-fueled, mobile missile.
India is estimated to have 40 to 50 <I>Prithvi </I> missiles,
with the intention of building up to 80. <sup>21</sup>  In 1992 India tested
a variant of the liquid-fueled and immobile <I>Agni </I> missile
that flew over 1,500 miles. It is now considering deploying this
missile, <sup>22</sup> which is capable of reaching most of Pakistan and many
targets in China. Additionally, India is developing an Advanced
Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV) for commercial purposes, and this
could become a 2,500-mile-range missile. In 1993 the United States
stopped Russia from selling ICBM engine technology to India but
did go ahead and sell complete rocket engines that could assist
India in building more powerful missile engines.
<P>
With China's assistance, Pakistan began the development of its
Haft missiles in the early 1980s. First tested in 1989, the <I>Haft-1</I>
has a range of only 50 miles. Also under development are the 185-mile
<I>Haft-2 </I>and 375-mile <I>Haft-3</I> missiles. In 1991 U.S.
officials revealed that Pakistan was purchasing the 185-mile Chinese
M-11. <super23></sup>  Pakistan received transporter-erector-launchers for the
M-11 in February 1991 from China. In July 1995, U.S. spy satellites
discovered over 30 M-11 delivery cases at an air force base in
Pakistan. <sup>24</sup> 
<P>
Future Indian long-range ballistic missiles may be capable of
reaching U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. However,
India's and Pakistan's potential nuclear missile arsenals are
mainly to deter each other, while India also seeks to deter China.
While it would not threaten the United States, a nuclear missile
exchange between India and Pakistan would create incalculable
destruction and loss of life, fuel religious and ethnic conflict,
and destabilize South Asia and the Persian Gulf for decades.
<P>
<b>DIPLOMACY ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT PROLIFERATION </b>
<P>
Washington has tried diplomacy and sanctions to prevent nuclear
and missile proliferation in Asia. While these attempts have been
worthwhile, they have not stopped proliferation. China signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1992 but continues
to export nuclear technology. Most recently China is reported
to have sold Iran a calutron for enriching uranium, a critical
missing link in Iran's nuclear weapons program. <sup>25</sup>  China twice has
promised but failed to abide by the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which forbids the sale of missiles with ranges
over 185 miles. <sup>26</sup>  However, evidence is accumulating that China
earlier this year shipped more than 30 M-11s to Pakistan. <sup>27</sup>
<P>
North Korea signed the NPT in 1985 but has failed to comply fully
with its terms. For example, it refused until 1992 to allow inspections
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as required by
the pact and threatened to withdraw from the pact in March 1993
in reaction to IAEA requests to inspect a nuclear waste dump.
This dump, which would have yielded information on the extent
of North Korean plutonium production, still has not been inspected.
In addition, North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge, made to
South Korea in 1991, to create a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula.
The threat of limited United Nations sanctions in 1994 forced
Pyongyang to agree to &quot;freeze&quot; its nuclear program.
In October 1994 North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle
its existing nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants that would be financed and built by an international
consortium. However, the pact allows Pyongyang to delay full IAEA
inspections for five years or more and stipulates that these inspections
will not begin until &quot;significant components&quot; of the
reactors are delivered.
<P>
Pyongyang has challenged and will likely continue to challenge
the implementation of this complex agreement.<sup>28</sup>  Pyongyang's objections
to Seoul's role in building the proposed light-water reactors
heightened tensions and again led to a flurry of U.S.-North Korean
negotiations this Spring and to further delay in the agreement's
implementation. Meanwhile, it is possible that North Korea continues
nuclear weapons-related research and development in locations
unknown to the IAEA  which cannot undertake full-scope inspections.
North Korea also refuses to join the MTCR. North Korea's ability
to undermine the NPT and IAEA and flout the MTCR all demonstrate
the weakness of diplomacy in stemming nuclear proliferation.
<P>
Both India and Pakistan also have refused to sign the NPT and
join the MTCR. The Pressler Amendment sanctions against Pakistan,
which have barred U.S. military sales since 1990, have yet to
convince Islamabad to end its nuclear weapons program. The Bush
Administration tried, but failed, to convince India and Pakistan
to negotiate a South Asian Nuclear Free Zone.<sup>29</sup>  In 1994 Pakistan
rejected a Clinton Administration proposal that the United States
and NATO guarantee Pakistan's security if it denuclearized.<sup>30</sup>
<P>
<b>THE DANGERS OF A WEAKER U.S. DETERRENT IN ASIA</b>
<P>
America's extended nuclear and conventional force deterrent is
the foundation of security in the Asia-Pacific region. This American
commitment obviates the need for allies and friends to build their
own nuclear deterrent. The possibility of nuclear proliferation
in Asia increases when America's commitment is undermined, either
from Washington or by new nuclear threats. After China's threatening
July missile tests, in Taiwan's parliament on July 28, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui responded to a question from opposition
Democratic Progressive Party member Liu Jui-hsiung on whether
Taiwan should develop nuclear weapons. &quot;Whether [we] need
nuclear weapons would require long-term study,&quot; Lee said.
&quot;Taiwan used to have the capability to build nuclear weapons
but it caused international concern and damaged the country's
image.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 
<P>
Indeed, it was the Carter Administration's decision to end diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and its attempt to reduce U.S. troops in
South Korea that increased interest in nuclear weapons in both
countries. Washington convinced Taipei not to proceed with attempts
to acquire plutonium in the late 1970s and to end nuclear weapons-related
research in the late 1980s.<sup>32</sup>  A retired South Korean general has
disclosed that in the late 1970s South Korea almost completed
an atomic bomb, but the project stopped after pressure from Washington.<sup>33</sup>

<P>
Although, although Japan's national policy since 1971 has been
not to manufacture, possess, or allow the introduction of nuclear
weapons into Japan, in 1994 then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata unnerved
many with the comment that &quot;It is certainly the case that
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but has not
made them.&quot;<sup>34</sup>  Only a series of cataclysmic events, such as
a rupture of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty combined with nuclear
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, would likely move Japan
to build nuclear weapons.<sup>35</sup> 
<P>
Missile technology is also widespread throughout Asia. Japan's
H-2 commercial space-launch vehicle conceivably could be turned
into a 9,300-mile-range ICBM. The South Korean Army deploys the
150-mile <I>NHK-1 </I>tactical missile. In June, Seoul reportedly
asked Washington to scrap a 1979 agreement that bars South Korea
from building missiles that travel more than 180 miles.<sup>36</sup>  Taipei
is developing the 80-mile-range<I> Green Bee</I> tactical missile
and the 600-mile-range <I>Sky Horse</I> missile.
<P>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES BENEFIT ASIANS AND AMERICANS</b>
<P>
Missile defense systems will increase the security of American
forces deployed abroad. At the same time, they can benefit the
United States and its Asian allies in other ways. For example:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Anti-missile systems offer a deterrent far less threatening
than nuclear weapons.</B>
<P>
Anti-missile systems are a less destabilizing way to deter attack
from nuclear missile-armed states.  Should a non-nuclear Asian
state build nuclear weapons, other non-nuclear states will be
inclined to follow suit. This is a recipe for further proliferation.
<P>
<LI><B>Anti-missile defenses reduce vulnerability to nuclear blackmail.</B>
<P>
China's July missile tests were intended to threaten Taiwan. With
appropriate anti-missile systems, Taiwan would not be as vulnerable
to future Chinese threats. Moreover, with adequate defenses, South
Korea and Japan could better withstand potential North Korean
or Chinese demands backed by nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses are insurance against accidental nuclear
missile launches.</B>
<P>
China is undergoing a near-term leadership transition in which
the military could emerge as a nationalist force. Because political
stability cannot be assured, concerns that the political leadership
may lose control of China's nuclear weapons cannot be dismissed.<sup>38</sup>
 Control of some of China's nuclear weapons may have been contested
in 1967, as reports indicate that the commander of the Chinese
military region containing the Lop Nor nuclear test facilities
rebelled briefly against Mao Tse-tung.<sup>39</sup>  In North Korea, presumed
leader Kim Jong-Il's intentions toward South Korea remain unclear,
while accurate knowledge of his health and mental stability is
lacking. Were he to be replaced by a faction bent on heightening
tensions with South Korea, the chances of an accidental missile
launch would grow.
<P>
<LI><B>Cooperation in missile defenses can build political confidence
in Asia.</B>
<P>
As missile defenses are non-threatening and reduce threats to
Asian population centers, multilateral efforts led by the United
States can enhance security, promote defense cooperation, and
advance U.S. leadership with Asian allies and friends. These measures
would decrease mistrust and increase confidence between Asian
countries.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses can create incentives to reduce both nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.</B>
<P>
For example, if both India and Pakistan possessed missile defenses,
there would be less incentive to launch missile attacks against
each other. A reduction in the utility of nuclear missiles could
enhance mutual confidence, opening the door to negotiations on
limiting and reducing nuclear and missile forces. Similarly, if
the ROC possessed adequate missile defenses, Taipei would have
a greater incentive to propose confidence-building measures with
Beijing. It could ask, for example, that Beijing join it in agreeing
not to deploy tactical or intermediate-range missiles within a
threatening proximity. If the U.S. and its Asian allies were to
create a regional missile defense system, they would have greater
credibility in approaching China, perhaps in the ASEAN Regional
Forum, about beginning a dialogue on shared missile defense systems.
This could serve as an incentive for Beijing to limit its short-range
and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
<P></OL>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES WILL STRENGTHEN ASIAN SECURITY</b>
<P>
American extended deterrence and forward deployment of conventional
forces serve as the foundation for Asian security. In order to
strengthen deterrence and security in Asia, the United States
must take the lead in dealing with Asia's emerging next threat:
 the proliferation of nuclear-armed missiles. The United States
is the only country with the technical and moral strength to counter
the growing missile threat in Asia.
<P>
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985 invited Australia,
Japan, and South Korea to participate in the Strategic Defense
Initiative.<sup>40</sup>  Only Japan responded positively, allowing private
companies in 1987 to participate in missile defense architecture
studies with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Clinton Administration
has built on this by seeking Japanese technological contributions
to missile defense systems more aggressively and by offering Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems on a commercial basis.
<P>
But the Administration's Asian missile defense architecture is
hobbled by its decision to abandon the Bush Administration's more
ambitious Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) program.
The Clinton Administration is limiting the U.S. missile defense
program to theater-based, short-range systems. The Administration
refuses to build space-based missile defense systems, like boost-phase
interceptors, that have a better chance of defending the United
States and its allies from missile attack. An active missile defense
strategy toward Asia can strengthen U.S. leadership by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating a major post-Cold War mission for the Asian-American
alliance system. </B>Building a regional missile defense architecture
is a service that only America can provide. A secure and stable
Asia will foster growth in job-creating U.S.-Asia trade. Equally
important, by cooperating with Washington to develop and fund
missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able
to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries
from nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Confirming the benign and defensive intent of American strategy
in Asia. </B>American leadership in missile defenses would offer
allied and friendly Asian states the same protection from limited
nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail that  Americans enjoy. Such
defenses threaten only the offensive weapons of potential aggressor
states in Asia.
<P>
<LI><B>Reversing the growing impression in Asia of American retreat
and weak leadership. </B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's policy flip-flops toward China, attempts
to manage trade with Japan, and inaction in response to aggressive
acts by China in the South China Sea and against Taiwan have reduced
American credibility in Asia. By exercising strong leadership
in missile defenses, Washington can regain lost political momentum
and begin to reverse diplomatic damage. A strategy to accomplish
this goal would entail:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Building and deploying a missile defense system for the United
States.</b>
<P>
A National Missile Defense (NMD) system is needed not only to
defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends
that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail.
Such a goal is both feasible and affordable. Earlier this year,
a team of experts assembled by The Heritage Foundation recommended
a National Missile Defense system based initially on the Navy's
Upper Tier proposal. This is an advanced high-velocity version
of the Navy's <I>Standard</I> surface-to-air missile system deployed
in AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Its guidance would be assisted
by the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> early warning and tracking satellite.
The Heritage plan then calls for Upper Tier to be supplemented
by space-based defenses, to include space-based missile interceptors
and lasers. The cost of the Upper Tier, <i>Brilliant Eyes,</i> and space
based systems is estimated to be about $25 billion over 15 years.<sup>41</sup>
 At the same time, it is critical that the U.S. retain adequate
offensive nuclear systems, although NMD would allow the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear deterrent forces.<sup>42</sup>
<P>
Space-based missile defense systems also would enable the U.S.
to complement any future TMD capabilities of its Asian allies.
If U.S. space-based interceptors or lasers did not destroy hostile
missiles early in their flight, U.S. satellites could help direct
Asian-based interceptors to their targets. Some countries in Asia,
like Australia, oppose a U.S. National Missile Defense program
because it might lead to abrogating the 1973 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. Washington should tell its friends that it seeks
ultimately to renegotiate the ABM Treaty with Russia to allow
for a limited national defense against missiles but that, in the
meantime, the ABM Treaty does not prohibit the United States from
deploying theater missile defenses in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Accelerating development and deployment of the Navy's Upper
Tier TMD system to the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD TMD
system to U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.</b>
<P>
The Clinton Administration should increase funding for the Navy's
Upper Tier TMD system, THAAD, and the Brilliant Eyes early warning
satellite. These TMD systems are needed urgently to defend U.S.
naval and ground forces in Asia.<sup>43</sup>  The Navy's Upper Tier system
is especially important because its mobility will enable the U.S.
Pacific Command to deploy a TMD system near South Korea or Taiwan.
This system also will protect U.S. naval forces within range of
Chinese medium-range missiles. The THAAD system is needed to defend
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan against North Korean Scud
 and <I>Nodong </I> missiles. Accelerated development of Upper
Tier and THAAD would make these systems more rapidly available
for sale to U.S. allies.
<P>
<LI><b>Encouraging Japan, South Korea, and Australia to acquire advanced
U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense cooperation.</b>
<P>
Washington should urge its major allies in Asia to purchase TMD
systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore
multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. Japan
is slowly developing a political consensus to purchase an advanced
U.S.-based TMD system. According to a recent study of potential
missile defense architectures for Japan, completed by private
U.S. and Japanese companies, a Japanese TMD system could include
advanced Patriot, THAAD, and naval-based Upper Tier systems guided
by missile targeting systems built into AWACS radar aircraft.
Washington should urge Tokyo to decide quickly on missile defense
architecture and to purchase those systems from the United States.
<P>
South Korea has a clear requirement to defend itself against North
Korean missiles. Therefore, it is interested in obtaining TMD
systems. Washington should urge Seoul to place a much higher priority
on purchasing TMD systems from the U.S. South Korea now relies
on the approximately 192 Patriot  missiles deployed in the Spring
of 1994, which mainly protect U.S. forces in South Korea and are
not enough to defend ROK forces or cities.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
Australia, which refused to join the 1985 U.S. offer of SDI international
cooperation, finally signed a missile defense research agreement
with the U.S. in June 1995.<sup>45</sup>  During the Gulf War, a jointly manned
early warning satellite downlink in Nurrungar, Australia, helped
target attacking Iraqi Scud  missiles. The U.S. should encourage
Australia to consider purchasing naval-based Upper Tier systems
and placing them in air defense frigates which Australia plans
to build. Washington should ask Canberra to consider hosting a
multinational missile defense early warning observation facility
at Nurrungar. The facility would be open to Western allies cooperating
in missile defense and to other states seeking neutral enforcement
mechanisms for missile control or reduction agreements.
<P>
Washington also should encourage missile defense cooperation between
South Korea and Japan. The major reason for this is to help South
Korea avoid any unintended damage from Chinese or North Korean
missiles destroyed on their way to Japan. When the Upper Tier
AEGIS cruisers are introduced to the 7th Fleet, the U.S. Navy
should demonstrate their capability to allies and friends in Southeast
Asia and make their use a regular part of multilateral exercises,
like <I>KANGAROO</I> in Australia and <I>RIMPAC,</I> conducted
bi-annually with most U.S. allies and friends in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Telling China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.</b>
<P>
Washington should continue to urge Beijing to abide fully by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime. Washington also should urge Beijing to make its
nuclear weapons programs more transparent and to consider eventual
limitations on its nuclear arsenal. But added pressure on China
is needed. The Chinese should be told that if they do not curb
nuclear technology cooperation with countries like Pakistan and
Iran, and missile sales to Pakistan, China will begin to define
itself as an adversary.
<P>
The Clinton Administration should obey the 1990 Arms Export Control
Act that obligates the United States to impose trade sanctions
on China because of its sale of missiles to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence
agencies believe China has shipped over 30 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
This charge cannot be swept under the rug. Failure to respond
to China's sale of missiles makes a mockery of the Administration's
nonproliferation policies. The Clinton Administration should devise
a graduated schedule of sanctions that will be ended when China
joins the MTCR.
<P>
Clinton should also explain to the Chinese that missile defenses
are a justified and moral response to China's continued nuclear
weapons buildup and its demonstrated willingness to engage in
nuclear threats. Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees
to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsenal, the
U.S. will make available to China early warning data.
<P>
<LI><b>Selling advanced TMD systems to Taiwan, consistent with the
Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval TMD forces to help
defend Taiwan.</b>
<P>
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) calls for the U.S. to &quot;provide
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and to &quot;maintain
the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
or the social economic system of the people of Taiwan.&quot; 
Following China's missile &quot;tests&quot; designed to threaten
Taiwan, sale of missile defense systems to Taiwan is consistent
with the TRA. Raytheon Company is helping Taiwan build a variant
of the Patriot PAC-2 called the Modified Air Defense System.<sup>46</sup> 
Since this program does not respond to Taiwan's immediate defense
needs, Washington should offer Taipei the more capable <I>Patriot</I>
 PAC-2 GEM  the most advanced variant in the U.S. Army  and consider
offering THAAD if Beijing persists in threatening Taipei. Washington
should make clear to Beijing that the sale of missile defense
systems to Taiwan does not threaten China. Rather, the purpose
is to prevent China's nuclear blackmail of Taiwan. Washington
also should prepare to use 7th Fleet AEGIS cruisers and destroyers
armed with the Standard Upper Tier TMD missiles to defend Taiwan,
consistent with the TRA.
<P>
<LI><b>Offering India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.</b>
<P>
To advance non-proliferation initiatives between India and Pakistan,
the United States should offer both countries missile defenses
and technology if they agree to limit and reduce their nuclear
and missile arsenals. A verifiable treaty to limit such systems
might be facilitated by giving Indian and Pakistani officials
access to a U.S. monitor that receives data from U.S. early warning
and reconnaissance satellites or a similar monitor placed in another
location. A monitor would enable both countries to observe each
other's military sites and provide warning of a first strike.
The agreement could be strengthened later by the sale of ground-based
TMD systems to both countries. After acquiring space-based missile
defense systems, the U.S. might help enforce an Indian-Pakistan
nuclear and missile reduction treaty by extending space-based
missile defense coverage to both countries. Space-based defenses
also could give Washington the option to intervene unilaterally
to prevent a disastrous nuclear exchange.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
The United States must develop a missile defense strategy for
Asia. Missile defenses are needed to enhance the security of U.S.
military forces in Asia, to safeguard America's Asian friends
and allies, and to encourage multilateral missile defense cooperation.
This strategy is sorely needed to enable Americans and Asians
to reduce their vulnerability to Chinese and future North Korean
nuclear missiles. Both countries have demonstrated they are prepared
to disregard conventions like the NPT and MTCR. China's willingness
to use missiles to intimidate neighbors like Taiwan, in addition
to concerns about instability in China or North Korea, compels
Americans and Asians to plan jointly for appropriate missile defenses.
<P>
Only the United States has the technical capability and the moral
vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail
or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation. By responding
to the threat of nuclear missiles in Asia, the U.S. can counter
perhaps the most critical emerging threat to peace in that region.
At the same time, by demonstrating determination to counter this
threat, Washington will be strengthening its extended nuclear
and conventional deterrent in Asia while lessening the possibility
that Asia could become destabilized by nuclear proliferation.

<h2>Bosnia</h2></center><P>

[The war in Bosnia is a European affair, and European nations should 
settle it. The United States has no strategic interests in Bosnia and gains 
nothing by getting involved.]
<p>
In a historic address to the U.S. Congress, the President acknowledged 
that the interests of European nations are of no particular significance to 
the United States. These nations get embroiled in "frequent controversies, 
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns," said the 
President, concluding that it would be "unwise" to get involved in matters 
of purely European concern. The geographic isolation of the United 
States is a tremendous strategic advantage, and Americans should make 
full use of it. The President said it would be foolish to jeopardize the 
peace and prosperity of our country by thrusting ourselves into the 
middle of the age-old ethnic and national rivalries of Europe.
<p>
These, alas, are not the sentiments of President Bill Clinton. They were 
expressed by an American president, however -- our very first president, 
in fact. President George Washington made his remarks 900 years ago in 
the Farewell Address that culminated his two terms in office. With those 
parting words, Washington advised his countrymen to protect our Union 
against the internal threat of factions and the external threat of foreign 
entanglements. <p>

Like most of our twentieth-century presidents, Bill Clinton is either 
ignorant of, or indifferent to, the warning issued by the Father of our 
Country -- as Clinton's decision to send 20,000 American soldiers into 
Bosnia clearly demonstrates. The President has an obligation to offer the 
American people a persuasive explanation for deployment, but he has yet 
to identify a compelling national interest in Bosnia, and his justifications 
so far seem specious at best. No matter how much the President may 
insist that we do, America does NOT have a moral duty to send troops to 
Bosnia. America does NOT have "values" that must be protected there. 
America does NOT need to go to Bosnia to assert its leadership in the 
world.
<p>
Clinton's status as Commander-in-Chief empowers him to deploy U.S. 
troops in defense of American citizens or interests; it does NOT entitle 
him to send troops anywhere he pleases for whatever reason he chooses. 
Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia will NOT keep the fighting from 
escalating into a wider conflict, it will do just the opposite. Our troops 
will NOT be "peacekeepers," for there is no peace to keep in Bosnia, nor 
has there been for some 500 years. U.S. servicemen should NOT be 
forced to assume the role of international policemen.
<p>
If Europe wants an end to the bloodletting in Bosnia, let European 
nations stop it. They have all the requisite resources. America, in the 
meantime, should concentrate on American interests. We should heed the 
advice that George Washington gave in his famous Farewell Address: 
"The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in 
extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political 
connection as possible."
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Great Awakening</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There have been three dramatic religious revivals in American history, 
and some social commentators claim that we are, right now, in the midst 
of a fourth "Great Awakening." </blockquote></i>

<P>


Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition believes that America is "a nation 
in which one becomes American not by accident of birth or by ethnic 
heritage, but by subscribing to an idea." In the April issue of "Imprimis," 
the monthly journal of Hillsdale College, Reed argues that America is 
the embodiment of  "a vision -- a vision of a society based on two 
fundamental beliefs. The first is that all men, created equal in the eyes of 
God with certain unalienable rights, are free to pursue the longings of 
their hearts. The second belief is that the sole purpose of government is 
to protect those rights."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed asserts that our Founding Fathers "possessed a view of the world 
and government that necessarily presupposed a people obedient to an 
internalized code of conduct . . . that made a large central government 
superfluous." That internalized code of conduct is based on the Ten 
Commandments. America was at the outset, and still is, "a nation 
undergirded by faith, built by faith, and enlivened by faith."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, the connection between faith and government "is a 
source of vigorous controversy," says Reed. He notes that "a crucial 
debate rages in the land over the role of religion in our public life and 
the role that religious believers should play in our politics. The religious 
conservative vote . . . is now one of the largest, if not the largest, single 
voting bloc in the electorate." Reed predicts that the election in 
November "will not be decided by the union vote, the feminist vote, the 
minority vote, or the third-party vote. It will be decided by the religious 
vote." The upcoming election will be characterized by "the largest 
mobilization of active religious believers in recent memory. And, if 
history is any guide, this mobilization is the sign of another period of 
great transformation in America, for political change in the United 
States has always been rooted in religious upheaval."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed concedes that "mainline church membership has declined by one-
fourth" in recent decades. But this decline has been "more than made up 
for by the skyrocketing popularity of conservative and evangelical 
churches in which membership has doubled." What has resulted "is a 
complete transformation of America's churchgoing population. Today, 
the typical American churchgoer is orthodox in faith, traditionalist in 
outlook, and conservative on cultural and political issues. Yet, as active 
religious believers move beyond the pews and into public life, a strange 
and disturbing hostility greets them," says Reed. "People of faith have 
become victims of the worst forms of stereotyping, marginalization, and 
demonology." It's time, he argues, to ''reaffirm the role of religion in 
public life" and to "encourage those with strong spiritual beliefs to re-
enter politics after too many years of self-imposed retreat. Religious 
believers must become full citizens."

 <i> September 11 , 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Science </h2><p>

<i>Any environmentalist who rejects the scientific method, and the objective truth it leads to, obviously has some other agenda than protecting the environment.<i><p>


"Some environmental groups insist that, unless a substance or action can be 'proven to be harmless' to human health or the environment, it should be restricted or banned. This is an impossible standard to meet," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute. "It is impossible to prove that something does not exist."<p>

This is but one of the many scientific lessons offered in a new book, co-authored by Bast, called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism. The nature of toxicity is another. "The dose makes the poison," says Bast. "Some chemicals can be highly toxic, so it is natural for us to be concerned about their possible effects on human health and the environment. But the real, as opposed to the hypothetical, threat posed by a substance depends on our exposure to the substance, or its dose. Many toxic substances, both man-made and natural, are present in the air, water, and our food, but they are present in such small amounts that only recently have we invented the tools needed to discover their presence. There is little convincing evidence that these substances pose any threat to human health at current levels of exposure."<p>

Extrapolating the results of an experiment from one specises to another may be ill-advised. "Mice are not little men," says Bast. "Experiments on laboratory animals are valuable ways of measuring a chemical's toxicity or its likely effects on wildlife. But such experiments fail to accurately assess human cancer risks. The enormous doses fed to laboratory animals cause tissue damage and stress, which can lead to tumors even if the substance being tested is not carcinogenic at normal doses. Animal tests also assume that mice and humans respond the same way to chemicals, even though mice sometimes respond to chemicals very differently than rats and guinea pigs."<p>

Risk is a relative -- not an either-or -- proposition. "Risks can be measured and ranked," says Bast. "Researchers can measure and compare the risks associated with different courses of action." Reasonable estimates can be used to "rank environmental problems according to how much risk they pose to the environment or our health. This, in turn, helps us prioritize problems and decide where our limited resources would be best spent."<p>

Bias can skew the results of any research effort. "Science is not immune to politics," says Bast. "Most scientific research taking place in American universities is subsidized by the government, which means it is influenced by politics. Some scientists have political beliefs or loyalties that influence their views, especially on subjects outside their area of technical training." A report issued by an independent scientist is "less likely to be politicized" than one issued by a government agency, Bast observes. Either one, however, should be subjected to peer review. Environmental research must not be exempted from rigorous scientific standards.<p>

<h2>
Self-Reliance
</h2><blockquote><i>

If displaced workers spent as much time looking for new jobs as they do complaining about having lost  
their old ones, they'd find themselves employed again much faster. 

</blockquote></i>
<P> 
Bill Prince was merchandising director for Frito-Lay in Dallas from 1959 to 1966, a period during which  
sales skyrocketed from $50 million a year to $325 million. When Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola,  
however, Bill resigned to start his own food company. Despite an enormous personal investment of time,  
money, and his own considerable experience, the company failed, and Bill was obliged to start all over  
again. 
 

 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
It wasn't the first time he'd been in that predicament, nor would it be the last. Much like Sisyphus, the  
character in Greek mythology whose fate it was forever to roll a giant rock up a steep hill only to have it  
roll down again every time he reached the top, Bill knew from personal experience that life is a series of  
challenges. Whether you succeed or fail in any given challenge, there's always another giant rock waiting  
to be rolled up another steep hill. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill Prince worked ceaselessly throughout his life, in a wide variety of occupations. Over the course of a  
50-year career, he was never unemployed for more than a month at a time. "Some of the time, my income  
was in the top five percent, but not always," Bill recalls, "because I took any job I could get when I needed  
work." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill notes that in recent years many companies have had to downsize in order to survive. This trend has  
been accompanied by increasing numbers of people "complaining about those mean, nasty, uncaring  
corporations and businesses who fire good and loyal workers." Bill wonders if these carpers and grousers  
"really believe" that a company has a lifetime obligation to anyone it hires, "no matter what kind of  
problems the company may have in the future?" He marvels at the attitude so prevalent among displaced  
workers that the government should "do something to save them." They obviously don't understand that  
government intervention is the main reason their jobs have evaporated. Why can't they see, as Bill so  
clearly does, that, "if government had not been passing all those business-busting laws and writing  
harassing, anti-business regulations, they might still have their jobs?" 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Whatever happened to individual initiative and enterprise?" Bill asks. "And why do people turn to  
government like they are asking for manna from heaven?" Bill insists that middle-aged managers thrown  
back into the job market have no one but themselves to blame if they prefer to remain idle rather than  
accept a job they consider beneath them. "Maybe the reason many downsized people are downsized is  
because they simply no longer have the drive, ambition, and creative ability to withstand competition from  
younger, hungrier people," he speculates in the February issue of a monthly newsletter called Bill's  
Soapbox -- written, edited, and published by Bill Prince himself, at the ripe young age of 74!

<h2>
On-The-Job Training
</h2>

<i>The experience a person gains on the job is often worth far more than 
the wages he receives.</i>
<p>
"Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous 
executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and 
employees," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation in the June 
issue of Policy Review. "Others say that inexorable economic and social 
trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects 
for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education." 
There is general agreement, however, "that America must raise the 
educational levels of its workers. But would-be reformers," says Hood, 
"often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is 
neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the 
education and training workers receive from their employers or in the 
private marketplace."
<p>
Almost every workplace in America offers endless opportunities for 
"lifelong learning." All that's needed is the gumption to take advantage of 
them. "Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving 
strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job," says 
Hood. "Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many 
businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long 
run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher 
wages." Hood reports that "about 50 million workers received some kind 
of formal training" in 1995, at a cost to their employers of more than $50 
billion. Throw in another $300 billion in informal training, and you've 
got a sizable investment in the American worker.
<p>
This is a win-win situation for employers and employees. "Workers who 
become more skilled in their jobs are more productive," observes Hood. 
"Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce 
turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more 
valuable at the firm where they were acquired." College graduates who 
rest on their laurels often find themselves earning less than "workers 
without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training 
for their jobs."
<p>
Of course, employees who lack a basic education and a decent work ethic 
are not likely to benefit no matter how much money is spent on them. 
"Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or 
no marketable skills," says Hood. "The problem is one of wasted 
resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but 
often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training 
later on. Government sponsored job-training programs have consistently 
posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they 
spent."
<p>
John Hood argues that "federal and state subsidies encourage students to 
pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally 
guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to 
enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time 
students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and 
university classes," he suggests, "might be better spent finding an 
employer that teaches useful skills."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 20, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Clinton's Civil Service Reform Flawed</h2></center><P>



             

President Clinton has made much of his plan to "reinvent government, " 
but a prominent management consultant says the President's proposed 
reforms would only make matters worse.
<p>
President Clinton promised to overhaul the federal civil service so as "to 
make the entire federal government both less expensive and more 
efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy awav 
from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment." 
But Donald J. Devine. former director of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management says that "this reinvention will weaken management. Iead 
to greater inefficiencies. dilute individual performance initiative. 
reinforce the culture of complacency. and make government less 
accountable."
<p>
In a Heritage Foundation report entitled "Making Government Work," 
Device argues that the President's proposed reforms downplay the 
importance of individual merit and performance and shift control over 
the executive branch from the President to federal bureaucrats and 
unions. "Instead of reinventing government." savs Devine, "Clinton's 
proposals would make things worse by transferring leadership to 
committees and unions and assuring weak executive leadership."
<p>
President Clinton's proposals ignore the key principles of "real 
government reform." says Devine. the first of which is to "keep the 
mission simple." To be successful. every government agency must have 
"a simple. clear mission with an imaginative leadership dedicated to that 
mission." Unfortunately. "government missions have become enormously 
more complex" than they used to be. and civil servants are now saddled 
with responsibilities that are ill-defined or contradictory. "Government." 
Devine insists. "can work effectively only when relatively few things are 
assigned unambiguously to a few institutions with sufficient esprit le 
corps to do them well."
<p>
Devine notes that our central government has "strayed far from its 
federalist roots" and recommends that its scope be strictly limited once 
again. "Functions properly performed by the states should be transferred 
back to them." he says. The federal government should also take 
advantage of the "reduced costs. greater efficiency, and improved 
management that flow from contracting work out to the private sector."
<p>
Devine calls for the reestablishment of "a true merit system." The hiring 
and promotion of civil servants must be based on "knowledge, skills, and 
abilities" once again. he says. The President and his department heads 
must accept and assert their responsibility for the activities of the 
executive branch. Devine notes that "the thrust of the Clinton reforms is 
to remove authority from the political and career executives . . . and 
transfer it to labor-management councils." This is foolish and 
irresponsible. says Devine. "Without political leadership. when the 
President gives an order, there is no reason to assume anything will 
happen down the line in the federal bureaucracy. That is why 
responsibility in current law rests with the political agency head." 
Devine argues that "effective government management requires strong 
agency leadership," which in turn requires straightforward missions and 
clear-cut performance standards.

<h2>Space Academy</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Some day in the not too distant future, you may get to watch your child 
or grandchild graduate from the U.S. Space Academy. On that proud 
day, you can both thank Lt. General Daniel Graham for making that 
opportunity possible.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Lt. General Daniel Graham had become convinced towards the end of 
his life that U.S. space policy "needed fundamental overhaul. Space had 
become a ravenous consumer of resources when it should have become a 
source of national wealth and a bastion of national security," he 
lamented in his autobiography, Confessions of a Cold Warrior Graham 
recognized that new and emerging technology could "make the 
taxpayers' space investments provide a substantial return," if only the 
government could be persuaded to "open space to the general public and 
the private sector." Advances in technology had "removed the principal 
constraints on the pursuit of practical goals in space, and enabled both 
commercial and government programs that would be well-supported by 
the public."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The commercial exploitation of space is no longer just a dream. If 
Americans want to capitalize on the boundless possibilities, however, we 
must plan accordingly. "No U.S. space policy, however well-formulated, 
can bear fruit without attention to the people who will be called upon to 
carry out the policy," General Graham warned. "Space efforts require a 
constant input of bright and properly educated young people into those 
sectors of government, industry and commerce that deal with space."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Graham knew that generating "enthusiasm for space among young 
people" would be simple enough. "They want to be a part of the grand 
adventure of space activity," he observed. "But, beyond getting them 
excited, we have little advice to give them about how to realize their 
dreams except to advise excelling in one or another hard-science 
discipline." Graham's visionary solution was "a Space Academy along 
the lines of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy where young 
Americans, and perhaps youngsters from other lands, could be steeped in 
the disciplines pertinent to space. They could be graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in space science, ready for employment in the 
aerospace industry, commercial space enterprises, or government civil 
and military space programs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Graham envisioned a comprehensive program of space 
scholarship, including disciplines such as "space medicine, space law, 
space diplomacy, space construction, and space literature." He saw "no 
difficulty whatever in establishing a space-oriented curriculum for the 
cadets of a Space Academy meeting all necessary criteria for the 
granting of degrees." He also knew that "the standards for entry into 
such an academy could be set very high and still not accommodate all 
young people who would apply and qualify. A student body with 
computer literacy, technical aptitude, physical fitness and high personal 
standards would be easily assembled, as well as a competent, highly 
motivated faculty." General Graham predicted that "graduates of such a 
Space Academy would be in great demand, and the aspirations of young 
people interested in a career in space-related activity could be channeled 
effectively."

<h2>Free Trade</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Absolute free trade between countries does not exist. With the 
possible exception of the United States, all manage their trade to 
serve their own national interests.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sovereign countries should establish trade policies that serve their 
own best interests, and they should expect their trading partners to 
do likewise. So-called free trade really makes no sense. Fair trade, 
however, is something different. All countries should be held to a 
certain minimal standard in their trade practices, and those that fail 
to live up to such a standard should be penalized. Many of the foreign 
countries that trade with America routinely resort to unfair 
practices, such as devaluing their currency, nationalizing U.S. 
property, violating agreements, stealing our patents and copyrights, 
and counterfeiting our money. It is absurd to advocate "free trade" 
with countries that engage in such disreputable practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Free trade" was the slogan used to persuade Congress to pass NAFTA 
and GATT, but what these treaties have done is put U.S. trade under 
the control of powerful new international bureaucracies. GATT created 
the World Trade Organization, which has a legislature, an executive 
branch, and a judicial system to control global trade. GATT is also 
loaded with 22,000 pages of special-interest provisions. What kind of 
"free trade" is it that provides for U.S. taxpayer subsidies of 
foreign industries and governments?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes right down to it, the NAFTA and GATT gang are really 
protectionists. They use the power of government to protect their 
friends. They could care less about protecting American workers, but 
they didn't hesitate to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to protect New York 
investment banks from the consequences of their bad investments in 
Mexico. The GATT treaty was filled with hidden handouts and 
perquisites for the politically powerful, who trumpeted their support 
for "free trade" without publicizing the potential for profit that 
motivated them.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's Founding Fathers were all avowed protectionists. To a man, 
they believed that protection of American workers and industries from 
cheap foreign imports is essential to our prosperity, our 
independence, and our sovereignty. The first act passed by our first 
Congress established tariffs on foreign goods -- an essential rite of 
passage in the transformation of our country from dependent colony to 
sovereign nation. Unfortunately, for the last 25 years, U.S. trade 
policy has been dominated by giant corporations that want to take 
advantage of cheap foreign labor and still have open access to 
American markets. Congressmen and executive branch officials 
accommodate these interests with the expectation of future employment 
or other consideration from the companies they favor at the expense of 
their countrymen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More and more economists are beginning to recognize that "free trade" 
will bring about the total destruction of the balance between capital 
and labor, allowing capital to squeeze labor costs lower and lower. 
This will drive prices lower too, of course, but lower prices will not 
provide much solace to consumers in the long run, because consumers 
are also workers, and workers without jobs cannot take advantage of 
lower prices.

<h2>
COST OF REGULATIONS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Federal regulations raise the cost of the goods and services we purchase 
by $400 billion annually. In other words, federal regulations cost the 
average American family $4, 000 per year!
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 
2,000 inspectors across the country," reports John Hood of the Heritage 
Foundation. But those 2,000 snoops will inspect fewer than 10 percent of 
the six million workplaces in America, and are not likely to have any 
beneficial impact even at those locations. OSHA's workplace safety 
crusade "has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector 
initiatives," says Hood. OSHA has "little value to add to the worker 
safety picture. But its costs -- measured in lower productivity and wages, 
as well as higher prices and taxes -- are significant."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gary Becker of the Hoover Institution explains the impact of minimum 
wage hikes. "Higher labor costs reduce employment," he says. "A higher 
minimum will further reduce the employment opportunities of workers 
with few skills." In other words, teenagers, high school dropouts, and 
other low-skilled workers will lose their jobs if "their productivity is not 
high enough to justify the cost to employers." When workers lose their 
jobs, they stop paying taxes and start receiving unemployment or welfare 
benefits.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Richard Lesher of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describes the 
Americans with Disabilities Act as "yet another weapon in the hands of 
disgruntled employees with personal axes to grind." Besides the cost of 
nuisance lawsuits, there is "the expense of retrofitting tens of thousands 
of workplaces and public facilities with wheelchair ramps, elevators, 
toilet stalls, and other special provisions to accommodate people with a 
wide variety of handicaps," says Lesher. "Together with the soaring cost 
of litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act is proving to be a major 
expense for both public and private enterprises."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Government banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 
1978, and an international treaty phased out their use entirely in all 
industrial nations at the end of 1995. Jane Shaw and Richard Stroup of 
the Political Economy Research Center say these drastic actions are the 
result of hysteria, not scientific documentation. They argue that it's 
foolish for our federal government to prohibit the production of the 
nontoxic CFCs "used in millions of automobiles and refrigerators" when 
the available alternatives are "more costly, more corrosive to cooling 
systems, less dependable, and less manageable. Some even appear to be 
less safe." The benefits of halting CFC production are negligible, but the 
costs are likely to be extraordinarily high.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Just as our forefathers rebelled against 'taxation without representation,' 
today, private property owners are revolting over 'confiscation without 
compensation,'" says Congressman Billy Tauzin, author of the Private 
Property Owners Bill of Rights. "Clearly, the federal government has 
become our master rather than our servant," says Tauzin. "But American 
property owners . . . are fighting back."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are just a few examples of the regulatory abuses financed by our 
taxes.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 21, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Affirmative Action Discriminates Against Whites</h2></center><P>


   

[The debate over affirmative action and the alleged disparity in 
opportunities for whites and blacks overlooks one thing -- not all blacks 
are alike, and neither are all whites.]
<p>
In a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, former U.S. Navy Secretary 
James Webb pointed out that "differences among white ethnic groups are 
huge. fed by cultural tradition, the time and geography of migrations to 
the country, and . . . the tendency of white Americans to discriminate 
against other whites in favor of their own class and culture." Webb cited 
a 1974 study by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research 
Center that divided white Americans into 17 distinct ethnic and religious 
backgrounds.
<p>
The study ranked these 17 separate groups according to their educational 
and financial status. and the results were not what you might have 
expected. "Contrary to prevailing mythology, the vaunted White Anglo-
Saxon Protestants were even then not at the top," said Webb. Jews in 
fact, led the list. followed by Irish. Italian. German. and Polish 
Catholics, in that order. Educational attainment and income levels 
within each group were consistent throughout the country which would 
seem to indicate that differences among the groups are "culturally rather 
than geographically based."
<p>
According to that 1974 study, white families at the top of this list earned 
nearly $5000 more per year than white families at the bottom. The 
income difference between whites and blacks as a whole, at the time. was 
less than $4000. The obvious conclusion, according to Webb, is that. 
"even prior to the major affirmative action programs, there was a greater 
variation within 'white America' than there was between 'white America' 
and black America. and the whites at the bottom were in approximately 
the same situation as blacks."
<p>
The whites at the bottom are the ones who have felt the brunt of 
affirmative action. at the very time when a shrinking industrial base and 
a declining public school system are diminishing their prospects for self-
improvement. But sympathy for their plight is not in fashion. "The 
prevailing attitude has been to ridicule whites who have the audacity to 
complain about their reduced status." said Webb. and to rationalize 
policies that discriminate against them as remedies for a "past wrong."
<p>
Webb says the working-class white male "sees a government system that 
seems bent on belittling the basis of his existence, and has established a 
set of laws and regulations that often keep him from competing His 
evermore-isolated leaders have mandated [a so-called] 'equal 
opportunity' bureaucracy in the military . government and industry . . . 
whose sole function is to report 'political incorrectness' and to encourage 
the promotion of literally everyone but him and his kind." The current, 
coercive celebration of "diversity" has no appeal to the white male at the 
bottom of the ladder. To him, diversity is "a code word used to exclude 
him . . . no matter the extent of his qualifications and no matter the 
obstacles he has had to overcome."

<title>Duplantier Slave-Labor Goods -- 5/22/96</title>

 May 22, 1996<br></i> 
 <h2>
 SLAVE-LABOR GOODS 
 </h2><blockquote></i><P><I>
Legislators in California and Massachusetts are considering bills to  
prohibit their state governments from buying slave-labor goods. 
 </i></blockquote><P>
Legislation proposed in California requires that all state contracts "shall  
contain a statement in which the contractor attests that no foreign-made  
equipment, materials, or supplies furnished to the state pursuant to the  
contract have been produced in whole or in part by forced labor, convict  
labor, or indentured labor under penal sanction." Legislation proposed in  
Massachusetts would likewise require state contractors to "swear under  
penalty of perjury" that their goods have not been produced by forced  
labor. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch, a nonpartisan foreign policy  
watchdog group, suggests that these proposed bills have been "prompted  
by the Federal government's indifference about slave labor overseas and  
its threat to American workers and firms." While acknowledging that  
"the importation of slave-made goods is banned by federal statute,"  
Olsen argues that "the ban has been easily circumvented by cumbersome  
Customs Service regulations and uncooperative foreign governments.  
The Chinese government," he points out, "has not allowed any  
inspection of its laogai facilities in over a year even though the Customs  
Service has demanded to see numerous ones." Olsen reports that "the  
largest forced labor systems in the world are in China and the former  
Soviet Union. The Chinese laogai factories and farms hold 20 million  
workers, equal in number to the entire workforce of California. Many  
gulags in the former Soviet Union are still in operation." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress has shown much  
concern with "slave labor overseas and its unfair economic threat to  
American workers and firms," says Olsen. At a February 29th World  
Affairs Council luncheon in Los Angeles, then-U.S. Trade  
Representative Mickey Kantor "stated that forced labor was not an issue  
in his bilateral negotiations with China. " Olsen notes that Most Favored  
Nation tariff status "was granted to China in 1994 with no human rights  
reservations as in years before," and he predicts that such reservations  
will again fall by the wayside when China's Most Favored Nation status  
comes up for renewal in June. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch says that the State Department's  
1992 Memorandum of Understanding with China regarding the  
inspection of suspected slave-labor facilities "has been ignored by the  
Chinese government without any consequence. The State Department,"  
he adds, "has no regulation to avoid purchasing slave-made goods for its  
own use or for foreign aid programs. It does not intend to insist on anti- 
slave labor policies for multinational organizations such as the United  
Nations and the Organization of American States." Olsen also points out  
that "no agency in the federal government has any contract provision,  
regulation, or monitoring program to prevent the purchase of slave-made  
goods or services. For the billions of dollars of purchases overseas for use  
overseas by the Federal government, there is absolutely no prohibition  
under current law against purchasing and using slave-made goods since  
the goods are not imported into the U.S."

<h2>SIECUS</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Sex Information and Education Council of the United   
States (known as SIECUS) applauds the dramatic increase in   
the number of states that require or recommend sex education   
in public schools. 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 1994 SIECUS survey of state sex-ed programs reported   
that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rieo have   
gotten on the bandwagon since 1986, when only three states   
required such curricula. The focus of the SIECUS   
assessment, however, was on the alleged "shortcomings" of   
the state curricula, as determined by deviations from the   
group's own Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality   
Education, K-12, which SIECUS published in 1991. Those 
guidelines include six "key concepts," subdivided into 36   
topics. The key concepts are Human Development,   
Relationships, Personal Skills, Sexual Behavior, Sexual   
Health, and Society and Culture.  
 <p>
The 1994 SIECUS study, entitled Unfinished Business,   
consisted of three major components: the responses of state   
education officials to a 20-question survey; the analysis by   
SIECUS of various state-developed sex-ed curricula; and   
SIECUS's own recommendations for changing curricula to   
conform with their biases about sex education. Resources   
cited for the study include the Alan Guttmacher Institute,   
Planned Parenthood, the Center for Population Options, the   
National Education Association, and People for the American   
Way. Funding for the study was provided by the Carnegie   
Corporation.  
<p>  
The SIECUS study complained that many state curricula   
guides "omit sexual behavior topics; exclude topics that are   
considered controversial, such as sexual identity and   
orientation and abortion; lack thorough coverage of topics   
throughout grades Kindergarten-Twelve, particularly in the   
elementary grades; and lack [what SIECUS calls] balanced   
coverage of abstinence and safer sex." SIECUS says such   
shortcomings represent "unfinished business."  
<p>  
The study laments the absence from most curricula of   
"detailed age-appropriate developmental messages." That is   
the SIECUS euphemism for statements that lay the   
foundation for easier acceptance of permissive sexual   
practices at a higher grade level. When it comes to coverage   
of sexual behavior, SIECUS complains that most curricula   
are guilty of a "fear-based" approach, which means that they   
emphasize abstinence and portray sex as something more   
profound than a recreational activity. To achieve what   
SIECUS calls "balance," the curricula would have to present   
"safer sex" as a more realistic option than abstinence.  
 <p> 
SIECUS rejects the "just say no" approach in sex education,   
asserting that it does "not provide corresponding refusal skills   
or assertiveness messages." For SIECUS, refusal skills are   
sexual negotiation techniques that students can acquire   
through role-playing and instruction in the art of explicit   
conversation. SIECUS ignores the fact that such techniques   
undermine the natural modesty of children (their most potent   
defense), and the likelihood that mastery of refusal skills   
would enable an aggressive negotiator to overcome them.  
 <p> 
Few sex-ed curricula begin early enough for SIECUS. The   
group deplores the benighted parents and right-wing pressure   
groups that have impeded "comprehensive" sex education.   
SIECUS urges a state-funded effort to combat these so-called   
obstructionists.

<h2>Organized Crime</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The face of organized crime in America is dramatically changing. " 
The challenge is to defend ourselves against it without giving up the 
freedoms we hold dear.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
"In the 1980s, the government began cracking down on organized 
crime," reports Robert McGarvey in the February issue of the American 
Legion magazine. The results were nothing short of spectacular. 
"Nowadays, the chiefs of the American Mafia . . . are languishing in 
prison, leaving the organizations they left behind in disarray." Their 
sudden departure created an equal employment opportunity for other 
minority gangsters, however, and "literally dozens of ethnic crime 
groups have emerged to fill the void." McGarvey reports that 
"Colombian drug barons earn billions of dollars annually in the United 
States. Japanese gangsters . . . claim a mounting presence in Hawaii, 
along with scattered outposts on the West Coast. Various Mexican 
criminals . . . wreak havoc in U.S. border states."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most menacing of all are the Triad gang of Hong Kong and the so-called 
Russian Mafia. "The Triads' business is heroin," says McGarvey. "Some 
60 percent of the drugs entering the United States are traced to Triad 
sources, primarily Burmese poppy fields that have long been controlled 
by Chinese criminals." The Triads have not neglected to diversify, 
however. Their other interests, according to McGarvey, include 
"extortion, prostitution, international car theft, and their much-
publicized involvement in alien smuggling," the latter netting them more 
than $3 billion a year. McGarvey warns that "the Triads are building 
alliances with U.S. street gangs," whose teenaged members "represent a 
sizable, often coldblooded army that will take on even the most vicious 
jobs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Russian Mafia, composed of former KGB officers and various gulag 
graduates, "now ranks as one of law enforcement's top priorities," says 
McGarvey. A deputy assistant FBI director recently told Congress that 
the Russian Mafia may soon be "the principal organized crime group in 
the United States." He warns that its members are extremely violent and 
have already linked up with Italian and Colombian comrades in crime. 
The FBI's New York bureau chief reports that he has "transferred agents 
and other scarce resources out of traditional organized crime 
investigations and foreign counterintelligence to concentrate on Russian 
crime."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey asserts that "America's new Russian gangsters also rank as 
perhaps the nation's most versatile criminals." He says that "the most 
fearsome aspect of the Russian Mafia is its access to the ill-guarded 
military warehouses of the old USSR. This makes the 'Moscow mob' 
instant leaders on the international arms black market, where they sell 
everything from automatic weapons to rocket launchers. Russian thugs 
even are alleged to be dealing in weapons-grade radioactive materiel."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey worries that "U.S. law enforcement currently is ill-equipped 
to battle groups like the Triads and the Russian Mafia." We should be 
concerned about the damage to our society from "corruption, violence, 
and wholesale theft," but we should never sacrifice our democratic 
freedoms in the fight against internal enemies.

<h2>
Revival of the Home Economy
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>More than a million American children are now schooled at home. If 
present trends continue, homeschooling may one day become the 
preferred method of education in America, as it was before 1840.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

The modern social-welfare state arose in the hundred years between 
1840 and 1940, assuming "nurturing functions that had throughout 
human history belonged to the family. The first and most important of 
these was education," writes Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute in 
the February issue of The Family in America. "Beginning in the 1840s, 
in the same time and place as early industrialization, the common school 
movement, backed by compulsory education laws, took children out of 
the home for moral and practical training."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The social-welfare state soon "captured other family functions as well," 
says Carlson. "Reform schools, the 'child saving' movement, the 
juvenile-justice system, and the vast child abuse and neglect apparatus 
all grew." Even child labor laws "further expanded the modern state's 
socialization of children's time." State-funded pension programs "erased 
other basic features of the family economy: security between the 
generations and care of the ill and infirm. Until modern times, grown 
children and other relatives provided security and support to elderly 
persons, particularly the indigent and the invalid. Adults bore an 
obligation, moral as well as social and legal, to care for their own; they 
also knew that their security might depend someday on the children they 
had reared and on the example they had set in giving care to their own 
parents. New systems of state pensions and health insurance shattered 
these security bonds between the generations of a family."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Allan Carlson contends that the growing homeschooling movement 
began in the 1970s as a reaction to "specific events -- federal efforts to 
regulate public and parochial education, Supreme Court decisions 
blessing the sexual revolution, the breakdown of discipline and standards 
in local schools, the appearance of books . . . encouraging a radical break 
with existing patterns of learning." These events, he says, "inspired a 
critical mass of pioneers to bring their children home. They soon 
discovered that, indeed, there's no place like home for the education of 
their children. These pioneer families also found that the nature of their 
family relationships changed, almost overnight. No longer mere 
consumers sharing the same roof and television set, they had become 
members of a learning enterprise who needed each other and who 
profited -- morally and practically -- from each other."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The pioneers of homeschooling made other pleasant discoveries. "Most 
of these families began to find ways to bring other functions home as 
well -- gardening, food preservation, or a family business -- and they 
tasted the satisfactions of an independence unknown to several American 
generations." Carlson argues that homeschooling "is the most promising 
effort at family institutional reconstruction undertaken in America 
during the last 150 years. The family, born to and naturally residing in 
the symbolic 'cottage,' then uprooted and ravaged by factory and state, 
has found a path back to its true home."

<title>Pollution Control -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
F.R. Duplantier <br>
October 4, 1995<br></i><hr>

<h2>Pollution Control</h2></center>

Wouldn't it be great if driving a car made the air cleaner instead of  
dirtier? That may seem like a crackpot idea, but someone's already 
developed the technology to make this paradoxical pipedream a 
revolutionary reality.<p>

In a recent column in the Washington Times, Eric Peters sings the praises 
of realistic pollution-control technologies that "would allow Americans to 
continue their love affair with the automobile -- without despoiling the 
planet." Particularly promising is the aptly-named "smog-eating radiator," 
developed by Ford Motor Company and the Engelhard Corporation. 
Peters explains that this intriguing new device "features a special catalyst coating that treats all the outside air that flows through it. [acting] much like an air filter -- only on a much larger scale.". This revolutionary new radiator appears to be able to "destroy 90 percent of the ground level ozone in ambient air that passes through it."<p>

Putting all that in layman's terms, Peters says that "'dirty' air passing 
through the radiator comes out the other side virtually 'clean.' Thus, the 
mere act of driving your car could actually clean up the air we breathe -- 
instead of making things worse than they are." The radiator does the 
cleaning all by itself. Nothing else is needed, says Peters, "and the 
technology can be applied to any vehicle on the road, regardless of age. 
Indeed,  it would be theoretically possible to retrofit most of the cars 
currently in service for a fairly modest amount of money, and with no 
adverse impact on vehicle function or performance."<p>

Peters observes that "one of the biggest obstacles to improving air quality 
is the 'lag time' between the introduction of a new emissions control 
technology" and its widespread usage. The simplicity of the smog-eating 
radiator should greatly accelerate the turnaround time. "Instead of the 
usual 10 or more years it takes for something like engine computers or 
fuel injection to become commonplace -- and therefore have a 
meaningful impact on air quality -- the smog-eating radiator could be put 
into widespread service in a fraction of that time."<p>

Studies indicate that smog-eating radiators have the potential to reduce 
air pollution more effectively than either alternative fuels or coercive 
carpooling. One such study. Peters reports, "estimates that if 9 million 
vehicles traveling 266 million miles per day in Los Angeles were 
equipped with smog-eating radiators, the air flowing through these 
radiators -- and being purified of harmful ozone and carbon monoxide 
along the way -- would be equivalent to all the air across the entire Los 
Angeles area up to a height of about 15 feet."<p>

There's a lesson to be learned from all this. "This technology is a terrific example of the innovation that is possible if society gives industry the chance to work on the best solutions for our air pollution problems," says Lou Ross of the Ford Motor Company. "You can't predict where invention is going to come from -- and you certainly can't mandate it into existence."<p>

<h2>Christmas Verse</h2></center><P>

[Everyone loves the Clement Moore classic "A Visit from St. Nick." 
Here's a revised version of that yuletide favorite that recaptures the true 
meaning of Christmas.]
<p>
Twas the morning of Christmas, when all through the house/All the 
family was frantic, including my spouse;/For each one of them had one 
thing only in mind,/To examine the presents St. Nick left behind./The 
boxes and wrapping and ribbons and toys/Were strewn on the floor, and 
the volume of noise/Increased as our children began a big fight/Over who 
got the video games, who got the bike./I looked at my watch and I said, 
slightly nervous,/"Let's get ready for church, so we won't miss the 
service."/The children protested "We don't want to pray:/We just got our 
presents, and we want to play!"
<p>
It dawned on me then that we had gone astray,/In confusing the purpose 
of this special day;/Our presents were many and very high-priced/But 
something was missing -- that something was Christ!/I said, "Put the gifts 
down and let's gather together,/And I'll tell you a tale of the greatest gift 
ever:/A Savior was promised when Adam first sinned,/And the hopes of 
the world upon Jesus were pinned./Abraham begat Isaac, who Jacob 
begat,/And through David the line went to Joseph, whereat/This carpenter 
married a maiden with child,/Who yet was a virgin, in no way defiled./ 
Saying 'Hail, full of Grace,' an archangel appeared/To Mary the Blessed, 
among women revered:/The Lord willed she would bear -- through the 
Spirit -- a Son./Said Mary to Gabriel, 'God's will be done.'
<p>
"Now Caesar commanded a tax would be paid,/And all would go home 
while the census was made;/Thus Joseph and Mary did leave Galilee/For 
the city of David to pay this new fee./Mary's time had arrived, but the inn 
had no room,/So she laid in a manger the fruit of her womb;/And both 
Joseph and Mary admired as He napped/The Light of the World in his 
swaddling clothes wrapped./Three wise men from the East had come 
looking for news/Of the birth of the Savior, the King of the Jews;/They 
carried great gifts as they followed a star --/Gold, frankincense, myrrh, 
which they'd brought from afar.
<p>
"As the shepherds watched over their flocks on that night,/The glory of 
God shone upon them quite bright,/And an angel explained the intent of 
the birth,/Saying, 'Glory to God and His peace to the earth.'/For this was 
the Messiah whom prophets foretold,/A good Shepherd to bring His 
sheep back to the fold;/He was God become man, He would die on the 
cross,/He would rise from the dead to restore Adam's loss.
<p>
"Santa Claus, Christmas presents, a brightly lit pine,/Candy canes and 
spiced eggnog are all very fine;/Let's have fun celebrating, but leave not a 
doubt/That Christ is what Christmas is really about!"/The children right 
then put an end to the noise,/They dressed quickly for church, put aside 
all their toys;/For they knew Jesus loved them and said they were 
glad/That He'd died for their sins, and to save their dear Dad.
<p>                           <P>

<P>

      When Bill Clinton's budget figures for his February 17 State of
the Union Address were released by the White House, they showed a far
larger reduction in the defense budget than the $60 billion he
proposed during the presidential campaign. Clinton now wants to slash
the defense budget by over $120 billion between fiscal years 1993 and
1997. (This estimate is based on the comparison of the Clinton
Administration's current request for fiscal years 1994 through 1997
with the Bush Administration's fiscal 1993 requested level.  As such,
the congressional reduction of $6.5 billion enacted last year for
fiscal 1993 is applied to the Clinton total.) This doubling of the
defense cut is more than another broken campaign promise. It will mean
that America's national security will depend on good luck. With
Clinton's proposed defense budget, the U.S. cannot field a military
force capable of countering the many threats to American security.
<P>
      Notwithstanding the collapse of the Soviet Union, the threats
are indeed many. Nuclear weapons and missiles are proliferating
throughout the world. Democracy could break down in Russia, producing
an anti-American nationalist regime bent on restoring the Russian
Empire. Iraq and Iran endanger not only Western oil supplies but the
security and stability of the Persian Gulf. The list could go on. The
Cold War may be over, but as the Persian Gulf War demonstrated,
America must be able to fight and win wars in regions where her vital
interests are at stake.
<P>
      The money the nation spends on defense is in many ways analogous
to that which American families spend on insurance. Like an insurance
policy, a sound defense policy is predicated on the assumption that
things can go wrong, that accidents can happen, and that outlaws can
inflict harm. While some families are comfortable with the increased
risks assumed by not purchasing adequate insurance, prudent ones
insure themselves against these risks. If calamity occurs, the unlucky
ones face financial ruin. Likewise, if America's luck holds, she may
survive Clinton's defense cuts. But if America is not lucky, and the
many potential threats become a reality, the result will be far worse
than financial ruin -- it could be nationaldisaster.
<P>
      Threats to America's Security Have Changed, But Not Disappeared.
The first step in buying insurance is to obtain a clear understanding
of the threats one faces, including health problems, accidents, or
crime. The same is true of national security. The threats America
faces today are clearly different from those of the Cold War. The
primary threat of that era was an expansionist Soviet Union. This
overarching threat has all but disappeared.
<P>
      But new threats to U.S. security have emerged in the wake of the
collapsing Soviet Union. For example, the Soviet Union's huge nuclear
arsenal still exists and the risk of an accidental or unauthorized
launch has increased. Moreover, long-range missile technology is
proliferating. The U.S. likely will face a number of countries armed
with long-range nuclear missiles within ten years, if not sooner.
<P>
      Likewise, Russia's appetite for conducting proxy wars in the
Third World has all but disappeared. But regional conflicts are still
very much a possibility in the post-Cold-War world. Regional bullies
such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea are still poised to exploit any
weakness to achieve regional dominance. And Russia or China could turn
belligerent and threaten regional stability in Europe and Asia.
<P>
      After the long struggle of the Cold War, the American people may
be tempted to believe that the world is now safe. But the bitter
experience of the military demobilizations after World War I and World
War II -- whereby America became dangerously weak after great military
victories -- should hold such temptations in check. The world is still
a dangerous place, and there is no substitute for vigilance and
preparedness.
<P>
      Clinton's defense cuts come on the heels of eight straight years
of declining defense budgets. This year's defense budget authority --
the amount of money the U.S. obligates for defense purposes -- is 30
percent lower than in the 1985 budget. Moreover, defense outlays as a
percentage of the total federal budget will be 5 percent less this
fiscal year than during the mid-1980s. The Clinton Administration is
accelerating this alarming decline. In fiscal year 1991, the defense
budget was falling 2 percent every year. This year, the average real
decline exceeded 3.5 percent. Clinton's annual defense reductions
could easily exceed an average of 4 percent per year in real terms if
optimistic projections about inflation do not hold up. The result: by
1997 defense outlays will constitute less than 15 percent of all
federal outlays, which is 10 percentage points below what it was in
1985. 
<P>
      The Emerging Gap Between Ends and Means. Clinton's proposed
defense reductions will make it impossible to fulfill America's global
military commitments. The first responsibility of a nation is to
defend its territory against attack, whether purposeful or accidental.
With serious questions now arising about proper control over the
nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union, plus the proliferation of
missile technology to other countries, the U.S. needs to deploy anti-
missile defenses. But the Clinton Administration has proposed an
almost 40 percent cut in the fiscal 1994 Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) budget. Cuts of this magnitude are certain to cripple this
program for developing and fielding anti-missile defenses.
<P>
      The U.S. maintains commitments that require its Navy to patrol
the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean. If
Clinton gets his defense budget, the Navy will shrink to some 300
ships, with fewer than the ten aircraft carriers the President has
promised. The Navy cannot maintain continuous patrols in these three
areas with so few ships. But Navy personnel should be forewarned. If
crises arise, the Clinton Administration will try to fulfill its
responsibilities by adopting backbreaking nine- and ten-month
deployments. Normally most deployments are about six months long.
<P>
      If the U.S. were to face two regional crises simultaneously,
American forces would not be up to the task. Iraq could several years
hence still be defying U.N. Security Council resolutions in ways that
could require air strikes or constant patrols of the Persian Gulf and
Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, North Korea in a last desperate effort to
gain control of South Korea could launch an attack. With the U.S.
military shrunken by Clinton cuts, it could not respond to these two
crises at the same time. It would be short of the ships, personnel,
and equipment needed to perform its missions.
<P>
      Conducting and completing combat operations is only the most
visible purpose of the U.S. military. Its capabilities and presence
pay more modest dividends every day by fostering regional stability
and reducing the risk of conflict. U.S. military strength and resolve
have served to assure German and Japanese security since the end of
World War II. As such, neither country has felt obliged to rearm. But
how long can the U.S. proceed along its current path of disarmament
before Germany or Japan concludes that America is unable to meets its
security commitments? A militarily strong Germany or Japan undoubtedly
will foster regional suspicions in Europe and Asia. The cost to the
U.S. of addressing the regional instabilities fostered by a rearmed
Japan or Germany would be far higher than making more modest
investments now, which are required to avoid such an outcome.
<P>
      Bill Clinton has inherited a strong military that is America's
insurance policy against calamity. But Clinton's defense budget shows
a willingness to weaken this policy. His defense budget cuts will
leave America unable to protect its interests and fulfill its global
commitments. Lacking proper defense insurance, America will have to
depend increasingly on good luck in international affairs. But as
history shows, protecting America's security in a dangerous world
requires more than hope and a prayer. In fact, it requires a good
insurance policy. It requires a military that prevents an attack on
the national interest from becoming a national disaster.

     President Clinton's 1995 defense budget, which allocates $1.29
trillion for defense from 1995 through 1999, continues his
Administration's systematic dismantling of the nation's defenses so
painstakingly rebuilt by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. (All figures are
for budget authority, the amount the Pentagon is authorized to spend
for a given period, as opposed to outlays, or the amount actually
spent.) In the Clinton plan, the Department of Defense will fall short
of its funding requirements -- as outlined in the Administration's own
"Bottom-Up Review" -- by nearly $100 billion. The Administration and
Congress must stop looking for "savings" in the defense budget, which
has paid more than its share in cost-cutting efforts by three
Administrations since the Reagan build-up peaked in 1985.
<P>
     To be sure, Clinton slightly raised this year's defense budget by
$1.8 billion. (This quote comes from the transcript of the budget
briefing included in the package of materials accompanying the
Department of Defense News Release No. 043-94, February 7, 1994.)
However, when adjusted for inflation, the 1995 defense budget still
shows a decline of 0.9 percent. This is the tenth straight year of
declining defense budgets. Furthermore, the budget will decline in
inflation-adjusted terms in each of the next four years beyond fiscal
1995. Thus, the Clinton Administration is now committed to fourteen
years of uninterrupted decline in the defense budget. 
<P>
     This year's defense budget will harm national security. In every
category -- force structure, modernization, combat readiness, and
maintaining the quality of military personnel -- the amount to be
spent is based not on how much defense is needed, but on budgetary
considerations. National security policy is not being made based on
threats identified by Clinton's national security advisers, but on
spending caps provided by his budget advisers, most of whom have no
knowledge of America's defense requirements. This approach represents
an abdication by Clinton of his highest constitutional priority: to
provide for the nation's defense. 
<P>
     The Clinton budget will lead to several damaging outcomes. They
are:
<P>
A force that is too small to defend America's interests. The Clinton
     Administration, on September 1, 1993, adopted a blueprint for
     America's future forces. The plan was the result of a
     comprehensive study of defense policy called the "Bottom-Up
     Review." It called for a force in 1999 of 15 Army divisions, 346
     Navy ships, 20 Air Force tactical wings, and 174,000 active-duty
     Marines. But it is now clear that the Clinton Administration has
     no intention of meeting these goals. The Clinton 1995 defense
     budget has nowhere near the money required to support this plan.
     (The assessment that the Clinton Administration's defense budget
     is too small to support its own force structure plan is shared by
     opinion leaders across the political spectrum. Editorialists at
     The New York Times, for example, on January 28, 1994, argued: "As
     Mr. Clinton must know, these [Bottom-Up Review] force levels --
     which Congressional Republicans are sure to support -- will end
     up costing far more than his proposed $260-billion-a-year budgets
     over the next five years.") The Bottom-Up Review Force (BURF)
     will require about $1.39 trillion for the five-year period
     covering fiscal years 1995 through 1999. (For a full assessment
     of the Bottom-Up Review, see Lawrence T. Di Rita, et al., "Thumbs
     Down To The Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
     No. 957, September 22, 1993.) Since the Clinton 1995 budget
     allocates only $1.29 trillion, the President is $100 billion
     short of his target. 
<P>
     This shortfall cannot be a surprise to the Administration,
because the procedure used to calculate it was used by former Defense
Secretary Les Aspin to criticize George Bush's defense proposals in
1992, when Aspin was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
The BURF most closely resembles what then-Congressman Aspin called his
"Option C." Option C provided the foundation for the defense budget
Congress drafted in 1992. Aspin estimated that Option C would cost
$270 billion in current dollar budget authority in fiscal year 1997.
(Les Aspin, "Defense 1997 Alternatives," February 25, 1992.)
<P>
     But the BURF, which Clinton has said will cost just $252 billion
in 1997, is larger than Option C. For example, Option C provides for
only 137,000 active-duty Marines, while the BURF provides for 174,000.
Further, while Option C planned for 18 Air Force fighter wings, the
BURF calls for 20. Taking the cost of the slightly larger BURF into
account, and using Aspin's own cost calculating procedures, the BURF
should cost about $275 billion in 1997. But the Clinton budget
provides only $252 billion in 1997, thus revealing a one-year budget
gap of $23 billion. Over the entire five-year period from 1995 through
1999, the shortfall is close to $100 billion.
<P>
     Since that is the case, the Clinton defense budget will result in
a force that is far smaller than the BURF. This force will resemble
another force described by Aspin called "Option B." Option B calls for
just 12 Army divisions, 290 Navy ships, 14 Air Force tactical wings,
and 134,000 active duty Marines . (Ibid.) A force this small could not
address the two "nearly simultaneous" major regional conflicts that
the Bottom-Up Review states must be addressed to protect the nation's
vital interests in the post-Cold War world.
<P>
A "hollow" military that is not combat ready. The Clinton defense
     budget, when coupled with the force structure decisions made in
     the Bottom-Up Review, will damage the ability of the military to
     stay ready for combat. To meet the austere budget goals, the
     military services will have to cut funding for the operations,
     maintenance, modernization, and training needed to stay ready for
     war.
<P>
     The damage to military readiness caused by the competition for
dollars is already evident. For 1994, the Army estimates that it can
pay for just over half (58 percent) of scheduled equipment overhauls.
(Memorandum from Acting Secretary of the Army John W. Shannon to
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, June 15, 1993. Reprinted in Inside the
Pentagon, June 24, 1993, pp. 7-8.) Ammunition supplies, a critical
indicator of readiness, are also declining due to budget reductions.
The Army is now consuming ammunition out of its war supply for
training purposes. Only 15 percent of the Army's ammunition is
certified as war-ready, based on shelf-life and other factors.
(Briefing by the Munitions Industrial Base Task Force at The Heritage
Foundation, February 15, 1994.) Finally, the Pentagon's own outside
group assessing military readiness, called the Readiness Task Force,
has determined that the frequency and length of Marine Corps
deployments overseas is preventing Corps units from participating in
required training activities. (Department of Defense, "Defense Science
Board Task Force on Readiness Interim Report," February 14, 1994, p.
6. Also see "Readiness Task Force Releases Interim Report," Department
of Defense News Release No. 081-94, February 18, 1994.)
<P>
     To reverse this disturbing trend in readiness, the Administration
is proposing to increase operations and maintenance funding in fiscal
1995 by $4.9 billion from 1994 levels. But this one-time infusion of
money will prove inadequate to avoid the emerging crisis in readiness.
There are two reasons for this conclusion: 
<P>
Reason #1: Clinton's approach amounts to no more than a budget "shell
     game" in which too little money is moved around between accounts.
     In future years, for example, military pay will demand larger
     percentages of the defense budget. This is because the number of
     troops in Clinton's force structure plan remains relatively high
     compared with the equipment purchases and operating costs
     provided in the budget. If the budget is to remain at the
     inadequate levels proposed by Clinton, then these other accounts
     will have to fall as military pay begins to consume a larger
     share of the total. In short, the reallocation of funds between
     accounts cannot solve the basic problem of an underfunded
     military force.
<P>
Reason #2: This reallocation of funds is also coming at the price of
     further reductions in the procurement budget. Reductions of the
     procurement account mean that the military will be operating
     aging equipment. For example, M-1 Abrams tank production ceased
     in the middle of 1993. As a result, the average age of the M-1
     fleet will go from 5.1 years in 1990 to 9.4 years in 1995, and to
     13.4 years in 1999. This is certain to result in increases in the
     cost of maintaining the fleet during the remaining years of this
     decade and into the next. Thus, the slashing of modernization
     funds also results in greater costs for programs under the
     Operations and Maintenance account.
<P>
     A posture that leaves the United States, its allies, and forces
abroad vulnerable to missile strikes. The Clinton Administration's
assault on the nation's missile defense program continues unabated
with the 1995 budget. The budget request includes only $3.25 billion
for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in fiscal 1995.
This compares to $7.6 billion that the Bush Administration planned to
propose for this program. Further, the budget demonstrates that the
Administration is even abandoning its own missile defense plan for the
period from fiscal 1995 through 1999, which was formulated during the
Bottom-Up Review. This longer-term plan already imposed a $22.9
billion, or 56 percent, cut in the program. Now the Administration is
saying that even the $18 billion that remains is too much. Another
$1.1 billion has been eliminated from the five-year budge.
<P>
     The impact of these budget proposals on the program will end the
prospects for effective national missile defense. The territory of the
United States will remain vulnerable to long-range missile strikes. As
former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stated last year, the so-called
theater missile threat is "here and now." (Secretary Aspin made this
comment during a press briefing on May 13, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
Furthermore, Clinton's budget proposal is too low to field defenses
against short-range (theater) missiles, despite earlier assertions by
Secretary Aspin that such defenses are a priority. (Ibid.) The Clinton
Administration plans to allocate only about $2 billion for theater
missile defense in fiscal 1995. The Bush Administration would have
budgeted almost $3.1 billion for the same period. This will certainly
delay the deployment of effective theater missile defenses and make
the systems that are ultimately deployed less effective. The question
that remains is how vulnerable will U.S. and allied forces be to enemy
missile strikes in places like Korea?
<P>
A technology gap. The Clinton Administration's defense budget
     represents a massive assault on the Pentagon's funding for new
     equipment and systems. The procurement budget will, in fiscal
     1995, fall by $1.2 billion from the year before. This inflation
     adjusted decline of 5.4 percent means that in 1995 the
     procurement budget will be only one-third of what it was in 1985.
     These budget reductions are already having an impact. Whereas the
     Pentagon bought 29 ships, 943 aircraft, and 720 tanks in 1985, it
     will buy only six ships, 127 aircraft, and no tanks in fiscal
     1995 (see chart on following page). The Army alone is planning to
     terminate 57 programs.
<P>
     Another trouble spot is research and development (R&D). The R&D
budget is slated to receive a modest 1 percent real increase (after
inflation) in 1995. Unfortunately, in the previous year's budget, a
similar attempt to protect R&D was rejected by Congress, which voted
to decrease it by about 10 percent. There is no reason to believe that
this pattern will not continue during debate on the fiscal 1995
defense budget. (For a full discussion on relationship between
procurement and research and development, see John F. Luddy, "Stop The
Slide Toward a Hollow Military, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
Update No. 209, January 14, 1994.)
<P>
     Taken together, the Administration's proposed funding plans for
procurement and research and development will endanger the military's
ability to arm itself with modern, high technology weapons. This will
result in a technology gap because existing military systems -- the
Navy's A-6 Intruder all-weather attack bomber, for example -- will
have to be retired before new systems can be developed and purchased.
This technology gap will certainly result in higher U.S. casualties in
a future conflict.
<P>
A damaged military industrial base. The steep reductions in the
     Administration's budget for defense procurement will not only
     prevent the military from obtaining high technology in the near
     future, it will also result in a depleted industrial base
     incapable of producing adequate numbers of high-tech weapons over
     the longer term. For example, the Clinton budget may result in
     the loss of around one million defense-related jobs in the
     private sector. (Richard A. Bitzinger and Steve Kosiak, Potential
     Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related
     Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.: Defense Budget Project,
     1993), p. 3.) In addition to lost jobs will be lost capabilities
     in defense production. Large defense contractors are cutting back
     on the number of smaller industries they rely on as suppliers.
     For example, Douglas Aircraft Company's list of suppliers dropped
     by 75 percent from early 1992 to the end of 1993. (Anthony L.
     Velocci, "U.S. Shakeout Tests Suppliers' Flexibility," Aviation
     Week & Space Technology, February 14, 1994, pp. 48-51.) Lockheed
     Corporation's Fort Worth Division has likewise reduced its list
     of suppliers by 68 percent. (Ibid.) Rebuilding this supplier
     network will take considerable time; something that may not be
     available in the event of a crisis.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is compounding the problems associated
with the weakening of the military industrial base. It is proposing to
allocate $3.3 billion of the defense budget in fiscal 1995 to "defense
conversion." This is part of a $20 billion multi-year, government-wide
program. The defense conversion program is designed to push industrial
enterprises out of the defense sector. This policy is misdirected
because it will not save any money. Instead, it directs that the
Pentagon actually pay for a weakening of the industrial base upon
which it depends. The $3.3 billion in the fiscal year 1995 defense
budget allocated to defense conversion would be better spent on
procurement. (For a full discussion of the defense industrial base and
defense conversion, see Baker Spring, "Supporting The Force: The
Industrial Base and Defense Conversion," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 964, October 22, 1993.)

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Any President's budget is a document that reflects policy
options. President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget is no exception, and
it shows the low priority he gives to national security issues. In his
budget, defense spending will go down while both entitlement spending
and domestic discretionary spending will increase. It exposes serious
contradictions in the Administration's defense policy, such as the
mismatch between force size and funding and the overemphasis on
reductions in procurement funding. 
<P>
     President Clinton must end this policy of neglect toward national
security. The nation's defenses must be given a higher priority than
the Clinton budget implies. The Administration must acknowledge the
full extent of its defense budget gap -- nearly $100 billion -- and
start working with Congress to find the funds from other budgets to
pay for it.

<title>Social Security Pandering -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<h2>Social Security Pandering</h2></center>

Politicians pander to senior citizens when they say that Social Security is 
sacrosanct. Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution warns of what will 
happen when the baby boomers are drawing benefits instead of paying 
taxes.<p>

"Even the most gung-ho budgetcutters in Washington make it a point to 
say that Social Security is off-limits," says syndicated columnist Thomas 
Sowell of the Hoover Institution, who concedes that to say otherwise is 
considered tantamount to political suicide. While acknowledging that 
Social Security recipients would be "outraged and up in arms if the 
federal government reneged on its promises and pulled the rug out from 
under them.'' Sowell insists that drastic steps must be taken to avert an 
impending disaster.<p>

Even if we are obliged to honor expensive promises made in the past, 
"we can at least stop making the same promises for the future." says 
Sowell. "Assure all those currently receiving Social Security checks that 
they will not lose one red cent." he urges. "Give the same assurances to 
those within a decade of their eligibility for Social Security. But there is no reason to continue subsidizing everyone who reaches a certain age." 
says Sowell. "If there are elderly people who are needy. Let them be 
subsidized out of general revenues, from which a transitional phaseout of 
Social Security could also be financed."<p>

Sowell explodes several of the enduring myths about Social Security. 
One myth is the notion that social security payments are qualitatively 
different from welfare relief. "As for the argument that people who have 
put contributions in are not welfare recipients when they take money 
out," says Sowell, "that of course depends on how much they put in and 
how much they take out." Most social security recipients extract far more 
from the system than they contributed.<p>

The fact "that Social Security is currently running a surplus and, that its 
reserve is expected to reach $3 trillion by the year 2020" serves as the 
basis of another myth. the myth of the system's solvency. "All of us can 
run a surplus," says Sowell, "if we are allowed to count all our assets and 
ignore enough of our liabilities," Sowell concedes that "$3 trillion is 
certainly a lot of money -- but not if you owe $4 trillion."<p>

Even the I in FICA, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, represents 
"pure fraud," says Sowell. "The word 'insurance' serves the political 
purpose of removing the onus of its being a handout like welfare or other 
entitlement programs. But a genuine insurance system collects money 
and invests it in assets which cover its liabilities. The Social Security 
system's assets have never covered its liabilities. It is not insurance." 
Sowell insists, "but a pyramid scheme in which those who enrolled earlier 
get what is paid in by those who enroll later."<p>

Sowell says the scheme "worked like a charm as long as the pyramid kept 
expanding, with the baby boomers' contributions being used to support 
the smaller generation before it." But, when the baby boomers reach age 
65, there will not be enough taxpayers to support social security as we 
know it.<p>

<h2>Libertine Libraries</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Your children cannot legally buy obscene rap music albums at a record    
store. They may, however, be able to check out the same revolting trash    
at your local library. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
Imagine your 12-year-old child coming home from the public library    
with a CD or cassette tape of 2 Live Crew's vulgar rap album As Nasty    
As They Wanna Be. Do you think it's impossible? Do you think no    
publicly-funded library would purchase music glorifying the rape and    
mutilation of women? Do you think no responsible librarian would    
release such material to children? Think again.   
<p>   
Public libraries all over America have multiple copies of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be and other violent and salacious recordings. They    
routinely loan these materials to children without the knowledge or    
permission of their parents. It's their policy to do that.   
<p>   
In the February issue of the Education Reporter, longtime teacher Helen    
Chaffee Biehle describes how she recently discovered that the public    
libraries she's loved all her life are no longer child-friendly forums for    
fact-finding and fantasizing. Having read in her local newspaper that a    
12-year-old boy had indeed been allowed to check out 2 Live Crew's    
filthy tape from one of the county libraries, Mrs. Biehle decided to call    
the library director herself and find out how this terrible mistake had    
occurred. She discovered that it was no mistake.   
<p>   
The library director was "completely calm and utterly unapologetic,"    
Mrs. Biehle recalls. Following the guidelines of the American Library    
Association's Intellectual Freedom Manual as regards the handling of    
complaints, the director offered three lines of defense. The first was an    
appeal to diversity. "Neither you nor I might approve of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be," she conceded, "but we serve a diverse population."    
Then there was the philosophical dodge. "Not to buy the tape would be    
making a moral judgment," she said. "We can't do that." The ultimate    
defense, however, was an American Library Association document called    
the Library Bill of Rights, which has absolutely no legal standing but    
purports to prohibit "censorship" on the basis of age.   
 <p>  
The great irony, of course, is that the guardians of intellectual freedom at    
the American Library Association are anything but tolerant when it    
comes to considering the opinions of others. It's not diversity that they    
believe in, but perversity. They make moral judgments -- or should we    
say, immoral judgments -- all the time. Censorship is the very essence of    
their profession. They decide which books, records, and videotapes will    
be made available to library patrons, and they routinely screen out    
materials that contradict their biases. Woe betide the independent-minded    
librarian who dares to defy them by respecting the values and opinions of    
the taxpayers who make their jobs possible. "The acceptance of moral    
responsibility for children in the library is now called 'unprofessional,"'    
notes Helen Chaffee Biehle; "making a responsible moral judgment about    
materials purchased for the library is called 'elitist,' and the librarian who    
is brave enough to do either is labeled a 'censor.'"

</center><hr size=3 width=30%><p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
  Having trimmed the size of its own politically appointed staff earlier this year, Congress is
moving toward enacting  legislation aimed at bringing about a sharp reduction in the number of
political appointees in the Clinton Administration. In doing so, however, Congress is not looking
closely at the consequences of its action.
<p>
  Specifically, the budget resolution recently adopted by Congress directs that the number of
political appointees in the executive branch be reduced by nearly a third, from the current level of
approximately 2,800 to just 2,000. It will be up to the authorizing committees either to implement this
change or to find other ways to reduce the budget outlays by the amount this move supposedly will
save.
<p>
    However, there will be two unintended consequences. First, since no overall reductions are
made in the size of the executive branch bureaucracy, no money will be saved by eliminating 800
political appointees. Their slots simply will be filled by career civil servants. Second, because these
slots will be filled by members of the career bureaucracy, Congress's action will solidify the grip of
Washington's "permanent government" on the operation of the federal establishment.
<p>
    While it is understandable that a conservative Republican Congress would want to see fewer
liberal Democratic appointees responsible to a Democratic President, this congressional effort
unwisely undermines legitimate presidential authority and the ability of the President to implement his
policy agenda -- and thus his responsibility to the American electorate.
<p>
    Paradoxically, the position taken by the Budget Committee Republicans parallels almost
precisely the 1988 recommendation of the National Commission on the Public Service to incoming
President George Bush that the number of political appointees be reduced from 3,000 (the level at that
time) to 2,000. Among the members of this commission, which was chaired by former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, were such prominent liberals as Robert McNamara, Walter
Mondale, Edmund Muskie, Elliot Richardson, and Donna Shalala. In other words, it was dominated
by the very people who had held (or, in Shalala's case, soon would hold) top federal positions and
had played a decisive role in creating the federal leviathan that exists today:  scores of big-government programs and agencies brought to life in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.
<p>
    The principal rationale for this recommendation was that putting political appointees in
positions of authority over career civil servants discourages "talented young men and women" in the
career bureaucracy. The commission trotted out the time-worn complaint from Washington's
powerful "public administration community":  political appointees are not around long enough to
learn their jobs well enough before leaving for another slot somewhere else. Therefore, it is better for
the President to have fewer of them.
<p>

<b>ARE THERE TOO MANY POLITICAL APPOINTEES?</b>
<p>
    There is, of course, occasional resentment among longtime career civil servants when political
appointees get high-ranking jobs they themselves had wanted. Although it certainly is true that
executive branch political appointees tend to have more influence than the average federal jobholder
(which is why their positions are defined in law and regulation as "policy-determining or policy-influencing"), their numbers remain minuscule. They certainly are not numerous enough to pose a
significant obstacle to ambitious career civil servants looking to advance.
<p>
    Consider the actual numerical strength of the political appointees targeted by the budget
resolution language:  non-career Senior Executive Service (SES) members and Schedule C employees.
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1979 requires that no more than 10 percent of SES positions be held
by non-career appointees. The proportion may be higher in a specific agency but cannot exceed 25
percent. Schedule C slots number fewer than 2,000 government-wide -- less than one one-thousandth of
the federal government's 2.1 million non-postal civilian workers. Taken together, non-career SES and
Schedule C employees represent only a drop in an ocean of career bureaucrats. By contrast, virtually all
congressional employees on Members' and committee staffs are political appointees.
<p>
    Congress clearly should protect the integrity of the career civil service -- for example, by
ensuring that civil service laws, rules, and regulations are enforced vigorously and that hiring and
promotion are fair and equitable. But the existence of a small and well-defined political cadre in the
executive branch is not a threat to the system's integrity. Rather, one of the most insidious and
corrosive abuses of the career civil service is a direct result of a law enacted by Congress in the
1940s. The Ramspeck Act allows former congressional staff employees to move into career
government jobs while avoiding the competitive appointment process. Remarkably, for all its progress
in the area of internal reform, the new Congress has left this egregious assault on the career service
virtually intact.
<p>
    To ensure the integrity of the federal civil service system, Congress should recognize and
endorse the distinction between, and the importance of, career and political employees. And it should
require that whenever highly paid congressional staffers move to the executive branch, they move into
positions that are clearly defined as political, rather than into positions reserved for career civil
servants.
<p>
    Congress should not undermine the President's ability to set his own agenda or his right to fill
key policy positions with men and women in whom he places particular trust. To do otherwise not
only compromises the ability of a President to carry out his responsibilities in a democratic system,
but also strengthens the hand of a powerful, entrenched career bureaucracy which tends to resist
change and innovation.
<p>

<b>THE ROLE OF POLITICAL APPOINTEES</b>
<p>
    To understand the impact of Congress's proposed cuts in politically appointed positions, one
needs to break down the totals into the categories of political appointees. There are three main
groups:  presidential appointments requiring Senate confirmation (PAS positions) and non-career
Senior Executive Service (SES) and Schedule C appointees.
<p>
    During the Reagan Administration, approximately 540 presidential appointments required
confirmation. During the past decade, Congress has created more than 100 additional positions in this
category, and the total is now more than 650. These are the top policy-making jobs in the federal
government and are held by Cabinet secretaries, deputy and assistant secretaries, heads of
independent agencies, and members of independent commissions and similar bodies. No one
questions that these should be people in whom a President has personal confidence and who, for the
most part, cannot be drawn from the career service.
<p>
    Non-career SES appointees currently number about 720, and the size of this category is
limited by a formula in the Civil Service Reform Act. They also serve in sensitive policy-making or
policy-influencing positions, typically with major responsibility for policy development, public affairs,
law, and other areas in which they are expected to be strong advocates of administration policy.
Because career civil servants must serve administrations of different parties from one term to the next,
they obviously should not be required to fill an advocacy role in these areas.
<p>
    The third category, Schedule C appointees, covers approximately 1,500 individuals in
positions requiring a politically sensitive relationship with one of the more senior appointees described
above:  confidential assistants, personal secretaries, senior policy advisors and assistants, and (in
smaller agencies) public affairs directors, general counsels, and so on. The roles they play in
supporting key political officials of the executive branch are roughly comparable to those of
congressional legislative and press aides. No Member of Congress would dream of giving such
responsibility to employees who remained in these jobs regardless of the political or philosophical
persuasion of whoever was representing the state or district in question.
<p>

<b>A SENSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL PERSONNEL POLICY</b>
<p>
    Members of Congress have an interest in making sure that the federal government is run
efficiently and effectively. Regardless of political party, they have an interest in seeing to it that the
President of the United States can manage the government without having to contend with the sorts
of institutional disabilities that are caused by not having the right people, or enough of the right
people, in the agencies he must operate. Members of Congress also have an interest in making sure
that executive branch witnesses who testify before them can speak with authority on the
administration's position. It does not help the legislative process for lawmakers to be second-guessing
what the administration really means or really wants in an area of policy. Such a situation advances
nobody's agenda -- except possibly the agenda of career staff determined to oppose, quietly but
strongly, what the President and his advisors are trying to accomplish. This is not good government.
It is quite the opposite. In crafting federal personnel policy, Congress should always maintain a clear
distinction between political and career staff, respecting the different and equally important missions
and functions of both.
<p>
    Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Congress should not compromise the right of a President to pick his own people. No matter
who occupies the Oval Office, a fundamental principle is at stake. A reasonable number of political
appointees are crucial to any President's success in carrying out his electoral mandate. The President
and Vice President are the only officials elected by a vote of all Americans. They are not beholden to
the interests of one state, or of one congressional district. They are elected by all the people and
represent the interests of all the people. No President can fulfill his mandate alone or with only a
handful of staffers in the West Wing of the White House. Nor can his Cabinet secretaries fulfill their
duty to implement his policies without a cadre of like-minded, personally committed political
appointees at the agency level.
<p>
<li>Conservatives in Congress should learn from and honor the example of President Ronald Reagan's
successful experience in personnel management. The managerial watchword in the Reagan White
House was "Personnel is Policy."  Everyone clearly understood that it was never enough simply to
announce a policy, expecting that the plodding, gargantuan federal establishment would respond like
a turbocharged V-8. The right people had to be in key positions throughout the government to make
things happen. Personnel selections thus were made with great care, with the White House looking
not only for management competence, but also for commitment to the President's program and the
kind of personal toughness and resolve that would be necessary to lead an agency in the right
direction. The fact that not every appointment turned out perfectly does not diminish the crucial
importance of making every effort to put the right people in the right jobs and to have enough of them
to get the job done.
<p><li>
While conservatives in Congress disagree with much that the Clinton Administration is doing, or
trying to do, the way to deal with such policy differences is by confronting them directly in the
legislative process, not by trying to weaken the Administration by trimming the number of political
appointees. Moreover, conservatives in Congress should realize that this is a double-edged sword:  a
sharp reduction in political slots today will be difficult, if not impossible, to undo in a few years if a
more conservative President takes office. Using political appointees in key policy jobs improves the
process of government. Not only is having people in place, regardless of their political party or
philosophical orientation, who can speak for, answer for, and defend the President's policy in
congressional hearings and other public forums good from a management standpoint; it is a highly
desirable feature of America's representative democracy.
<p><li>
Congress should not compromise the President's ability to carry out his agenda. Political
appointees are selected because they share the President's philosophy and agenda. They serve at the
pleasure of the President, can be fired at any time and for any reason, and have no civil service job
protection. They thus are acutely sensitive to the political direction set by the President. These
appointees give the President the support he needs in crucial congressional hearings, speaking for him
in a direct way and pressing his case on Capitol Hill. They also play the key role in making the
bureaucracy responsive to the President's wishes. There can be no more worthwhile management goal
than ensuring that the federal bureaucracy is responsive to the direction set by the highest elected
official in the land.
<p><li>
Congress should not strengthen the power of the permanent government bureaucracy. The
real, though largely unspoken, reason for the public administration community's hostility to political
appointees, whether liberal or conservative, is both simple and understandable:  these appointees
represent a force seeking real change, sometimes even upheaval. Regardless of which party controls
the White House, the President's immediate staff view themselves as his agents in the struggle to
fulfill his campaign promises and other commitments. Thus, their agenda often contrasts sharply with
that of the career civil servant, whose loyalty tends to be to the institution and who has spent years
(even decades) at an agency, creating and shaping the programs whose direction, size, or very
existence may now be under attack.
<p></ul>
Without saying so, the Volcker Commission's priority was to structure the civil service so as to
preserve and protect the vast bureaucracies that its own members had played such an important role
in creating. Those who share this objective view with nearly equal horror both the Reagan
Administration's efforts to cut the size, scope, and reach of government and the Clinton
Administration's campaign to "reinvent" government in order to make it more efficient.
<p>


<b>MAINTAINING THE LINE BETWEEN CAREER AND POLITICAL STAFF</b>
<p>
Congress should recognize the fact that America's representative democracy has long included
both political and career employees with distinct and equally important roles to play. Political
employees ensure that the will of the people, expressed in quadrennial national elections, is reflected
in the way government does its work. These employees, proudly and unapologetically, should be
advocates for the President's program. Congress should respect this because only these individuals
can fulfill this responsibility. Career employees, on the other hand, provide continuity, administrative
expertise, and institutional memory that can help the President and his appointees avoid repeating old
mistakes. Wise Members of Congress would not wish to return to a Jacksonian spoils system in
which political employees held all the jobs. But neither would they want a federal government in
which career employees, who enjoy civil service protection, hold all the jobs except for a few Cabinet
posts. A functional, effective executive branch needs both political appointees and career civil
servants.
<p>
    It is worth noting that the principle of having both political and career officials with distinct
roles in the executive branch is being undermined by the Ramspeck Act. Under this law, people who
have worked on congressional staffs for at least three years can be selected noncompetitively for
career jobs in the executive branch if their Representatives or Senators leave office. This happens
regularly in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, and it is time to end the practice. Since
last fall's wholesale defeat of scores of Democratic Members and the retirement of many others,
hundreds of these highly political staff employees have been able to move quietly into jobs that are
supposed to be held by career civil servants. A proper respect for the distinction between the roles of
political and career officials would place these staffers in political, not career, jobs. It is not the
function of a competitive civil service to be a haven for activists with a strong political agenda. Those
who do have such an agenda and who insist on trying to advance it should be subject to the risks and
responsibilities of political appointment. That is fair to the career civil servant and to the American
taxpayer.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
    Members of Congress considering proposed personnel cuts must realize that reducing the
number of executive branch political appointees by 800 simply will mean that those jobs will be taken
over by members of the career bureaucracy -- the permanent government. Without the guidance and
direction of a sufficient number of appointees responsible to the President, the results inevitably will
be to frustrate change and innovation and to enhance the power of the government leviathan.
<p>
    During the 1980s, American public television aired a series imported from Britain called
"Yes, Minister."  It depicted, in often hilarious fashion, how the British career bureaucracy had
raised to a fine art the process of sealing off and co-opting political ministers from the moment they
arrived on the job. While amusing, the series was painfully close to the truth, since government
ministers in Great Britain at that time were unable to hire any political assistants. Key officials in the
Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a point of trying to move in
America's direction when it came to giving their top political officials the ability to hire like-minded
people for their staffs. They recognized clearly that even the toughest political appointee cannot hope
to have any real impact if forced to rely exclusively on career bureaucrats. New Members of
Congress, swept into office by voters demanding fundamental change and the reining in of the
Washington establishment, should not let their opposition to the policies of the current White House
blind them to the importance of a President's being able to set policy direction for the executive
branch. It would be ironic indeed if a Congress wishing to carry out the people's demand for change
were to enact a personnel policy that delivered so much additional power into the hands of
Washington's permanent government.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
      In 1964, Marshall McLuhan pointed out that new technologies,
such as television and the computer, have changed our vision of the
world.  He wrote describing his new paradigm:
<P>
      <UL>After three thousand years of explosion, by means of
      fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Western world
      is imploding.  Today, after more than a century of electric
      technology, we have extended our central nervous system
      itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time
      as far as our planet is concerned.  Rapidly, we approach
      the final phase of the extension of man -- the
      technological simulation of consciousness, when the
      creative process of knowing will be collectively and
      corporately extended to the whole of human society.</UL>
<P>
      McLuhan's vision came to be known as the global village; a
result of his equation, in its own way as revolutionary as Albert
Einstein's E=MC2, that "the medium is the message."  McLuhan's insight
was that media are the extension of the human nervous system, and "the
personal and social consequences of any medium result from the new
scale that is introduced into our affairs... by any new technology."
<P>
      One of the most important writers to follow McLuhan has been
George Gilder.  His Life After Television, significantly distributed
in "The Larger Agenda" series by Whittle Direct Books in 1990, argued
that "television, in technical terms, was dead."  Gilder counselled
against following the Japanese model of government bureaucracies and
business consortia because large, centralized organizations were an
outdated relic of obsolete technologies -- dating from the Industrial
Revolution of the 19th Century.
<P>
      With the introduction of the micro-chip, Gilder argued
"Intelligence could move from the broadcast station into inexpensive,
home-based personal computers.... The choices now made by broadcasters
at an event could be made at home by a viewer's hand-held remote
control."  The entire existing terrestrial broadcast system became
outdated, in Gilder's words, "as passe as last century's ice-box and
ice wagon."  According to Gilder, the result will be enhanced
individualism, strengthening democracy and capitalism all around the
world.  In Gilder's view, all networks are the equivalent of ice
companies doomed by the invention of refrigeration.
<P>
      Such an individualism means that the era of television as a
purely mass medium is over, to be replaced by an electronic
marketplace entered through the "telecomputer."  This marketplace will
be accessible through fiber optic cables and digital compression. 
Gilder argues such an "electronic town hall" (to borrow from Ross
Perot or Heritage's own new service) will "liberate our imaginations
from programs regulated by bureaucrats chosen by a small elite of
broadcasting professionals and governed by the need to target the
lowest common denominators of public interests," or in the case of
PBS, by political considerations.
<P>
      Gilder uses the metaphor of the magazine business, with dozens
of special interest publications for every taste, as his vision for
the micro-chip age, which is now upon us.
<P>
      Critic David Marc argues that we don't even have to wait for the
telecomputer -- that cable and satellite broadcasting, along with the
home-video cassette, have already rendered mass media as a thing of
the past.  In Demographic Vistas, he remarks:
<P>
      <UL>As NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS and big-city independents are
      joined by HBO, ESPN, A&E, CBN, WHT, USA, CNN and the rest
      yet to come in the alphabet soup of the cable converter,
      the forty years or so during which scores of millions of
      people watched the same TV shows day in and day out are
      likely to be remembered as a quaint, naive period.  Cable
      innovations will allow the demographer marketeers to
      decentralize structure and even to isolate and attack
      pockets of aesthetic resistance (the highly educated are
      among the early, prominent target groups).</UL>
<P>
      So McLuhan, Gilder, and Marc all argue that the transformation
of technology has changed our way of life irrevocably, and that the
approaches of the past will be of little help in the future.  In this
sense they have an affinity with Jacques Ellul, who argues in The
Technological System that "the human being who uses technology today
is by that very fact the human being who serves it.  And conversely,
only the human being who serves technology is truly able to use it." 
At a crucial moment, then, one might ask "not what your technology can
do for you, but what you can do for your technology."  And it is with
this constrained vision that I would like to discuss the role of
public television on the cultural marketplace after privatization.

<P>
A SEA CHANGE
<P>
      The current debate over public television is not occurring in
isolation.  The present moment is one of tremendous change in the
communications industry and show-business, as the impact of the events
of the 1980s is beginning to be felt.
<P>
      In Europe, the fall of Communism has resulted in an explosion of
private media outlets, and a revolution in the relationship between
broadcasters and the marketplace.  I recently returned from MIP, the
international TV program market in Cannes, where I attended a press
conference on the privatization of Russian television, and heard a
pitch on why a network buy in Russia now was a bargain.  At the same
time, the European Community is preparing to increase production of
television, much of it in English, designed for sale to the American
market.  And in France there are rumors that Antenne 2, the second
public channel, will be sold off to private investors before the next
national elections.  Already, Canal, Plus, a private wireless cable
channel, is the most successful station in Europe, and owns Carolco
pictures, which produced both Basic Instinct and JFK.  TF-1
successfully drove its competitor, le Cinq, off the air -- with a
little help from the French government, which plans to split its
franchise between a French-German cultural channel and Jacques Lang's
dream of a national MTV for France.
<P>
      In England, the BBC announced a joint venture with Thames
Television on a new satellite channel featuring shows from their tape
libraries -- fully financed by advertising.  This is a dramatic change
for the BBC, and was announced only days after the victory of John
Major and the Conservatives.  The BBC also has started a service to
Asia, again with advertising on its satellite feed.  Thus, even Auntie
Bee is moving into the marketplace with surprising alacrity.
<P>
      Here in the United States there is evidence of dramatic change
in telecommunications.  In addition to the CPB reauthorization still
pending in the Senate, there remains serious legislation to re-
regulate the cable industry; to decide on the entry of telephone
companies into competition with the networks; and to set up a new
satellite service dedicated to educational use called EDSAT.  The
networks are pressing for an end to Fin/Syn.  In addition, the
competing HDTV suppliers have pooled their resources.  Each of these
events alone is a small sign of the sea change in broadcasting.  Put
together, they mark the most significant shift since the Nixon
Administration's decisions of Financial Interest in Syndication,
Prime-Time Access, satellites, and cable entry.  It is also rumored
that Clayton Yeutter has set up a telecommunications policy working
group in the White House, which indicates just how important these
matters will be in the coming months and years.  The tectonic plates
are clearly shifting, and the fight over the public broadcasting bill
is now seen to be a volcano erupting on a fault line, a fault line
caused by the irresistible force of market pressures on a highly
regulated industry.  The immense demand can no longer be met by
government sanctioned gatekeepers extracting monopoly rents.
<P>
      Some measure of the transformation in broadcasting can be seen
in viewing statistics.  In 1983-1984, the networks had a 69 share,
independent broadcasters a 19 share, PBS a 3 share, basic cable a 9
share, and pay cable a 5 share.  Six years later, the numbers had
shifted dramatically.  In 1990-1991, the networks were down sixteen
points, to a 53 share, independents up slightly to a 21 share, and
basic cable up fifteen points to a 24 share.  Meanwhile, PBS remained
static at a 3 share, which meant its core of loyal viewers were not
switching, but neither were they getting new audiences.  Another set
of statistics, from Entertainment Weekly, actually reported PBS
audiences went down by 12 percent in 1990-1991.  In that same period,
cable stations doubled their expenditures on programming from $1.74
billion to $3.46 billion, some three times the annual budget for
public broadcasting.  Given these statistics, how can public
broadcasting cope with the seismic changes in their universe?  Harold
Vogel points out in his book Entertainment Industry Economics that
Direct Broadcast Satellite, Microwave Multi-point Distribution of
Signals, Small Master Antenna Television, and subscription television
will all be growth technologies challenging cable's dominance, as well
as the current share of the networks and PBS.  He notes "technological
development has been the driving force behind the growth of the
entertainment industries."  Vogel further notes that in a competitive
environment, small entrepreneurs (not established) thrive because of
the inherent non-standardization and novelty required.  Vogel says
creative works "are uniquely produced and are normally originated by
individuals working alone or in small groups, and not by giant
corporate committees.  One can become rich and famous as a direct
result of one's own creative efforts."
<P>
      How can public broadcasting provide an environment which
attracts such creative entrepreneurs?  Only by transforming the system
into one which rewards individualistic impresarios rather than
bureaucratic operators.
<P>

CREATIVE COMPETITION
<P>
      This competition means that government funding, with its
strings, serves to stunt the growth of public broadcasting.  Richard
Blum and Richard Lindheim predict that pay-per-view will become an
increasingly competitive source of programming in the 1990s, in their
book Primetime Network Television Programming.  In that book, they
point out that the creative process is an extremely personal one.  The
presentation begins with an oval "pitch" explaining a series idea. 
The written presentation is usually not shown to the network, unless
there is a complication.  The most important factor is showmanship. 
They add:  "A number of key ingredients are necessary for a successful
presentation.  Among them are honest enthusiasm, abundance of detail,
humor, conviction, and adaptability."  Once the idea is accepted, the
written concept is purchased.  As the authors point out, it "often
sounds like a TV guide marketing blurb."  They reprint the one-
paragraph concept for Murder She Wrote as follows:
<P>
      <UL>Angela Lansbury stars as a celebrated mystery writer,
      Jessica Fletcher, whose penchant for crime-solving
      invariably involves her in often bizarre and always
      colorful escapades.  Once a contented widow from a small
      town in Maine, Jessica has found fame, as well as
      adventure, by turning her avocational scribblings into a
      lucrative new career.  A star-studded cast and an endless
      chain of nieces and nephews will join her as she solves the
      most intriguing of crimes with the most eccentric of
      methods.</UL>
<P>
      In contrast to the highly personal creative process surrounding
commercial programming, because of its reliance on tax dollars today
public broadcasting operates much more like a government bureaucracy. 
According to 1988 congressional testimony from Fred Wiseman, the
system is a "mess."  He added, "most competent professionals would not
consider working in public television in its present form."  Yet, so
long as public broadcasting is accountable for federal tax dollars it
will rightfully be hamstrung by administrative procedures inimical to
the creative spirit, designed for civil service priorities.  Evidence
for this can be seen in the lack of successful new series on PBS
prime-time schedules, even a follow-up to General Motors' The Civil
War.  Evidence can also be found in P.J.  O'Rourke's description of
bureaucracy.  He says "the actual work of government is too
unglamorous for the people who govern us to do.  Important elected
office-holders and high appointed officials create bureaucratic
departments to perform the humdrum tasks of national supervision. 
Government proposes, bureaucracy disposes.  And the bureaucracy must
dispose of government proposals by dumping them on us."
<P>
      Such a system rewards the bureaucratic mind, not the creative
and glamorous spirit.  It is a fact that even Norman Lear, one of the
most successful producers in Hollywood and certainly a bona fide
liberal, was unable to get his American Writer's Theatre -- which
would have featured adaptations of classic American authors -- through
the PBS and CPB maze.  It is not surprising, as Jonathan W.  Emord has
shown in his book Freedom, Technology and The First Amendment.  "The
normal functioning of the free speech and press models is possible
only in the absence of government regulation."  But federal tax
dollars carry federal strings.  Therefore, for public broadcasting to
be free and creative, it must be truly independent -- and that means
financially private -- in order to thrive.
<P>
      How is this to take place?  The answer lies in the rich
potential of the ancillary revenues from public broadcasting.  As has
been shown by the success of ventures such as Bill Kling's $77,000,000
Minnesota Public Radio catalogs, or Ken Burns's and Bill Moyers's
video and book tie-ins, or Sesame Street's licensing of $1 billion
worth of merchandise world-wide, there are substantial revenues to be
earned in the public broadcasting aftermarkets.
<P>
      With a real, bottom line after privatization, public
broadcasters will be encouraged to make deals so that the profits from
ancillary income go directly to finance the creation of new
programming.  This will be true for stations as well.  The copyrights
for public broadcasting productions would be the motor of this
prosperity.  Combined with donations, underwriting, and increased
corporate support, these sums will more than make up for the trade-off
in federal funds.  Such a self-supporting public broadcasting system
could be run on either a non-profit or a for-profit basis.  If non-
profit, the model might be The National Geographic Society.  With
10,000,000 members -- twice as many as public broadcasting -- National
Geographic runs $450,000,000 of cultural and educational programs each
year -- including two TV series, a magazine, the visitor center, and
numerous expeditions and publications.  Yet, it receives no direct tax
dollars, unlike the present CPB.
<P>
      Or CPB could go for-profit as a publicly held and publicly
traded corporation, receiving its capital from the marketplace instead
of the taxpayer.  This would still leave the local stations untouched,
free to operate as they have been doing.
<P>
      But instead of receiving community service grants as they now
do, local stations and other recipients would have to bargain over the
terms of contracts with a partner who had a bottom line to meet.  This
would enforce fiscal discipline on the entire system, and perhaps
encourage public television stations to increase their audiences.  It
would create incentives to reach viewers.  Share holders could
participate proudly in any profits, having converted charity to an
investment.
<P>
      The non-profit model is already successful for Children's
Television Workshop, grossing $100 million annually.  The for-profit
model also exists in production companies such as Ken Burns's
Florentine Films and Bill Moyers' Public Affairs Television.
<P>
      All of them are already truly thriving in the cultural
marketplace, selling books, records, and videocassettes, among other
items.  There is no reason their successes could not be duplicated in
such a way that contribute directly to the system instead of
extracting profit (and "non-profit") from the system.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
      By entering the cultural marketplace as a truly private entity
and directly competing with new services, and by using its strongest
programming to support new products, Public Television has every
opportunity to grow and prosper in the multi-channel marketplace.  For
in addition to all its tangible assets, Public Television enjoys
another benefit -- the good will engendered by its long established
reputation for quality educational and cultural programming.  It is a
blue-ribbon name, on which one cannot even place a dollar estimate. 
With the proper marketing strategy, and a willingness to go head-to-
head in competition, there can be no doubt but that PBS could
establish itself in the market niche of the "Tiffany" service by the
end of the 1990s, and Tiffany's is a very successful shop.
<P>
      Without the stifling influence of the government bureaucracy
which goes with its congressional appropriation, a liberated CPB will
be free to bring far more of the finest in arts, education, and
culture to viewers like you, at no cost to the taxpayer.

<P><h2><center>
NEW ZEALAND: A BLUEPRINT FOR ECONOMIC REFORM</h2></center><p>

Delivered June 16, 1995 by His Excellency John Wood, Ambassador of New Zealand to the United States. 
<P>
	I had hoped to talk to you this afternoon about the America's Cup. But my staff have told me that I've done that subject to death, that Americans don't really want to hear any more about New Zealand winning yachting's greatest prize, and that I might actually get a better reception at The Heritage Foundation for one of my other favorite topics -- farming without subsidies.
<p>
	Actually, today I'd like to talk to you about the economic transformation of New Zealand that has occurred over the last decade.
<p>
	New Zealand at the time of the Korean War was among the five wealthiest countries in the world. By the late '70s, we had fallen to near 20th. New Zealand had one of the poorest performing economies of the Western world; had not dealt well with the oil shocks; had high tariff and other import barriers, high levels of farm subsidies, a national debt that was approaching Third World proportions, a top tax rate of 66 percent; a gold-plated welfare system that the country could no longer afford. From 1975 to 1983, the economy barely grew; the only thing that grew was unemployment -- from 0 percent to 5 percent. 
<p>
	In other words, we were as tightly regulated, protected, and centralized as any East European country, and performing about as well. If we'd been a company, we would have been bankrupt, or at the least operating under Chapter 11!
<p>
	In 1984 a period of reform started which has been described by the OECD as the most comprehensive undertaken by any Western country in recent decades. I've said a little bit about how we got into the mess. How did we get out of it?  What are the results today?
<p>

<b>PRECONDITIONS FOR REFORM</b><p>
	There were three critical preconditions for reform:
<P>
First, in 1984 there was an acute sense of crisis in the country at large.
<p>
Second, there was a consensus among New Zealand's professional leadership, both public and private sector, that drastic and comprehensive change was necessary, that no single interest group should be immune from change or should be permitted to dictate the agenda. An intellectual basis for change was provided by a key group of officials in the Treasury, drawing in part on their exposure to academic debate in the United States. A change of government in 1984 brought to power a Labor government that was a generation younger than its predecessor, of liberal persuasion and professional background, and willing to embrace change. They took the view that ideas, productive energies, and confidence for New Zealand to make its way in the world would only emerge from opening all sectors of the economy to the forces of competition.
<P>
Third, there was a realization that no one else was going to help us. There was no fairy godmother out there willing and able to shore up our currency, extend our debt raising capacity, or anything else. We were in trouble, in part of our own making. We had to get out of it ourselves.

<P>
<b>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?<br></b><p>
<b>Financial Sector
</B><p>
	The foreign exchange crisis at the time of the change of government led to a decision to massively devalue the currency, then free float the exchange rate, and then to comprehensively deregulate the financial sector. With foreign exchange controls lifted, new banks were allowed to operate.
<p>

<b>Agriculture</b>
<P>
	Let me spend a little time here even though I appreciate that I may be speaking to the converted, given the position that has been taken in The Heritage Foundation's publications. But let me explain how we got rid of the sacred cows -- not the other ones, but the sacred ones.
<P>
	Farm production and processing account for nearly 12 percent of New Zealand's GDP. Two-thirds of total farm output is exported, earning 60 percent of total export revenue. Agriculture is too big to be carried by the rest of the economy. Assistance to New Zealand's farmers peaked in 1984, contributing to 30 percent of total agricultural output. That was  unsustainable. One year later, almost all subsidies were gone, and the rest went soon after.
<P>
	There are now no subsidies and no other forms of assistance except for spending on inspection, quarantine, research, and pest control. New Zealand's farmers are fully exposed to market forces. New Zealand's agricultural sector is by far the least assisted in the OECD. Government support to farming fell from a peak of 30 percent in 1984 to 3 percent in 1990.
<P>
	It was not a painless process. Market land values fell by 22 percent during 1982-1988 (indicating the extent to which government support for agriculture was capitalized into farm land values). Overseas markets worsened in the late 1980s, mostly due to the subsidized overproduction of pastoral products in OECD countries.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the main farmers organization supported the reforms (provided they were implemented throughout the economy, thus lowering farmers' costs of production). Farmers adjusted rapidly to liberalization. Very few were forced out -- only about 800, or 1 percent. Farming contracted at the margins (marginal land use, excessive debt loads, and/or incompetence), not across the board. Lurid depictions of rural collapse never became a reality.
<P>
	Now farmers' real net incomes have returned to the level prevailing in the early 1980s. Farmers have become more innovative and more responsive to markets and allocate their  resources more efficiently. They have developed new markets.
<P>
	Some in the U.S. have suggested that there was a drop in agricultural output. That is misleading. The pattern of farm output changed, reflecting more efficient allocation of resources. For example, there was a trend away from traditional pastoral farming, where most subsidies were once directed (sheep numbers fell from 70 million in 1982 to 50 million today) into a range of areas such as horticulture, forestry, and cattle.
<P>
	No New Zealand farmers are calling for a return to the bad old days of government support. New Zealand farmers earn their living by their own efforts, without interference. That independence is now fiercely defended by rural people. New Zealand's experience shows that it is possible for farmers to live well and prosper following the loss of government assistance despite the agricultural support policies of other countries, including the U.S., which distort and limit international trade.
<P><b>Trade</b><P>
	Tariffs in New Zealand were reduced to one-third of what they had previously been. New Zealand consciously opened up its market to imports and international competition. Even after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, New Zealand unilaterally announced a further series of tariff reductions up to the year 2000 in areas as sensitive as textiles, clothing, and footwear. Over 90 percent of all imports now enter New Zealand free of any quota, duty, or other restriction. In the meantime, New Zealand's manufacturing base has flourished. Our total exports of all goods increased 5 percent in 1994; manufactured goods increased by 7 percent. I know this kind of action is commonly referred to as unilateral disarmament in this country. We simply don't see it that way. We weren't seeking to convey unrequited benefits to anyone else, but to do ourselves a favor.
<P>

<b>Market Reforms</b>
	The public sector in New Zealand used to run everything from the railways to electricity generation, the telecommunications sector, a savings bank, the coal mines. The government used to build all the roads and dams. Some estimates suggest that the government was involved in 60 percent of the economy, certainly in almost all major investment decisions.
<P>
	In 1984, the government adopted the principle that the state should not be involved in any activities that could be more efficiently and effectively run by the private sector. The first step was corporatization through the State Owned Enterprises Act of 1986, which involved getting enterprises run on a commercial basis, freeing them from government red tape, putting a private sector board in charge, removing political interference, requiring them to make a profit. This often meant setting clear, unambiguous goals. For example, the Forest Service was never sure whether its main purpose was to plant and harvest trees profitably or to provide jobs. Corporatization removed that conflict.
<P>
	The second step was privatization, or selling the enterprise and removing the government as an owner. An important principle that was at the heart of the privatization process was minimum regulation but maximum competition. There was no desire to substitute private sector monopoly for government monopoly. The government therefore sought to put in place a framework that would generate competition.
<P>
	One of the best examples is in the field of telecommunications, with corporatization in 1987 and privatization in 1990. The proceeds of NZ$4.250 billion were used to retire the debt. Telecom New Zealand had 26,500 employees; it now has 9,300. There is competition from MCI on long distance, from Bell South on cellular. Capital investment of nearly NZ$5 billion since 1987 was not paid by the taxpayers. In addition, Telecom New Zealand paid $463 million in taxes in the last three years. From antiquated technology to a 97 percent digital system rated second in the World Competitiveness Report (an independent Swiss-based organization) for telecom systems, and from being a drain on the taxpayer, our telecommunications system has become a significant force in an expanding economy that  actually contributes to government revenue through taxation.
<P>
	The Coal Corporation had had losses in 20 of the previous 22 years. In its first year of   corporatization, it increased its level of production while cutting staff numbers in half. And it made a profit. Now while there are fewer workers, they are better paid -- and they have a  future.
<P>
	Since 1987 21 former State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been sold, generating NZ$12.8 billion, which has been used to repay debt. Some SOEs remain, some possibly to be privatized (for example, Forestcorp). Others may not (for example, Airways Corp, responsible for air safety, with a profit of NZ$6 million last year, or the New Zealand Post, with very large profits, improved services, and a basic postage stamp rate that has not increased in many years).
<P>

<b>Public Sector Reform</b><P>
	One statistic that gives an idea of the scale of change in the public sector is that it decreased in size from 88,000 people employed in public service in 1984 to 36,000 ten years later:  a reduction of 59 percent.
<P>
	How did we do it?  We made managers fully accountable. For example, permanent heads became CEOs on five-year contracts. They contracted with Ministers to provide certain   outputs. We freed up central controls on finance and personnel policies. We let managers set pay and conditions and use capital to the best advantage. Departments can buy and sell assets within their existing level of appropriation without any further appropriation or authority.
<P>
	We introduced accrual accounting (it was a bit of a shock to find the government's net worth in FY 1992/93 was negative NZ$7.7 billion). We are the only Western government to produce its national accounts in this way, which gives a clear idea of the unfunded liabilities of the government. A capital charge on each department's capital has meant departments no longer regard capital as a free good and leads to much more sensible use of assets, akin to the way a private company would behave.
<P>
	In sum, three key aspects of the government reforms have been very successful:
<p><ol><li>Transparency in the activities and processes of the government;
<li>The liberation of managers from central input controls;
<li>The new financial management and accounting systems.
<P>
<b>LOCKING IN THE REFORMS</b><P>
	The reform process took place under two different governments in New Zealand. From 1984-1990, there was a Labor government; from 1990 onwards, a National government. The National government took up the reform process from Labor and reformed the Labor market. The Employment Contracts Act provided for comprehensive deregulation, employees not being required to join any union, and few external legal constraints other than contract law and minimum standards. National also reformed the welfare system. It reduced the value of government benefits and targeted them more precisely, including means testing to ensure assistance was directed to those most in need.
<P>
	Both parties took steps to ensure that in the future, economic management would be as divorced from politics as possible.
<p>
	The Reserve Bank Act 1989 enhanced the independence of the Reserve Bank and stipulated that the bank's main function, for which the Governor would be held personally responsible, was maintenance of price stability within 0-2 percent.
<P>
	The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994 requires all of the government's financial reporting to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. The government is required to set medium term objectives, which at present are reducing net debt to between 20 percent-30 percent of GDP, restoring the government's net worth to positive levels, reducing government expenditure to below 30 percent of GDP, not increasing the rate of income tax, and prudently managing risks facing the government. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the government must publish a comprehensive set of accounts annually and before any election.
<P>
<b>RESULTS OF TEN YEARS OF REFORM</b><P>
	In 1994 New Zealand was ranked ninth overall amongst the OECD in the World Competitiveness Report. It ranked first in the world for government policy designed to develop a competitive business environment.
<P>
	After years of low to mediocre growth, New Zealand's economy has grown over the last two years by 5 percent, with growth at times exceeding 6 percent. We believe this is on a sustainable basis. Our mid-term expectation is for between 3.5 percent and 5 percent growth. Inflation has been held below 2 percent -- the second-lowest rate in the OECD.
<P>
	For two years running, the government has balanced its budget. In 1984 the deficit was 9 percent of GDP. This year we expect the surplus will be over 4 percent of GDP (NZ$2.6  billion), rising to 7.5 percent by 1997. Public debt as a share of GDP was nearly 52 percent of GDP at 30 June 1992, is currently 38 percent, and is projected to be down to 18 percent by 1998. Net foreign currency debt will be totally paid off by 30 June 1997.
<P>
	Government spending as a percentage of GDP -- 41 percent in 1991 -- is 34 percent this year, and we aim to have it below 30 percent. Despite this reduction in government spending as a percentage of GDP, expenditure on education overall has been increasing steadily. It was the top expenditure priority in the budget just recently announced. It is now over 5 percent of GDP, above that in the U.K., Australia, and the United States.
<P>
	When accrual accounting was introduced, we discovered the government's net worth in 1992/93 was negative $7.7 billion. By next financial year we expect it to be positive. Unemployment has fallen from a high of 10.9 percent to 6.6 percent, with excellent employment growth in last two years.
<P>
	But even more than these economic statistics, the process of reform, which has not been without pain for many New Zealanders, has now led to a new spirit of self-confidence in the country and a feeling that New Zealand has positioned itself to compete in the global environment. We are now free traders par excellence. We have the cleanest and most comprehensive free trade area in the world, with Australia. We are talking to Chileans. We are exploring a link between the Australia/New Zealand Free Trade Area and ASEAN. We would be delighted to talk free trade with any other economies in the Asia/Pacific region.
<P>
	I hope you will all come down to New Zealand to see for yourselves. New Zealand is not just a pretty place to visit, but also a very stimulating environment. Whilst we do not pretend that there are necessarily any lessons from what has happened in New Zealand for other countries, we are always happy to share experiences with our friends. Come down and see us defend the America's Cup!

<p>
	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>hen Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith offered to help Congress find alternative 
sources of money to replace federal funding of public-television broadcasting, PBS 
supporters protested en masse. And when Jones Intercable--which already distributes 
adult-education courses through its Mind Extension University--offered to take over 
programming for PBS, the cries of outrage grew louder. Public broadcasting, which has 
always presented itself as an impoverished charity case throughout years of on-air beg-a-
thons, was suddenly described by PBS president Ervin Duggan as a valuable business 
enterprise that should not be "sold off for scrap."</P>
<P>	A similar contradiction surfaced when House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) first 
announced on National Empowerment Television (which receives no tax money) that 
he'd like to "zero out" federal subsidies for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Lobbyists attacked him for wanting to "kill" public broadcasting. This same lobby 
counters criticism of its reliance on tax money by pointing out that the federal share of its 
revenue was only 14 percent of the total.</P>
<P>	The conflicting arguments of public-television advocates against the privatization 
of the industry illuminate the broad contours of the debate: Congress is now debating 
proposed cuts in appropriations for public broadcasting of 15 percent for 1996 and 30 
percent for 1997. But the issue is about more than just $285.6 million in tax money; it is 
also about the role and reach of the federal government and an elitist culture determined 
to manipulate it for its own purposes:</P>

<H3>Plenty of Money</H3>
<P>	Public broadcasters maintain that the federal share of their income is sacrosanct, 
the "seed money," and quite unlike the remaining 86 percent that comes from other 
sources. But, in fact, the federal matching formulas work precisely in the opposite 
manner. It is the non-federal money which is the "seed money" for public broadcasting, 
as anyone who has ever watched a pledge-week special will recognize. The federal 
government offers to match the amount of private funds each station succeeds in raising. 
This is the reason large urban stations with wealthy viewerships perversely receive more 
money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting than do small, rural stations. It all 
prompts the question: Why are CPB advocates so certain the rest of their income could 
not be generated outside of federal coffers?</P>
<P>	It was a curious thing to watch this hostility to businessmen displayed by 
representatives of an institution that usually, at least in public, sings honeyed praises of 
"public-private partnership." These same elites point to the many <I>Fortune 500</I> 
corporations that enjoy enhanced prestige through their association with PBS: General 
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, GTE, New York Life, and Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	Indeed, private-sector benefactors who offered to raise money for the educational 
broadcasting system were described by Frank Rich, a columnist for the <I>New York Times</I>, 
not as generous philanthropists, but rather as "circling vultures." The privatization that 
had once been described as impossible is now denounced as being all too likely.</P>
<P>	The availability of private funding sources reveals that the fundamental issues are 
ideological and not financial. Proponents of federal support for public broadcasting want 
the government to be involved because they dislike private enterprise. They claim to fear 
the "trash" that a market-based broadcasting system could produce. They say they want 
to make television "safe for kids."</P>
<P>	What they dislike, however, is not poor-quality programming, but the very idea of 
the market. If it were the former, then how can PBS justify <I>Tales of the City</I>, a campy 
soap opera; <I>Tongues Untied</I>, which was both crude and lewd; Frontline's <I>Death of a 
Playboy Centerfold</I> and <I>Death of a Porn Queen</I>, subjects more suitable to tabloid 
television; and <I>Yanni: Live at the Acropolis</I>, which some might consider of doubtful 
value? Clearly such programming is not intrinsically superior to <I>A Current Affair</I> or 
<I>Inside Edition</I>. In fact, trash is not in the least offensive to the fans of public 
broadcasting--commercial trash is.</P>
<P>	In the PBS world view, exposure on public television can even elevate 
commercial television into art. Take the case of <I>I'll Fly Away</I>. A CBS drama starring Sam 
Waterston and Alfre Woodard, it did well critically, but poorly in the ratings, and was 
canceled after one season. PBS picked it up, producing one new episode and then airing a 
full season of repeats. The series depicted the effect on one family of the civil rights 
movement in the South, and flattered the sensibility of the liberal professionals who make 
up the core PBS audience. No doubt they could identify with this well-educated Southern 
family, which was manifestly superior to the backwards rednecks who made up the rest 
of the white folks in the series.</P>
<P>	The program was among the highest-rated shows ever broadcast by the network. 
If anything, the success of <I>I'll Fly Away</I> has indicated that a show by commercial 
producers was just what public broadcasting needed. But that was not what happened. 
Despite the series's appeal, no further commercial drama has appeared on the network. 
Indeed, PBS even canceled a development deal with producer Brandon Tartikoff, who 
had been president of NBC when it was at the top of the ratings.</P>
<P>	Commercial-drama producers were not welcome at PBS even after the success of 
<I>I'll Fly Away</I>, just as Bell Atlantic is not welcome as a replacement for Uncle Sam. The 
reason is simple: Public broadcasters see themselves as an aristocracy and, like aristocrats 
everywhere, they find commerce beneath them. No matter that the U.S. Constitution 
prohibits titles of nobility; public broadcasters see themselves like the Dons of 18th-
century Spain, with neither dust on their boots nor soil of commerce on their hands.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic pose of public broadcasting, and protestations of independence 
from mainstream American tastes, is curiously dependent precisely on the patronage of 
the federal government. Otherwise, the status of the enterprise is no different from that of 
any other broadcasting entity. Indeed, the aristocratic pretension even informs the refusal 
of the public-broadcasting lobby on Capitol Hill to submit CPB to the Freedom of 
Information Act. To disclose information to the American public--to mere commoners--
would be to lose stature. The mystery of the enterprise would be disturbed, and without 
the mystery, there would be little majesty.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conceit also undergirds broadcasters' refusal to ensure, as the law 
requires, that programming is objective and balanced. The Public Broadcasting Act of 
1967 specifically calls for such balance in all matters of public controversy. This was 
necessary for the same reason Congress passed the ban on domestic dissemination of the 
Voice of America--that it would be dangerous to allow the federal government's power 
over the press to be exploited by a victorious political faction.</P> 
<P>	In 1992, after complaints of imbalance and the intercession of Senator Dole (R-
KS), Congress strengthened the statute to provide for a procedural review of 
programming and commissioning of remedial fare whenever public broadcasters violated 
standards of objectivity. Yet, after almost three years, the CPB has never admitted a 
single mistake, nor commissioned a single hour of remedial programming.</P>
<P>	A desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for this 
otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. For to admit error would be to place public 
broadcasting on the same plane as the commercial press. <I>The New York Times</I> prints 
corrections every single day. The <I>Washington Post</I> has an ombudsman. When NBC was 
caught rigging a crash test on Dateline NBC, the company fired the president of NBC 
News. But when PBS aired the fraudulent <I>Liberators</I>, which falsely gave credit for the 
liberation of Buchenwald to African-American troops instead of the 6th Armored 
Division, WNET in New York retracted it after substantial public pressure from Jewish 
groups and World War II veterans. Yet not a single head rolled, and no corrective 
programming was aired.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conception of status also thrives in the relation of CPB to 
Congress. Although dependent on the federal government for its annual appropriation, 
the CPB regards its role as a "heat shield" against Congressional critics rather than a 
regulator. That is, public broadcasting must be permitted to receive federal funds and 
commission programming with no questions asked. The government-weary electorate 
demands accountability for tax money spent on every other government program. Yet 
public broadcasters stand with the National Endowment for the Arts as one of the few 
recipients who claim a special exemption.</P>

<H3>Kids as Shields</H3>
<P>	PBS's attitude is bad enough when it is programming for the "new class" of 
professionals and educators. But it is even worse when it hides behind supposed concern 
for the sensibilities of children. Commercials, one of the engines of revenue, are deemed 
hazardous by a cadre of "experts" in education and media, who need to certify shows as 
"educational."</P>
<P>	But here's the rub: When advertising aimed at children became increasingly 
restricted on the networks, PBS became the venue for licensing bonanzas connected to its 
shows. For example, over 5,000 products connected to Sesame Street are grossing almost 
$1 billion in annual sales. Yet the show is nevertheless considered "non-commercial" 
because it is certified as such by "experts" in educational psychology, such as Gerald 
Lesser, a founder of Children's Television Workshop (which created <I>Sesame Street</I>) and 
a professor at Harvard University's School of Education.</P> 	
<P>	PBS executives try to have it both ways. On the one hand, they shun commercial 
television because of its commercializing influence on children. On the other hand, those 
with the franchises for PBS shows enjoy exclusive advantages no other toy vendors can 
claim--for they carry the noble title, "educational," and the PBS seal.</P>

<H3>Big-Bucks Programming</H3>
<P>	In public broadcasting, the democratic institution of Congress, which is 
responsible to the taxpayer, relinquishes the power to approve programs to an unelected 
bureaucracy. In deciding who gets grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has 
depended on judgments from expert panels of industry insiders, rather than the board of 
directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Again, the principle is 
clear: CPB should be accountable neither to the marketplace nor to the taxpayers and 
their representatives.</P>
<P>	In fiscal year 1993, CPB distributed some $289.4 million to 200 affiliated 
television stations and 490 affiliated radio stations. That was about 14 percent of the 
total--about $2 billion--spent on public radio and television. By way of comparison, in 
fiscal year 1993, CBS was the number-one rated television network in the country, with a 
prime-time Nielsen rating of 14.0, and earned broadcasting revenues of about $2.3 
billion. At that time, public television stations spent about $1.2 billion for an average 
prime time rating of under 2.5. In other words, CBS was paying $164 million for every 
ratings point in 1993, while PBS was paying about $480 million per ratings point.</P> 
<P>	Were PBS viewers three times as valuable as network audiences, or was the 
federally-subsidized network simply paying three times as much to reach the same 
people? Rather than reaching the most people for the least amount of money--a 
democratic mission--public broadcasting strives to reach a select group of people, no 
matter the cost. Such targeting of consumers happens all the time in the commercial 
marketplace. But it's hard to justify for a democratically funded organization.</P> 
<P>	This phenomenon of elitist and parochial disdain, then, begins to explain the 
unwillingness of the public broadcasting lobby to engage in the debate over the specifics 
of public broadcasting. The problem is not lack of money. It is simple snobbery on the 
part of public broadcasters. Federal tax dollars are considered "clean." Private donations, 
sponsorship, or underwriting is considered "dirty."</P>
<P>	Could the public broadcasting system become self-sufficient? Of course. The 
money is already there, within the same system that has been growing for more than 27 
years. As President Clinton himself told Brian Lamb in a C-Span interview during the 
1992 campaign, the public broadcasting system is pretty healthy, and he "didn't know 
that we needed to spend any more money on it." The president's own budget line item for 
CPB has been essentially frozen since he took office, and his administration actually 
proposed a 6 percent cut for public broadcasting in its 1996 budget.</P>

<H3>Drawing from the Well</H3>
<P>	Where could taxpayer funding find a substitute? Any number of combinations and 
permutations of replacement funders spring to mind.</P>
<UL><LI>  More than 5.2 million members contribute some $391 million annually to public-
broadcasting stations. That's about $75 each. Since public-broadcasting membership 
represents the top stratum of the socioeconomic ladder, were each subscriber simply to 
pledge $56 additional each year, it would yield public broadcasting $290 million--the 
entire federal share. Not too difficult a challenge, considering that the average net worth 
of the membership of WETA, a PBS station in Washington, D.C., is $627,000, according 
to <I>USA Today</I>.<BR> 
<LI>  The private foundations that support public broadcasting are among the richest entities 
in America today. They include the multi-billion-dollar Ford, MacArthur, Warhol, and 
Rockefeller foundations. Certainly these vast accumulators of wealth could increase their 
contributions to public broadcasting as well. The Ford Foundation alone has a $6 billion 
endowment. If public broadcasting were a genuine priority for them, private foundations 
could make up the $290 million annual appropriation from their own bank accounts.<BR>
<LI>  The commercial radio and television networks that benefit from the fact that PBS and 
National Public Radio serve to crowd out potential competitors could fund public 
broadcasting in the same way that cable companies pay for C-Span, as a cost of doing 
business and a way of increasing corporate goodwill. Split between NBC, ABC, CBS, 
and Fox, the sum required would be about $75 million each, and no doubt the networks 
could barter programs onto the schedule as part of the contribution. This system was 
actually used by Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain to establish Channel 
Four--originally proposed as taxpayer-supported. A private corporation owned by the 
other commercial television companies and known collectively as Independent Television 
(ITV), Channel Four was so successful at nurturing alternative and diverse television 
programming that it has actually begun to support itself, even attracting commercial 
sponsors. It frequently draws better than the BBC's arts and cultural channel, BBC-2.<BR>
<LI>  Hollywood stars are quite vocal in their support of public broadcasting, lining up to 
testify at congressional hearings. But they haven't yet confessed that they are in a better 
position than most to make up for the federal share. Entertainer Barbara Streisand, who 
makes $10 million to $15 million per picture while warning about the deleterious effects 
of cutting public television funding, admitted in a recent speech at Harvard that 
Americans spend about $340 billion annually on the entertainment industry. A donation 
from the Hollywood moguls totaling only one-half of 1 percent of those receipts would 
amount to more than five times the federal share to all of public broadcasting.</UL>
<P>	What's going on here? Are CPB and its offspring, NPR and PBS, hapless paupers 
dependent on the federal dole? Or are they sophisticated business ventures whose profit 
potential remains untapped? Which is it? Although Streisand denounces conservatives for 
emphasizing the private sector, she has chosen to work with commercial Hollywood 
studios and record companies. Stars like Streisand, along with other "arts advocates" 
from groups like the Creative Coalition such as Blair Brown, Christopher Reeve, Ron 
Silver, and William and Alec Baldwin, could agree to donate their time to do one 
television special a year for public broadcasting. They could get their Hollywood friends 
to join them, and the programming could be used as pledge specials. If such stars 
appeared for free on PBS, their shows could be used for fundraising, much like <I>The Three 
Tenors</I> is used now.</P>
<P>	How much money could Hollywood raise for public broadcasting? You do the 
math: Streisand brought in a cool $1 million for then-candidate Bill Clinton at a 1992 
fundraiser. In 1986, she raised $1.5 million for a group of six Democratic congressional 
candidates. Forbes magazine estimates Streisand earned $52 million in 1994.</P> 
<P>	Other big-money show-business stars (according to Forbes) include Oprah 
Winfrey, who made $53 million last year, Bill Cosby ($34 million), Harrison Ford ($27 
million), Bruce Willis ($19 million), Tom Hanks ($16 million), Kevin Costner ($15 
million), Tom Cruise ($14 million), Eddie Murphy ($13 million), and Roseanne ($13 
million). The richest of them all is Steven Spielberg. Forbes magazine estimates 
Spielberg makes $165 million to $170 million annually.</P>
<P>	We know where at least some of their money goes. Spielberg donated $161,000 to 
Democrats running for Congress. Five studio political-action committees gave $866,798 
to Democrats (compared to $187,050 to Republicans). MCA chairman Lew Wasserman 
gave more than $230,000 to Democrats in 1992, compared to $6,000 to Republicans. In 
1992 Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg (now partnered with Spielberg and music mogul David 
Geffen in a new company) gave over $100,000 to Democrats and $2,000 to Republicans. 
Disney's Michael Eisner gave $19,000 to Democrats and $3,000 to Republicans. Eisner, 
it should be remembered, sold almost $200 million worth of Disney stock after the 
election of Bill Clinton because he feared higher taxes. That one transaction was worth 
almost the entire amount the Corporation for Public Broadcasting spent on PBS in 1992.</P>
<P>   With the biggest names from the silver screen appearing on PBS, there is no question 
but audiences would rise to the occasion. In fact, PBS President Duggan, in a speech to 
affiliates last year, said he would love to have a Barbra Streisand special on PBS for 
pledge week. No doubt CD sales alone would make a startling contribution to the PBS 
budget. Yet so far, Barbra is still operating in the commercial sphere. Why?</P>
<P>	Underwriters would surely love to be associated with top stars, and so private 
support would no doubt more than make up the federal shortfall. Indeed, producers like 
Norman Lear (founder of People for the American Way) might even agree to produce 
series for PBS and donate their fees as contributions, with residual rights reverting to 
PBS.</P>
<UL><LI>  As Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) showed, the telephone companies seem to be willing 
to provide free over-the-air educational and cultural programming in exchange for the 
right to enter the broadcasting business. Certainly regulators and corporations could 
arrange to make duplicate television stations available for other purposes while 
maintaining the core mission of public broadcasting as a cost of doing business.<BR>
<LI>  Cable companies like Jones Intercable also appear ready to step into the breach, 
providing public-service broadcasting in order to expand their activities. Such offers 
should be seriously considered. Another cablecaster expressing interest is the Discovery 
Network, which also runs The Learning Channel.<BR> 
<LI>  Finally, PBS could strike better deals with the producers of <I>Barney, Sesame Street, The 
Civil War, The Frugal Gourmet</I>, and the dozens of other extremely lucrative programs 
with merchandising tie-ins carried on the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves. Valuable air time 
is now given away for free to these producers, who know what to do with it. Producers of 
<I>Sesame Street</I>, for example, use the subsidized exposure to sell $800 million worth of 
some 5,000 licensed products annually. The show's producer, Children's Television 
Workshop, has about $70 million in stocks and bonds and pays its top executives more 
than $300,000 a year. Barney was estimated to sell about $500 million worth of products 
in 1993, and <I>Shining Time Station</I> garnered $250 million. Intelligent licensing deals alone 
could probably make up the lost federal subsidy from products connected to PBS's 
children's programming.</P></UL>
<P>	The recent announcement that CPB would get a share of <I>Barney's</I> net profits is 
unfortunately mere window dressing. In show business, only gross points are real dollars, 
and CPB does not share in the gross under any known contract. One reason that 
producers connected to public broadcasting have enjoyed such sweet arrangements is that 
the system is federally subsidized, There is no incentive to strike the most profitable deal. 
As media critic Brent Bozell noted in recent congressional testimony, it is very hard for 
public-broadcasting executives to go up to Capitol Hill and ask for increasing amounts of 
taxpayer money if they are making millions from selling T-shirts.</P>
<P>	And they are. The <I>Wireless</I> and <I>Signals</I> catalogs produced by Boston's WGBH 
and Minnesota Public Radio, for example, yield about $150 million in total. On the East 
Coast, PBS stations are partners in the Learningsmith chain of stores, pioneered by 
WGBH and WETA. On the West Coast, KCET owns a chain, The Store of Knowledge. 
Both are private firms that benefit from the cross-promotion, advertising, and corporate 
goodwill of their association with PBS. But their books are sealed to the public, exempted 
from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
<P>	Public broadcasting can survive, indeed thrive, without a penny of scarce taxpayer 
dollars. There are many alternative sources of revenue, from station members, to 
corporate underwriters, to alternative programmers. Better deals can be struck with those 
who are exploiting the present system. The opposition to self-sufficiency is based not on 
practical considerations, but rather on an ideological commitment to the role of the 
federal government as the guarantor of culture and education--much as in Britain, where 
there are jams and jellies carrying the emblem, "by appointment to Her Majesty."</P> 
<P>	That is why the current debate over public broadcasting is so fierce. It is a 
struggle between those with an "unconstrained vision," in the words of economist 
Thomas Sowell, of an all-powerful central government run by an educated elite that does 
everything, including decide what is cultural and educational television. On the other side 
are those who feel a commitment to limited government. As Representative John Kasich 
(R-OH) recently put it, "the vast majority of people we hear from say, as we go into the 
21st century, government doesn't need to run a television station."</P>

Popular Culture.</B></I>

      This year my Heritage lectures have been concerned with American
political errors during the closing decade of the twentieth century --
errors of the Republican party, of the Democratic party, and general
blunders in foreign relations. This evening, ladies and gentlemen, I
conclude my lecture series for Anno Domini 1991 with some desultory
remarks on the possibility of redemption from error -- and, in
particular, whether our rising generation in these United States may
find it possible to "redeem the time, redeem the dream" -- to borrow
T.S. Eliot's line.
<P>
      First, a few words about this concept "generation." To generate
is to beget; to bring into existence. In popular usage we mean by a
generation a large number of persons brought into existence about the
same time; in the same year, perhaps, or possibly in the same decade.
Thomas Jefferson promulgated the somewhat vague concept of every
"generation" of people making its own choices; of the generation of
the living not binding the generation which soon would come into
existence.
<P>
      Yet, this notion cannot be sustained logically or pragmatically.
For really there exists no line of demarcation parting alleged
generations of men and women. Every minute, as I address you, babies
are being born somewhere; and during the same minutes, old people are
dying in every land. 
<P>
      Actually, society is an intricate continuity of lives, not a
mere succession of human beings resembling the flies of a summer,
generation unable to link with generation. It is possible for me to
say truthfully that six generations of my family have lived in our
house at the village of Mecosta, in Michigan; but those alleged
"generations" have much overlapped; at no time over the past twelve
decades has only a single generation lived in our family home. The
notion of distinct generations, then, each generation monopolizing the
earth during its brief span of existence, is merely a convenient
fiction.
<P>
      Nevertheless, we employ that useful fiction frequently,
particularly with reference to literary and political movements. Thus
Spaniards refer to the "Generation of '98," made up of literary movers
and shakers whose convictions were formed at the time of Spain's naval
and military defeats that caused the loss of the Philippines, Cuba,
and Puerto Rico. Thus, in Britain, Wyndham Lewis referred to the "men
of 1914" -- certain innovating writers who began to appear in print
about the beginning of the First World War: Eliot, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, T.E. Hulme, and Lewis himself. And thus, a very few years ago,
here at The Heritage Foundation, Mr. Ben Hart introduced the concept
of three generations of American conservatives that have exercised
influence since the late 1940s, say. Tonight, I address especially the
third of those hypothetical generations.
<P>
      By the First Generation, I take it, Mr. Hart means men and women
of politics and letters who began to come to public attention about
the end of the 'Forties and the beginning of the 'Fifties; who, most
of them, had grown aware of the sunken state of the world about them,
some time between, or during, the First World War and the Great
Depression. Among such persons who grew up with a conservative
inclination were Richard Weaver, Francis Wilson, Robert Nisbet, Daniel
Boorstin, William Buckley, and your servant; one might add William
Yandell Elliott (a little older) and William McGovern, and others who
were active so early as 1933, say. There would be regarded as
belonging to an earlier "generation," both in point of years and of
thought, such persons as T.S. Eliot, Irving Babbitt, Paul Elmer More,
and George Santayana. Among public men, Senators Robert A. Taft and
Carl Curtis, say, would be classified as members of the pre-
conservative generation, I suppose, their activity having occurred
mostly during the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman;
while Senator Barry Goldwater, a relatively late conservative champion
in arms, would be classed with the First Generation conservatives, I
suppose, in Mr. Hart's scheme. You will perceive, ladies and
gentlemen, that membership in a hypothetical generation does not
necessarily coincide with the date of one's nativity.
<P>
      The Second Generation of conservatives, in Mr. Hart's
categories, consists of persons of varying ages who were attracted to
conservative causes, or began to style themselves conservatives,
sometime after 1953, in which year The Conservative Mind was
published. Thus Mr. Irving Kristol, almost so old as is your servant,
is classified as Second Generation; so is my wife Annette Yvonne
Cecilie Courtmanche Kirk, the first secretary at the organizational
meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, twenty-one years younger than
myself. I take it that Dr. Jeffrey Hart, Mr. Ben Hart's father, is
Second Generation -- although very nearly meeting the requirements for
Generation I; that Mr. M. Stanton Evans, despite his many years of
active duty in the conservative array, is a Second Generation
legionnaire; while Mr. Ben Hart himself, and his spouse are field
marshals of the Third Generation. 
<P>
      But, more subtle distinctions and classifications I leave to Mr.
Gregory Wolfe, now engaged in preparing an Encyclopedia of the Right.
So far as public men go, permit me to suggest merely that such
conservatively-inclined gentlemen as Senator Richard Lugar, Governor
John Engler, and Mr. Patrick Buchanan seem to fall within the Second
Generation fold. In brief, nowadays First Generation conservatives --
such of them as have not passed unto a less troubled realm of being --
usually are people in their seventies or their sixties; Second
Generation conservatives, most of them, in their fifties or forties;
Third Generation conservatives, in their thirties or their twenties --
or even in their teens. Pass we then to these ladies and gentlemen of
the Third Generations.

<P>

      Few of the Third Generation folk retain personal memories of the
Disaster of 1964 -- that is, the defeat of Barry Goldwater's
presidential candidacy, the centralizing follies of President
Johnson's "Great Society," the foretaste of ruin in Vietnam, the
loathsome and destructive antics of the crazy black militants and the
crazier young white radicals. The present members of the Third
Generation were reared when the hearts of our great American cities
already were dismal and rotten; when addiction to narcotics plagued
every social class; when public schools, with few honorable
exceptions, offered next to nothing for mind and conscience; when
Demon TV offered something for every taste but good taste; when
promiscuity and sexual perversity demanded recognition as normality;
when it was unwise to walk the streets o'nights; when shrieking mobs
dominated what had been the grove and halls of Academe; when
altercations in Washington made it almost impossible to conduct the
regular business of government; when American life seemed confusion
worse confounded; when one came to appreciate the mordant aphorism of
Albert Jay Nock: "American society is like German beer; dregs at the
bottom, scum at the top."
<P>
      In short, the conservative Third Generation have not known a
tranquil and pleasant and confident America. They scarcely can imagine
a time, not many decades past, when it was the happy evening diversion
of families or couples to stroll in New York's Central Park of
Detroit's Belle Isle Park. They have little knowledge even of the
neighborhood grocery or butcher-shop, the corner drug-store with its
soda-fountain; for them is the leviathan shopping-mall, commercial
collectivism. They have experienced little of continuity; the
expectation of change has been greater far. Yet, they know that much
remains to conserve, and that much ought to be restored.
<P>
      In one respect, but in that respect only, the task of the
conservative of 1991 looms less oppressive than was the task of the
conservative of 1951, when my first book was published. I mean that
the grim menace of the Soviet Union no longer hangs over us. Seventy
years were required for the Communist ideology to work its own ruin,
so that it fell to pieces at a good-natured push, quite bloodless,
from Mr. Ronald Reagan. Always will there be wars and rumors of war;
yet from the Soviet terror we have been saved, so that the Third
Generation conservatives may address their energies to something more
fundamental than resisting the armed doctrine called Marxism.
<P>
      What, then, is the mission of Third Generation conservatives,
young men and women who seek to preserve the Permanent Things, those
elements in human existence that were not born yesterday? It is not to
promulgate a "conservative ideology": for conservatism is the negation
of ideology. Ideology is an attempt to govern all life by political
slogans; while American conservatives believe that no mere political
formulas can make a people content. Conservatives take for their guide
in politics what Edmund Burke called "the wisdom of the species": that
is, the experience of human beings in community, extending over many
centuries. Thus, American conservatism is a cast of mind and
character, not a neat body of political abstractions. Ideology is
political fanaticism, an endeavor to rule the world by rigorous
abstract dogmata. The dogmata of an abstract "democratic capitalism"
may be mischievous as the dogmata of Marx.
<P>
      It is possible to describe certain attitudes that make up
America's conservative mentality, even though not all Americans could
express coherently their belief in such general principles, and
although some conservatives would dissent from one or more of the
general assumptions or principles I now mention.
<P>
      First, belief in some transcendent order in the universe, some
law that is more than human: a religious understanding of the human
condition, if you will; a belief in enduring moral norms. As the
national pledge of allegiance puts it, "One nation under God.... "
<P>
      Second, opposition to totalist ideology and the totalist
political order. The American conservative rejects the notion of a
future earthly paradise -- which the ideologue promises to attain.
<P>
      Third, confidence in the American Constitution -- both the
written national Constitution and the intricate fabric of custom,
belief, and habit that makes up the underlying "unwritten"
constitution of a nation-state. Many decisions of the Supreme Court in
recent decades are bitterly resented; nevertheless, attachment to the
Constitution itself remains strong.
<P>
      Fourth, maintenance of the rights of private property and of a
free or competitive economy, as contrasted with a directed or
socialist economy. This healthy prejudice persists despite the
increasing consolidation of business and industry into large
conglomerations or oligopolies.
<P>
      Fifth, suspicion of central political direction, and preference
for state and local powers: insistence upon private rights. 
<P>
      Sixth, a deep-rooted patriotism, joined to uneasiness at
"entangling alliances"; this latter attitude, nevertheless, modified
by determination to resist totalist powers that menace the American
national interest.
<P>
      Seventh, an awareness that change is not identical with healthy
improvement; a relish for the American past; a genuine preference for
the old and tried.
<P>
      Such is the consensus of that very large body of Americans who
choose to call themselves conservative in their politics. Within this
crowd of conservative citizens exist various factions, each
emphasizing some aspect or another of the general conservative
attitude. There exists no "party line" to which conservatives of one
persuasion or another are compelled to conform.
<P>
      Retrenchment and Reform. With such assumptions as those I
outlined just now, America enters upon an age of retrenchment and
reform in economic concerns. If American prosperity is to endure,
public expenditure and taxation must be kept in check. Conservative
economic measures must be employed to prevent inflation of the
currency and to reduce the national deficit -- a hard necessity of
which the general public is becoming aware.
<P>
      In this present era when the Soviet power fades away, the
majority of the American public seem disillusioned with social
experiments and with the rapid pace of change; with excessive
governmental regulation; with cities fallen to ruin and tormented by
crime; with subsidized abortion, with judicial usurping of power, with
a permissive indulgence of license and criminality, with the blight of
pornography, with the whole liberal climate of opinion. For the next
half-century at least, I suggest, the American democracy will tend to
reject those politicians who still indulge dreams of Lotos-land.
Liberalism has undone itself.
<P>
      There have been ages when custom and inertia have lain
insufferably upon humankind; and such an age may come to pass again;
but such is not our age. Ours is an era when the moral and social
heritage of many centuries of civilization stands in imminent peril
from the forces of vertiginous indiscriminate change. Resistance to
the folly of such change is the primary duty of the Third Generation
conservative.
<P>
      The continuing American conservative movement, if it is to be
carried on tolerably well, must work within the minds and the
consciences of a good many young men and women. I do not think that
this work of conservation can be accomplished by any particular group;
certainly not by any idealizing of "business rule." I trust that
Americans will conserve a market economy and all the better features
of an economy marked by volition. But Americans will conserve such
advantages only if they conserve something higher and older: that is,
a society of tradition, diversity, and the life of spirit.

<P>

      The critic Eliseo Vivas wrote once that "It is one of the marks
of human decency to be ashamed of having been born into the twentieth
century." Spiritually and politically, the twentieth century has been
a time of decadence. Yet, as that century draws near to its close, we
may remind ourselves that ages of decadence often have been followed
by ages of renewal.
<P>
      What can you do to commence redeeming the time, to conserve the
Permanent Things, to raise up the human condition to a level less
unworthy of what Pico della Mirandola called "the dignity of man"?
Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are; by improving one
human unit, yourself, and helping your neighbor.
<P>
      You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in
redeeming the time: what you need for that task is moral imagination
joined to right reason. It is not by wealth or fame that you will be
rewarded, probably, but by eternal moments: those moments of one's
existence in which, as T.S. Eliot put it, time and the timeless
intersect. In such moments, you may discover the answer to that
immemorial question which now and again enters the head of any
reflective man or woman, "What is all this? What is this world that
surrounds us, and why are we here?"
<P>
      Yes, what is all this? Why, this present realm of being, in
which your consciousness and my consciousness are aware of reality, is
a divine creation; and you and I are put into it as into a testing-
ground -- into an arena, if you will. As the German writer Stefan
Andres put it, "We are God's Utopia." You and I are moral beings meant
to accomplish something good, in a small way or a big, in this
temporal world.
<P>
      The Roman Stoics taught that some things in life are good, and
some are evil; but that the great majority of life's happenings are
neither good nor evil, but indifferent merely. Wealth is a thing
indifferent, and so is poverty; fame is a thing indifferent, and so is
obscurity. Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face
against the things evil; and by doing God's will, said the Stoics,
find that peace which passes all understanding.
<P>
      True Authority. How do we know such postulates, religious and
philosophical, to be true? Why, by the common sense and ancient assent
of mankind -- that is, by hearkening to the voice of true authority,
the voice of what G.K. Chesterton called "the democracy of the dead."
I think of what John Henry Newman wrote about Authority in 1846:
"Conscience is an authority; the Bible is an authority; such is the
Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such are
hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical
memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs;
such are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions." Believe what wise
men and women, over the centuries, have believed in matters of faith
and morals, and you will have a firm footing on which to stand while
the winds of doctrine howl about you.
<P>
      This counsel that I offer you, conservatives of the Third
Generation, will not guarantee your winning any of the glittering
prizes of modern society; for those too are among the things
indifferent, and some of them are among the things evil. Yet, this
advice from a conservative of the First Generation who has seen a good
deal of the world conceivably may help you on the track toward certain
eternal moments, when time and the timeless intersect. What happens at
such timeless moments, such occurrences in eternity? Why, quiet
perfect events, usually; among them the act of telling stories to
one's children, or of reading aloud to them.
<P>
      What is all this -- this confused American world of glittering
material things and of appalling personal and social decay? I have
found it to be a real world, sun-lit despite its vices; a real world
in which one may develop and exercise one's potential virtues of
courage, prudence, temperance, and justice; one's faith, hope, and
charity. You will take your tumbles in this world, which can be rough
enough in our age, Lord knows; but also you may enjoy your triumphs.
It is a world in which there is so much needing to be done that nobody
ought to be bored. For young Americans especially, this is still a
world of high opportunity.
<P>
      All this creation about us is the garden that we erring humans
were appointed to tend. Plant some flowers in it, if you can, and pull
some weeds. If need be, draw your sword to defend it. Do not fancy
that a sorry policy of Looking Out for Number One will lead you to
Heaven's gate. Do not fail to remind yourselves that consciousness is
a perpetual adventure. Do not ignore the wisdom of the ages, the
democracy of the dead. Such, ladies and gentlemen, is the counsel of
this survivor from the First Generation.
<P>
      Those of us who aspire to conserve our inherited order and
justice and freedom, our patrimony of wisdom and beauty and loving-
kindness, have a hard row to hoe nowadays -- that I confess. But, I am
heartened from time to time by a stanza from Chesterton's long poem,
The Ballad of the White Horse. Chesterton is describing the prophets
of doom, who tell us that nothing in life is permanent; that all is
lost, or is being lost, in our culture; that we totter on the brink of
an abyss. Such prophets of doom think themselves wise. Chesterton has
in mind the typical intellectuals of the twentieth century, but he
calls them the wise men of the East. Here I give you Chesterton's
lines: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The wise men know what wicked thingsAre written on the
      sky,They trim sad lamps, they touch sad stringsHearing the
      heavy purple wings,Where the forgotten seraph kingsStill
      plot how God shall die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Such despairing souls, though possessed perhaps of much
intelligence, in truth are not wise. In our time, ladies and
gentlemen, many voices have been declaring that life is not worth
living. A multitude of writers and professors and publicists and
members of the class of persons commonly styled "intellectuals"
gloomily instruct us that we human beings are no better than naked
apes, and that consciousness is an illusion. Such persons insist that
life has no purpose but sensual gratification; that the brief span of
one's physical existence is the be-all and end-all. Such twentieth-
century sophists have created in the murky caves of the intellect an
Underworld; and they endeavor to convince us all that there exists no
sun -- that the world of wonder and of hope exists nowhere, and never
did exist. Plato knew just such sophists in his age. Those doctrines
of despair, the rising generation of conservatives must confront and
refute.

<P>
      My counsels so far may have seemed somewhat ghostly, no doubt.
But, I have learned from life in various regions of the world, and
under differing circumstances, that it is the life of spirit which
truly matters; and that the Permanent Thing most worthy of
preservation is an understanding of the human soul. The conscious
conservative defends the soul of humankind against the corrosive
materialism and sensuality of twentieth-century will and appetite.
<P>
      Let me turn, however, to the art of worldly wisdom. I can offer,
too, some practical advice. How, for instance, you may ask me, does
one contrive to forge ahead in practical political life in this
sprawling American democracy, with the intention of conducting a
conservative defense of the Permanent Things?
<P>
      Why, ordinarily it is fairly simple to make one's way in the
American political structure. American political parties could not
function without volunteers. Volunteer, and you will be gladly
accepted, such as you being urgently needed; you will find, indeed,
that a number of your fellow-volunteers are rather peculiar people,
almost Outcasts of Poker Flat, but welcome in a local political
organization (if not welcome in many other circles) because, whatever
their peculiarities, they are willing to work for the common cause.
<P> 
      If you are an intelligent and adept volunteer, you will be made
much of by the party leaders and faithful, and will be advanced in
your responsibilities. You may be asked to be a delegate, whether
elected or appointed. If chosen delegate, arrive early at caucus or
convention. When the meeting proper commences, endeavor to sit at the
chairman's right hand; then others may take you for his right-hand
man. There are many little arts by which one may gain ascendancy over
the minds of one's political colleagues. But, the great necessity is
to have acquired previously a fund of knowledge and some mastery of
rhetoric -- and honest principles. That is why I sometimes advise
undergraduates not to expend their time in street demonstrations, but
instead to study. If Karl Marx, instead of reading books within, had
spent his days parading round and round the outside of the British
museum, a placard "Down with the bourgeois!" tacked to a sandwich-
board over his shoulders -- why, had he been so foolish, the world
would be so much better off today.
<P>
      Redeem the time, redeem the dream -- in ways mundane as well as
ways spiritual. If you should resolve really to take a vigorous part
in restoring the American Republic, choose your vocation accordingly,
so that the work by which you gain your livelihood, and the work by
which you help to redeem the time, may coincide. Take to the law -- if
you can endure the boredom of our law schools nowadays. Or, take to
serious journalism -- or, for broader and more immediate influence, to
television and radio. You may accomplish some reform of the American
mind through book-publishing. Or, supposing you possess fortitude
sufficient to fight your way through our PC graduate schools, aspire
after a college professorship that might enable you to counteract the
freaks who appear to dominate the typical campus nowadays. Or take to
pedagogy, if you can surmount the dull obstacles to certification as a
teacher. If you feel a religious calling -- why, in no way might you
accomplish more to restore meaning to lives in the twenty-first
century. And, the best way to insure a Fourth Generation of
intelligent young conservatives is to beget children, and rear them
well: the wise parent is the conservator of ancient truths. As Edmund
Burke put it, "We learn to love the little platoon we belong to in
society." The institution most essential to conserve is the family.
<P>
      If we aspire to redeem this age of ours, so far gone in
decadence -- well, we have no time to lose before commencing our
endeavors. Fixed to the walls of the entrance hall of my house are
masks of the archaic god Cronos, in his role of Time the Devourer; his
half-leonine, half-human face bares his fangs, which the ancient
Greeks dreaded. Those masks serve to remind me daily that the night
cometh when no man shall work, and that I had best turn back to my
productive typewriter.
<P>
      Yet, Time is not a devourer only. With proper use of the life-
span that is allotted to us, we may accomplish our part in redeeming
our era from its vices, terrors, and catastrophic errors. With
Demosthenes, ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you to think. For only if
you think soundly at this juncture in your lives will you be enabled
to act decisively in those years when you have achieved some
influence.
<P>
      I conclude with an exhortation which Orestes Brownson, that
redoubtable conservative reformer, scholar, and journalist, delivered
at Dartmouth College in 1843. His topic was "The Scholar's Mission."
He concluded, as follows, his charge to the rising generation:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Ask not what your age wants, but what it needs, not what it
      will reward, but what, without which, it cannot be saved;
      and that go and do; and find your reward in the
      consciousness of having done your duty, and above all in
      the reflection, that you have been accounted to suffer
      somewhat for mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      In the later 'Sixties, many of the rising generation thought it
amusing to pull down what earlier generations had patiently built up;
their zeal extended even to the burning of university libraries. In
the early 'Nineties, I hope and trust, many of the rising generation
will find it satisfying to restore and redeem their patrimony from
earlier times -- and so save the world from suicide. That labor will
require cleverness and courage. Some of you present here tonight may
choose it for your vocation.

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>
     Congress this week will vote on final passage of a crime bill
which purportedly puts 100,000 new police officers on the beat, funds
the construction of new prison space, and directs billions in federal
funds toward "crime prevention." In reality, the bill provides funding
to increase the number of uniformed police officers by only 3 percent
nationwide, places a huge new unfunded mandate on the states, and will
finance an expensive new layer of social welfare programs.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Specifically, the bill:
<P>
     Guarantees full funding for only 20,000 permanent new cops over
     the next six years, or one-fifth the number claimed by the bill's
     supporters. This is equivalent to adding about one new officer to
     every police department in the nation.
<P>
     Assumes state and local governments will pick up as much as $33
     billion in new expenditures over the next six years if the bill
     is to meet the target of 100,000 officers.
<P>
     Gives the Attorney General the discretion to decide which cities
     and states receive the Community Policing funds. This invites
     handouts to politically connected big-city mayors and
     politicians.
<P>
     Adds at least $8.7 billion in new social spending, and nearly 30
     new social programs, to a welfare system which has cost taxpayers
     over $5 trillion since the War on Poverty was created in 1965.
<P>
     Will put two new social workers on the street for every new cop
     it fully funds.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In short, the crime bill turns out to promise more cops on
America's streets. In reality, it means few cops, a big tab for
cities, and plenty of new social programs and social workers.
<P>
<B> WHY THE NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP </B>
<P>
     The most publicized portion of the crime bill is the $8.845
billion Community Policing grant program. The White House claims this
measure will put 100,000 new cops on the street over the next six
years. But a closer inspection of this claim reveals that the figures
simply do not add up.
<P>
     The intention of the Community Policing grant program in reality
is to provide "seed" money to local governments to hire 100,000 new
police officers, not to fully fund these positions. So the bill
assumes that once these new officers have been hired with Washington's
help, state and local governments will find the billions of new
dollars to keep them on permanently. The bill actually provides just
one-fifth of the funds needed to keep 100,000 new cops on the street
for the next six years, leaving the states with the massive cost of
fulfilling the bill's promise. Even worse, the bill allows local
governments to use some of these Community Policing funds for purposes
other than hiring new cops, so there is no guarantee that even 20,000
new officers' positions will actually be funded and cops hired.
<P>
     Based on salary levels for police officers and overhead costs
reported by police departments, the cost of putting one new cop on the
street for one year in a high-crime area is estimated at between
$70,000 to $80,000. (According to the Census Bureau's March 1993
Current Population Survey, the nation-wide average salary for a police
officer is $36,366, and for larger cities the figure is closer to
$40,000. A fiscal officer in the San Francisco Police Department
reported in a telephone interview that the actual cost of putting a
new officer on the street is at least $71,000. Salary and benefits for
this officer are some $61,000 and the cost of recruiting, examination,
and background checks is at least $10,000. Moreover, for every three
new officers hired a typical department must purchase one new police
vehicle. This and other administrative costs are not included in the
above figure. These one-time costs mean the costs of the typical
officer rise to over $71,000. In addition, quotas and other hiring
practices -- which are mandated in the crime bill -- will make the
cost of hiring new officers very expensive, reports the financial
officer in the San Francisco Department. To hire 50 qualified officers
meeting the quota standards, that department assumes it must recruit,
screen, and test at least 200 applicants.) Therefore the actual cost
of putting 100,000 cops on the street is at least $7 billion per year,
or a minimum of $42 billion over the six-year life of the bill. But
the crime bill provides only $8.845 billion over the six-year period,
or $1.475 billion per year. Thus in order to permanently place 100,000
new police officers on America's streets over the next six years,
state and local governments who apply for Community Policing grants
will have to supplement Washington's contribution with some $33
billion of their own funds.
<P>
     This highly publicized crime bill provides only one-fifth the
necessary funding for 100,000 permanent new police. If cities do not
cut back on other services or raise taxes, the funds provided in the
bill can keep at most just 20,000 permanent cops on the street over
the next six years. There are some 600,000 uniformed police officers
nationwide, so 20,000 represents an increase of just 3 percent, or the
equivalent of adding just one new officer for every police department
in the nation. (But the impact of this additional officer will be
slight. Because of rotational schedules, most large city police
departments require at least five officers to cover a beat in a
24-hour period.)
<P>
     Another way to look at this financial sleight-of-hand is to
calculate how much funding the bill provides per police officer per
year. On average, the bill authorizes $1.475 billion per year for
100,000 new officers. This amounts to just $14,750 per cop per year --
roughly the poverty level for a family of four. Since it is ridiculous
to think that quality police officers could be hired for minimum wage
salaries, state and local governments would have to absorb the
remaining roughly $60,000 per year cost of hiring and keeping each of
these new cops. To meet the 100,000 target, local governments would be
responsible for some $6 billion per year in total new costs.
<P>
     Supporters of the bill no doubt will argue that local governments
will not be stuck with a big tab. They might say, for instance, that
the bill caps at $75,000 the amount local governments may spend
initially to hire a new cop and it also limits the federal share of
this cost at 75 percent. But this changes the real-world scenario very
little. If, for instance, Chicago were to spend $75,000 to hire a new
cop and contribute 25 percent of this cost, the federal share of this
new hiree would be over $56,000. Now, dividing this amount into the
$1.47 billion the bill provides annually for new police would mean it
funds only 26,222 permanent new cops. This is still far short of the
100,000 promised.
<P>
     However the computation is made, the result is the same: the bill
actually funds only a small fraction of the promised new officers.
<P>
     An often overlooked detail, moreover, is the fact that the bill
does not require local governments to use all of these Community
Policing funds to hire new cops. Indeed, 15 percent of these funds can
be used for a variety of social or community activities only
tangentially related to law enforcement, and 20 percent of the
remaining funds can be spent on equipment, computers, and overtime for
existing officers.
<P>
     For example, cities may use the funds in the following ways:
<P>
To enhance police officers' "conflict resolution, mediation, problem
   solving, service, and other skills needed to work in partnership
   with members of the community";
<P>
To "develop new technologies to assist State and local law enforcement
   agencies in reorienting the emphasis of their activities from
   reacting to crime to preventing crime"; and
<P>
To "develop and establish new administrative and managerial systems to
   facilitate the adoption of community-oriented policing as an
   organization-wide philosophy."
<P>
     Cities actually have an incentive to use Community Policing funds
for other purposes because such programs will not add the future costs
of a police officer's pension and other benefits to the municipal
budget. Spending the money on items other than new police officers
means a city does not have to find ways of covering a funding
shortfall after the first year of the bill. Such an incentive system
virtually guarantees that fewer than 20,000 new cops will be hired,
let alone the purported 100,000.
<P>
     Supporters of this bill, moreover, have been less than
forthcoming in noting that 75 percent of these Community Policing
funds can be distributed at the discretion of the Attorney General.
This means that there is no guarantee that the funds will be targeted
toward cities that are in greatest need of new police. It does mean,
however, that the Administration may play politics with these funds
and reward politically loyal mayors and local politicians, rather than
addressing areas of greatest need. (Last year, Congress passed an
emergency supplemental bill which included $150 million in aid to hire
2,000 new police officers. Nearly 45 percent of these funds went to
four states: California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.)

<P>
<B> SOCIAL WELFARE PORK </B>
<P>
     Roughly $8.7 billion of the funds in the crime bill is dedicated
to creating nearly 30 new "crime prevention" programs ($7.4 billion
for programs identified as "prevention" and $1.3 billion for new "Drug
Courts"). It turns out that many of these new programs are little more
than social welfare pork barrel, adding a new layer of programs onto a
welfare system that already costs taxpayers at all levels of
government over $310 billion per year. (Robert Rector, "A
Comprehensive Urban Policy: How to Fix Welfare and Revitalize
America's Inner Cities," Heritage Foundation Memo To: President-Elect
Clinton No. 12, January 18, 1993. p. 17.) 
<P>
     Unlike the Community Policing grants, these new grant programs
are permanent and will not require matching funds by local government
or the private social service organizations who receive the funds.
This means that recipients will have more incentive to apply for these
funds than the grants intended for new cops. Thus new social service
workers will be much less costly for jurisdictions to hire than new
police officers. Indeed, if all this new social welfare money goes
toward hiring new social workers, the bill will add a minimum of
40,000 social workers per year -- at least two social workers will be
hired for every cop the bill puts on the street. (According to the
Current Population Survey, the typical social worker earns less than
$23,000 annually -- fully one-third less than the average police
officer. Most social workers, especially those working in the
non-profit agencies largely funded by the bill, do not have as
generous benefits packages as unionized police officers or the
training costs (The typical recreational worker earns less than
$12,000 annually). This calculation assumes that the value of a social
workers benefit package is half-again as much as their salary, or some
$12,000, for a total cost per social worker of $36,000.)
<P>
     The assumption behind these new social programs is that potential
criminals can be steered away from a life of crime by targeted
government initiatives aimed at altering their environment. In other
words, crime will be reduced if government provides community
development aid, social services, job training, and recreational
activities.
<P>
     This argument may sound attractive to many taxpayers. But it
belies the fact that society has spent $5 trillion on the War on
Poverty since 1965, yet the national crime rate stands at its highest
level ever. As shown in Chart 1, welfare spending since 1965 has grown
in real terms by 800 percent while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the typical rates before 1960.
(Rector, op. cit.) While these two sets of statistics may not be
directly correlated, welfare spending appears to have little impact on
reducing the crime rate.
<P>
     Chart 2 shows that government already has spent lavishly on
programs identical to the ones created in the new crime bill. Since
1965, government has spent $161 billion on community development and
economic aid programs, $202 billion on social service programs, $204
billion on job training programs, and $292 billion on targeted
education programs. These are exactly the types of federal assistance
boosted in the crime bill. They have not cut crime. Moreover, the new
programs created by this bill will duplicate at least 50 existing
federally funded "crime prevention" grant programs. Among other
things, this will compound the overall problem of duplication and
overlapping programs identified last year by Vice President Al Gore's
National Performance Review. The Performance Review found that:
<P>
Some "14 separate government departments and agencies invest $24
   billion a year, through 150 employment and training programs." (The
   National Performance Review, Creating a Government that Works
   Better and Costs Less (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
   Office) September 7, 1993, p. 49.)
<P>
Washington spends "about $60 billion a year on the well-being of
   children. But we have created at least 340 separate programs for
   families and children, administered by 11 different federal
   agencies and departments." (Ibid., p. 51.)
<P>
"Much of Washington's domestic agenda, $226 billion, to be precise,"
   is allocated to state and local governments "through an array of
   more than 600 different grant programs."
  <P>
     Ten such examples of the 30 new programs added to the current
600, include:
<P>
1)   Local Partnership Act. This new community aid program will hand
     out $1.8 billion to local governments on a formula basis. The
     formula is written to reward areas with high tax rates, high
     unemployment, and low personal income. In other words, cities
     which have overtaxed their residents will benefit most from the
     Local Partnership Act.
<P>
2)   Model Intensive Grants. This program gives the Attorney General
     the discretion to award $895 million to 15 high-crime areas.
     These funds are intended to accomplish the vague goals of
     relieving "conditions that encourage crime" and providing
     "meaningful and lasting alternatives to involvement in crime." In
     reality, this is likely to be a traditional pork barrel program
     because priority will be given to areas marked by the
     "deterioration or lack of public facilities, inadequate public
     services such as public transportation, street lighting... or
     employment services offices." (This specific language was
     contained in the House version of the crime bill (H.R. 4092)
     pages 111-112. The Conference Committee language was not
     available at the time this analysis was written.)
<P>
3)   Youth Employment Skills (YES). This program will spend $650
     million to "test the proposition that crime can be reduced...
     through a saturation jobs program." The 150 job training programs
     already being funded seem to have done little to reduce the crime
     rate. The bill's supporters assume spending more will have an
     impact.
<P>
4)   Ounce of Prevention. This program creates a new interagency
     council to distribute $100 million for summer and after-school
     programs, mentoring and tutoring programs, substance abuse
     treatment, and job placement. This program duplicates dozens of
     established federal programs and countless programs run by local
     governments and non-profit organizations.
<P>
5)   Family and Community Endeavor Schools (FACES). This program
     authorizes the Secretary of Education to dole out some $270
     million to "community-based" organizations. These organizations
     can use the funds for activities such as "work force preparation,
     entrepreneurship, cultural programs, arts and crafts," dance
     programs, and supervised sports programs. However, community
     organizations "may not use such funds to provide sectarian
     worship or instruction." (H.R. 4092, p. 120.)
<P>
6)   Midnight Sports. This well-publicized $40 million program directs
     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish so-
     called midnight basketball leagues. The bill specifies how many
     teams must be in a league, how many players must be on each team,
     and requires that at least half of the players must live in
     public housing. Youth involved in this program must live in an
     area with a substantial drug problem, high crime rates, large
     numbers of people infected with AIDS, and high illegitimacy
     rates. One problem apparently overlooked by those supporting the
     midnight league is that many of the cities toward which this
     program presumably is targeted have curfews for adolescents.
<P>
7)   Violence Against Women. This $1.8 billion program funds an array
     of grant programs intended to assist law enforcement agencies and
     nonprofit groups develop strategies to prevent crimes against
     women. A large portion of these funds must go to "nonprofit
     nongovernmental victim services." The bill establishes the
     Attorney General's Task Force on Violence Against Women at a cost
     of $500,000. The Task Force may hire an Executive Director at an
     annual salary of some $69,000 (GS-15 level) and pay consultants
     up to $200 per day.
<P>
8)   Drug Courts. Though not officially designated a "prevention"
     program, this $1.3 billion grant program is no different from the
     other new social programs. The Drug Court grants are to be used
     by local governments or private organizations involved in
     "continuing judicial supervision over specified categories of
     persons with substance abuse problems, and that involve the
     integrated administration of other sanctions and services." These
     "other services" include: substance abuse treatment, health care,
     education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
     and child care or other family support services. (H.R. 4092, p.
     149.)
<P>
9)   Juvenile Drug Trafficking and Gang Prevention Grants. This $125
     million program authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Justice
     Assistance to make grants to local public and nonprofit
     organizations for projects intended to steer young people away
     from gangs and drug activities. Such projects include "school
     programs that teach that drug and gang involvement are wrong,"
     and "programs such as youth sports and other activities,
     including girls and boys clubs, scout troops, and little
     leagues."
<P>
10)  Missing Alzheimer's Patients. The bill approves $3 million in
     grants to establish a Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert
     Program. Many Americans may approve of such an effort, but it is
     unclear how this would eliminate violent crime in America's
     streets.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The crime bill conference report Congress will act on this week
does not live up to supporters' promises to put 100,000 new police
officers on the beat. At best the bill will fully fund only 20,000
permanent new cops. Most likely it will mean far fewer because of the
strong incentive it gives local governments to use the Community
Policing grants for other programs. Still, the bill is good news for
social workers: the bill funds a massive expansion of the social
welfare system and could put two social welfare workers on the street
for every new police officer.

<h3><i>CHILE SHOULD JOIN NAFTA</i></h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
The prompt accession of Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would be a powerful incentive for other Latin American countries to accelerate the pace of economic liberalization and democratic reforms. These reforms constitute a necessary institutional framework upon which a successful Free Trade Area of the Americas can be built. Conversely, delaying Chile's entry into NAFTA could paralyze the consolidation of capitalist democracy not only in Chile, but also throughout all of Latin America. Similarly, if negotiations imposed conditions on Chile that are unrelated to free trade, such as side agreements on labor and the environment, Chile's economy would be damaged. Chile, therefore, would likely balk at including such agreements in a NAFTA expansion agreement.
<p>
Free trade agreements like NAFTA are the most efficient way to open up intra-regional markets. They eliminate most tariffs on trade, substantially reduce non-tariff trade barriers, and remove restrictions on the free flow of capital. Since average tariff levels are clearly higher in Chile than in the United States, the tariff elimination schedule resulting from Chile's accession to NAFTA would encourage a rapid expansion of American exports to Chile and more high-wage jobs for American workers.
<p>
Chile's quick accession to NAFTA would be a reaffirmation of U.S. leadership in the construction of a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Other Latin American countries are following the situation very carefully. They are waiting for the U.S. Congress to approve a new "fast track" negotiating authority and are wondering whether the Clinton Administration can wrap up a NAFTA deal with Chile that will pass muster in Congress. At stake is a pledge by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas in Miami that Chile would become NAFTA's fourth member before mid-1996. If that timetable is not met, the pace of economic and democratic reform could slacken in many Latin American countries where there still is much popular and political resistance to open markets and true democracy.
<p>
NAFTA would encourage faster growth of American exports to Chile, but Chile also would benefit from the removal of some non-tariff barriers that affect Chilean exports to the U.S. market. A NAFTA agreement would shield Chilean producers from protectionist tendencies in the U.S. that fluctuate with the business cycle and are sensitive to a wide variety of special-interest groups. Similarly, the trade dispute settlement mechanism that would form part of a NAFTA deal would provide added security for Chilean exporters. 
<p>
For Chile, however, the greatest benefit of joining NAFTA is that the agreement could provide the institutional insurance Chile needs to resist domestic pressures for abandoning the free-market model. By supporting a path of more stable and higher economic growth, accession to NAFTA would be a decisive step in placing Chile in the developed world more quickly. Membership in NAFTA would encourage more foreign investment in Chile by dramatically reducing the perception of risk associated with investing in a country which, despite the high and sustained rates of development achieved in the past two decades, could still repudiate the free-market policies that have been maintained successfully since the mid-1970s.
<p>

<b>INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR FREE-MARKET POLICY</b>
<P>

NAFTA would establish an institutional framework to compel the government of Chile to guarantee the long-term stability and continuity of sound free-market policies. It also would create permanent barriers against tax increases, exchange controls, and other interventionist actions that could trigger an immediate decline in country risk perceptions about Chile. On July 11, 1995, Standard and Poor's upgraded its rating for Chile's sovereign long-term foreign debt from BBB+ to A-, placing Chile in the same top credit rating category assigned to successful Southeast Asian economies. Joining NAFTA probably would make the needed difference in raising Chile's credit rating to the highest level normally given to the most developed countries. 
<p>
Since 1974, U.S. investors in Chile have accounted for almost 50 percent of registered foreign investment and 40 percent of realized foreign investment. Following Chile's accession to NAFTA, these percentages should grow rapidly as investment restrictions are liberalized in such key economic sectors as banking and financial services -- one of the fastest-growing economic activities today in Latin America. 
<p>
The accession of Chile to NAFTA undoubtedly would expose the country to significantly greater competition, but it also would open up a fast-growing new world of trade and investment opportunities. However, in order to take full advantage of those opportunities, Chile must rise to the greatest challenge it faces today:  Chile must become more productive, competitive, and efficient. This challenge will require better leadership from a government committed to perfecting and consolidating the free-market policies responsible for Chile's track record of sustained high economic growth since 1985. Fortunately, the timing of the challenge could not be better for Chile.
<p>
Chile has won international praise and respect for the success of its free-market model and for its successful transition from military regime to freely elected democratic government. Paradoxically, however, since democracy was restored at the beginning of the 1990s, the pace of free market reform has slowed in Chile. In recent years, the Chilean government has raised taxes, made the country's labor laws more rigid, increased public spending excessively, and expanded its regulatory powers. Moreover, the government has failed to continue opening the economy. The government also has paralyzed further privatizations of state-owned companies and has ignored the need to facilitate private-sector participation in the provision of human and physical capital infrastructure. As a result, the competitiveness of the Chilean economy has been weakened, although the private sector has made remarkable strides in becoming more efficient and productive during this period. Thanks to these efforts, Chile is well-positioned today to improve its competitiveness if the government of President Eduardo Frei rectifies its present course. Accession to NAFTA would be an important catalyst for ensuring that President Frei makes these necessary changes.
<p>

<b>THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
Chile is at the forefront of developing nations. For the past 11 years, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent. This growth has been accompanied by a steady reduction of inflation. In recent months, the yearly inflation rate has been as low as 7.5 percent, while unemployment has reached levels of 5.5 percent. The commitment of Chile's independent Central Bank to sound monetary policies has been decisive in bringing down yearly inflation to single digits. 
<p>
The public sector has been downsized to less than a third of what it was only two decades ago through a process of aggressive privatization and rationalization. One important consequence of this process has been a dramatic increase in private and public-sector savings. The stated goal of fiscal policy has been to maintain a balanced budget, but in practice, the government in recent years actually has maintained a permanent budget surplus equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP. Chile created this budget surplus by reducing the tax burden on individuals and corporations and by drastically reducing current expenditures from the equivalent of 30 percent of GDP in 1984 to 18 percent of GDP in 1994. Taxes also declined during the 1980s, from 19 percent of GDP in 1984 to 15 percent by the end of that decade, although since then they have increased again to about 17 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the economy's tax structure is efficient and provides a stable income flow to the treasury, as well as a positive incentive to increase private savings.
<p>
One of Chile's principal economic strengths today is its high level of domestic savings, which was about 25 percent of GDP in 1994. These savings underpin investment levels equivalent to 27 percent of GDP. High levels of savings differentiate the Chilean economy from its neighbors not only in Latin America, but in all of the Western Hemisphere, including the United States. Savings are an important factor in Chile's economic and financial stability, shielding the country from the normal volatility of short-term capital flows. 
<p>
Another important feature of Chile's economic stability is the development and depth of its capital markets. The strength and solvency of Chile's capital markets is one of the characteristics that most distinguishes the country from the rest of Latin America. In addition, Chile's consolidated banking system is not only highly capitalized and profitable; it also is the most soundly supervised system in the region. 
<p>
The growth of Chile's capital markets and savings levels is tied directly to the successful privatization of the country's social security system during the early 1980s. The traditional pay-as-you-go system managed by the government was replaced with a privately managed and competitive system of individual capitalization. The companies that manage these pension funds compete for savings deposits, and workers can decide for themselves what percentage of their income they wish to place in the pension funds. As a result, the national level of savings has climbed impressively, adding depth to Chile's capital markets and favoring a more efficient allocation of resources for investment and savings.
<p>
The key to Chile's success in achieving sustained economic growth has been the outstanding performance of the country's export industry. Twenty years ago, copper accounted for 77 percent of Chile's total exports. Today, copper accounts for 37 percent of the country's export package. Moreover, Chilean exporters have been very adept at diversifying products and creating new markets. The geographical spread of Chile's exports currently is distributed almost evenly among the European Union, Latin America, the United States, Japan, and the rest of Asia. Argentina and Brazil are Chile's most important trading partners in Latin America.
<P>
Chile has been reducing its import duties unilaterally since the mid-1970s. The average tariff is now 11 percent. This policy of unilateral tariff cuts was bolstered by Chile's strong adherence to the multilateral efforts of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Free trade agreements negotiated with Chile's main trading partners in Latin America have played a positive role. Chile is a full member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC) and is becoming a free trade associate of Mercosur, the South American integration group that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
<p>
During the last ten years, there has been a dramatic improvement in the level of Chile's external indebtedness in relation to GDP. The country's external debt has declined from nearly 120 percent of GDP in 1984 to nearly 40 percent of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, the servicing of that debt -- payments of principal plus interest -- declined from the equivalent of 35 percent of Chile's total exports a decade ago to less than 8 percent today. Chile's external debt in 1994 -- less foreign assets -- was equivalent to only 15 percent of GDP. 
<p>
Chile's social progress during the past twenty years has been as outstanding as its economic performance. For example, the infant mortality rate was reduced from 66 per thousand live births in 1973 to 15 per thousand in 1991. Access to safe water in urban areas increased from 67 percent to 98 percent of the urban population, and life expectancy at birth of the population grew from 64 years in the mid-1970s to 72 years at the beginning of the 1990s. Real per capita GDP more than doubled during the same period, measured in 1994 dollars, from $1,715 in 1973 to $3,719 in 1994.
<p>

<b>ADDING VALUE </b>
<P>
Chile is leading the current wave of structural economic reforms in Latin America, but there still is much room for improvement. To maintain high rates of economic growth, Chile must achieve significant increases in investment and savings -- both public and private -- and economic policy must be managed with great care. In this respect, a crucial factor will be a renewed government commitment to two broad policies that were developed during the early stages of the reform process in Chile. 
<p>
The first policy focused on providing incentives to private enterprise by reducing the size of government and thereby expanding the spaces available to private initiative. The creation of free-market conditions to assure the private sector's health and development was an integral part of this policy. The second broad policy was that the government should not interfere with the economy or try to steer the market's behavior, even under the pretext of acting for the "common good," as it has been doing recently. The Chilean government must understand that its proper role is to ensure that markets operate efficiently. Thus, governmental regulation should not distort markets, but facilitate their creation. 
<P>
A number of important structural reforms are still pending in Chile today. For instance, the still-high uniform tariff level of 11 percent must be reduced unilaterally in order to expand Chile's international trade, and regulations governing balance of payments capital transactions must be liberalized. In addition, investment in human capital must be improved and rationalized by reforming education and health care. A system of private concessions must be implemented to build the physical infrastructure that Chile must have in order to become more competitive internationally. Private investors must be allowed to finance, build, and operate ports, airports, and water and sewage systems. Fortunately, the legislation for most of these reforms is already in place or under discussion in the Chilean Congress.
<p>
The accession of Chile to NAFTA will stimulate a permanent inflow of international resources, causing the peso to appreciate in value. This means that, in order to prevent any loss of international competitiveness, Chile must increase its domestic savings levels from around 25 percent of GDP to at least 30 percent of GDP, and it must do so quickly. This can be achieved by cutting back public expenditures and improving the economy's tax structure by reducing the tax on personal and corporate savings. Before joining NAFTA, the Frei government also must address structural weaknesses by further liberalizing trade, moving toward capital account convertibility, and opening up the financial sector.
<p>
There is no reason to delay these structural reforms. For many years, Chile has enjoyed the economic benefits created by the unilateral reduction of its import duties. There is no need to wait for a NAFTA deal before carrying out these reforms. In fact, Chile's hand in the NAFTA negotiations will be strengthened if the Frei government acts quickly. Moreover, the NAFTA negotiations should not pre-empt or slow the process of opening up unilaterally to other countries and regions, thus minimizing the potential effects of any trade diversion that NAFTA might cause.
<p>

<b>REAFFIRMING U.S. LEADERSHIP</b>
<P>
Chile's early entry into NAFTA could spark renewed efforts throughout the rest of Latin America to push forward with difficult economic and political reforms. Chile's quick accession to NAFTA would be a powerful signal that, despite the Mexican crisis, the U.S. remains strongly committed to supporting free trade and structural economic reform in the Western Hemisphere and that there is a real reward ahead for countries that persevere in the creation of free-market democracies.
<p>
The time to act is now. This must be done before the region loses the sense of urgency that has driven the reform process since the end of the 1980s. Latin America has made a quantum leap forward in terms of economic liberalization and democratic reform, but there is always the risk that the region could backslide to its statist, interventionist past. Venezuela already has done so, while in Mexico a growing chorus of critics are wrongly blaming the peso's collapse on the free-market policies of the Salinas and Zedillo governments. In both Mexico and the U.S., the enemies of NAFTA once again are urging its abolition.
<p>
The expansion of NAFTA to include Chile presents the U.S. with a major opportunity to receive full credit for developing the vision of a free trade area encompassing all of the Americas. U.S. influence would increase significantly throughout the region if Chile were included in NAFTA. Moreover, U.S. exporters, investors, and workers would be direct beneficiaries of this enhanced influence thanks to America's fast-growing trade with the rest of the region.
<P>
But NAFTA's expansion to include Chile, and subsequently other Latin American countries, will not be a free ride for the United States. Instead, it will demand a minimum level of accountability from U.S. trade policy. The rhythm and conditionality of Chile's accession to NAFTA will be followed closely by other potential candidates for membership, such as Argentina and others in the Andean and Caribbean regions. Depending on the outcome of Chile's negotiations to join NAFTA, these countries could be encouraged to reform their economies with the goal of attaining NAFTA-level standards. However, if they are spurned by the U.S., they may seek alternatives such as Mercosur or the recently created Association of Caribbean states, whose members include NAFTA partner Mexico and communist Cuba, among others, but not the United States.
<p>
If the U.S. expects to be viewed as a legitimate champion of free trade in the world, and if it wants to be viewed in Latin America as the region's natural leader, the Clinton Administration and Congress must reach agreement quickly on a new fast track negotiating authority to implement Chile's accession to NAFTA. Moreover, the bill approved by Congress and accepted by the Clinton Administration should be a clean bill, without language on labor or environmental issues. In addition, the U.S. must implement a stable, predictable trade policy with regard to Latin America -- one that avoids the threat of unilateral actions against the region's economies and also resists pressures by special-interest groups to impose a non-trade agenda that would pose a threat to development. These are the challenges facing the U.S. as it negotiates Chile's membership in NAFTA.

Supplementing the C-17 with the NDAA, a military version of Boeing's proven 747, may produce significant cost savings and still meet most of the Pentagon's future strategic lift requirements. <p><h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIC LIFT </h3><hr><p><b>America's Historic Strategy of "Forward Deployment"</b><p>In the 20th century the United States has been drawn into two global wars and numerous regional conflicts, but always with the luxury of fighting on someone else's soil, sparing the American homeland the ravages of war. This historical experience led the United States to adopt a strategic posture of "forward deployment" to contain the rise of Soviet Communism at the end of World War II. America's leaders determined to meet threats as far away from the continental United States as possible. For 45 years the U.S. has stationed large forces around the world, backed by the ability to reinforce and sustain those forces in the event of war. <p>However, the fall of the Soviet empire has brought about a dramatic withdrawal of forward deployed forces. American personnel in Europe have decreased from over half a million at the height of the Cold War to approximately 100,000 today. The growing integration of Europe and the rise of new security structures competing with NATO may bring that number down further in the future. The U.S. is turning over the Panama Canal to Panama and removing Southern Command forces from the Canal Zone. The U.S. has left the Philippines entirely, giving up naval and air bases that were the hub of the U.S. security posture in the Pacific. The Pentagon plans to maintain a force of 100,000 in the Pacific; but the future of the U.S. presence in Okinawa, recently wracked by demands for withdrawal, is in doubt. Even South Korea, a staunch ally which relies on Americans to help deter still-volatile North Korea, must contend with growing dissent over the U.S. presence. The clear pattern is one of global retrenchment and the inevitable return of most forward deployed forces to the United States.    <p><b>Protecting Vital Interests</b><p>Even though the United States is being compelled by budget cuts and other imperatives to pull back its far-flung forces, America's vital interests and obligations around the world are not undergoing a corresponding decline. The United States still has commitments or vital interests in Europe, the Middle East, throughout the Pacific region, and the Western Hemisphere. <p>The security and prosperity of the United States, a maritime trading power, depend as much as ever on unhindered passage of the world's sealanes and airspace, and on access to the world's raw materials and markets. America's leadership and credibility, essential elements of national security, depend on the ability to keep commitments to allies and friendly powers. <p><b>Replacing Forward Deployment with Force Projection</b><p>Without large, capable forces deployed close to the scene of potential conflicts, the United States may find it difficult to respond to a regional threat unless the nation replaces withdrawn forward deployed forces with the ability to project combat power to trouble spots. <P>Force projection includes the ability to deliver accurate attacks on key strategic targets like command, control, and communications centers or air defense networks early in a conflict. This is why America will continue to need the B-2 bomber, carrier-based naval strike forces to hit hard from the sea, and continued improvements in surveillance, real-time targeting, and precision-strike capabilities. <p>Force projection also means the ability to move men and equipment rapidly to the battlefield. Victory still depends, in the words of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, on "getting there first with the most."  Clearly the best way to get there first is by air. With enough heavy airlift, U.S. forces can arrive quickly with the weapons, munitions, spare parts, and heavy equipment needed to fight and prevail in a high-intensity campaign. <P>Of course, adequate sealift is required also to bring the huge stores needed to sustain the forces in a protracted conflict. But the Navy's fast sealift vessels require three weeks to reach the Persian Gulf, for example, and in warfare, time can be the decisive factor. Only strategic airlift can get troops and equipment into the theater in those critical early hours or days that can determine the outcome of the conflict. The U.S. can never rely on a future aggressor to give away the initiative as Saddam Hussein did in the Persian Gulf War, allowing the allies six months of unimpeded time in which to build up the force needed to throw him out of Kuwait. <p><b>America's Declining Strategic Airlift Capability</b><p>The Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR), which serves as the basis of current military strategy and force planning, calls for U.S. forces to be able to fight and win two nearly simultaneous medium regional conflicts. The BUR plan estimates that the strategic airlift requirement for such a scenario is 49-52 million ton miles per day (the measurement of tonnage carried over distance used by the Pentagon to compute its lift requirements). However, in the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. was able to deliver only about 17-21 million ton miles per day. That was an immense achievement. According to the U.S. military, it was equivalent to transporting the more than 500,000 residents of Seattle halfway around the world, along with all their cars, trucks, fuel, and food. But this level of airlift capacity may fall far short in the future if multiple, simultaneous crises erupt to threaten vital U.S. interests.<p>America's strategic airlift fleet, operated by the Air Mobility Command of the U.S. Air Force, is built around 231 heavy airlifters  the C-141 <i>Starlifter</i>, the C-5 <i>Galaxy</i>, the new C-17 <i>Globemaster</i> III, KC-10 and KC-135 tankers for aerial refueling, and a host of smaller support and command and control aircraft. KC-10 tankers also are being diverted for use as airlifters to meet shortfalls now common among the Command's C-141s. Supplementing the nation's strategic airlift fleet are 94 Guard and Reserve C-141s, C-5s, and tanker aircraft and the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), aircraft from civilian airlines brought into service in emergencies like Operation Desert Shield.<p>The problem is that this aging fleet is being used up at a faster rate than anticipated by the high number of sorties being flown in support of proliferating humanitarian and peace operations. No new C-5s nor C-141s are being built. The latest model C-141 entered service in 1979 and is nearing the end of its useful life, even after having gone through several overhauls or "SLEPs" (Service Life Extension Programs). These aircraft are simply wearing out and cannot fly much longer without endangering their crews. <p><b>OPTIONS TO REPLACE THE AGING FLEET</b><p>As the C-141 retires by FY 2003, the Pentagon proposes to replace the aging airlift fleet with the new McDonnell Douglas C-17, 40 of which will be authorized by the end of fiscal 1996 under current defense plans. At first the C-17 program was plagued with cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls, but the company and the Air Force appear to have worked out most production problems. The C-17 program is now on the way to producing a truly outstanding airplane. It cannot carry as much cargo as the mammoth C-5, but it does accommodate outsize items like helicopters. It can land on short, rough, undeveloped airfields close to the battlefront (which used to be limited to the tactical C-130) and can maneuver in tight spots to unload quickly. It also can conduct airdrops of paratroops and heavy equipment. In July 1995 the C-17 underwent rigorous reliability, maintainability, and availability testing at Charleston, South Carolina, and passed the tests with the enthusiastic praise of the operators. <p>The Pentagon originally wanted to purchase 210 C-17s. The planned buy is now down to 120, and even though the unit cost is falling as the contractor perfects its manufacturing processes, the planned C-17 acquisition is still an expensive program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the price per airplane at $251 million, including cost of support and spare parts. In total, the Pentagon would spend $21.2 billion to procure 80 more C-17s beyond the 40 expected to be approved in the fiscal 1996 defense bill. <p><b>CONVERTING EXISTING CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT FOR MILITARY AIRLIFT</b><P>The Defense Acquisition Board, in reviewing various solutions to the strategic airlift problem, must make a decision that will lead to one of the most significant aircraft procurements in U.S. history. The DAB must consider three main options:<p><ol><li>Complete the planned buy of 80 more C-17s;<p><li>Purchase fewer C-17s, order the restart of the closed production line of Lockheed Martin's C-5 <i>Galaxy</i>, and purchase more C-5s; and<p><li>Supplement a core C-17 fleet with a military version of the proven workhorse of the skies, the Boeing 747, which can be reconfigured for military use in a version known as the C-33.</ol><p>Since options two and three are cheaper, Congress is highly unlikely to approve option one, the full buy of 120 C-17s at a cost of $21.2 billion, if options two and three come close to fulfilling the ton-miles-per-day lift requirement. <p>While the C-5 is a capable aircraft with huge lift capacity, its advantages over the highly capable and more flexible C-17 do not appear sufficient to re-open production. On the other hand, the Boeing 747 freighter is in production now. This Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft can easily be turned into an Air Force C-33 with reinforced cargo decks, a widened side cargo door, and a door in the nose for military cargo like trucks and wheeled artillery. <p>The C-33 cannot carry outsize cargo like helicopters or <i>Patriot</i> missile batteries. Those items can fly only on the C-5 or C-17. But the C-33 can carry as much cargo as the C-5, and considerably more palletized bulk cargo than the C-17. Moreover, the low-wing C-33 can fly faster and farther than the C-17 (7,000 nautical miles) without refueling. For example, a C-33 could haul 280,000 pounds of cargo from Maguire Air Force Base in New Jersey to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and then unload and fly back to a rear area base in Cairo before needing fuel.<p>The Air Force has done a study called the Strategic Airlift Force Mix Analysis, which looks at a variety of options for a mix of existing military aircraft like the C-5, the C-17, and the NDAA, supplemented by the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet. While it is up to the DAB and the technical and cost-effectiveness experts in the Pentagon to decide on the best mix, it is clear that a base force of C-17s combined with C-33s could meet almost all of the Air Force's ton-miles-per-day lift requirement, but at a considerable savings. <p>According to a newly released Congressional Budget Office memorandum ("Options for Strategic Airlift," October 1995), "If there was adequate room at airfields in regions of potential conflict, buying 32 more C-17's plus 30 C-33's would provide the same delivery capability as 80 additional C-17's. That option would also be nearly $8 billion cheaper...."<p>Seven or eight billion dollars in savings over the life of the program is considerable in light of today's defense budget pressures. Those savings could be applied to other vital national security programs like ballistic missile defense or the B-2 bomber without sacrificing essential strategic airlift requirements. In addition, using the military version of the Boeing 747 will produce savings in time as well as in money. It will speed up the availability of a highly capable airlifter to rebuild today's aging airlift fleet, which might not be up to the job in the event of another Desert Storm or multiple, simultaneous regional contingencies.<p>General Thomas Moorman, Jr., Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, says that "strategic lift has been the greatest deficiency in meeting the nation's two-conflict military strategy."  While supporting a robust C-17 program, the Defense Department and Congress have an historic opportunity to engage in meaningful acquisition reform by considering the C-33 to help fulfill the Pentagon's critical strategic lift requirement. At the same time, using the C-33 will rebuild the aging airlift fleet more quickly and produce significant savings in a period of tight defense budgets.<p><p><center><a href=/heritage/hbut.map><img src=/heritage/hbut.gif ismap border=0></a></center></body></html>                                                                                                        ....()()))()()                                                                  >  	                                        S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           P                        @    Y                        @    VK                                                                                              @                                      Microsoft Word 6.0                                                   4                                                                              >  	        0	  n	  ?  d  Q            #  -  ?  N  Y+  c+  ?/  J/  9  9  9  9  :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  u uD     U`V``    A          8  X  m    	    L  P        '	  ,	  0	  k	  o	      :  >  ?  a  e      L  P  Q          ;  ?               $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $        ,-  p  t  4!  8!  =#  A#  B#  l#  p#  n'  r'  x)  |)  })  )  )  *  *  *  *  *  +  +  ?,  H,  5-  9-   /  /  /1  31  C3  G3  4  4  77  ;7  |9  9  9  9  9  9  9   

<h3>NATIONAL DEFENSE AND AMERICA'S ALLIANCES</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim R. Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
Delivered October 6, 1995<br>
<p>
I would like to begin with an anecdote I heard two weeks ago at an OSCE conference in Vienna. It is a story that was making the rounds in Budapest in 1989, at the time the Cold War was coming to an end.
<p>
There was this man fishing in the Danube. Eventually he caught a big fish. While he was dragging the fish on shore, the fish began to speak and asked that his life be spared. He said that he would grant the fisherman three wishes if his life could be saved. Since it is an unusual thing to hear a fish speak, the fisherman thought it was worth a try. So he said:  "I want to be a prince. I want to live in a palace. And I want a beautiful wife."  The fish promised to deliver and was released from his ordeal. The next morning the fisherman awoke in a palace. And indeed he was a prince. The door opened and a beautiful woman appeared and said:  "Get up Franz-Ferdinand. Today is our trip to Sarajevo."
<p>
Perhaps this story may be a useful reminder that we should be careful about what we wish for. All of us, of course, are very glad that the Cold War is over, but we have not yet adjusted to the immense complexities of the new era. We thought and acted like strategists during the Cold War, but that art sadly has been lost over the past few years. With the Cold War over, we have lost sight of the big picture. And because there is no big picture, we find it difficult to reach consensus on many foreign and defense policy issues.
<p>
The only way to find a new consensus is to start looking at the big picture again. We need to start looking for connections between things that seem to have no connections. The connection I would like to draw this morning is between our defense capabilities and our alliances -- between our military power and our security structures. 
<P>
I would propose that we try to reach a consensus on two points: 
<p>
1) That our alliances depend on America remaining a strong and global military power.
<p>
2) That we need to devise a new transatlantic bargain for the NATO alliance to guide us, not only through NATO expansion, but through European conflicts such as Bosnia.
<p>


<b>DEFENSE</b>
<p>
Let me begin with the first point about defense. You cannot talk intelligently about America's security structures unless you first talk about American military power. As Malcolm Wallop is fond of saying, "diplomacy without military power is but a prayer."  And a security alliance without adequate military backing is but a promise without a prayer.
<p>
My concern is that, if current trends in defense spending cuts are continued, both the U.S. and our alliances could indeed become a promise without a prayer. If defense spending continues to plummet, the U.S. will be hard-pressed to meet its future alliance commitments.
<p>
We at Heritage have long argued that the Clinton Administration has not asked the Congress for adequate funding to maintain the force envisioned in its Bottom-Up Review. You will recall that this force supposedly would be large enough to win two major regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously."
<p>
We estimated that the Administration's defense budget will fall short by some $110 billion over five years. The result will be deeper than anticipated cuts in military capabilities and combat readiness. For example, according to our estimates, the force structure of the U.S. armed forces could be reduced by roughly 20 percent below levels recommended in the Bottom-Up Review, and military personnel levels would have to shrink by roughly 15 percent below levels envisioned in the BUR.
<p>
I cannot see how our alliance commitments can be kept if, in fact, we are going to reduce our forces to levels lower than the bare minimum envisioned in the Bottom-Up Review. At these lower force levels, we would not be able to cover two major regional conflicts at the same time. If war broke out in one region -- say, in Asia -- we would be forced to move troops, weapons, and ships from another region in which we have alliance commitments -- for example, Europe. By doing this, we would have strengthened one region at the expense of the other. In effect, we would have been forced to make choices between alliances. 
<p>
This is not a choice we should be forced to make. It should be obvious that, at some point, a lack of sufficient military forces casts doubt on our alliance commitments. Our allies are masters at taking our pulse and measuring our power. They are keenly aware of the "promise without a prayer" problem of which I spoke earlier. 
<p>
If we value our alliances -- and I know there is a bipartisan consensus that we do -- then I believe we should take maintaining our military capabilities more seriously. In short, we must provide adequate funds for defense. All the diplomacy in the world will not save our alliances if America is perceived by our allies to be a waning and weakened military power. Our democratic values are keenly important to our allies. But our military power is critically important.
<p>

<b>NATO AND EUROPE</b>
<p>
Now let me turn to NATO. There is, of course, a bipartisan consensus favoring U.S. participation in NATO. There is not much doubt about that. But there has not been much discussion or debate, at the political level at least, of what needs to be done to ensure that NATO survives.
<p>
I firmly believe that the United States needs to revitalize the Atlanticism represented by the NATO alliance. Unless we define a new transatlantic bargain between the U.S. and Europe, the Atlantic Alliance may either collapse or wither away. This would be dangerous not only for Europe, but for the United States. The details of this transatlantic bargain may take a while to develop, but working them out will require Americans and Europeans to change old habits and take new risks.
<p>
The old transatlantic bargain was, to put it crudely, "If you European members of the alliance are attacked by the Soviet Union, we will risk our own annihilation to come to your defense."  Of course, the strategic rationale for this bargain has changed; the threat of hegemony has weakened, although not entirely disappeared, while other, less apocalyptic threats have emerged.
<p>
A new transatlantic bargain will be much more complicated -- and possibly even riskier in the near term. I could see a new bargain emerging that goes something like this:  "We Americans will do all the things we used to do (deter a strategic attack on Europe as a whole), but in addition to this, we will help you solve some of your purely regional problems if you help us solve some of our problems outside of Europe."
<p>
What does this mean?  It means, in principle, that if the circumstances are right and the interests and mission are clear, the United States should consider involving its military forces, including ground troops, in lesser regional contingencies and crisis management operations (peacekeeping operations) in Europe. By doing this, we would be going beyond Article Five commitment because we would be involving ourselves in actions that go beyond defending an ally from an attack.
<p>
This would not mean, however, putting U.S. troops in military operations that are bound to fail. U.S. leadership should not be defined as merely doing what the Europeans ask. Sometimes leadership will mean saying "no" to dumb ideas. And it may be that committing U.S. troops to a peace-enforcement operation in Bosnia today is a dumb idea.
<p>
While U.S. participation in so-called major regional contingencies, such as a major attack on Europe, would be more or less automatic, participation in lesser regional contingencies (at least those not involving a direct attack on an alliance member, as in Bosnia) would not be automatic. Since an agreement for participation would have to be reached by consensus, a veto by the U.S. not to send ground forces would not necessarily stop an operation if the Europeans decided to go ahead with their own troops. In any event, the Americans could support the operation in other ways, with air power, for example, as we are now doing in Bosnia. In this way, the U.S. could refuse to send ground troops without undermining a fundamental principle of the alliance. 
<P>
An important assumption here is that the dispatch of U.S. troops for lesser regional contingencies in Europe is something new -- a step up the ladder of risk, so to speak. Putting troops in actual combat is different from stationing them in peacetime for potential combat, as we did in Europe for most of the Cold War. The Europeans would have to understand that our making such a commitment would be a new chip in the bargain. In fact a lesser regional conflict not involving a direct attack on an alliance member is, by definition, an "out of area" operation. Sending U.S. forces to Europe for peacekeeping purposes would be keeping our end of the new bargain with respect to "out of area" operations. 
<p>
Another chip that we Americans could throw into the bargain could be to provide a missile defense umbrella for Europe. This would be making good on our strategic end of the bargain. By promising to defend our European allies from missile attack, we would be adding a new dimension to extended deterrence.
<p>
What would we expect from the European members of the alliance in return?  First, they would have to take up a greater burden for maintaining international peace and stability outside of Europe. And, second, they would have to do a better job of submerging their national preferences for the greater good of the alliance. 
<p>
If we Americans are asked to take on greater risks -- and sending U.S. forces into combat entails greater risk -- then the Europeans should be assisting us in "out of area" operations outside of Europe. Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince the Congress and the American people that this new transatlantic bargain is worth the risk and the money. These "out of area" operations would be like Operation Desert Storm -- i.e., arranged by consultation and determined to be in the mutual interest of the alliance and international peace and stability. 
<p>
Another part of the bargain is NATO expansion. If we expand NATO, we are bringing more countries into the bargain, so to speak; we would be giving Poland and other countries security guarantees. In return, we would expect them to come up to NATO's standards. But we get something else as well. We fill the strategic vacuum in Central Europe; we anchor these countries to the West; and we provide a geopolitical hedge against a revived Russian threat.
<p>
There are, of course, many issues involving NATO expansion which I do not have time to go into:  Who exactly should be brought in?  What happens to the countries that are left out?  What kind of defense posture should we have for new members?  And what are the time lines? 
<p>
Let me say only this:  It would be wise to expand NATO sooner rather than later. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be. The Russians will not become less resistant to NATO expansion simply because we go more slowly. In fact, if they think that we are slowing down because of them, they may increase their resistance.
<p>
A second point:  There are no easy solutions to the problem of countries falling outside the NATO defense perimeter. However, the difficulty of this problem should not be used as an argument against NATO expansion. It makes no sense to argue that NATO expansion will create new dividing lines when old ones already exist. To be sure, if NATO expands, there will be a new dividing line, but I would rather have that dividing line on the eastern border of Poland than on the western one. There will always be some European countries outside NATO, whether it expands or not.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
I have chosen to speak only about NATO. The relationship between military power and security structures is equally true for our alliances in Asia. Our allies in Asia will not for long trust our commitments to them if they perceive that our purpose is uncertain and our capabilities are weak. They will tend to measure the strength of our resolve by the commitment we make not only to our alliances, but to our own defense.
<p>
We can easily find a bipartisan consensus favoring our alliances in principle. The trouble begins when we start talking about costs and risks. Then the details begin to get troubling, and they could become deeply divisive.
<p>
I believe that a bipartisan consensus can be reached on the principle of NATO expansion. But can we maintain this consensus when the cost of expansion -- up to $35 billion over ten years, by some estimates -- comes up in defense budget debates in Congress?  I hope so, but I have my doubts unless we start thinking more strategically. We will not be able to make the proper connections unless we have a consensus on America's overall purpose and strategy in the world. 
<p>
I believe that a growing gap between our military capabilities and our alliance promises poses the greatest threat to our ability to remain engaged in the world. If we cannot remain militarily strong, we will drift off into isolationism not by intent, but by default. Ultimately, this is far more dangerous to America's position in the world than the isolationist speeches of Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIA-U.S. RELATIONS</h2></center><p>
Delivered May 24, 1995 by Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Minister of External Affairs of India
<p>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, I am aware of the importance of The Heritage Foundation in shaping ideas and attitudes in this great country. At a time when our own dialogue with the United States has begun to broaden and deepen, I knew that if I could take the message of the great changes that are occurring in India to the Foundation I could be sure of it reaching those in this country who are interested in knowing about India. My message is about the modernization and reforms that are sweeping throughout our country and the groundwork that is being laid for building strong relations with the outside world, especially with the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Shared Values: Democracy<p></B>
	The people of India and the U.S. are alike in the most fundamental of ways. We are democracies, ruled by the will of the people. The United States is one of the oldest democracies in the world and India the largest. In India, we are particularly proud that our system successfully allows us to mediate the sometimes conflicting interests of our 870 million people. We have repeatedly demonstrated the resilience of our democratic process. We have experienced peaceful and orderly transition of governments and have maintained effective unity in diversity. We face the future with the confidence that our democratic system will be equal to all the challenges it may have to face. If we in India have adjusted better than have many other countries to radical transformation, one of the reasons is that our democratic institutions ensured that the market system and free enterprise flourished even when a strong public sector ruled the commanding heights of our economy.
<p>
<b>Economic Reforms</B><P>
	India's reforms have been aimed at invigorating our economy by liberalization and industrialization, which have had the effect of enhancing competition. The role of the public sector in our economy has been reduced by design, and more stringent accountability has been instituted. Though I am also the Planning Minister, let me confide that the balance between central planning and market-driven investment in our economy is shifting markedly towards the latter. Barriers to foreign participation in India's economy have disappeared in a large number of cases. We realize that our future growth and prosperity can be accomplished best by integrating with the global economy and that if we are to become a global player, our products have to measure up to global standards.
<P>
	The results of these reforms are impressive. Last year the economy grew by 5.3 percent. According to our projection, a similar target will be achieved next year, but I find that a U.S. group of experts has a more optimistic expectation and anticipates that the figure for next year may be 6.3 or 6.4 percent. Industrial growth was almost 9 percent. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up from $1 billion in July 1991 to $21 billion today. Food reserves are at a record high of 30 million tons. Our exports are growing at the rate of about 20 percent in  dollar terms. Inflation has declined sharply in the last few months. Investment offers, direct or indirect, which were under $200 million until only three years ago, are of the order of $4 to $5 billion in the past two years. All in all, the Indian economy is today poised for a sustained growth of 6 to 6.5 percent between now and the year 2000.
<P>
	In implementing our reforms, we have attempted to maintain a political consensus behind them in the country, avoid shock therapy and overheating, and deliberately and carefully sequence the reform process so as to minimize social pain and develop stable markets. We certainly intend to stay the course we have set for ourselves.
<P>
	Our approach has undoubtedly succeeded so far, as borne out by the enthusiastic response received from foreign investors, in particular those from this country. The United States has now become our largest source of foreign investment, with almost 40 percent of approved new investment originating from the U.S. The enlargement of our economic ties is dramatically illustrated by the fact that, in 1993 alone, U.S. firms invested more in India than in the previous 45 years of our relationship. The U.S. is also now our number one trading partner, with an estimated $7.6 billion in goods and services exchanged in 1994. It accounts for 18 percent of our exports and 20 percent of our imports.
<P>
	We are encouraged by the identification of India by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown as "one of the ten most exciting emerging markets in the world."  During Secretary Brown's recent visit to India, business deals of around $7.7 billion were signed. This, plus the $10 million business tie-ups in the energy sector firmed up during Secretary O'Leary's two visits, underscores the enormous opportunities for business and investment in India for U.S. companies.
<P>

<b>Multilateralism in World Trade</b><P>
	In the more economically integrated world ahead of us, it is important that all countries, in particular major trading countries like the U.S., act to strengthen the multilateral trading system. The Uruguay Round has given us an effective framework in the World Trade Organization. On our part we intend to abide fully by the obligations assumed by us as part of the multilateral agreements adopted in Marrakesh. A strong multilateral framework, such as we have established in the WTO, is our best guarantee for continued growth of world trade and prosperity. As we liberalize and reform the Indian economy, this is of vital concern to us. While we can sympathize with the impulses that animate America in controlling what it regards as restrictive trading practices, we do not believe that unilateral measures are the answer. The last thing we wish to see is a trade war between major trading nations, as that is bound to affect our interests adversely.
<P>

<B>Indian Americans</b><P>
	There are around 800,000 people from India in this country, according to the U.S. 1990 census, who have made the U.S. their home. These Indian Americans have made a signal contribution to American society. They have also demonstrated how the values they brought with them from India -- the ideals of family and education, for example -- can help overcome almost any barrier in this land of opportunity. We take pride in the fact that this community has done so well. They form a vested interest in good relations between the U.S. and India. At one stage, we used to fret about the "brain drain" which brought tens of thousands of highly skilled young persons from our country to the U.S.A. and other Western countries. We may still feel the loss in some respects, but we are now able to regard Indians abroad as a resource for the mother country, creating goodwill for India, providing a bridge between the two countries and a source of expertise and capital for the development of India.
<P>

<B>Terrorism</B><P>
	The end of the Cold War has considerably eased the global security situation. But not all regions of the world have benefitted from reduction of tensions. The end of the Cold War has spawned new threats and dangers to the stability of individual states. Ethnic conflicts have sharpened and international terrorism become more widespread. The Oklahoma bombing has brought home dramatically to the American people the human tragedy that is caused by mindless terrorist violence. What you have suffered at Oklahoma City and earlier at the World Trade Center, we in India have suffered in much more virulent form for over a decade in both Punjab and Kashmir. The Bombay blast in March 1993 constituted the biggest single act of urban terrorism in history, causing over 300 deaths and injuries to over 1,000 people. Just a few days ago in Kashmir, the terrorist organizations, the Harkat ul Ansar and Hizbul Mujahideen, burnt down a four and a half century-old religious shrine on the day of the holy Muslim festival of Id-ul-Zuha in a cynical bid to stoke religious fires. The international community needs to join hands to combat the mounting menace of international terrorism and break its close linkage with the narcotics trade. We find it particularly reprehensible that terrorist organizations should be used to subvert legitimately appointed governments and to promote territorial claims on behalf of their sponsors.
<P>

<B>South Asia</b><P>
	We are strongly committed to setting up a structure of durable peace in the subcontinent. There are many problems in our region, but we seek to address them through dialogue and peaceful means. Ultimately, peace is the best guarantee for the security of any country. Global and regional peace and stability provide the best bulwark for a nation's defense. With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, India enjoys good friendly and cordial relations. We are constructively engaged in steps to improve our relations with China and have made significant progress in recent times. Unfortunately, with Pakistan we continue to have serious difficulties. Despite our best efforts to engage Pakistan in a serious bilateral dialogue to find solutions to all outstanding issues between us, we have failed to persuade them so far. The 1972 Simla Agreement provides a mutually agreed framework to settle our differences, but Pakistan regrettably has rejected all our calls for a dialogue without preconditions, with or without agenda, at any place of their choice, whether in India or Pakistan.
<P>
	The SAARC Summit earlier this month provided a useful opportunity for Prime Minister Rao and President Leghari of Pakistan to have an exchange of views. We hope that Pakistan will see reason and accept the fundamental proposition that, as two neighbors, we have a lot to gain if we are friends and a lot to lose if we do not make a serious search for realistic solutions to our problems. We may not be able to solve all our problems at one go, but dialogue will permit us to make a start. Let me add that we have no plan or intention to stoke tensions in the region or in any way to threaten regional peace.
<P>

<B>Non-Proliferation</b><P>
	India has faced four major aggressions across our borders since independence. Nuclear weapons and missiles are all around us. Our defense needs are large, but our means to fulfil them are limited. We feel accordingly that our security is best met through progressive global measures for disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  In 1954 we took the lead by introducing a resolution in the United Nations for a complete halt to nuclear testing. In the early 1980s, along with other countries, India had proposed a global convention to cut off all production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. These proposals figured again in the 1988 Action Plan on Nuclear Disarmament proposed by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the third Special Session on Disarmament, which still merits attention as a well thought out and practical program for universal disarmament.
<P>
	The end of the Cold War has created conditions for implementing these proposals. India and the United States are actively cooperating in the U.N. towards this objective. But these are only intermediate steps. Our goal should be to deal with nuclear weapons in the same way as the international community has dealt with the questions of chemical weapons and biological weapons. Our Prime Minister and President Clinton have jointly endorsed the objectives of eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons.
<P>
	India has always adopted a cautious and measured approach in building up its own defense capabilities. Our current expenditures, at around 2.5 percent of the GNP, are far less than those of our neighbors. We have no aggressive aims against others. We covet no nation's territory. We would have preferred to devote all our energies towards economic development. However, our experience of facing repeated aggression has shown that an adequate defense capacity is unavoidable. For all this, however, let me say that the talk one hears, especially in the West, about a nuclear showdown in South Asia is rather farfetched, if not altogether fanciful.
<P>

<B>Conclusion</b><p>
	I hope I have been able to convey a sense of the many things that we share with you. Let me conclude by reiterating what our Prime Minister said last year, in his address to the U.S. Congress:  "Indo-U.S. relations are on the threshold of a bold new era."  The pace at which Indo-U.S. relations have developed and expanded in the past year demonstrates that we have already entered that era. I have no doubt that the new Indo-U.S. partnership we are forging will go from strength to strength.

<b>Heritage Lecture 530<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href=/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2></b><p><hr><p>
<center><h2>LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION</h2><p>
</center>
Midge Decter - Trustee, The Heritage Foundation, speaking April 21, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation's Annual Board Meeting and Public Policy Seminar, San Diego, California.
<p>



DR. EDWIN J. FEULNER: It is my pleasure to introduce Heritage trustee Thomas "Dusty" Rhodes. Dusty has been officially on the Board of Heritage for a year and a half. In his earlier incarnation, he was a partner with the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs. While Goldman Sachs is known to many in the room, I'm sure, for its considerable achievements in the investment world, it is not particularly known for its hospitality to conservatives. Perhaps on some other occasion we will have the opportunity for Dusty to tell us about Wall Street's political perspectives. Also in his earlier business incarnation, he was a Chief Financial Officer for commercial insurance in London.
<p>
	Dusty, in addition to his service on Heritage's Board, has brought a closer link between Heritage and National Review, the premier conservative magazine, of which Dusty is President. He also helps lead the Conservative Movement by his service as co-chairman of Town Hall, the conservative computer network. 
<P>
	 He has been active in the Conservative Movement for a number of years. He is one of the founders of the Project for the Republican Future, which has had such a salutary impact in formulating some of the specific debates on major public policy issues since it began about two years ago. 
<P>
	Dusty began a state think tank in New York, the Empire Foundation. He works very closely with another organization called Change New York, which is a grass-roots activist organization in New York. I was reading the New York Times not long ago about the new Governor, George Pataki, and alongside the article I saw Dusty's picture and noted that he serves as one of Pataki's chief advisors. 
<p>
	 Dusty is also a graduate of the Wharton School. In fact, Dusty and I were graduate school classmates. 
<p>
	 He has recently been appointed to the Board of the Bradley Foundation. Dusty, please introduce Midge.
<p>

DUSTY RHODES: When faced with a list of accomplishments -- so long and well-known -- one is tempted to say, "Midge Decter needs no introduction."  It's shorter, it's sweeter, it's somehow less boring. This list of accomplishments must be cited, however. It is only then that we see them in the context of Midge Decter's enormous energy, radiance, heroism, and humor.
<p>
	She wrote The Liberated Woman and Other Americans, The New Chastity, and other arguments against women's liberation; Liberal Parents, Radical Children; hundreds of pieces for Commentary, Harper's, Esquire, The Atlantic, National Review (my favorite magazine). 
<p>
	 She was the Executive Director of the Committee for the Free World, Managing Editor of Commentary, the Editor of CBS Legacy Books, Editor at the Hudson Institute, the Executive Editor of Harper's, Book Review Editor of Saturday Review World, and Senior Editor of Basic Books. 
<p>
	She is preparing the Erasmus Lecture to be delivered at the Institute for Religion and Public Life. She is frequently on TV and radio. She is the board chairman of the Clare Booth Luce Fund. She is a board member of the Center for Security Policy. And, most important, she is a board member here at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	When she first joined the Heritage Board she gave a speech saying how delighted she was. She said, "I decided to join the side I was on."  She has done all of these things while quietly raising four children; she is the grandmother of 10. She was heroic and prescient to have signaled, when it was dangerous to do so, the negative impact to be expected from the feminist movement as it gathered steam in the late '60s and '70s.
<p>
	She was heroic to have formed the Committee for the Free World knowing the controversies that would arise by being fervently anti-communist in an era of dtente.
<P>
	She is humorous. How many of us have laughed at her writing and speaking about the foibles of mankind?  Humorous and brilliant, she was ahead of her time; her critics were so wrong.
<P>
	She is humble. She always has time for us. Have you ever noticed that when she talks to you she is really listening?  Not like so many of us, looking over your shoulder ready to get to the next conversation.
<P>
	Father Richard Neuhaus, with whom Midge worked for years, tells of this major figure in the field of public policy disappearing into the mail room to help when there was a crunch.
<P>
	She has boundless energy and commitment. When she was 8 months pregnant with son John and had a 3 year old, a 9 year old, and a 10 year old, she packed, moved, unpacked, and wrote two articles. 
<P>
	 I have known Midge only for a few years, but we have covered a lot: the art and responsibility of raising children, magazine publishing, religion -- you name it. Together, we have marveled at the wonders of the Vatican and wondered about the Albanian definition of luxury. For me, it has been a blessing.
<P>
	I am honored to introduce a truly wonderful woman, Midge Decter.
<P>

MIDGE DECTER: We are gathered here primarily, of course, to celebrate a revolution: that glorious revolution whose anthem was set to music in 1964, whose first shot was fired in 1980, and whose armies are now, at last, in full headlong engagement.
<P>
	Before I begin with my own very particular celebration, however, I want to read you a classified document that was dropped on my desk the other day by a highly confidential source. This document is the transcript of a recent editorial meeting at the New York Times, one of the famous five o'clock meetings, usually presided over by the newspaper's executive editor, at which the next day's major stories are discussed. This particular meeting began with a challenge from the executive editor, who shall hereinafter be designated only as boss editor, to the various department editors. If you would bear with me for a few moments, I should like to read you this transcript verbatim. 
<P>
	 Boss editor: "The issue for today, gentlemen -- and I have to tell you I am both disappointed and disturbed about this -- the issue for today is, why haven't you people been able to tame Newt Gingrich the way we used to tame all the others?" 
<P>
	 The first one to respond is the Arts and Culture editor (who does, from the text here, seem to me to be a touch defensive): "What do you want?  We've just cost the guy four million dollars!"
<P>
	Boss editor: "Yes?  Well, I notice that hasn't stopped him. What about our reporters, for God's sake?  Have you guys so quickly forgotten Woodward and Bernstein and how they once put us to shame?"
<P>
	National news editor: "Boss, my boys are on the case night and day. Hardly an issue goes out that doesn't carry some item or other -- how he wants to starve poor schoolchildren, for instance -- that should be a major embarrassment to him"
<P>
	Here the editorial page editor interrupts: "And how about us?  Admit it, boss, you've never seen such editorials. Not even Ronald Reagan.... "
<P>
	At this point the transcript indicates there is a sudden silence, broken first by a gasp and then by a moan. "Can it be?"  -- this is the boss editor again -- "Can it be?"  everyone present repeats. "Can it be that this guy actually doesn't give a damn about what we think of him?  So what in Heaven's name do we do now?  Has anybody around here got something else for tomorrow's front page?  A new angle on the OJ trial?  A follow-up on last month's witchcraft story?  How about those UFO sightings.... "
<P>
	Here the transcript is cut off. I have read it in part to help you understand that whatever great things Newt Gingrich and Company may have done for the United States of America in general, they have performed one extra great service for regular readers of the New York Times. Truth to tell, they have given us back the pleasure of our morning coffee. 
<p>
	 You see, if you do it at all, you have got to read the Times first thing in the day; if you let it go till later or, God forbid, until evening, you will simply have no time off at all. And whereas for some years now we have been forced to greet each weekday morning -- not even to mention Sunday, oh awful!  -- whereas we have been forced to greet each morning with the newspaper in one hand and a bottle of Pepto Bismol in the other, now the only thing that might disturb our coffee-sipping is an occasional fit of the giggles. 
<P>
	 Just last week, for instance, there was a story about how a newly "resolute" Clinton was at last coming out from under the Republican shadow. He was stepping up his pace, said the Times: first there would be a fund-raising event at the home of Steven Spielberg -- now there's a sign of a real effort to be a resolute leader!  -- and from Steven Spielberg's house to Warm Springs, Georgia, for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Take that, you conservatives!  Indeed, it is hard to know which is more amusing -- the Times's bewilderment in the face of a political development that refuses to fit the paper's long-held cozy assumptions about its importance to the world or the feebleness of its efforts to stand four-square behind a President it deeply despises. 
<P>
	 In any case, cheerful mornings are a very special gift of the 104th Congress to its Times-reading friends, one the Members might be surprised to hear about but which has earned them our deepest thanks all the same. 
<P>
	 I fear some of you may find all this rather frivolous, especially in the face of all our grave national problems. But let me assure you that there has for many years now been no graver problem facing this wonderful country than the establishment press and the mischief it has taken it upon itself to make, from Vietnam to the environment to health care and education to the enthronement of AIDS and homelessness. (Look, I know we are in San Diego, and I understand that the San Diegans may simply be too lucky to understand at first hand the kind of problem with the press that I am talking about. But people who get to read the Union should nevertheless be encouraged to have some compassion for the predicament of others.) 
<P>
	 Now, what has made it possible for the establishment press -- the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Time, Newsweek, and add whatever name you wish to this list -- to make such mischief is the sensitivity of politicians and government officials to the things that are said about them by their enemies. To the extent that there is a new class of legislators more concerned about what they can accomplish than about how they look to the Washington watchers, the media simply lose their power.
<P>
	And if for some reason you should happen to think that the newfound light-mindedness of such powers in the political land as the Times, the network news divisions -- and don't forget that age-old Washington mainstay The New Republic -- the light-mindedness and irrelevance that are nowadays the very hallmark of these institutions are anything other than a leading symptom of the general encroaching senility of liberalism, think again. Let me give you this month's leading example of what I mean by the senescence of liberalism, this time not a confidential document but a widely published and commented-on story. 
<P>
	 It seems that Harvard University recently offered early enrollment to a 19-year-old young lady who turned out on closer inspection to have some five years earlier bludgeoned her mother to death with a crystal candlestick and, when she saw that her mother was dead, stuck a knife into the woman's throat in order, she said, to make it look like a suicide. (A charming story, no?  For any of you who might be new to Heritage meetings, it has commonly been my role to entertain our friends with pleasant stories of this kind.) In any case, for this little mishap the girl received six months in what the papers referred to as a "locked facility."  Well, as you can imagine, poor old Harvard was in a pickle. Might there not be some problem about admitting into its august community an erstwhile matricide?  some officials thought. But on the other hand, said others, might it not be unjust to rescind her acceptance, which, since she was an excellent student, she had after all earned fair and square?
<P>
	It subsequently turned out that Columbia University had also accepted this young lady and has not yet made up its collective mind about what to do should Harvard in the end reject her after all. What has clearly been something of a puzzlement for the community of liberal educators, however, was no problem at all for the New York Times editorialist, who was without a day's hesitation happy to tell the Harvard admissions committee where its duty lay: The only course of justice, said the editorialist, was to accept this girl. She had after all served her six months, and in addition to being an excellent student, she had also helped to tutor poor children.
<P>
	If you were inclined to ask was there anyone, Harvard or no Harvard, from among all the officially designated precincts of liberalism to suggest that perhaps six months in juvenile hall, even with the doors locked, might not be an exactly suitable punishment for offing one's mother, the answer is a ringing no. This, my friends, is not mere senility; this is a political-cultural form of what the psychiatrists call senile dementia. 
<P>
	 Well, let the pundits and the pollsters say what they will, it is not the voters' pocketbooks but, rather, the way that the liberals have come more and more to respond to the horror of stories like mine as if it were merely caseload material for some skilled guidance counselor that really accounts for what happened on November 8th and what will be happening at the polls with greater and greater frequency in the future. People can live with and humor dementia for only so long before they say, "Stop!  This is crazy!  I need to get off!"
<P>
	When they tried to tell us this country is evil, we said, "So's your uncle!"  and went on about our business. When they tried to tell us there was no difference between men and women, we had more important things on our minds and tried to ignore it. When they tried to tell us that taking money away from working people in order to give it to idle people was only justice, we got angry but said, "Go fight city hall!"  When they tried to tell us that people dying of a certain venereal disease called AIDS were entitled on this account to society's special love and most tender consideration and that, besides, we were all potential victims, we were shocked but confused -- until, that is, some of us discovered that the liberal authorities wanted to teach six- and seven- and eight-year-olds how more carefully to go about doing the things that got you this disease. Then we weren't confused any more and understood that what was going on was an effort to recruit all the little kids for what most people called perversion but the liberals called "another lifestyle."
<P>
	For different people among us there were, of course, different straws that did the trick, but whichever it was, for most ordinary, honest people that camel's back has finally and forever been broken.
<P>
	So why are we at this meeting spending our time in serious discussion?  Why aren't we out in the streets dancing around the broken back of liberalism?  The answer is, of course, that we are doing both. (And those of you who are afraid that, given the past 40-45 years, your street-dancing might be a bit rusty, I advise that you see our master dancer Peter Pover, who has over the years lightened the load on many a pair of Heritage feet.) What we are discussing is precisely what we are also celebrating: namely, how to restore the most brilliantly invented government in the history of mankind to its rightful and necessary role both in the world and in the lives of its citizens. 
<P>
	 And yet. And yet. If there is one thing we ought to have learned by now, especially during the years of the Reagan presidency, it is that no President and no legislature can move very far beyond the limits set by the political culture. Newt Gingrich -- I speak of him now as the liberals speak of him: not as that particular man, but as the symbol of the revolution I was talking about -- Newt Gingrich the symbol is not some happy accident; he was prepared for, in meetings like these, by people like you and who knows how many tens of thousands of others, by arguments that have for years now been chipping away at the status quo like so many ax-blows at the base of a rotting tree.
<P>
	That is why, when all the so-called Washington insiders in a tone somewhere between desperation and triumph say things like "See, x percent of the American people don't even know what the Contract with America is," or, "See, this or that amendment to the Constitution hasn't got the votes," or "This or that piece of legislation won't pass the Senate," or "The President will veto it" -- when all the inside dopesters tell you that there really is no revolution, they are engaging in that very special form of rationalizing known as whistling past the graveyard. Deep down, they know that what passes or doesn't pass this year in the halls of Congress is only a pale reflection of what is really going on in this country.
<P>
	Because what is really going on is all of us: Newt and company and Heritage, which has of course already gone way beyond him, and you and me and that vast coalition of people who worry about textbooks, who worry about universities, who worry about the corruption of race relations, who worry about the criminal justice system, who worry about manners and morals, who worry that the greatest medical establishment in the world might be destroyed, who worry about the status of the English language, who worry lest the country be left once again without an adequate defense, who worry that the vast, productive machine that is the American economy is being fettered to the point of paralysis. These are in fact not separate worries; combined, they add up to what you might call Ronald Reagan's prayer: "Make us great again."
<P>
	Now, therefore, is the moment for us to remember that we are not only the makers of a revolution, but the heirs of a revolution -- the greatest and most benign revolution in the history of human affairs -- fought a little more than two hundred years ago by a band of settlers on this continent who believed they were struggling to secure for themselves the rights of free Englishmen and who in the process created the one truly revolutionary system: a system based on the proposition that all men are created equal, by which was meant that all men are created morally equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. This system was not born full-blown, but drew on centuries of experience and centuries'-worth of ideas developed in a country called England and then embodied in a set of political institutions freed up from the dead weight of the past out of which they had been carved. Our revolution, then, is not to make something new, but precisely to return to that system which is our blessed inheritance, to refresh it, and to rescue it from the hands of those who, in arrogance and carelessness and moral greed, have overlaid it with alien structures and ungrateful purposes.
<P>
	Ours is, in a way, actually a harder job than that undertaken by our American forefathers. For we have no new and virgin territory to repair to, but rather what is by now an old land -- the oldest continuing form of government in the world!  -- to clean up. We will not accomplish our purposes overnight, and we must not grow impatient. Each of those worries must be attended to, and none must be scanted.
<P>
	We must not, either, depend on others to do the job for us. We must not make the Newt Gingriches our water-carriers and throw up our hands when they fail. And fail they are bound to do sometimes. (While we are remembering that first revolution, let us remind ourselves that it took that revolution eighty years and a bloody fratricidal war to settle its affairs and another ninety to grant the moral equality of all men to black Americans.) The overlay that I spoke of -- the overlay of alien structures and ungrateful purposes -- has been a long time accumulating; it will not vanish by legislative fiat. 
<P>
	 The job is not only the politicians' to do nor even only the Heritage Foundation's, but ours as well, each and every one of us: as members of communities, as businessmen, as educators, as doctors, as soldiers and sailors, as philanthropists and parents -- perhaps especially as parents -- as churchgoers, as husbands and wives: in general, as citizens on our knees in gratitude for our inheritance from that band of men who once set out to claim the rights of free Englishmen and ended by creating the richest and most powerful of all the nations on Earth.
<P>
	So let us celebrate indeed. Not only what is at long last being accomplished in Washington and in our state legislatures and even maybe -- though I tremble to say it -- in our cities. Let us also celebrate our own need to carry on the fight. It will energize us, this need, and replenish us and keep us younger and more fit than ten thousand hours of running down streets or working out in gyms.
<P>
	One thing more: Many conservatives -- I include myself -- tend to be suspicious of good news. Perhaps it is in our nature as conservatives. We do not easily take yes for an answer. And we are soon to enter that silly season that leads up to presidential elections, where every day we follow the political stock market and feel rich with every up and poor with every down. I would caution us all, especially in honor of the man who at a critical moment was not afraid or embarrassed to say simply, "Make us great again," that it was to us and not to his minions in Washington that he was speaking. So let us pay more attention to what is in our own hands and under our own noses than to that political stock market.
<P>
	In other words, this revolution is not Newt Gingrich, not Phil Gramm, not Bob Dole or Lamar Alexander or... take your pick. It is YOU. What a heavy and happy responsibility!  What a grave and golden opportunity!
<P>
	Long live the revolution!

<title>Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat -- Heritage</title>

<h3>AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Physicians Council Report No. 3<br>
June 20, 1996<br>
</center><hr width=50%>								
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.


	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits.  To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, according to the Heritage analysis.

</i>


	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse.  Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent).  Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent.  With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
<p><i>

</i>
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years, and by that point, the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program:<ol>

 <p><li>Turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  
 
 <p><li>Allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  
 
<p><li>Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.

	</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Policy makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms.  Only the third choice makes any sense, and the quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

<title>  Children And Family In America: Challenges For The 1990s - Heritage</title>

<h3> CHILDREN AND FAMILY IN AMERICA: CHALLENGES FOR THE 1990S </h3><P>

<b> By Wade F.  Horn, Ph.D.</b><br>
July 23, 1991<br>

<P>

     When I walked into my first meeting of the National Commission on
Children, I looked around the room and, observing that two-thirds of
the Commission were liberal Democrats, thought to myself, "What's a
good conservative like me doing in a place like this?"  Indeed, at the
beginning, at least, given the makeup of the Commission, the idea that
the final report would be anything that a conservative could support
seemed to be inconceivable.
<P>
     But, almost two years later, I did vote for the Commission's
final report, something which has prompted many of my friends to ask
me, and some not quite so politely, "What's a supposedly good
conservative like you doing voting for a report like that?"
<P>
     Today, I will attempt to answer that question, hopefully to the
satisfaction of my conservative friends here at The Heritage
Foundation.  But before doing so, I would like to first share my sense
of the status of children and families in America as well as some
basic principles which I believe should guide public policy in this
area.
<P>
     When one reads newspaper accounts of the status of children in
America, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the statistics -- and
some of the statistics are overwhelming:
<P>
 <UL> one million children abused and neglected every year;
<P>
     over 400,000 children living away from their families in
     substitute care;
<P>
     one in five children living in poverty.</UL>
<P>
     Statistics like these makes one wonder if there are any happy
children left in America
<P>
     The fact is, however, that although there are children who are
abused and neglected by their parents, the vast majority of children
are being raised by parents who care for and nurture them; although
there are children who are living away from their families in foster
care, the vast majority of children are living in homes with their own
parents; and although there are too many children living in poverty,
the vast majority of children do live in circumstances where their
material needs are adequately met.  The truth is that most children
are doing quite well, in spite of what we do in Washington.
<P>
     Upside Down View. But many so-called child advocates do not like
to emphasize this side of these statistics.  Instead, many child
advocates like to engage in what I call the "Poseidon Adventure"
school of child welfare -- the proclivity of many child advocacy
groups to turn the world upside down so that it appears that a happy
American childhood is a relic of the past.
<P>
     Adherents to such an upside down view of the world often become
uncomfortable when reminded that most American children are, in fact,
healthy, happy and secure, and living in loving, caring families. 
There was even a moment, about midway through the National
Commission's work, when some Commission members actually expressed
disappointment when told of the results of a public opinion survey,
which the Commission funded, which found that most American families
and communities are alive and well, that most parents are involved in
their children's lives, and that most parents and children feel good
about their family relationships.  It is quite interesting to note
that although the survey was originally intended to be an appendix to
the final report, the Commission's final report neglected to include a
summary of the results of this survey.  In psychology we call that
"selective forgetting."
<P>
     But just because most children in America are, in fact, healthy,
happy and secure, does not mean we should neglect to attend to those
who are at risk, whose chances for success are seriously endangered. 
We know, for example, that every day:
<P>
     <UL>2,500 children are born out of wedlock;
<P>
     700 low birthweight babies are born;
<P>
     135,000 children bring a gun to school;
<P>
     7,700 teenagers become sexually active;
<P>
     1,100 teenagers have abortions;
<P>
     600 teenagers get syphilis or gonorrhea; and
<P>
     6 teenagers commit suicide.</UL>
<P>
     After acknowledging that some children are, indeed, at-risk of
poor developmental outcomes, we must then ask why.  Conventional
wisdom says that families are buffeted by external forces -- economic
or whatever -- that are simply beyond their control.  This answer
drives a policy that relies on government intervention into family
matters.  It's no shock to people in this room that this has
essentially been our family policy for twenty-five years, and it
hasn't worked.
<P>
     I brought a much different perspective to the National Commission
on Children -- that much of what threatens our children results from
individual decisions and behaviors on the part of adults -- decisions
like abusing alcohol and drugs, having children out of wedlock, and
neglecting one's responsibility to support children both emotionally
and financially following a divorce.
<P>
     We know, for example, that adult drug abuse, and especially the
use of "crack cocaine," is the single most important factor behind the
escalating numbers of abused and neglected children in the United
States, as well as the rapid rise in the number of foster care
placements.  We also know that perhaps as many as 375,000 children
each year are starting off life already handicapped because parents
chose to "share" their drug habit with their unborn child.
<P>
     We also have a popular culture which chooses to, on a daily
basis, bombard developing children with messages that drugs are cool,
teenage sex is wonderful, parents don't know anything, and hard work
is for nerds.
<P>
     Mythology of Relativism. But perhaps most devastating of all, is
the fact that our culture has spent the last several decades deeply
inculcating a mythology -- the mythology of family relativism -- the
misguided belief that family structure is irrelevant, that no
configuration of family is better than any other.  Indeed, the need to
even form a family is questioned.  Family relativism lets us stop
worrying about many of our children, because it tells us that divorce
and single parenting have no real impact upon children.  And it
convinces us that something called "quality time" makes up for
unconnected parents.
<P>
     And how successful this mythology has been.  About half of
today's children will spend some time in a single-parent family before
they reach the age of 16.  Many children will attain single-parent
family status through divorce.  About half of all marriages today will
end in divorce and about one-half of all children whose parents do
divorce will experience a second divorce before they are 16 years old.
<P>
     For many other children the pathway to single-parent families is
through the failure of family formation.  Today, over 25 percent of
children now begin life in a single parent household; among blacks,
the figure is over 60 percent.
<P>
     Most Important Variable. The increasing numbers of children being
raised in single parent households is important because family
structure is the most important variable related to successful
outcomes for children.  As a group, children from one-parent families
exhibit above average rates of youth suicide, mental and physical
illness, violence, and drug use.  And the connection between crime and
single-parent homes is so strong that, when one controls for family
configuration, the relationship between crime and race as well as
crime and low-income disappears.
<P>
     There is also a strong relationship between single-parenting and
being raised in poverty.  According to David Elwood, single-mother
families have a poverty rate, after government transfers, of 38
percent, as compared to only 6 percent for two-parent families. 
Seventy-three percent of children in this country growing up in
single-parent families are poor for some time before age ten, as
compared to only 20 percent of children living in two-parent families. 
Indeed, the real reason more children are living in poverty today
compared to two decades ago is not because of any supposed decimation
of domestic spending by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, but
because the proportion of all children living in single-parent
households has more than doubled from 11 percent in 1970 to 25 percent
in 1990.
<P>
     This is particularly striking for blacks, where over the past two
decades the poverty rate for black children in single parent
households has remained nearly constant at about 65 percent, whereas
the poverty rate for black children in two-parent families actually
declined from 26 percent in 1970 to 19 percent in 1988.  The reason
why poverty among black children continues to be high despite
declining poverty rates for black children growing up in two-parent
families is that many more black children are being brought up in
single-parent families today compared to just two decades ago.
<P>
     Yet despite this mounting evidence, the connection between
single-parenting and poor outcomes for children has largely been
ignored in the development of public policy.  As Karl Zinsmeister
wrote in the June 1990 issue of the Atlantic Monthly:
<P>
    <UL> For the past quarter century American public policy has
     shied away from the idea that certain family forms are more
     desirable than others.  There is no attempt to promote child
     bearing within wedlock.  There is little penalty attached to
     child abandonment.  There is scant recognition of the social
     benefits of marriage, or of the social contributions of
     those who devote themselves to conscientious childrearing. 
     There is no reward from our public programs for standing by
     kith and kin.</UL>
<P>
     And a family that remains a family today spends less time being a
family.  William Mattox pointed out in last winter's Policy Review
that "parents today spend 40 percent less time with their children
than did parents in 1965."  A quote Mattox uses from Harvard
University child psychiatrist Robert Coles is a concise description of
the legacy of family relativism:
<P>
    <UL> Parents are too busy spending their most precious capital --
     their time and their energy -- struggling to keep up with
     MasterCard payments.  They're depleted.  They work long
     hours to barely keep up, and when they get home at the end
     of the day they're tired.  And their kids are left with a
     Nintendo or a pair of Nikes or some other piece of crap. 
     Big deal.</UL>
<P>
     Given this situation, what should be the proper role of
government in addressing these issues.  I believe that several
principles should guide us:
<P>
     First, the federal government should play an important leadership
role by elevating the discussion of these issues through "bully
pulpit" activities and by inspiring others to focus their resources
and energies on addressing these pressing concerns.  Department of
Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.  Louis Sullivan has been
especially effective in using this "bully pulpit" to elevate these
issues through his calls for the resurgence of a "culture of
character" and "communities of concern," as well as his advocacy of
healthy lifestyles.
<P>
     Second, we need to examine current social policies to determine
which may create perverse incentives that actually cause family
dissolution or a failure to form in the first place.  There are, for
example, instances where rents in public housing authorities skyrocket
should a single mother choose to marry.  And there is mounting
evidence that no-fault divorce laws may make family breakup too easy
an option, by leading to the impression that there is such a thing as
a "relatively painless divorce" -- a notion that is never true when
children are involved.
<P>
     Third, while government should continue to provide cash and non-
cash assistance to those who find themselves in poverty due to
circumstances beyond their control, there should be a recognition of a
reciprocity in government benefit programs -- that is, if one gets,
one has an obligation to give something back.  That was one of the
ideas behind the Family Support Act, as well as programs like Mom's
Place in Pennsylvania where single moms get quality child care in
exchange for going to school, getting good grades, and cleaning up the
center at the end of the child care day.
<P>
     Fourth, government needs to ensure that money earned by the
working poor is money brought home by the working poor.  That was the
idea behind the recent expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
<P>
     Fifth, the federal government should continue to fund well-
targeted programs designed to promote familial self-sufficiency by
combatting parental behaviors that tend to perpetuate long-term
welfare dependency -- programs like Head Start and JOBS.  But in doing
so, we should be careful not to confuse good intentions for effective
programs.  Consequently, before bringing every "good idea" to scale,
we should engage in the difficult work of determining program
effectiveness through research and evaluation studies.
<P>
     Finally, government programs and services should always be
designed to empower parents and strengthen families through maximizing
choice and local control of programs.
<P>
     So how does all of this square with the final report of the
National Commission on Children?  First, it is important to state that
I do not agree with everything contained within the final report. 
Indeed, I have some significant reservations about the final report
which I highlight in my letter of reservation contained in an appendix
in the report.  But there is much that I do endorse.
<P>
     First of all, the Commission resisted the temptation of "Poseidon
Adventure" thinking, and actually kept the statistical thinking right-
side-up, stating in the opening paragraph of the report that:
<P>
 <UL> Most American children are healthy, happy, and secure.  They
     belong to warm, loving families.  For them, life is filled
     with the joys of childhood -- growing, exploring, learning
     and dreaming -- and tomorrow is full of hope and promise.</UL>
<P>
     Similarly, the report states in the chapter on preparing
adolescents for adulthood:
<P>
    <UL> The majority of young people emerge from adolescence
     healthy, hopeful, and able to meet the challenges of adult
     life... They are progressing in school, they are not
     sexually active, they do not commit delinquent acts, and
     they do not use drugs or alcohol.</UL>
<P>
     Furthermore, the Commission did what it had to do if it wanted to
be honest to its mission of helping children -- it rejected family
relativism.  Indeed, one of the guiding principles for the entire
report states:
<P>
    <UL> Children do best when they have the personal involvement and
     material support of a father and a mother and when both
     parents fulfill their responsibility to be loving providers.
<P>
     Even more incredibly, the report goes on to state:
<P>
     Rising rates of divorce, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and
     absent parents are not just manifestations of alternative
     lifestyles, they are patterns of adult behavior that
     increase children's risk of negative consequences.
<P>
     And:
<P>
     There can be little doubt that having both parents living
     and working together in a stable marriage can shield
     children from a variety of risks.</UL>
<P>
     Not exactly a death knell perhaps, but plenty to make the
faithful followers of family relativism nervous.

     Talking About Values. In addition, the Commission report actually
talks about values, and about morals.  Not just talks about it, but
devotes an entire chapter to it, entitled "Creating a Moral Climate
for Children."  The very existence of this chapter reflects the belief
of the Commission that not all problems are solved by government
programs, but rather are best overcome by developing moral values in
children, and, in the words of Secretary Sullivan, a "culture of
character."
<P>
     And now we've got the moral relativists on the phone to the
family relativists, and they're both wondering what in the world
happened.
<P>
     Significantly, the Commission also endorsed public school choice. 
While not going as far as I and other members wanted to go -- which is
to include private schools as well -- it is a major push for parental
empowerment, and a recognition that the current educational
establishment is failing our nation's schools.
<P>
     And finally, the report reflects the view that the most effective
ways to help families achieve economic self-sufficiency are to:  1)
encourage the formation and stability of two-parent families; 2) make
work pay through the Earned Income Tax Credit; and 3) develop a
strategy for countering the decade-long tilt in the tax code against
families with children.
<P>
 <UL> For example, the report states:
<P>
     Clearly, living in a stable, two-parent family with one or
     both parents employed is the child's best hope for escaping
     poverty and having his or her basic material needs met. 
     Government should therefore actively encourage work,
     independence, and strong families.</UL>
<P>
     Flawed Proposals. Unfortunately, the Commission's major proposal
of a $1,000 refundable tax credit for children is flawed by a failure
of the liberal majority to explicitly tie the refundable nature of the
tax credit to a reduction in other government benefit programs.  As an
"add on" to welfare, such a refundable tax credit could potentially
lead to an increase in single-parenting, a violation of one of the
report's guiding principles.
<P>
     The report is also flawed by its failure to develop a reasonable
plan for paying for its proposals.  It's fair to say that a majority,
if not all, of the liberal Commissioners supported some sort of tax
increase -- although most of their ideas for increasing taxes reflect
the traditional liberal philosophy of, "I won't tax you, I won't tax
me, so I'll tax that guy behind the tree!"
<P>
     Some of us, on the other hand, considered the notion of paying
for a cut in taxes by raising taxes as ludicrous, and circular
thinking at its worst.  In our view, a program designed to support
families can not further erode their economic power with new taxes. 
More reasonable approaches put forth by a minority of members of the
Commission involved curtailing federal spending by cutting some
expenditures or capping growth in domestic spending.
<P>
     The Commission also did not reach consensus on health care.  The
liberal Democrats on the Commission endorsed a national health
insurance scheme which is essentially a repeat of the recommendations
of the Pepper Commission -- a previous Rockefeller-chaired commission
that also could not reach consensus on this issue.  Unfortunately, as
we stated in our minority chapter on health, the Rockefeller-endorsed
"play or pay" proposal would invariably lead to higher taxes, a
substantial loss of jobs, and discrimination against employees with
families -- a result which I find unconscionable for a National
Commission supposedly concerned about the welfare of families with
children.
<P>
     Positive Results Also. Nonetheless, and despite these
shortcomings and unfortunate events, I believe the message of the
report isn't lost, and shouldn't be wasted by conservatives.  For
years now we have been attacking mainstream policy thought as off the
mark, completely missing the issues and concerns that really matter to
families, and that can really make a difference to children.  The
result has been, as Zinsmeister says, a public policy that provides
"no reward... for standing by kith and kin."
<P>
     Now we have a report that pushes two-parent families, recognizes
the importance of values and morality, endorses school choice, and
acknowledges that what families need is not more government programs,
but to be allowed to keep more of the money they earn.
<P>
     The report has also helped to further sharpen the distinctions
between conservatives and liberals -- concerning both the proper role
for government in family matters and the way we pay for government. 
For example, the existence of two health chapters indicates that
liberals are for government mandates without regard for costs, either
in terms of increased taxes or job loss.  Liberals apparently are even
willing to tolerate discrimination against employees with families in
the name of government mandates.  Conservatives, on the other hand,
believe in empowering consumers and permitting undistorted markets to
function in medical care and health insurance as a means of providing
the best health care for the most people while targeting public
programs to those most in need.  In addition, the lack of consensus on
how to pay for the report's recommendations reveals that liberals
continue to refuse to even flinch at the idea of raising taxes,
whereas conservatives believe government should do everything it can
to keep taxes low and federal budget deficits small.
<P>
     But there is a danger in the report.  It may be, as some suspect,
that the liberals on the Commission didn't really believe in any of
the conservative rhetoric contained in the report and only agreed to
include it in order to obtain a unanimous vote.  Perhaps that's why
the title of the report, chosen after the final vote, reads "Beyond
Rhetoric."  So we must work hard at holding the liberal Commissioners'
feet to the fire, and insist that they remain true to the rhetoric and
message of the report.  We must constantly remind the liberal
Commission members that they endorsed the idea that the best way out
of poverty is not some government program, but rather for single
parents to get and stay married.  We must remind them that they
endorsed the idea of school choice precisely because the present
school establishment has failed our nation's children.  And we must
remind them that they endorsed the idea that the mass media must be
more responsible in their messages to children regarding drugs, sex
and hard work because moral values are important -- and in the long
run even more important than government programs.  Then let them
answer why "good liberals like them voted for a report like this."

<P>


<UL>      I believe it is time for a new era in environmental
      protection which uses the market to help us get our
      environment back on track - to recognize that Adam Smith's
      invisible hand can have a green thumb... [In] certain
      settings, this results-oriented approach can cut compliance
      costs, shrink regulatory bureaucracies, enlist corporate
      support, take environmental policy away from the
      specialists and lobbyists, and open it up more to the
      general public.<BR>
                   <I>  Bill Clinton,<BR> 
                     Drexel University, Earth Day, April 22, 1992.</I></UL>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
<P>      President-elect Clinton, if you really intend to use market
forces to reach reasonable environmental objectives, and make results
the test for legislative or regulatory action, that truly would be a
welcome and positive change in environmental policy. To accomplish
this sensible change, you will need to address a number of issues from
a fresh perspective. If you do so, you have the opportunity to end the
traditional conflict that pits environmental protection against jobs,
and give substance to your campaign claim that the conflict is a
"false choice."

<P> If you do not approach environmental policy in this different
way, however, and instead merely add a new layer of environmental
regulations to existing ones, you are doomed to fail not in only your
economic mission, but in your environmental mission as well. Contrary
to the "false choice" argument, today's environmental policies
generally do pit environmental protection against jobs. And the longer
the list of environmental regulations, the longer the unemployment
lines. 

 <P>     To give Adam Smith a green thumb, as you say you wish to do,
will require carefully crafted action on environmental issues. Five in
particular will confront your new Administration: 
<P>
1) Superfund. Superfund legislation will be up for reauthorization
      next year, providing an excellent opportunity for reform.
<P>
2)    Global Warming and Carbon Taxes. Last year's Earth Summit did
      not put this issue to rest. There is likely to be a bill
      introduced in Congress to combat the alleged global warming
      problem, through the creation of a tax on carbon dioxide
      emissions.
<P>
3)    Fuel Economy Standards. There is certain to be legislation
      introduced to raise the average fuel economy for a car maker's
      fleet to 40-45 miles per gallon.
<P>
4)    Wetlands. Wetlands disputes continued throughout the Bush
      Administration without resolution. This year, the final
      resolution of the subject will rest on your shoulders.
<P>
5)    Solid Waste and Recycling. Solid waste legislation is up for
      reauthorization, and some in Congress wish to alter radically
      the substance of the Act.

<P> Addressing these and other environmental issues from the sound
approach you have outlined requires you to shape policies using three
underlying techniques:

<P>Use of markets and property rights where possible to distribute
environmental "goods" efficiently and equitably. This will help you to
promote conservation and reduce pollution to acceptable levels. 
<P>
Base policies on sound and credible science, to ensure that problems
are real, and to determine the true levels of risk. This will mean
ignoring orchestrated media hysteria and "expert" testimony by movie
stars, and asking instead for hard scientific evidence.
<P>
Develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent
of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing
that harm to acceptable levels. This will allow Americans to receive
the maximum environmental "bang for the buck" -- or to achieve
environmental objectives with the fewest pink slips for American
workers. 

<P> Applying these techniques to the major environmental issues
before you suggest a number of specific actions you should take.
<P>SUPERFUND
<P>
Action 1: Require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set
immediately a specific cancer risk level that it defines as an
unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA can choose between different risk
levels to apply in its determination of whether a particular site
poses a cancer risk. This gives arbitrary power to bureaucrats without
giving Americans a guaranteed degree of safety. 
<P>
Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. Sites should be listed for remediaton only if they actually
will expose people to risk.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA to develop within six months a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site. It is unnecessary to clean-up all
sites to the same degree; some pose more risk than others.
<P>
Action 4: Draw up a priority list for clean-up of orphan Superfund
sites based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, the exposure
classification, and the estimated remediation costs. Essentially the
list should correspond to a formula, determining overall risk per
dollar of remediation costs. This will end the current system of
relying on ad hoc decisions as to which sites are more important.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites. This will reduce the
overall cost borne by the government.
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance. This
will ensure that monies remain available for remediation even if the
private party goes bankrupt. Meanwhile, society's economic resources
will not be squandered on sites that may never pose a threat.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability. Joint and several liability currently applies
to findings of liability for remediation of Superfund sites. This
means that those responsible for only minute quantities of hazardous
waste become liable for the full costs of multi-million-dollar clean-
ups. Further, innocent owners who purchased their property before
passage of Superfund legislation should not be liable for the clean-up
of their property since they neither contaminated the sites nor were
given notice of liability. 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued support for increasing funding levels for
global climate change research. Most of what we know about global
warming has been learned within the last three to four years, thanks
to increased research. This trend should continue.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant government archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns. This would allow
researchers to gain access to a wealth of raw data collected over the
decades by America's intelligence agencies. Any access must, of
course, be tightly controlled and limited to this purpose.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. A carbon tax would cause the loss of an estimated
600,000 jobs and cost the nation approximately $100 billion per year.
This is too great a price to pay to insure against the possible
consequences of an unproven theory in light of more reasonable
approaches -- such as increasing the knowledge base.
<P>
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE) 
<P>
Action 1: Announce immediately that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards regulate the average miles per gallon that a car maker's
fleet must obtain. Advocates of raising the current standard from 27.5
mpg to 40 or 45 mpg ignore the fact that this policy change will
result in thousands of avoidable highway fatalities.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees. These would be directly proportional to the amount of
pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes, making polluters pay the
costs of their actions.
<P>
WETLANDS
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States." These would include wetlands where the physical structure or
location of the wetlands makes it impossible for pollutants to migrate
to a "water of the United States" -- the term used in legislation --
via normal water flows. This will return the protection of wetlands to
its original meaning.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of their
confiscated property rights when development is denied to protect
societally beneficial wetlands. It antithetical to the American system
of government not to do so. If government confiscation of private
property rights benefits the public, the public should pay for it --
not some hapless landowner.
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands -- even those where
pollutants cannot migrate to "waters of the United States" -- enact a
Wetland Protection Act giving EPA the authority to do so. Currently,
the authority is lacking.
<P>
SOLID WASTE
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation. This will allow the nation to devote
its scarce economic resources to truly important environmental
problems.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order to
eliminate most of the current costly landfill regulations and require
financial assurances from operators. This will allow operators to
devise the least costly way to contain pollutants. This order should
require landfill operators to provide financial assurances, such as
interest bearing bonds, to assure compliance or funds for clean-up. 
<P>
      President-elect Clinton, you said during your Earth Day speech
last year that you prefer using markets to regulation. Now is the time
to translate that preference into public policy. This will take
backbone. Although you want to "open [environmental policy] up more to
the general public" by instituting market reforms, you will face
fierce opposition from environmental lobbyists that have a strong
vested interest in the regulatory status quo. But if you wish to use
markets to increase protection of the environment without destroying
jobs in the process, you must fundamentally overhaul the methods used
by government.

<P> Specifically, you must replace Superfund and landfill regulation
with a system of financial assurances. You also must substitute for
CAFE standards, which needlessly squander lives, a system of fees
based on the amount of pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes.
You must pay landowners for the value of the property taken in
wetlands-regulating confiscation. And you must quickly and
exponentially increase our knowledge of the global warming issue
through fostering increased research and by opening up the relevant
archives. Simultaneously, you should resist imposing a economically
devastating carbon tax that will throw hundreds of thousands of
Americans out of work to address what may be a theory full of "hot
air."

<P> Finally, and most important, you must create a priority list of
environmental concerns. Base this list on the extent of the harm
caused by the problem divided by the cost to address the problem. This
will provide you with a mechanism to obtain the maximum environmental
protection possible for the amount of economic resources used. Without
this list, costs will be needlessly high and environmental protection
will be needlessly low.
<P>
SUPERFUND: REFORM BASED ON RISK 

<P> The Superfund legislation was enacted in 1980, under the formal
name of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act or CERCLA (pronounced sir-kluh). CERCLA has failed
utterly in its mission of cleaning up old hazardous waste sites.
Billions of dollars have been spent, but large portions of this money
has been spent on legal costs, not clean-up. In fact, only 149 of the
1,275 listed superfund sites have been cleaned up. To clean the
remaining sites, EPA's costs alone -- excluding the costs to
businesses and insurance companies -- will run approximately $40
billion. Also many more sites will be listed, thus driving costs up
even higher. Total costs to the nation in the next thirty years are
estimated at $300 billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office,
"Superfund Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) 

<P> Although EPA has considerably improved its oversight management
of this program since the mid-1980s, the agency still has a long way
to go. Many of the factors evaluated in the site listing process are
given varying importance, depending on the particular EPA decision-
maker. The uncertainty and poor decision-making that can result from
this practice needs to end. Moreover, Congress should recognize that,
while the legislation was well-intentioned, it has become a vehicle to
prosecute innocent landowners and businesses through the liability
laws applicable under CERCLA. Not only that, the distorted legal
framework for findings of liability unnecessarily depresses the real
estate market by discouraging lenders from making loans. Bills have
been introduced in Congress and rules have been proposed by EPA to
resolve this problem. (For example, in Congress, H.R. 4494 was
introduced by Representative John LaFalce and S. 2827 was introduced
by Senator Jake Garn in 1990; the proposed EPA rule was published in
the Federal Register, June 24, 1991, 5(121), p.28798.) But the issue
remains unsolved. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd S. Dixon, Superfund and
Transaction Costs: The Experiences of Insurers and Very Large
Industrial Firms," The Institute for Civil Justice, Rand, 1992.)
Congress should remedy this situation.
<P>
The key changes needed:
<P>
Action 1: Require EPA to set immediately a specific cancer risk level
that it defines as an unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA uses a range of "risks" to define when the
probability of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an
acceptable risk to an unacceptable risk. So one EPA official may
consider a site to be "hazardous," and thus subject to Superfund
legislation, if the risk of cancer from the materials at the site is
one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But another EPA official may use
a risk level of one in a million to determine if a site is
"hazardous." Still others may use various different risk levels,
depending on the site being examined. 

<P>      There is no justification for using a range of risk. The problem
is obvious. This range results in some unnecessary site clean-ups and
some sites remaining unlisted which possibly should be cleaned up.
("Striking a Better Balance: Improving Superfund Clean-up Decisions,"
Report to Coalition on Superfund, Arthur D. Little, Inc., May 1992,
page 18.)

<P> Mr. Clinton, you should instruct EPA to choose a single,
specific risk level that is acceptable, and to justify that decision.
From that point onward, EPA's discretion to pick an arbitrary standard
should cease.

<P>Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. 
<P>      The Office of Technology Assessment has found that clean-up
decisions at the majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical
future risks rather than on actual or likely risks. ("Coming Clean:
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved... ," Office of Technology
Assessment, October, 1989.) This means that remote or inaccessible
contaminated sites that pose no current or even any likely future
danger to people's health are given just as high a priority as sites
that expose people to a real present danger.

 <P>     Superfund sites should instead be classified based on categories
of actual, likely, and potential risks of human exposure to the site.
The way to do this, Mr. Clinton, is for you to instruct EPA by
executive order to classify sites according to these categories. The
exposure level risks within each category should be given a numerical
weight by the EPA so that the relative risk of each site can be
determined.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA within six months to develop a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site, such as an industrial or residential
area. 
<P>      Within each site type, EPA would then assign a different level
of clean-up required, with justification for the designated level. For
instance, in a residential area, where the risk of exposure to
children playing in contaminated soil is relatively high, the de-
contaminated soil would need to be cleaner than the de-contaminated
soil in, say, a warehouse park, where less direct exposure would be
anticipated. A range of clean-up requirements of this kind would cut
Superfund compliance costs at some sites enormously, thus reducing
CERCLA's burden on the economy.
<P>
Action 4: Based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, draw up
a priority list for Superfund clean-up.
<P>      To deal with this, you should instruct EPA to develop a priority
list for superfund clean-up. This priority list would be based on the
exposure classification and the type of site, as well as estimated
remediation costs. The list would be derived from a formula allowing
EPA to arrive at an overall risk per dollar of remediation costs. This
can be accomplished by issuing an executive order.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites.
<P>      Whenever solvent liable parties cannot be found to clean up old
hazardous sites, the government becomes responsible for these "orphan"
sites. Contractors for orphan site remediation often have been paid
substantial sums even if no work is performed. Worse, contractors that
fail to clean up a site properly increase the total costs borne by the
government -- and ultimately the taxpayer.

<P>      Under new rules, lowest-bid contractors of orphan sites should
be required to post an interest-bearing bond when awarded remediation
contracts. This would ensure that monies were available for
remediation if the contractor improperly cleaned the site or became
insolvent. Contractors should be made legally liable for the
remediation and be given total freedom to choose methods of clean-up
without permission from the government. If the contractor failed to
remediate the site adequately for any reason, then the bond would
become forfeit and another contractor could be selected and paid with
the bond proceeds. (See Richard Stroup, "Selling Orphan (Superfund)
Sites," Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, Montana, September
25, 1988.)
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance.
<P>      In dealing with potential, or low priority, Superfund sites, EPA
is faced with a dilemma. If solvent liable parties can be identified,
the government is encouraged to require remediation; if it waits, the
liable parties may become insolvent, leaving the government with an
orphan site. Yet the site may never pose a threat to warrant clean-up.
To avoid the unnecessary costs resulting from this situation, liable
parties should be required to provide assurance.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability.
<P>      Two particular changes are needed. The first is to eliminate
joint and several liability. This concept is a sham designed to find
somebody -- anybody -- other than Uncle Sam to pay for clean-ups of
hazardous waste. Under the doctrine the "responsible" person often has
no part or only a small part in creating the waste problem. If, say,
someone has caused 2 percent of a hazardous waste problem, that
individual or institution will become liable for the full cost of the
remedy. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" pays
for the clean-up of wastes created by another individual or firm. The
law should be amended to require that the percentage of clean-up costs
for which an individual or body is liable is no greater than the
percentage of the contamination they contributed.

<P>      The second necessary change is to divorce the status of property
ownership from findings of liability. 

<P>      What happens today is that a landowner who bought property that
was contaminated before 1980, when Superfund was enacted, is legally
responsible for the total cost of clean-up. Yet the owner neither
caused the waste nor could be given notice of liability for any clean-
up, since Superfund was not law at the time. This ownership basis for
liability leads to a host of problems. One is that it makes lending
institutions wary of repossessing properties in default because the
lender would then become liable for cleaning up any old hazardous
wastes that may be on the property. And since the collateral provides
less security because the lender is wary of foreclosure, the lenders
are less willing to make loans. This depresses segments of the real
estate market. (See footnotes 2 and 3 and accompanying text for a
brief description of actions proposed to correct this problem.) 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
  <P>    Global warming, also known as the "enhanced greenhouse effect,"
is a theory that has gained growing attention over the last decade.
Basically the theory predicts that human-caused greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide will increase the average temperature of the earth.
This theory is the mirror image of the ice age theory popular about
fifteen or twenty years ago. Although the vast majority of climate
change scientists do not believe a runaway greenhouse effect will
occur, a vocal minority has maintained its probability. 

<P>      Although a severe greenhouse effect is improbable, whether more
minor atmospheric changes will occur within the next century is
subject to much debate. (John Shanahan, "Guide to the Global Warming
Issue," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.) If
warming does occur, however, most of the temperature increase would
occur at night and at high latitudes, which could be beneficial,
rather than increasing daytime high temperatures. Moreover, most of
the models upon which climate change predictions are premised have
been flawed. For instance, one of the most widely known models
effectively moved the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.
(The study, by Sukryo Munabe and Richard Wetherald of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1975 noted that it
had increased the sun's output by 6 percent above its actual output,
which is equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer
to the sun. Still other models have incorrectly forecast that clouds
warm the earth, but new studies show that clouds actually cool the
earth; this is significant since cloud cover is increasing. V.

Ahmad, D. Hartmann, "Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from
the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6,
1989.)
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued levels of research funding on global
climate change.
<P>      Most of what scientists know about global climate change has
been learned within the last three to four years due to the Bush
Administration's massive research effort. The U.S. now spends about
$1.4 billion per year -- more than all other nations on earth combined
-- on climate research, and the funding has been going up at the rate
of about 25 percent per year. It is likely that our knowledge will
grow ten-fold again within the next five years.

<P>Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant federal archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns.
<P>      The scientific debate over global warming could be improved if
you would order agencies to open up the relevant national archives to
researchers -- subject to legitimate national security concerns, such
as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and oceanic
vessels have collected a vast amount of data that can be used to
accelerate research. For example, the material could help resolve
questions about past contours and thaw rates of polar caps, ocean
chemistry, and many other issues.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. 
 <P>     Action to limit carbon dioxide emissions to lessen the effects
of the theoretical runaway greenhouse effect will be costly to jobs
and put an undue burden on household budgets. Yet there is no firm
evidence that runaway global warming will occur -- in fact, according
to a survey by the environmental group Geenpeace, the vast majority of
scientists believe it will not. (Greenpeace Press Release, "Climate
Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global Warming, Poll Shows,"
February 9, 1992.)

   <P>   Taxes on carbon emissions are popularly viewed as the best way
to reduce carbon output levels to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But if
carbon taxes are imposed, many Americans would be thrown out of jobs.
A study by the CONSAD Research Corporation found that five years after
the imposition of a $100 per ton carbon tax -- the tax amount needed
to reduce carbon to 1990 levels -- some 600,000 jobs would be lost.
The tax also would reduce total GNP by approximately 2 percent, or
$100 billion. (Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a
Response to Global Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels,"
August 1990.) This is the equivalent to a $1,250 tax on every
household in America. The price of basic goods would rise
substantially. For instance, according to the Department of Energy,
electrical and natural gas heating costs would rise by 27 percent.
("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United States," U.S.
Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis, Deputy Under
Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September 1991.)

<P>      A study by the George C. Marshall Institute has found that "a
five year delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree [Celsius],
compared to how warm it would be if there was no delay." (see Marshall
Institute, "Global Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings"
(Washington, D.C. 1992).) Since our knowledge will increase
dramatically in those five years, and the theory may well prove false
or overstated, taking expensive action now probably would be
foolhardy.
<P>
      
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE)
<P>      Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards , enacted in
1975 in response to the oil crisis of 1973, were designed to stabilize
oil at low prices. Today, CAFE mandates that automobile manufacturers
build cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon.

 <P>     Today, the primary support for CAFE standards comes from the
environmental community, which is concerned with energy conservation
and the perceived threat of global warming, (Global warming is
addressed in the following section.) which, if it is occurring, would
be exacerbated by carbon emissions from cars. Unfortunately, CAFE is
the wrong tool to address these concerns, and a dangerous one.
Alternative policies would be far less burdensome and far more
effective.

<P>      The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it bluntly,
is that they kill people. According to economists Robert Crandall of
the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of
Public Health, 1989 model cars are about 500 pounds lighter than they
would have been in the absence of the 27.5 miles per gallon fuel
economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight
reduction will result in 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional
serious injuries for the model year fleet. (Robert W. Crandall and
John D. Graham, "New Fuel-Economy Standards, The Politics of Energy,"
The American Enterprise, March/April 1991, p. 68.)

 <P>     If fuel efficiency standards are raised further, even more
deaths can be anticipated. If the standard is raised to 40 mpg, deaths
will likely surge to between 4,800 to 8,600 additional deaths per
model year fleet. That is why Bush Energy Secretary Admiral James
Watkins referred to a 1991 bill to raise CAFE standards as the
"Highway Death Act of 1991." (For further information, see William G.
Laffer III, "Auto Cafe Standards: Unsafe and Unwise At Any Level,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 825, April 19, 1991.)

<P>      Proponents of raising the standards will tell you that, if
standards are phased in slowly, car makers will be able to make cars
just as safe through technological improvement, even if they are
lighter, or that cars will be more efficient so that car weights will
not need to be reduced. Both arguments may be true, but they miss the
point. If lighter cars in the future will be more safe, future cars
with today's weights will be safer still. Similarly, if future cars
can be made more fuel-efficient at today's weights, then they can be
made just as efficient as today's cars, but at heavier weights. In
either case, thousands more Americans will die each year as a direct
result of the CAFE standards.
<P>
Action 1: Immediately announce that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards.
 <P>     This legislation will surely be forthcoming in your first year
in office. If CAFE legislation receives your signature, the political
responsibility for those deaths will rest squarely on your shoulders.
Press stories that question whether Johnny who crashed into a
telephone pole would have lived but for "Clinton's CAFE Act" could
well result.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees.
<P>      Instead of relying on regulatory bureaucracies, Mr. Clinton, it
is time, in your own words, to use "the market to get our environment
back on track." In areas of the country with air pollution problems,
fees should be assessed according to the severity of the local
pollution problem, the emission level of each individual vehicle, and
the number of miles each vehicle is driven. Since 50 percent of all
car pollution is caused by 10 percent of the cars, this will provide a
powerful economic incentive for owners of polluting cars to tune up or
scrap their cars. CAFE standards, on the other hand, place financial
penalties on those Americans who buy new cars, which are already the
cleanest cars on the road.
<P>
WETLANDS PROTECTION ISSUES 
<P>      Wetlands loss has been extensive since the founding of the
nation. An estimated 53 percent of the original number of acres has
been lost -- still leaving over 100 million acres. ("Natural Resources
Management Issues," General Accounting Office, Transition Series,
December 1992.) Moreover, most of the loss was attributable to
government draining of mosquito-infested swamplands or wetlands that
hampered navigation of waterways. (Ironically, the government agency
that drained these wetlands -- the Army Corps of Engineers -- now has
as its primary mission the enforcement of wetlands regulations.)
Today, less than one-fourth of one percent of the total is lost
yearly, and much of this small amount serves no ecologically
beneficial purpose. 

 <P>     Wetlands are currently protected under Sections 301 and 404 of
the 1977 Clean Water Act (CWA). This law regulates the discharge of
pollutants into "waters of the United States." (This term, while
ill-defined, should properly be construed to inlcude any water body
from which discharged pollutants could migrate via natural water flows
into interstate waterways.) But wetlands regulation has gone beyond
the authority granted or intended during passage of the Act. Instead,
EPA has used Sections 301 and 404 as a way to protect all wetlands for
their ecological value, such as waterfowl habitat. (For further
information, see William G. Laffer, III, "Protecting Ecologically
Valuable Wetlands Without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 840, July 15, 1990. Note that the
Delineation Manuel described in Laffer's paper is the 1989 Manual; the
Manual currently in effect is the 1987 Delineation Manual to which
EPA's regulatory authority has been returned. Nevertheless, EPA still
protects all wetlands for their ecological value regardless of what
criteria are used to define wetlands.) The EPA also has been depriving
landowners of the value of their properties without compensating them
for their loss, forcing many into bankruptcy. While there have been
ongoing court challenges, the results have been unclear, and have
merely fueled further litigation. In fact, wetlands regulation has now
become so inflexible that it has led to many outrageous or ridiculous
results. For instance, wetlands rules have blocked construction of low
income housing all over the country, delayed construction of shelter
for the homeless in Alaska for over a year, and even resulted in the
jailing of one environmentalist for making duck ponds. (Ibid. See also
"EPA's Most Wanted," The Wall Street Journal, November 18, 1992, p.
A16.) 

 <P>     Throughout the Bush Administration's term, there was a
fluctuating stance towards wetlands protection. The problem in part
stemmed from the lack of a clear objective. Additionally, the
litigation costs due to the government's dubious authority under
current law have been enormous, thus creating an unnecessary drain on
the economy. You will need to rectify this situation if you wish to
prioritize environmental concerns, and to minimize unnecessary
economic expenditures. Otherwise, it will be one more roadblock in
your economic agenda.

<P>      To do this, Mr. Clinton, you need to take urgent action:
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States."
<P>      EPA's policy should be this: only if pollutants discharged into
a wetland can migrate via natural water flows into other water bodies,
such as streams, rivers, and lakes should government intervene.
(Ibid.) This will return wetlands protection to its original meaning.
The Clean Water Act was extended to wetlands only inorder to restrict
pollution in non-navigable water bodies from entering navigable
waterways. Thus, restricting the polluting of a wetland that is
physically connected to a waterway is proper and was intended in the
legislation; protecting wetlands for wetlands' sake was not.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of lands which
are designated wetlands. 
<P>      When a tract is declared a wetland, it becomes off-limits to
development. Thus a landowner or developer may be forbidden to build a
home on land that he purchased for that purpose. To be sure, society
may gain a benefit from the protection of wetlands, but blocking
development can impose an enormous cost to the owner. If wetlands
protection is for the benefit of the nation, the nation should bear
that cost -- unlucky landowners should not be forced to subsidize the
public. Moreover, requiring the federal government to reimburse the
costs imposed by its regulation will encourage government officials to
determine the priority of protecting a tract. Now, declaring an area a
wetland is a "free" decision to the government, even though that
decision can impose large costs on the economy. 
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands, obtain the necessary
authority through a new Wetlands Protection Act. 
 <P>     Sections 301 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, which today are
considered the sources of authority for wetlands protection, relate
only to pollution discharges that can directly or indirectly pollute
navigable waterways. Thus, enforcement of regulations to protect all
wetlands under these sections has sparked numerous lawsuits. 

<P>      You may feel that the government should have the authority to
protect all wetlands, regardless of the threat to navigable waterways.
If you do, you should seek legislative authority to do so, so the
issue can be debated publicly. Obtaining clear legislation also would
have the advantage of reducing the extensive and costly litigation
resulting from current methods of enforcement under dubious and vague
authority. 
<P>
SOLID WASTE 
<P>      As you consider your policy on the environment, solid waste
legislation should be a low priority. Legislation covering the issue
is contained in Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). You will hear from some environmentalists that this law
must be strengthened. They will advocate mandatory recycling and
packaging reductions to conserve raw resources and to ease the
"crisis" of shrinking landfill space. This advice is misguided. (For
further information, see John Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to
Garbage: The Reauthorization of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) New
rules also would be expensive; EPA estimates that efforts to mandate
recycling and packaging reductions could cost up to $30 billion.
(Assistant Administrator Don R. Clay, Office of Solid Waste and
Emergency Response, Letter to Representative Norman F. Lent, June 16,
1992.        ) You should adopt a very different course of action. 

 <P>     Before you design a policy, you should ask your advisors some
basic questions, and then weigh the evidence. Among the questions you
should ask:

<P>      1) Is there really a landfill "crisis?" The evidence suggests
that there is not. Landfill capacity has been declining 2.8 percent
annually while the amount of waste has been increasing 1.6 percent.
(Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.) This decline is due to
stricter government regulation, which has quadrupled costs in the last
decade, and to the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) syndrome, whereby
local opposition to landfills is triggered by ill-informed health
concerns. Despite this decline, landfill space will be adequate if a
system of financial assurances replaces regulation. 

  <P>    2) What are the real health risks from using landfills and
incinerators? These actually are minimal. Today's new facilities are
state-of-the-art and pose negligible risk to health and safety.
Regulations now are so strict that if an individual sat continuously
for seventy years on an incinerator smokestack operating 24 hours a
day, that person would have only a one-in-a-million chance of
contracting cancer from smokestack pollutants. (Jerry Taylor,
"Municipal Waste Combustion: Toxic Threat or Trivial Pursuit?"
American Legislative Exchange Council Issues Analysis, April 1990.)

<P>      In fact, a major criticism of RCRA is that the regulations have
become too strict, leading to a decline in the construction of safe,
new incinerators and landfills, even though the health risks are
minuscule. 

<P>      3) Do reductions in packaging conserve resources? Paradoxically,
government pressure on businesses to reduce packaging can increase
waste. For instance, a pound of paper packaging used for foods reduces
food waste by an average of only 1.41 pounds, while a pound of plastic
packaging reduces food waste by 1.66 pounds. (Harvey Alter, "The
Origins of Solid Waste: The Relations Between Residues from Packaging
Materials and Food," Waste Management and Research 7, 1989.)

 <P>     Further, businesses already have economic incentives to reduce
packaging weights and volume. After all, the greater the amount of
packaging, the greater the transportation costs. Consequently,
manufacturers have been decreasing their packaging weights steadily
over the past two decades.

 <P>     4) Does recycling always conserve natural resources? Not always.
Recycling can be efficient and environmentally responsible, but it can
also waste resources. Whether it does so depends on the energy
requirements, the region of the country, and the characteristics of
the item to be recycled. Recycling aluminum is worthwhile because
recycling uses 95 percent less energy than making aluminum from
aluminum ore. Hence, businesses tend to recycle aluminum without being
forced to do so by the government. Recycling other products, however,
such as resource-efficient shrink wrap, actually would consume far
more natural and economic resources than making the resources from
virgin materials. Thus collecting, separating, and processing shrink
wrap to recycle would drive up costs to the economy, waste resources,
and cause air pollution.

<P>      5) Can government mandates conserve resources? Any attempt to
conserve resources by interfering with production and packaging
processes has the perverse effect result of wasting resources.
Government policies that mandate packaging reductions or recycling are
designed to encourage firms to substitute for one material another
material that consumes fewer resources. But to know which resources
should be conserved or used in every situation would require the
government to know the exact value of each resource in relation to
other resources. Market prices do this very well because they
fluctuate according to the latest information as to scarcity and
value. But if government attempts to determine resource values without
using prices, it must set the value or "worth" of each resource
according to an arbitrary standard. Hence, the "wrong" resource inputs
will be used in the production process, thus increasing overall
resource consumption. (Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.)

 <P>     Given these considerations, there are two specific actions that
you should take:
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation.
<P>      If you do not oppose such legislation, you will be weakening the
economic recovery without any appreciable benefit to the environment.
Ironically, the environment may even be harmed by encouraging wasteful
use of raw resources in the recycling process.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, issue an executive order to eliminate most
of today's costly landfill regulations.
 <P>     Rather than mandating recycling or packaging reductions, it
would be wiser to eliminate most of the current costly landfill
regulations. These erroneous rules are, in large part, responsible for
the nation's landfill capacity decline. You should instead replace
these regulations with a requirement that landfill operators provide
financial assurances, such as interest-bearing bonds, that the
landfills meet government standards of environmental safety. The
operators then should be given free rein to devise the least costly
manner of containing pollutants. But if the operator fails in this
duty, the bonds would become partially or wholly forfeit to finance a
clean-up.

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     If Americans think that Congress is going to be effective in
fighting violent crime, they are likely to be disappointed.
Congressional rhetoric on violent crime is very tough, but the reality
of the anti-crime legislation is very different. Major differences
between versions of federal anti-crime legislation await resolution by
Senate and House conferees as they attempt to reconcile the crime bill
passed by the Senate last November (S. 1488 and S. 1607) and the one
approved by the House last month (H.R. 4092).
<P>
     While both versions of the bill and related measures contain
superficially attractive language on such items as increased police
presence, bans on "assault weapons," and the federal "three-strikes-
and-you're-out" provision, it is a safe bet that the bill which
finally reaches the President's desk will not reduce violent crime.
For example, the "get-tough" provisions, including an expansive new
death penalty for about sixty different federal crimes, would be used
exclusively by a shrinking federal law enforcement team which deals
with just a tiny fraction of all violent crime. In 1990, state courts,
not federal courts, handled over 98 percent of all violent crime
convictions. (See "The Crime Bill: Much Ado About Nothing," National
Center for Policy Analysis Brief Analysis No. 106, April 15, 1994.)
Thus, in dealing with the violent street crime that plagues so many
inner-city residents, these elaborate death sentence threats will go
largely unused. Moreover, the House version of the crime bill contains
a racial quota system (the so-called Racial Justice Act) that would
make the imposition of the death penalty virtually impossible.
Complains Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, ranking Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, "While pretending to get serious about
crime, they have inserted into the House crime bill a set of
provisions that would in effect abolish the death penalty nationwide
-- both at the federal level and among the states." (Senator Orrin
Hatch, "Dear Colleague," April 25, 1994.) 
<P>
      The one truly useful proposal, billions of new dollars for state
prisons, is the target of substantial liberal congressional
opposition. If opponents are successful in the conference committee,
even this reasonable proposal likely will be of little benefit to
Americans desperately seeking relief from the continuing scourge of
violent crime.
<P>
     In fact, expectations are so low that many knowledgeable analysts
simply hope that the federal crime bill will do no harm to the
existing criminal justice system, a tragic testimony to the lack of
political leadership in Washington. The fact that the "Racial Justice
Act" is being seriously considered reveals the legitimacy of such
concerns.
<P>

<B> WHAT TAXPAYERS NEED IN THE CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     Nevertheless, while the shape of the congressional response to
violent crime may not inspire confidence, it may still be possible to
salvage sound policy prescriptions and have a meaningful crime bill
this year. Such a bill would have as its primary focus the goal of
providing maximum assistance to the states in their battle against
violent crime. It is the states, not the federal government, that bear
the greatest responsibility for combatting violent crime. Moreover,
federal policies, particularly requirements tied to federal grants,
should not hamstring state and local law enforcement officials.
Accordingly, the final crime package should contain provisions that
include:
<P>
1)  Federal funding for imprisonment of violent criminals. At least
    $10 billion should be available to the states for the construction
    and operation of state prisons as an incentive for them to reform
    their sentencing laws. This would make the bill's "truth in
    sentencing" provisions a reality, ensuring that violent criminals
    serve their time. (For an excellent discussion of "truth in
    sentencing," see James Wootton, "Truth in Sentencing: Why States
    Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time," Heritage Foundation
    State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
 <P>

2)  A serious death penalty. This means establishment of a federal
    death penalty for truly federal crimes -- a death penalty that
    will not take more than a decade to carry out after sentence is
    imposed. 
<P>
3)  A restraint on federal courts that put violent criminals back on
    the streets. This would mean, as a matter of federal policy,
    cutting back on prison population caps and other controls imposed
    by federal courts on state prison and local jail systems.
 <P>
4)  Improvements in the prosecution and punishment of federal violent
    crimes, particularly sexual assaults. This would include
    increasing penalties for violent federal crimes and expanding the
    range of admissible evidence in federal sexual assault cases,
    especially to serve as models for state law.
<P>
5)  Restoration of the strength of federal law enforcement agencies.
    While talking tough on crime, the Clinton Administration has cut
    agent and prosecutor strength in such key federal law enforcement
    agencies as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Drug
    Enforcement Administration (DEA). If Congress is serious about
    toughening federal law enforcement, this policy should be
    reversed. 
<P>
 <B> WHAT TAXPAYERS DO NOT NEED IN A FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In fashioning a new federal crime policy, Congress must make sure
that it does no harm to the efforts of state and local law enforcement
officials. This means:
<P>
1)  No death penalty quotas. The "Racial Justice Act" included in the
    House version of the crime bill would enable a prisoner convicted
    of a capital crime to offer statistical evidence that imposition
    of a death sentence in his case would be racially discriminatory.
    Such data would automatically require the state to prove that
    racial discrimination was not involved, imposing a burden that
    would be difficult, if not possible, to overcome unless the
    government previously had established a quota system based on
    local racial demographics. Under the terms of the House bill, this
    would be applied retroactively, in effect giving convicted felons
    yet another avenue of appeal to avoid the death penalty. This new
    system of "Outcome-Based Executions" would undermine the principle
    of individual justice.
<P>
2)  No new federal rules hamstringing state law enforcement. This
    includes, for example, the House-passed "Repeat Violent Offender
    Incarceration Act," which, while sounding innocuous enough,
    actually may require states to "assure" that they are reducing
    prison time for drug traffickers. 
<P>
3)  No new federal rules governing state and local police work. This
    includes congressional restrictions on federal funding for police
    officers that would have the effect of turning cops into social
    workers. Under no circumstances should federal policy encourage
    any kind of hiring or promotion quotas for police officers. As
    Representative James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who
    is the ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Crime and
    Criminal Justice, observes, the House version of the crime bill
    recommends that states and cities "seek and recruit members of
    racial, ethnic and gender minority groups." (Rep. F. James
    Sensenbrenner Jr., "A Real Crime Crisis and A Fake Crime Bill,"
    The Washington Times, April 6, 1994, p. A-19.) No personnel
    decision in the criminal justice system is more important than the
    hiring of a police officer, whose individual merit -- especially
    courage, judgment, integrity, and intelligence -- is critical in
    making life and death decisions. 
<P>
4)  No expansion of taxpayer funding of social programs. Liberals in
    Congress view public anxiety over crime as an excellent reason to
    fund more government social programs. The House bill contains $8
    billion worth of social welfare spending, (Ibid.) even though most
    taxpayer funding for social programs has little or nothing to do
    with genuine law enforcement. The bill includes funding for such
    things as arts and crafts programs and basketball leagues, replete
    with absurd federal requirements governing youth basketball
    participation. It is even more remarkable that Members of Congress
    would resort to social welfare spending in combatting crime when
    one considers that such spending is now at all-time high and that
    welfare spending per capita, in constant dollars, is five times as
    high as in 1965, the beginning of the "Great Society." (See Robert
    Rector, "Combatting Family Disintegration, Crime and Dependence: 
    Welfare Reform and Beyond," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
    983, April 8, 1994, p.5.) 

<P>
<B> THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In May 1989, President George Bush unveiled his comprehensive
violent crime control proposal to a large gathering of police
officers. President Bill Clinton hopes soon to stand before a similar
audience to announce completion of this process started five years ago
by his predecessor. (The Crime Control Act of 1990 was not viewed as
important anti-crime legislation. It included only provisions that
enjoyed the unanimous support of the conferees. Thus, despite lopsided
victories in the House and Senate on President Bush's proposals, the
final bill was largely a wasted effort.) Before this can happen,
however, Congress must agree on the details of this complex and
politically divisive legislative package. To that end, House and
Senate conferees are working to resolve many crucial policy
differences between their respective bills.
<P>
     In resolving these differences, Members of Congress must answer
three basic and critically important policy questions:
<P>
1)  How should the federal government spend $22 billion to combat
    violent crime in America?
<P>
2)  What should be the role of federal law enforcement in relation to
    violent street crime?
<P>
3)  To what extent should the federal government involve itself in the
   administration of capital punishment at the state level?
<P>
     If the conferees reach a consensus on these three questions, they
will have resolved the most significant issues presented to them by
the federal crime legislation, including whether to spend money on
prisons or so-called prevention programs, whether to expand federal
law to cover nearly all crimes involving firearms, and whether to
impose insurmountable burdens on prosecutors in states with capital
punishment.
<P>

<B> WHERE WILL TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS GO? </B>
<P>
     The crime legislation authorizes huge amounts of new federal
spending whose targets are easily identified: police, prisons, or
prevention.
<P>
     When the Senate passed its crime bill last November, it created a
violent crime reduction trust fund of $22 billion from anticipated
savings over the next five years from attrition in the federal
workforce. How to spend this $22 billion will present some tough
choices for the conferees. Making matters even more difficult, the
House bill includes nearly $28 billion in new spending. In fact, taken
together, the two bills include nearly $40 billion worth of ideas.
Some of the ideas are good, some are bad, and others are simply
irrelevant to the serious task of fighting violent crime. 
<P>
     The major spending proposals are:
<P>
     $9 billion (Senate bill) and $3.5 billion (House bill) for "cops
       on the beat."
<P>
     $13 billion for state prisons (House bill), $3 billion for
       regional prisons (Senate bill), $4 billion for correctional
       options and alternatives to prison (Senate bill).
<P>
     $9 billion (House bill) and $1.2 billion (Senate bill) for
       miscellaneous crime prevention/social programs, many of which
       fall under a new program entitled the "Ounce of Prevention"
       initiative.
<P>
     The Police. The Clinton Administration seems most interested in
securing federal money for police and prevention. The President
promised 100,000 more police in his election campaign and continues to
emphasize this issue in his crime speeches. At least three key
problems remain, however, concerning the benefits and nature of this
initiative. First, how can financially strapped local jurisdictions
pay the 25 percent matching fund requirement in both bills and afford
the cost of keeping the new police on board as the federal
contribution steadily declines? Second, will local governments retain
genuine control over hiring decisions and the type of work that the
new officers will perform, or will the federal government require
these individuals to fit into a mold pre-designed in Washington, where
many see community policing as another form of social welfare service?
Third, how will the criminal justice system handle the violent
criminals added to the pipeline as a result of more arrests (assuming
Washington allows them to make arrests)? There are about 550,000
arrests for violent crime in the entire nation each year, and one
violent crime arrest each month by an additional 100,000 police would
more than double the current number.
<P>
     Attorney General Janet Reno has championed the "prevention"
programs ever since she arrived in Washington. She appears convinced,
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that traditional social
welfare programs will strengthen families and reduce juvenile crime.
And even though the public is generally favorable to making violent
criminals serve their full time, a change that requires greater prison
capacity, the attorney general is no advocate of additional prison
capacity.
<P>
     If the conferees follow the Clinton Administration's lead with
regard to community policing, they will be left with about $30 billion
of additional programs and only $13 billion of the original $22
billion available to spend. This will result in one of two outcomes:
1) a confrontation between supporters of money for prisons and
proponents of more social welfare spending under the guise of
"prevention" spending or 2) the familiar dodge whereby Members of
Congress merely authorize spending on all of the proposals, leaving it
to congressional appropriators to make the hard choices and decide in
the years ahead who gets real money.
<P>
     Prisons vs. Prevention -- A False Dichotomy. Any confrontation
between prisons and prevention should involve a serious discussion
about the nature of crime prevention. Congressional proponents of more
social spending insist that more prisons will not reduce crime;
instead, federal legislation must be aimed at the "social conditions"
from which violent criminals often emerge. Representative Cardiss
Collins (D-IL), clearly expressed this view on the House floor during
the crime bill debate: "Any crime measure that budgets more for
prisons than job training is not sufficient to the task of fighting
crime."
<P>
     Once again, congressional liberals are wrong. Drawing a
distinction between prisons and prevention poses a false dichotomy.
Removing violent criminals from the streets is crime prevention, as
relevant statistics prove. For example, recidivism declines when
younger violent criminals serve longer percentages of their prison
sentences, (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (NCJ-116261), April 1989, p.
3.) repeat offenders commit a large number of crimes when they are out
of prison, (U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the
Federal Armed Career Criminal Statute, March 1992, p. 29.) and there
is an inverse relationship between rates of incarceration and rates of
crime. (U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Policy Development, The
Case for More Incarcerations (NCJ-139583), October 1992, p. 10.)
<P>
     The preventive effect of incarceration also is supported by the
four basic purposes for prison: incapacitation (the offender obviously
cannot commit crimes against law-abiding citizens when he is in
prison), retribution (justice is strengthened when offenders pay their
debt to society), deterrence (offenders are less likely to commit
crimes if the punishment is swift and severe), and rehabilitation.
There is widespread debate among students of the American criminal
justice system as to the effectiveness of rehabilitation, but this
issue also represents an area of potential agreement for pro-prison
and pro-social welfare advocates. And while retribution may involve
philosophical considerations and deterrence may turn largely on
empirical data, there can be no doubt about the value of
incapacitation in preventing crime. Anyone who has been victimized by
someone who should have been in prison at the time -- and there are
perhaps thousands of such victims each day -- can testify to the
certainty that imprisonment prevents crime.
<P>
     More Social Welfare Spending -- In a Crime Bill? It is beyond
dispute that an enormous variety of social programs, including welfare
spending, continue to receive a major portion of government spending.
These programs include urban and community aid, social services,
training and jobs, housing, education and energy assistance, medical
assistance, food stamps, and cash assistance. As Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector has noted, "From the start of the
War on Poverty in 1965 to the present, welfare spending has cost the
taxpayers $4.9 trillion in constant 1992 dollars. This is greater than
the cost of defeating Germany and Japan in World War II, after
adjusting for inflation." (Rector, op. cit. p. 6.) Thus, the argument
that government has ignored social spending as a means of attacking
the "root causes" of crime is inconsistent with the facts. (It is
true, of course, that federal policy makers have failed to address the
"root causes" of crime in terms of exploding illegitimacy, family
disintegration, and the collapse of traditional values in many crime-
ridden communities.)
<P>
     Congressional opponents of more prison spending claim that
building prisons has not reduced crime because crime has not declined.
This is akin to arguing that using a bucket to bail a leaking boat
does not reduce the amount of water in a boat with a hole in the
bottom because the water is still coming into the boat -- never mind
that the boat would sink without using the bucket. If a lack of
concrete results for dollars spent is the basis for embarrassment,
congressional advocates of another round of Great Society-style social
spending should have the good sense to break off the public
discussion.
<P>
     What Kind of Prevention Programs Are They, Anyway? Finally, it
must be observed that many of the programs being proposed are an odd
assortment of social programs that appear to be the product of "pop"
psychology. Under the House version of the crime bill, Congress would
authorize spending taxpayers' money for arts and crafts, Olympic
training, self-esteem classes, conflict resolution training for
violent teens, and midnight basketball leagues. Naturally, federal
programs mean federal rules which, in the case of the new midnight
basketball leagues in the House bill, are neat and precise: each
league must have eight teams with no more than ten players on each
team, and half of the players must live in government-subsidized low-
income housing projects. In a country where the average murderer
spends only eight-and-a-half years behind bars because of insufficient
prison capacity, it is curious to insist on spending limited taxpayer
dollars on arts and crafts.
<P>

<B> THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT </B>
<P>
     The second question Members of Congress must address concerns the
role of federal law enforcement in combatting street-level violence.
Both crime bills, but particularly the Senate version, contain several
new offenses and penalties aimed at such crime. In addition to death
penalty offenses for murder with a firearm, drive-by shootings, and
car-jackings, the bills establish new crimes for gang activity,
criminal use of firearms, and juvenile crime. Provisions relating to
sexual and domestic violence would be enforceable only on federal
lands such as Indian reservations.
<P>
     The much-discussed "three-strikes-and-you're-out" provision would
not expand the jurisdiction of federal law enforcement, but it would
increase the penalty for conviction of a federal violent crime after
two similar federal or state convictions. President Clinton has
developed an attractive "tough on crime" soundbite in pushing for this
penalty, but the reality is that current federal law already severely
punishes such offenders.
<P>
     It used to be easy to spot the difference between the role of a
Member of Congress and the role of a state legislator in crime
legislation. The Constitution clearly distinguishes between the
national responsibilities of the general government and the domestic
and particular responsibilities of state governments. State
legislators, not Members of Congress, have direct responsibility for
enacting the rules that govern state and municipal law enforcement. 
<P>
           In the 1980s, Congress spent most of its legislative energy
focusing on drug abuse, grant programs to assist state and local law
enforcement, and procedural reforms affecting federal prosecutors.
Within the past few years, however, the direct involvement of federal
law enforcement in countering urban violence has emerged as a major
issue. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) initiated much of the debate in
1991 with an amendment that would give federal law enforcement
jurisdiction over nearly all crimes committed with a gun. This idea is
very popular in Congress. D'Amato's amendment has passed the Senate
twice by overwhelming margins. Not surprisingly, it also has been
strongly opposed by many prominent conservatives, including Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
<P>
     Meanwhile, as the legislative debate has continued, federal law
enforcement has become ever more involved in the fight against street
violence. Since possession of a firearm by a felon is a violation of
federal law, it has been relatively easy for the federal government to
arrest and prosecute tens of thousands of violent criminals. This new
role has been well received in states where violent crime has soared
and criminal justice systems have been largely dysfunctional. For
example, local law enforcement officials in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, have praised federal authorities for the aggressive role
they played in attacking drug trafficking gangs from 1989 to 1992; the
federal government was able to "lean forward" and assist a local
government that was unable to detain offenders pre-trial because of a
court-imposed cap on its jail population.
<P>
     Notwithstanding the success of high-impact operations like the
one in Philadelphia, Members of Congress should be cautious about
continuing to expand federal jurisdiction. Once again, virtually all
violent crime enforcement falls upon state, not federal authorities,
and there is an ample menu of specific policy initiatives that state
officials can pursue in controlling violent crime. Former Attorney
General William Barr has outlined two dozen specific recommendations
that would help state officials combat violent crime. (For an
excellent and detailed discussion of the Barr recommendations to state
and local officials, see Mary Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent
Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a Safer America," Heritage Foundation State
Backgrounder No. 944/S, June 7, 1993.)
<P>
     There are several other reasons why Members of Congress should be
cautious in expanding the federal role in combatting domestic street
crime.
<P>
     First, limited resources will not permit greater involvement by
federal law enforcement. Generally lost in all of President Clinton's
rhetoric about fighting crime are his significant cutbacks in federal
law enforcement. There are hundreds fewer agents and prosecutors now
than there were in the Bush Administration. Moreover, the President's
proposed budget for FY 1995 seeks to cut prison construction by 30
percent (adding to a sharp cut in 1994) and Department of Justice law
enforcement agencies by 1,523 positions. Former Deputy Attorney
General Philip Heymann summarized the Clinton Administration's policy
by stating that, "With fewer federal investigators and fewer federal
prosecutors in the years ahead there will not be more federal law
enforcement but less.... " (Philip B. Heymann, "The Lock-'em-up
Debate; What Pols Won't Say: 3 Strikes -- And We're Out of Money," The
Washington Post, February 27, 1994, p. C1. ) It would be misleading
for Congress to expand the federal role in law enforcement while
following the lead of the Clinton Administration by slashing the
resources of these law enforcement agencies. Meaningless rhetoric on
the crime issue only adds to the taxpayer's discouragement with
government; both Members of Congress and state legislators should
recall that the first duty of government is to protect American
citizens, not simply to talk tough about crime. 
<P>
      Second, Congress should avoid passing laws that continue to
undermine the distinction between federal and state jurisdiction
regarding street crime. Given the independent nature of United States
Attorneys, it is likely that some would attempt to operate like local
district attorneys. Furthermore, elimination of the federal-state
distinction runs counter to the notion of a limited federal government
acting only in accordance with enumerated powers. While such a
traditional notion of constitutional law is hardly the guiding
influence of Washington's current policy-making process, the loss of
even more ground in this area must be avoided.
<P>

<B> ENDING STATE DEATH PENALTIES </B>
<P>
     The third question that Members of Congress must resolve pertains
to the imposition of capital punishment at the state level. By the
slimmest of margins, the House passed the so-called Racial Justice
Act, which purports to remedy racial bias in the administration of
state death penalties but which actually would end the death penalty
not just for future cases, but also for all offenders currently under
sentence of death.
<P>
     According to the provisions of this remarkable proposal, if a
defendant offers statistical information indicating a disparity
between the race of the offender or the victim in a capital case and
the racial composition of the general community, a presumption of
racial bias is established. At this point, the prosecutor must prove
there was no discrimination. In other words -- in violation of the
canons of logical debate -- the government must prove a negative. Even
if evidence is presented that is relevant to the government's reason
for seeking the death sentence, it will not respond fully to the
possibility that racial prejudice was an additional factor. Moreover,
the prosecutor must do this retroactively, recovering evidence from
potentially thousands of cases dating back to the re-establishment of
capital punishment in 1976. Prosecutors agree that this measure will
lead to an injustice far worse than the one its sponsors now think
exists. To avoid the statistical disparity which triggers the
presumption of bias, the government will be forced to keep track of
the racial composition of offenders and victims and to make sure that
such composition matches that of the local community. This quota
system is completely contrary to the basic principles of the American
criminal justice system: that justice is color-blind and that every
case must be judged on its own merits.
<P>
     If Members of Congress accept this proposal, they will further
damage the criminal justice system. Even worse, the realization by
citizens and state law enforcement officials that Congress has imposed
this system on them, it will further erode the credibility of Congress
as an effective institution of government, underscoring the difference
between the tough rhetoric of Congress's latest war on crime and the
legislative reality of its latest anti-crime package.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     To craft a truly effective anti-crime policy, Members of Congress
ideally would need to start from scratch, beginning with the
recognition that state legislators have primary responsibility for
fighting violent street crime. Streamlining the court systems,
enacting rational sentencing laws, and improving the quality of police
recruiting and police detection of crime are all within the
jurisdiction of the several states.
<P>
     A serious federal anti-crime policy would have as its main focus
the elimination of every form of federal interference in the crucial
mission of public safety by the states. Through unfunded mandates that
consume their scarce fiscal resources, the federal government forces
states to divert funds from public safety. Because of activist federal
judges who micro-manage state prison systems and continually grant new
legal opportunities to death row inmates, states remain handcuffed in
their struggle against violent criminals. These are the problems that
should be addressed in federal anti-crime legislation.
<P>
     In the meantime, Congress can salvage good policy in a measure
that otherwise holds little promise of reducing the violence on
America's streets. First, in apportioning federal funds, Congress
should set aside not less than $10 billion as an incentive fund for
the states to encourage sentencing reform. States must stop revolving
door justice by increasing the amount of time served by violent
criminals from the current 38 percent to something much closer to 100
percent. Second, not one dime should be spent on more misguided social
welfare programs. Members of Congress should reject the advice of
those who still insist, despite two decades worth of evidence to the
contrary, that violent criminals also are victims of society to be
helped through more social spending. It is time for Members of
Congress to start listening to the real victims of violent crime.

The "Anti-Crime Bill" Congress will likely vote on this week
authorizes roughly $8.7 billion to create nearly 30 new "crime
prevention" programs ($7.4 billion for programs identified as
"prevention" and $1.3 billion for new "Drug Courts").  Many of these
new programs are little more than social welfare pork, adding a new
layer of bureaucracy on a welfare system that already costs taxpayers
at all levels of government over $310 billion per year.
<P>
      Supporters of the bill claim that crime will be reduced if
government provides community development aid, social services, job
training, and recreational activities.  They are wrong.
<P>
      Society has spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty since 1965,
yet the national crime rate stands at its highest level ever.  As is
shown in the adjacent chart, welfare spending since 1965 has grown in
real terms by 800 percent while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the typical rates before 1960. 
The evidence suggests that welfare spending, by promoting family
breakup, has played a large role in increasing, rather than decreasing
crime. (See Patrick F.  Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social
Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation FYI No.  19, June 29, 1994.)

<h3>THE DOLE-CANADY BILL: AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p><blockquote>
By making race a relevant criterion... in its own affairs, government teaches the public that the apportionment of rewards and penalties can legitimately be made according to race... and that people can, and perhaps should, view themselves and others in terms of their racial characteristics. 
<p>
	
-- Justice Potter Stewart, dissenting in <I>Fullilove v. Klutznick</I>, 448 U.S. 448 (1980).
</blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, government in America has made race a relevant criterion. Racial and gender preferences pervade the federal government: employment quotas for minority and female employees; contract "set-asides" reserved exclusively for minority and female firms; and "bid preferences" where up to 10 percent is added to the bids of nonminority firms to aid minority and female firms. Defenders characterize these programs as containing mere "goals and timetables."  Such Orwellian terminology, however, cannot disguise the obvious fact that a preference by any other name is still a preference.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last July, Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) and Representative Charles Canady (R-FL) introduced the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2128:">Equal Opportunity Act of 1996</a>.<sup>1</sup>  The Dole-Canady bill attempts to restore the colorblind principle to federal law by prohibiting the federal government from granting any preference to any person based in whole or in part on race, color, national origin, or sex. Specifically, Dole-Canady contains two main provisions:
<P>
<b>1)</b> It prohibits the use of preferences based on race, color, national origin, or sex by the federal government in 
<p><ul>
<li>federal employment, 
<p>
<li>The awarding or administering of federal contracts, and
<p>
<li>Any other federally conducted program or activity;
</ul><p>
<b>2)</b> It prohibits the federal government from requiring or encouraging any federal contractor or subcontractor to grant preferences based on race, color, national origin, or sex to employees, suppliers, or subcontractors.
<p>

<b>GOALS AND PREFERENCES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 8 of the Dole-Canady bill defines "preference" as "an advantage of any kind, and includes a quota, set-aside, numerical goal, timetable, or other numerical objective."<sup>2</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is one of the bill's most important provisions because it attempts to prohibit preferences from being disguised in other forms. The Dole-Canady bill prohibits the federal government from using and requiring a "numerical goal, timetable, or other numerical objective" because such goals and timetables are indistinguishable from quotas. Laurence Silberman, as Undersecretary of Labor in the Nixon Administration, helped devise the regime of employment goals and timetables now imposed on private businesses. Silberman, now a federal circuit judge, later wrote:
<p><blockquote>
	I now realize that the distinction we saw between goals and timetables on the one hand, and unconstitutional quotas on the other, was not valid. Our use of numerical standards in pursuit of equal opportunity has led ineluctably to the very quotas, guaranteeing equal results, that we initially wished to avoid.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 3 of the bill expressly protects the federal government's nonpreferential affirmative action programs. Such programs include outreach, recruiting, and marketing efforts to encourage qualified minorities to apply for federal employment and bid on federal contracts. All such programs are permissible under Dole-Canady provided no preferences are involved. 
<p>
<b>RHETORIC VS. REALITY</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite its clear language and narrow focus, the purpose and effect of the Dole-Canady bill have been subject to serious misinterpretation in some quarters. For example: 
<p><blockquote>
 "[A]n all out, in-your-face attack, a walking away from hard-earned civil rights gains."<br>
  -- William Raspberry, Columnist.<sup>4</sup>

<P>
A "safe haven for sophisticated bigots."  <br>
-- Representative Barney Frank (D-MA).<sup>5</sup>
<P>

"It's an incredible rollback. It would basically take away equal opportunities for women and minorities."  <br>
-- Rosemary Dempsey, Vice President, National Organization for Women.<sup>6</sup>

<p>
A "unilateral disarmament in the war on racism and discrimination."<br>
  -- Representative Nita M. Lowey (D-NY).<sup>7</sup>
</blockquote> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Discrimination Remains Illegal.</b> In reality, the bill does none of these things. It would not address, amend, or weaken any civil rights laws and protections in any way. Discrimination would still be absolutely illegal, subject to the same penalties. Nothing in the bill would impair the federal enforcement and prosecution of civil rights laws and violations. In fact, Section 8(1) of the bill exempts the federal judiciary, thus ensuring the courts' power to order remedial relief to victims in discrimination cases. Civil suits for employment and contract discrimination also would be unaffected. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Contrary to the claims of some, nothing in the Dole-Canady bill would prevent the use of numerical disparities as evidence in discrimination trials; juries still could consider such "numerical evidence" in deciding whether discrimination occurred in a particular case. In sum, Dole-Canady does not address any issues involving civil rights or employment litigation. All it does is prohibit the federal government from using and requiring racial and gender preferences. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Private Preferences.</b> The Dole-Canady bill does not prohibit state and local governments, colleges and universities, or private businesses, including federal contractors, from granting racial, ethnic, or gender preferences otherwise permitted by law -- provided such programs are truly voluntary and not adopted pursuant to pressure from the federal government. However, it does prevent the federal government from "requiring or encouraging" federal contractors from adopting such preferences. Currently, contractors and subcontractors are required to adopt rigid quotas and preferences as a condition of receiving and maintaining federal contracts.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Consistent with Civil Rights Act of 1964.</b> It is indisputable that Dole-Canady is consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the current regime of preferences is not. For example, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), the floor manager of the landmark 1964 Act, assured the Senate specifically that "nothing in the bill would permit any official or court to require any employer or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority group."<sup>8</sup>  More important, the Dole-Canady bill's concept of discrimination is consistent with the definition of discrimination in the 1964 Act: in the words of Senator Humphrey, "a distinction in treatment given to different individuals because of their different race."<sup>9</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Politically Popular Support.</b> An overwhelming number of Americans disapprove of racial and gender preferences. A recent poll showed that 84 percent of the American public opposes "favoring a minority who is less qualified than a white applicant, when filling a job in a business that has few minority workers."<sup>10</sup>  However, traditional, nonpreferential forms of affirmative action are favored. For example, 73 percent of those polled approve of companies making "special efforts to find qualified minorities and women and then encouraging them to apply for jobs with that company."<sup>11</sup>  This strongly suggests that the goals of the Dole-Canady bill are supported by the American people.
<p>
<b>WHERE THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION STANDS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Following last year's landmark Supreme Court ruling in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</I>,<sup>12</sup> which held that all racial classifications by government are subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny, the Clinton Administration unveiled a five-month long study of federal affirmative action programs.<sup>13</sup>  This review did not recommend the elimination of a single federal preference program.<sup>14</sup>  In fact, despite the nearly impossible standard for government preferences announced in <I>Adarand</I>, President Clinton personally endorsed virtually all existing federal race and gender preferences in a July 19 speech. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of the Administration's commitment to race-based affirmative action abound:
<p><ul>
<li>Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger has defined affirmative action as "a group-based remedy: where a group has been subject to discrimination, individual members of the group can benefit from the remedy, even if they have not proved that they have been discriminated against personally."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>Says Associate Attorney General John Schmitt, "Race can be taken into account as a preference."<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor Shirley Wilcher believes that "it's absolutely absurd that anyone would think affirmative action programs constitute reverse discrimination."<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>Says Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Deval Patrick, the Clinton Administration "firmly and unequivocally opposes" the Dole-Canady bill.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>And President Clinton, in his July 19, 1995, address on affirmative action made it clear that "where our legitimate objectives cannot be achieved through such means, the federal government will continue to support lawful consideration of race, ethnicity, and gender" in federal programs.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>LIMITED YET SIGNIFICANT</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the Dole-Canady bill focuses only on the activities of the federal government, it would have a significantly broad impact. In all, there are over 160 different federal programs that contain racial and gender preferences. Dole-Canady would eliminate such preferences from these programs. For example, under Dole-Canady the 2.8 million federal employees that comprise 3.1 percent of America's total workforce<sup>20</sup> would no longer be subjected to preferential hiring and promotion practices.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even more important, roughly one-third of all private employers in the United States contract with the federal government,<sup>21</sup> and employees of these private-sector federal contractors comprise approximately 28 percent of the nation's workforce.<sup>22</sup>  The Dole-Canady bill prohibits the federal government from requiring or encouraging these federal contractors to employ racial or gender preferences. In other words, the bill frees up to one-third of America's private employers from a particularly burdensome federal requirement.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the Dole-Canady bill is narrow in scope, it would accomplish one very important objective: the restoration of colorblind law to the federal government. This is a goal that can and should be supported by all Americans of goodwill. In the eloquent words of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia:
<p><blockquote>
	Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or debtor race... In the eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is American.<sup>23</sup>

      Now that the United States has become, temporarily, the greatest
power in the world, some of us recall an observation, half a century
ago, by the French writer Andre Siegfried:  "The United States is the
only country to have passed from barbarism to decadence without having
known civilization."  At the end of the twentieth century, have
Americans intelligence and imagination sufficient to lead the peoples
of the world?  Indeed, do Americans possess talents sufficient to
maintain their present degree of security and prosperity?
<P>
      These are grave, if not fatal, questions.  Decisions are being
made nowadays, in public policies abroad and at home, that may be
irrevocable.  And it appears that such decisions may be based upon
erroneous assumptions.
  <P>    Therefore I offer you during this year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and ninety-one, ladies and gentlemen, a series of four
lectures on the general topic "Political Errors at the End of the
Twentieth Century."  My first lecture, to be delivered to you this
very day, is entitled "Republican Errors"; the second, this spring,
will be "Democratic Errors"; the third, in summer or fall, will be
"International Errors"; the concluding one, "The Politics of Reality,"
when I will suggest some paths to truth in public policy.
<P>
      I commence with an examination of the state of mind and heart in
America's two great political parties; and of the two, I venture first
to touch upon certain errors prevalent in the Republican Party.  I
have known various Republican presidents, presidential candidates,
members of Congress, governors, and other party leaders, all the way
from Herbert Hoover to my friend and neighbor, John Engler, very
recently elected governor of Michigan against heavy odds:  From time
to time I have had a hand in their campaigns, especially in those of
Senator Goldwater.  I was on cordial terms with President Nixon and
President Reagan.  My wife and I succeeded in reconciling the several
factions of the Republican Party in Michigan, on the eve of the
national convention which chose Mr.  Bush as the party's nominee for
the presidency.  So you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, that in
my lamenting of the present state of Republican leadership in
Washington, I am more moved by sorrow than by wrath.
<P>
      Stolid Party. During this twentieth century the Republican Party
has been more stolid than imaginative.  It has attracted public
support by its appearance of practicality, its defense of private
property and of a competitive economy, its reluctance -- most of the
time -- to embark upon adventures abroad.  Although praised as the
party of industry and business, also, at least in my Michigan
backwoods, Republicans were the representatives of the rural interest. 
In short, it has been a broad-based party which, in recent decades,
has made considerable gains in the region that used to be the Solid
South.  Of presidents taking office since World War II, five have been
Republican, three Democratic.  The tremendous margins of victory
enjoyed by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush in their
presidential campaigns seemed to suggest that the Republican Party
might sweep away the Democratic Party within a few years, as long
before the Federalist Party, and the Whig, had gone to the wall.
<P>
      Yet the Republican Party, which achieved its greatest vigor in
this century during the presidential terms of Ronald Reagan, now seems
in the sere and yellow leaf.  Permit me to discuss with you, for a
quarter of an hour, the domestic errors of the Republican national
administration, and then to examine, for the second quarter of an
hour, that administration's blunders in foreign policy.
<P>
      My task with respect to the fiscal measures of the Bush
Administration is made the easier for me by Dr.  Edwin Feulner's
"State of Conservatism, 1991" message, entitled "Fashionably Out of
Fashion Again."  I concur heartily in his observation that "after more
than eight years of steady growth, a combination of new federal taxes,
out-of control spending increasing, and suffocating regulatory burdens
have conspired to send the economy into spasms."  Federal expenditure
soon will exceed a quarter of the gross national product; the deficits
for the present fiscal year and for the fiscal year 1992 will be the
largest in the history of the United States.  The reforms of income
tax and inheritance tax, worked in the Reagan years, are undone.  As
socialism dissolves in Eastern Europe, in the United States, an
unofficial and unproclaimed form of socialism gains ground. 
<P>
      Why has this come to pass?  Why does a national administration
elected on a conservative platform offer such feeble resistance to
measures advocated by doctrinaire liberals.
<P>
      "Rockefeller Republicans."  Why, one ought not to blame Mr. 
Bush unduly.  When he stood for the Republican presidential nomination
against Mr.  Reagan in 1980, of necessity he turned for support to the
liberal wing of the Republican Party.  That wing had insufficient
strength to secure him the nomination; but in the course of the
contest he acquired advisors and helpers best classified as
"Rockefeller Republicans."  Those people, some of them eminent, are at
his side still, and have his ear.
<P>
      An anecdote will illustrate my point.  While, in 1988, Mr.  Bush
was campaigning vigorously, I was invited to confer with an inner
circle of his staff, in Washington.  Mr.  Bush was busy elsewhere, but
kindly telephoned me during the course of the discussion.  One of the
pieces of advice I had offered to the Bush people there was to
emphasize Mr.  Bush's opposition to abortion-on-demand; I said he has
consistently advocated the sound policy of returning the abortion
question to the police powers of the several states.  My remark was
received with an embarrassed silence; clearly some people present very
much favored abortion.  A little later I pointed out that in national
publicity, the Bush campaign should refer repeatedly to Mr.  Bush's
conservatism.
<P>
      "What has he done that's conservative?"  inquired, perhaps
rhetorically, a Young Lion of the Bush.  I might have pointed to his
intelligently conservative years in the House of Representatives, but
contented myself at the moment by suggesting that others present might
know Mr.  Bush's principal views and utterances better than I did. 
Some of Mr.  Bush's people there present in the headquarters shivered
at that dread word "conservative."
<P>
      I am suggesting that all presidents, in some degree, are held
captive by the inner circles of the Executive Force, their own
Executive Force.  I doubt whether President Bush himself inclined
initially to the fiscal measures that presently he accepted; but those
close about him persuaded him of the need for such damaging
concessions to liberals' demands.
<P>
      Now the Republican Party long boasted of its frugality.  The
Bush Administration, on the contrary, has stolen some of the
Democrats' old clothes while the sons of Jefferson and Jackson were
out bathing.  But those purloined garments are ragged; and Republicans
look odd and unconvincing when clad in them. 
<P>
      Oppressive Taxation. With respect to a sharp increase in the
level of taxes, it seems as if the Bush Administration really does not
understand the principle of diminishing returns, or know the history
of the consequences of excessive taxation.  When computing our federal
income tax very recently, my wife and I discovered that more than half
our gross income is taken in taxation -- federal income tax; Social
Security taxes; state income taxes; village, township, and county
taxes, school property tax; sales taxes.  And we are not of the number
of Franklin Roosevelt's "malefactors of great wealth."  We are in the
process of educating four young daughters, paying off mortgages,
trying to save something for one's declining years -- I, being
seventy-two years of age already -- and contributing to charitable
causes.  Yet we are better off than many taxpayers.  What straw will
break the camel's back?
<P>
      A state that annually exacts in taxes half of a citizen's income
is more oppressive, financially, than the despotisms of old.  In the
ancient monarchies of China, a tax load of more than ten percent would
have been thought unjust.  Excessive taxation is a major cause of the
decline and fall of great states:  so writes C.  Northcote Parkinson,
the author of Parkinson's Law, in his last book.
<P>
      "Taxation, taken to the limit and beyond, has always been a sign
of decadence and a prelude to disaster," as Parkinson puts it.  "For
government expenditure is the chief cause of inflation and is also the
means of government interference in commercial, industrial, and social
life.  Where evil has been averted it has normally been from lack of
funds.  Where evil has been done it was usually because the
perpetrators had money to spend."
<P>
      Billion Dollars Daily.  The Bush Administration had one handsome
prospect for reducing governmental expenditure, reducing the federal
deficit, and possibly even making a gesture at reduction of the
federal debt:  that is, the prospective contraction of the armed
forces, what with the dwindling of the Soviet menace.  Instead, Mr. 
Bush has plunged the United States into a war which, so far, has cost
about a billion dollars a day.  (You will recall that a billion
dollars is a thousand million dollars.) Already, more taxation to pay
for this struggle in the Levant is being discussed in Washington.  So
I quote Parkinson once more:  "Taxes become heavier in time of war and
should diminish, by rights, when the war is over.  That is not,
however, what happens.  Although sometimes lowered when the war ends,
taxes seldom regain their pre-war level.  That is because the level of
expenditure rises to meet the war-time level of taxation."
<P>
      Unless the Bush Administration abruptly reverses its fiscal and
military course, I suggest, the Republican Party must lose its former
good repute for frugality, and become the party of profligate
expenditure, "butter and guns."  And public opinion would not long
abide that.  Nor would America's world influence and America's
remaining prosperity.
<P>
      But, time running on, I must turn to affairs diplomatic and
military:  Republican errors internationally.  What are we to say of
Mr.  Bush's present endeavor to bring to pass a gentler, kinder New
World Order?
<P>
      Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon
Johnson were enthusiasts for American domination of the world.  Now
George Bush appears to be emulating those eminent Democrats.  When the
Republicans, once upon a time, nominated for the presidency a "One
World" candidate, Wendell Willkie, they were sadly trounced.  In
general, Republicans throughout the twentieth century have been
advocates of prudence and restraint in the conduct of foreign affairs.
<P>
      But Mr.  Bush, out of mixed motives, has embarked upon a radical
course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf.  After
carpet-bombing the Cradle of Civilization as no country ever had been
bombed before, Mr.  Bush sent in hundreds of thousands of soldiers to
overrun the Iraqi bunkers -- that were garrisoned by dead men,
asphyxiated.
<P>
      And for what reason?  The Bush Administration found it difficult
to answer that question clearly.  In the beginning it was implied that
the American national interest required low petroleum prices: 
therefore, if need be, smite and spare not!
<P>
      That excuse reminds me of Burke's rebuke to the Pitt ministry in
1795, when it appeared that the British government was about to go to
war with France over the question of the navigation of the River
Scheldt, in the Netherlands.  "A war for the Scheldt?  A war for a
chamber-pot!"  Burke exclaimed.  Now one may say, "A war for Kuwait? 
A war for an oilcan!"
<P>
      "The blood of a man should never be shed but to redeem the blood
of man," Burke wrote in his first Letter on a Regicide Peace.  "It is
well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our
country, for our kind.  The rest is vanity; the rest is crime."  Burke
was eager that England declare war against France because of the
menace of the French revolutionaries to the civilized order of Europe,
and because of their systematic crimes.  But he set his face against
war for mere commercial advantage.  So should Republicans.  "The rest
is vanity; the rest is crime."
<P>
      War for Righteousness. A war for an oilcan not turning out to be
popular, however, President Bush turned moralist; he professed to be
engaged in redeeming the blood of man; and his breaking of Iraq is to
be the commencement of his beneficent New World Order.  Mr.  Bush has
waged what Sir Herbert Butterfield, in his little book Christianity,
Diplomacy, and War, calls "The War for Righteousness."  As Butterfield
begins the third chapter of that book, "It has been held by
technicians of politics in recent times that democracies can only be
keyed up to modern war -- only brought to the necessary degree of
fervor -- provided they are whipped into moral indignation and heated
to fanaticism by the thought that they are engaged in a 'war for
righteousness'." 
<P>
      Now indubitably Saddam Hussein is unrighteous; but so are nearly
all the masters of the "emergent" African states (with the Ivory Coast
as a rare exception), and so are the grim ideologues who rule China,
and the hard men in the Kremlin, and a great many other public figures
in various quarters of the world.  Why, I fancy that there are some
few unrighteous men, conceivably, in the domestic politics of the
United States.  Are we to saturation-bomb most of Africa and Asia into
righteousness, freedom, and democracy?  And, having accomplished that,
however would we ensure persons yet more unrighteous might not rise up
instead of the ogres we had swept away?  Just that is what happened in
the Congo, remember, three decades ago; and nowadays in Zaire, once
called the Belgian Congo, we zealously uphold with American funds the
dictator Mobutu, more blood-stained than Saddam.  And have we
forgotten Castro in Cuba?
<P>
      Momentum of Its Own. I doubt whether much good is going to come
out of the slaughter of perhaps a hundred thousand people in Iraq. 
"For one of the troubles of war," Butterfield writes, "is that it
acquires its own momentum and plants its own ideals on our shoulders,
so that we are carried far away from the purposes with which we began
-- carried indeed sometimes to greater acts of spoilation than the
ones which had provoked our original entry into the war.  Before the
war of 1914 had lasted a year, its own workings had generated such a
mood that we had promised Russia Constantinople and had bought the
alliance of Italy with offers of booty, some of which had later to be
disavowed by President Wilson.  And it is a remarkable fact that in
wars which purport to be so ethical that the states attached to
neutrality are sometimes regarded as guilty of a dereliction of duty,
the great powers primarily concerned may have required an iniquitous
degree of bribery to bring them into the conflict, or to maintain
their fidelity.  The whole ideal of moderate peace aims, and the whole
policy of making war the servant (instead of the master) of
negotiation, is impossible -- and the whole technique of the 'war for
righteousness' has a particularly sinister application -- when even in
the ostensibly 'defending' party there is a latent and concealed
aggressiveness of colossal scope, as there certainly was in 1914."
<P>
      You may perceive some parallels between Butterfield's
description of the course of the Allies during World War I and the
course, so far, of the coalition against Iraq.  Already there is talk
of what shall be done with the "remains of Iraq."  Mr.  James Baker
talks of rebuilding Iraq; others talk of dismantling Iraq altogether,
by way of spoilation.  And what promises and bribes were provided by
the government of the United States, in recent months, to secure the
assent of such murderous governments as that of Ethiopia to strong
measures against Iraq; to secure, indeed, by holding out prospects of
massive economic aid, the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Iraq's
former patron?
<P>
      Was not Egypt's cooperation obtained by forgiving the Egyptian
government's indebtedness of several billion dollars?  Was not Syria's
assent gained by America's ignoring of the Syrian conquest of the
Lebanon, with a massacre of General Aoun's Christian army?  What began
as determination to restore a legitimate (if somewhat arbitrary)
government in Kuwait may result in the overturn of several governments
in the Levant.  As for regarding neutral states as guilty of
dereliction of duty -- why, the United States has done just that to
Jordan, by cutting off economic aid at the very time when Jordan is
crammed with destitute refugees from Iraq.
<P>
      Disagreeable Consequences.  In short, deliberate entry into war
commonly brings on consequences disagreeable even to the seeming
victors.  Prudent statesmen long have known that armed conflict, for
all involved, ought to be the last desperate resort, to be entered
upon only when all means of diplomacy, conciliation, and compromise
have been exhausted.  In Iraq, we have crushed an insect with the club
of Hercules.  Temporarily, Mr.  Bush's stroke is popular.  When a
democracy goes to war, at first there occurs a wave of enthusiasm: 
"Bop the Wop; sap the Jap; get the Hun on the run!"  But afterward,
when troubles arise.... 
<P>
      True, we did not suffer a long war in the deserts of Kuwait and
Iraq.  But we must expect to suffer during a very long period of
widespread hostility toward the United States -- even, or perhaps
especially, from the people of certain states that America bribed or
bullied into combining against Iraq.
<P>
      In Egypt, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Algeria, in Morocco, in all
of the world of Islam, the masses now regard the United States as
their arrogant adversary; while the Soviet Union, by virtue of its
endeavors to mediate the quarrel in its later stages, may pose again
as the friend of Moslem lands.  Nor is this all:  for now, in every
continent, the United States is resented increasingly as the last and
most formidable of imperial systems.
<P>
      In this century, great empires have collapsed:  the Austrian,
the German, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, the
Spanish, the Italian, and the Japanese.  The Soviet empire now
languishes in the process of dissolution.  "Imperialism" has become a
term of bitter reproach and complaint; all this within my own
lifetime.
<P>
      American Empire.  But there remains an American Empire, still
growing -- though expanding through the acquisition of client states,
rather than through settlement of American populations abroad.  Among
the client states directly dependent upon American military power are
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and El Salvador; and until the
withdrawal of American divisions from Germany for service in Arabia,
Germany, too, was a military client.  Dependent upon American
assistance of one kind or another, and in some degree upon American
military protection, are the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and
Panama; and also, in the Levant, Egypt and Jordan, and formerly
Lebanon.  Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are added to the roster of
clients.  I hardly need mention America's earlier acquisitions: 
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgins, and lesser islands.  I refrain from
mentioning America's economic ascendancy, through foreign aid or
merely trade, over a great deal more of the world.  In short, although
we never talk about our empire, a tremendous American Empire has come
into existence -- if, like the Roman Empire, in a kind of fit of
absence of mind.  No powerful counterpoise to the American hegemony
seems to remain, what with the enfeebling of the U.S.S.R.
<P>
      Such a universal ascendancy always has been resented by the
lesser breeds without the law.  Soon there sets to work a widespread
impulse to pull down the imperial power.  But that imperial power,
strong in weapons, finds it possible for a time to repress the
disobedient.  In the long run -- well, as Talleyrand put it, "You can
do everything with bayonets -- except sit on them."  In the long run,
the task of repression is too painful a burden to bear; so the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union has discovered in the past few
years.  Napoleon discovered that hard truth earlier and King George
III and the King's Friends discovered it between the years 1775 and
1781.  Doubtless George Bush means well by the world near the end of
the twentieth century.  He is a man of order, diligent, dutiful,
honest, and a good family man.  But he lacks imagination, "the vision
thing."  And power intoxicates; and, as Lord Acton put it, power tends
to corrupt.  The love of power tends to corrupt both speech and
actions.  It may corrupt a grave national undertaking into a personal
vendetta.  It may corrupt what began as a chivalric rescue into a
heavy belligerent domination.  (Talk continues to come to our ears of
a "permanent American presence" in the Persian Gulf.)
<P>
      President Bush and Americans of his views doubtless intend the
American hegemony to be gentler and kinder than the sort of hegemony
that prevailed in the ancient Persian Empire, say; more just even than
the Roman hegemony that gave peace, for some centuries, to several
lands -- relative peace, anyway, at the price of crushing taxation and
the extinction of earlier cultures.  But devastating Iraq (and the
rescued Kuwait) is an uncompromising way of opening an era of
sweetness and light.  Peoples so rescued from tyrants might cry, as
did the boy whom Don Quixote de la Mancha had saved from beating by
the muleteers but who was thrashed by them not long later,
nevertheless -- "In the name of God, Don Jorge de la Casablanca, don't
rescue me again!"
<P>
      Don Jorge de la Casablanca has toppled and imprisoned one
Central American despot -- somewhat small fry -- and is in the process
of dealing after the same fashion with one Mesopotamian despot,
somewhat larger fry.  "Well done!"  some cry.  It has all been rather
like deer hunting in my Michigan back woods.
<P>
      Yet presidents of the United States must not be encouraged to
make Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, nor to fancy that they can
establish a New World Order through eliminating dissenters.  In the
second century before Christ, the Romans generously liberated the
Greek city-states from the yoke of Macedonia.  But it was not long
before the Romans felt it necessary to impose upon those quarrelsome
Greeks a domination more stifling to Hellenic freedom and culture than
ever Macedon had been.  It is a duty of the Congress of the United
States to see that great American Caesars do not act likewise.
<P>
      Echo of 1984.  If that duty is forgotten, before many years are
out we may receive such television communications as follows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The voice from the telescreen paused.  A trumpet call,
      clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air.  The
      voice continued raspingly:
<P>
      "Attention!  Your attention please!  A newsflash has this
      moment arrived from the Malabar front.  Our forces in South
      India have won a glorious victory.  I am authorized to say
      that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war
      within a measurable distance of its end.  Here is the
      newsflash -- "
<P>
      Bad news coming, thought Winston.  And sure enough,
      following a gory description of the annihilation of a
      Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and
      prisoners, came the announcement that, as of next week, the
      chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to
      twenty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

      Perhaps you have already recognized the preceding passage from
Orwell's 1984.  Orwell describes our world of 1991, too.  Perpetual
War for Perpetual Peace comes to pass in an era of Righteousness --
that is, national or ideological self-righteousness in which the
public is persuaded that "God is on our side," and that those who
disagree should be brought here before the bar as war criminals.
<P>
      I shall have more to say about such concerns in my Third
Heritage lecture this year.  Just now I conclude my thoughts on
Republican errors by suggesting that it would be ruinous for the
Republicans to convert themselves into a party of high deeds in
distant lands and higher taxes on the home front.  Such a New World
Order, like the Pax Romana, might create a wilderness and call it
peace; at best, it would reduce the chocolate ration from thirty grams
to twenty.  And in the fullness of time, the angry peoples of the
world would pull down the American Empire, despite its military
ingenuity and its protestations of kindness and gentleness -- even as
the Soviet Empire is being pulled down today, thanks be to God.

(Updating Backgrounder Update No. 190, "North Korea's Nuclear Threat:
A Test for Bill Clinton," March 23, 1993, and Asian Studies Center

     There is little comfort for the United States or the world in
North Korea's June 11 decision to "suspend" its March 12 withdrawal
from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). The crisis North
Korea has precipitated by trying to build nuclear weapons is not over.
North Korea's latest decision, following intense discussions from June
2 to 10 between high-level U.S. and North Korean officials, did not
include a pledge by the North to resume international inspection of
its nuclear facilities. There is a real risk that North Korea is
negotiating with the U.S. merely to buy time to build its nuclear
weapons -- an event that may be imminent. Just last February, CIA
Director James Woolsey warned Congress that North Korea may have
enough nuclear material to build one bomb. President Bill Clinton must
now increase American pressure, in cooperation with South Korea and
Japan, to convince North Korea that it can no longer delay the
termination of its nuclear weapons program.

<P>
<B> PREVENTING NORTH KOREA FROM BUYING TIME</B>
<P>
     North Korea's June 11 announcement that suspended its decision to
withdraw from the NPT was correctly described by Secretary of State
Warren Christopher as an "interim step." The next step -- and it
should be taken immediately -- is to convince North Korea to resume
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and then by South Korean inspectors. Washington
must insure that the latest diplomatic "concession" by Pyongyang does
not merely grant it more time to build nuclear weapons. Unfortunately,
delaying tactics and a disregard for its promises are characteristic
of Pyongyang's efforts to stave off action by the international
community, as the following examples demonstrate: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Although North Korea signed the NPT in 1985, it refused until
     1992 to abide by treaty obligations that required international
     inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
<P>
     After finally allowing six IAEA teams to visit in 1992, and when
     an inspection late that year showed that North Korea may have
     produced more plutonium than Pyongyang had previously admitted,
     the North halted IAEA inspections. When pressure mounted on North
     Korea to resume inspections, it became the first country ever to
     announce its intention to withdrawal from the 150-member NPT. 
<P>
     North Korea has refused to honor a December 1991 agreement that
     would have allowed the North and South to inspect each other's
     nuclear facilities. This agreement was negotiated to create a
     nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. To assist it, the U.S.
     withdrew its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in late
     1991.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     North Korea's nuclear program is large and serious. Its one known
nuclear research facility, near the city of Yongbyon, has two nuclear
reactors. When both reactors begin operation -- perhaps later this
year -- they may be able to produce up to 115 pounds of plutonium a
year, enough for about seven nuclear weapons the size of those used by
the U.S. against Japan in 1945. 
<P>

<B> NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IS A GLOBAL THREAT</B>
<P>
     A nuclear-armed North Korea threatens U.S. allies and American
security interests in Asia. Nuclear weapons will further enhance North
Korea's military power, which includes one million men under arms,
over 700 aircraft, and a large arsenal of biological and chemical
weapons. The North's possession of nuclear arms also will multiply its
ability to threaten South Korea and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed
there. A nuclear-armed North Korea could increase pressure on South
Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear weapons, which will further
destabilize Northeast Asia. And just as Pyongyang is hawking SCUD
ballistic missiles to such dangerous Middle East states as Iran and
Syria, North Korea eventually may sell nuclear bombs to terrorist
states like Libya or Iran. This would significantly increase the
terrible possibility that Israeli or American civilian populations
could be subjected to nuclear blackmail or detonations.
<P>

<B> AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS NECESSARY TO STOP NORTH KOREA</B>
<P>
     As North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons would threaten
America and the world, the United States must provide the leadership
necessary to end North Korea's threat. This means that Washington, in
close consultation with Seoul, must set goals and a timetable for
results from Pyongyang. The long-term goal must be to convince North
Korea to terminate its nuclear weapons program. If this goal is not
met by early next year, it may be too late to stop North Korea from
building one or several nuclear weapons. The immediate goal must be to
convince North Korea to begin inspections of its nuclear facilities by
IAEA and South Korean inspectors. Such inspections must begin by the
end of July, to give the IAEA and other international experts time to
determine the extent of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. If
Pyongyang refuses, then it will have shown its duplicity once again.
Clinton must then forge a cooperative effort among South Korea, Japan,
China, and Russia to convince, or perhaps even force, North Korea to
abandon its nuclear ambitions. If necessary, this pressure should
include:
<P>
<B> Steadfast support for South Korea</B>. 
    <P> The U.S. must ensure that North Korea's nuclear weapons program
will not jeopardize America's security guarantees for South Korea. An
essential element of this guarantee is American steadfastness in
maintaining its ground and air forces in South Korea until North Korea
ends its nuclear weapons program. When Clinton visits South Korea on
July 10 and 11, he should strongly reaffirm America's commitment to
defend South Korea.
<P>
<B> Rhetorical pressure</B>. 
<P>     Clinton must use his influence as leader of the free world to
identify North Korea as a global nuclear threat. During the G-7
industrial nations summit in Japan in early July, Clinton should seek
a statement condemning North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
<P>
<B> Increased United Nations pressure</B>. 
  <P>   On May 11 the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
criticizing North Korea that was deliberately cushioned in diplomatic
verbiage to prevent China from vetoing the resolution. Pyongyang
nevertheless condemned that resolution. The next U.N. resolution must
be tougher and include the possibility of U.N.-enforced economic
sanctions.
<P>
<B> China's and Japan's cooperation</B>. 
<P>     Japan's cooperation is critical if economic sanctions become
necessary. Because the U.S. has no trade with North Korea, the U.S.
must ask Japan to be ready to cut its nearly $500 million a year trade
with North Korea. A far more important challenge for the U.S. will be
getting China's cooperation with economic sanctions. China, for
example, is the source of 60 percent of North Korea's energy needs.
<P>
<B> Offer of better relations</B>.  
   <P>  Clinton should offer better relations with North Korea only if it
terminates its nuclear weapons program. Such an offer should include
better diplomatic relations with, and more trade and investment from,
South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. However, such benefits should not be
conferred for piecemeal concessions by Pyongyang, such as the
resumption of international nuclear inspections. 
<P>
<B> Military options</B>. 
   <P>  A new war on the Korean Peninsula would be a catastrophe. It
could devastate South Korea and cost far more American and allied
lives than the recent Persian Gulf War. Yet, impoverished North Korea
remains desperate and volatile. Clinton must not rule out military
options and the U.S. should be prepared to repel any North Korean
attack on the South.
<P>
     Pyongyang's June 11 suspension of its withdrawal from the NPT
prevented -- for now -- North Korea's nuclear threat from becoming
Bill Clinton's first major foreign policy crisis. Yet, North Korea's
nuclear weapons potential remains a major challenge to America's
future in Asia. Resolution of this threat -- peacefully if possible --
will ensure that America benefits from Asia's increasing economic
growth. If the President does not take resolute action now, first to
convince North Korea to resume international inspections of its
nuclear facilities and then to end its nuclear weapons program, the
result is likely to be increased instability in Asia. Failure by
Clinton will likely result in several disasters: rising prospects of
nuclear terrorism, nuclear proliferation in Asia and the Middle East,
and possibly even the end of the system of American-Asian strategic
cooperation that has maintained peace and prosperity in Asia for
decades.

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wadethe Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortionwe have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusionssuch as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participantsregardless of race, sex, or residencemost often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motivesin some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestringmany have no paid staffand they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobbywe had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do thatthey have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically27 percentwhile the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appealit's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortionlegal or illegaldestroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomesor, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<title>Human Rights Treaty Poses Dangers for America -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3> HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY POSES DANGERS FOR AMERICA </h3>
By Andrew J. Cowin<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs <BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 361<br>
July 29, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 

Four years after the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the fall
of Communism, the Clinton Administration intends to present for
ratification a treaty shelved at the height of the Cold War because of
its embrace of socialist principles. The International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights establishes the rights to
housing, food, a fair wage, paid vacations, health care, and other
expensive benefits. The treaty was signed in 1977 by Jimmy Carter and
has been pending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since 1978.
This treaty should remain on the shelf. If ratified, it could become
law and have the same force as legislation passed by both houses of
Congress and signed by the President.
<P>
     The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 with
the support of the Soviet Union and the Third World non-aligned
movement. Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford refused to sign it, but
Jimmy Carter reversed that policy and signed the document on October
5, 1977, as part of his international human rights agenda. In a speech
to the World Conference on Human Rights this June, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher declared that the treaty "constitutes [an]
important advance," which the Clinton Administration views as a
"solemn commitment to be enforced."
<P>
     As a practical matter, signing a treaty laden with economic
rights is foolish. It accepts as a premise that government can create
wealth. If the 75-year communist experiment proved anything, it is
that government gets in the way of producing goods and services.
Abundant health care, housing, and food are byproducts of wealth
created by private individuals pursuing a profit. Even the most hard-
core former communists in Russia and China have come to understand
this.
<P>
     "Supreme Law of the Land." Unfortunately, the treaty may do more
than simply put the U.S. on record in support of bankrupt ideas. These
ideas may actually become part of U.S. law. Article VI, section 2 of
the U.S. Constitution states, "... all treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the authority of the United States, shall become the
supreme law of the land." Once the Senate ratifies international
treaties, they sometimes become the basis for American case law as
practiced in state and federal courts. One factor courts consider is
whether the cooperation of the other signatories is needed to enforce
the agreement.
<P>
     The classic legal example of this involves the 1918 Migratory
Birds Treaty covering the U.S. and Canada. In a landmark case two
years later, the state of Missouri challenged the right of the federal
government to mandate closed seasons and other treaty measures to
protect migratory birds like geese. The Supreme Court, however, agreed
with the argument that the birds were valued both as food and as
destroyers of insects, and that preserving them was in the national
interest. Protecting this interest required the cooperation of Canada.
The Court ruled that the Migratory Birds Treaty was part of federal
law and therefore pre-empted Missouri state law. (Missouri v. Holland,
252 U.S. 416 (1920).) 
<P>
     Another important consideration often taken into account by the
courts is whether the terms of the treaty can be met without spending
federal money. Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution
states, "All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives." In the case of the International Covenant, enforcing
the right to housing and other economic rights would require the
government to appropriate funds. This cannot be done without
additional legislation from Congress.
<P>
     Based on these considerations, no reasonable judge would conclude
that the International Covenant is meant to apply to domestic law.
However, not all judges are reasonable. For example, in the early
1950s, a state appellate court struck down the California Alien Land
Law solely on the grounds that it conflicted with the human rights
provisions of the U.N. Charter. The state's highest court rejected the
rationale, but upheld the decision based on the U.S. Constitution.
(Sei Fujii v. State, 38 Cal. 2d 718 (1952).)
<P>
     There have been other examples of U.N. documents being cited in
court cases. For example, several courts have cited the U.N. Standard
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners when deciding cruel and
unusual punishment cases, although none have based their decisions on
that document. (See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).) And
the Supreme Court in 1963 made a passing reference to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights to support the right of dueprocess for a
man denied a passport by the State Department. (Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U.S. 1 (1963).)
<P>
     Reading New Meaning. Activist judges use broadly worded documents
like the International Covenant to achieve a variety of social goals.
One such document on the U.S. statute books is the National
Environmental Policy Act. In a recent decision, federal Judge Charles
Richey read new meaning into the broad language of that Act, applying
its provisions for environmental impact statements to the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and thus endangering early ratification
of the agreement by Congress. Ignoring congressional intent, past
practice, and years of judicial precedent, Judge Richey's ruling in
favor of radical environmentalists could cause a foreign policy crisis
with Mexico if it leads to U.S. rejection of the agreement. (See
Marshall Breger, "Trade on Trial: NAFTA in the Dock," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 199, July 12, 1993.) 
<P>
     Clinton's proposal to ratify this treaty ignores centuries of
Western intellectual and economic history, while at the same time
embracing the theories of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Their ideas
are enshrined in the Soviet Constitution of 1936, written at the
behest of Josef Stalin. It contained many of the rights in the
International Covenant, including the right to housing, education,
medical care, a job, and leisure time. This cynical document
identified rights that were never meant to be granted. For decades,
though, it gave Soviet totalitarian governments the cover that
justified their accumulation of power and property. 
<P>
     For years, legal activists have tried to get American courts to
recognize this concept of economic rights. Generally, the courts have
refused. (See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (no
constitutional right of poor women to have taxpayer-funded abortions);
Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972) (no constitutional guarantee of
free housing).) This could change if courts decide that the
International Covenant is U.S. law.
<P>
     Ratification of this treaty could be a costly disaster. It would
violate the intellectual spirit of freedom and individual liberties
that has characterized America since its founding.

<title>Why the So-Called "Civil Rights" Bill Would Still Mean Quotas -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3> WHY THE SO-CALLED "CIVIL RIGHTS" BILL WOULD STILL MEAN QUOTAS </h3>
By  William G. Laffer III<BR>
       McKenna Fellow in Regulatory
                         and Business Affairs<BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 302<br>
June 3, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 

     George Bush last year vetoed a so-called "civil rights" bill
because it would encourage employers to adopt racial quotas in
employment decisions. This year's version of the bill, the "Civil
Rights Act of 1991" (H.R. 1), was introduced in the House by
Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat. Again there is a
debate over whether this legislation promotes quotas, and again the
proponents of the legislation claim that it does not. By the end of
last week, the bill had seen several revisions, each an attempt to
allay the fears that the bill is a quota bill. Yet there are still
solid grounds for such fears. It is still a quota bill that deserves a
presidential veto.
<P>
     Useless Provision. The latest version of H.R. 1 ostensibly would
prohibit the use of quotas. Its definition of a "quota" is so narrow,
however, and it has so many loopholes, that the provision would be
useless. While employers would supposedly be prohibited from setting
aside a fixed number or percentage of positions for people of a
particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin, they would
be free to engage in other forms of preferential treatment. Example:
Employers could give job applicants extra credit on employment tests
for being black or Hispanic, and could adopt a policy of always
choosing a minority whenever two applicants are otherwise equally
qualified. Moreover, an employer could use quotas as long as everyone
hired met the minimum necessary qualifications to perform the job. And
while it might be illegal for an employer to fire a department head
for failing to meet a hiring quota, the employer could make department
heads' bonuses, raises and promotions contingent on achieving quota
targets.
<P>
     Current civil rights law allows individuals to sue an employer
over legitimate and nondiscriminatory hiring practices if such
practices happen to produce a racial or ethnic mix in the employer's
work force different from that found in the general population. This
is called a "disparate impact." Section 102 of H.R. 1 would alter the
standards in disparate impact suits, making it more likely that
employers will lose, and more expensive for them even when they win.
This would encourage employers to try to avoid being sued in the first
place by giving special preferences to any groups that might otherwise
be under-represented in the employer's work force. 
<P>
     Among the changes H.R. 1 would make:
<P>
1)   It would not require plaintiffs to identify the specific
     employment practices that produce a disparate impact. Under the
     current language of the bill, all a plaintiff would have to do is
     to allege that all of the defendant's employment practices taken
     together produce a disparate impact. The burden of proof would
     then shift to the defendant to identify which of his employment
     practices, if any, actually produced the disparate impact, and to
     show that every one of these practices is "required by business
     necessity" -- an enormously difficult, if not impossible, task.
<P>
2)   It would change the standard for deciding whether an employment
     practice that produces a disparate impact is "required by
     business necessity." The current standard is whether a challenged
     practice serves any legitimate employment goals of the employer
     in any significant way. The new standard would require that
     challenged practices bear "a substantial and manifest
     relationship to the requirements for effective job performance,"
     thus making the standard much more difficult for employers to
     meet.
<P>
3)   It defines its standard of business necessity solely in terms of
     "effective job performance," thereby precluding consideration of
     other nondiscriminatory factors that can legitimately bear on
     employment-related decisions. For example, if a manufacturer were
     to close an unprofitable plant with a high percentage of minority
     workers, and the workers whose jobs were eliminated were to
     challenge the plant-closing decision based on its disparate
     impact, H.R. 1 would require the manufacturer to defend its
     decision solely in terms of the affected workers' performance,
     attendance, punctuality, and so on -- even though such factors
     had nothing to do with the closing, and even though the real
     reason clearly was non-discriminatory.
<P>
     Many employers almost surely would conclude that defending
against disparate impact suits simply is not worth the effort and
would instead alter their hiring procedures to produce the "right" mix
of race and sex within their work force. That is, the employer would
adopt quotas.
<P>
     Ignoring Provisions. Even if the anti-quota language in H.R. 1
were to prohibit any form of racial preference, it would not change
other aspects of the bill which create powerful incentives to promote
quotas in the first place. Several sections of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, meanwhile, already prohibit quotas; yet the courts have
generally ignored these provisions. And if the H.R. 1 anti-quota
provision were effective, it would put employers in an impossible
situation: They could be held liable if they failed to adopt quotas
and their work force happened to become imbalanced, but they also
could be held liable if they used quotas in an effort to keep their
work force numbers in line. 
<P>
     In addition, Section 104 of H.R. 1 also would restrict severely
the right of individuals harmed by quotas or other race-conscious
"remedies" imposed by consent decrees or court orders to seek redress
through an anti-discrimination lawsuit of their own. Thus, for
example, if an employer is ordered by a court to give half of all
promotions to blacks, better qualified Asians or Hispanics who are
denied promotions because of the new quota could be denied a day in
court. The real point of Section 104 is to lock in quotas by
protecting them from subsequent challenge. 
<P>
     Despite its revisions, emendations and explanations, H.R. 1
remains a quota bill. It thus still deserves a presidential veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The health care reform bills that have been approved by both the House and the Senate are being touted as a tiny step toward reform.  Perhaps, but when a giant like the federal government takes even a small step, it can create a thunderous reverberation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Some of the provisions of the legislation may help -- like increasing the deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed to 80 percent by the year 2006.  Others are mixed: the requirement that individuals can purchase health insurance is designed to assure "portability," but state experiences indicate the new mandate likely will destabilize the market for private health insurance policies by driving up costs. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Still others are echoes of a health care reform bill that crashed to defeat less than two years ago.  The House bill and to a lesser extent the Senate bill contain a confusing plethora of new fines, penalties, and jail terms for doctors, with broadened investigative powers for federal agents.  These provisions are designed to stop the leakage of an estimated 10 percent of Medicare dollars that are lost to "waste, fraud and abuse," and to stop overcharges in private plans.  But experience proves that trying to enforce cost containment with laws rather than market dynamics is a no-win game.  In the process, a huge amount of expertise and expense goes toward compliance rather than patient care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Here are some of the provisions drawn from the two bills that will be on the table when the House-Senate health care conferees go to work to produce a final bill:
<p><ul>
 <li>A new category of crime would be created, called "Federal Health Care Offenses."  Doctors could be sent to jail for 10 years if they misapply any assets used in health care, and they could be sentenced to life in prison if their wrongdoing results in a death.  They would go to jail for five years if they obstruct a health care investigation.
 <p>
 <li>A national health care Fraud and Abuse Control Program would be created to investigate the actions of doctors and other medical providers.  Doctors and health plans could be required to pay stiff civil penalties, forfeit property, and even pay for the investigations against them. In the House bill, the feds would issue special "Fraud Alerts" to warn people about offending doctors and health plans.
 <p>
 <li>Doctors could be fined up to $10,000 for delivering medically improper or unnecessary health care services, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services -- not patients and doctors -- defining what is medically necessary.
 <p>
 <li>A new crime is created for citizens who "knowingly and willfully" dispose of assets to qualify for Medicaid. They could be fined $25,000 or jailed for five years or both.
 <p>
 <li>Under the House bill, doctors also could be fined $5,000 or more if they certify that a patient who doesn't meet requirements is eligible for home health services.  
<p>
 <li>The federal government also would develop new standards for health plans to report financial and administrative information on patients.  The penalty for violating the standards:  up to $25,000 a year.  If the information is wrongfully disclosed: $250,000 and 10 years in jail.
<p>
 <li>The FBI would get involved in inspections, investigations, and prosecutions regarding health care matters with the aid of $47 million in additional funding next year and more each year after.  HHS also would get new money to go after doctors and health plans in the Medicare program -- more than $430 million in 1997, with funding increases each year.  The cost to taxpayers is only the tip of the iceberg; health care costs inevitably will rise as facilities devote even more resources to produce the information to defend themselves.
 <p>
 <li>The bills are very generous with long-term care services:  If a person needs help with any two daily living activities ("eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, or continence"), he or she would be eligible for payment under long-term care insurance -- which, by the way, receives a special new tax break.  Worse, any licensed health care provider, not just one associated with the insurer, could determine eligibility.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
	Certainly, if there are laws, they must be enforced.  But the requirements would be so confusing that doctors and patients would have trouble knowing the rules. Doctors, nurses, and health plans would be forced to focus even more on whether they are running afoul of a "Federal Health Care Offense" instead of treating their patients. If they slip up, they may find the FBI at their doorstep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	It is ironic that at a time when the Congress is trying to devolve more power to the states,  it is giving the federal government broad new powers to go after doctors, hospitals, and health plans -- powers that are eerily similar to those granted to the much-despised Internal Revenue Service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	A system based upon regulation requires tighter and tighter rules to close an ever-growing number of escape hatches.  Ultimately, regulators cannot win. The only way to stop this escalating spiral is to give individual consumers more control over decisions about their health coverage, not to further criminalize the health care system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The bills do give patient watchdogs new incentives -- such as offering Medicare beneficiaries a payback for reporting erroneous billing.  The conferees are expected to go to work soon and hope to have a final bill on President Clinton's desk before Memorial Day. When they convene, they would be well advised to give cost-conscious consumers -- not a brigade of federal agents -- more control over health care dollars.

<title> The Meaning of "Justice" - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<CENTER><H3><I>THE MEANING OF "JUSTICE"</I></H3>
by Russell Kirk<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Lecture #457<br>
March 4, 1993<br>
</CENTER>
<p>

     The word "justice" is on everyone's lips nowadays, and may
signify almost anything.  We hear the cry "Peace and Justice!"  from
folk who would destroy existing societies with fire and sword.  Other
folk fancy that perfect justice might readily be obtained by certain
financial rearrangements -- as if anything in this world ever could be
perfected.  One thinks of the observation of William James:  "So long
as one poor cockroach suffers the pangs of unrequited love, this world
will not be a moral world."  At the end of the twentieth century, the
liberal mentality demands justice for roaches, too.
<P>
     All confusion about the meaning of the word "justice"
notwithstanding, the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica
contains no article under the heading "Justice."  Yet there is a
succinct article about justices of the peace, of whose number I once
was one, before the state of Michigan swept away that high office.  My
lecture today may be regarded as the attempt of a fool, rushing in
where the angelic Britannica fears to tread.  Yet possibly the nature
of justice may be apprehended by a mere quondam justice of the peace: 
for the fundamental purpose of law is to keep the peace.  "Justice is
the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations
together," said Daniel Webster at the funeral of Justice Joseph Story,
in 1845; and so say I today.
<P>
     I propose in this series of four lectures to discuss first the
signification of this word "justice"; in my second lecture, to examine
natural law; in my third, to deal with criminal justice; in my
concluding lecture, to quarrel with certain notions of justice that
have been much puffed up during recent years.  In the twenty-first
century of the Christian era, will justice signify anything more than
the state's rigorous enforcement of its edicts?  Such questions I hope
to raise in your minds. 
<P>
<P>
      Nowadays, near the close of the twentieth century, moral and
political disorders bring grave confusion about the meanings of old
words.  As T.  S.  Eliot wrote in "Burnt Norton" -- 
Words strain,
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under the
     tension, slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision, will
     not stay in place, Will not stay still.  Shrieking voices
     Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering, Always assail them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Conspicuous among such venerable words, in our era often abused
and misrepresented, is this necessary word justice.  Today I am
attempting to purify the dialect of the tribe -- to borrow another
phrase from my old friend Eliot, who endeavored lifelong to rescue
words from the clutch of the vulgarizer or of the ideologue.
<P>
     Permit me first to offer preliminary descriptions or definitions
of this word justice.  Jeremy Taylor, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, wrote that there exist two kinds of justice.  The one is
commutative justice, or reciprocal justice, expressed in Scripture
thus:  "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do to
them."  In Taylor's words, "This is the measure...  of that justice
which supposes exchange of things profitable for things profitable,
that as I supply your need, you may supply mine; as I do a benefit to
you, I may receive one by you....  "
<P>
     The other kind is distributive justice, expressed in this passage
from Romans:  "Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is
due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor;
owe no man anything but to love one another."  Upon this Taylor
comments, "This justice is distinguished from the first, because the
obligation depends not upon contract or express bargain, but passes
upon us by some command of God, or of our superior, by nature or by
grace, by piety or religion, by trust or by office, according to that
commandment, 'As every man hath received the gift, so let him minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God.'"
<P>
     But perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, I proceed too fast; I shall
have more to say a little later about the Christian concept of
justice.  Just now a little about the classical idea of justice.  The
classical definition, which comes to us through Plato, Aristotle,
Saint Ambrose, and Saint Augustine of Hippo, is expressed in a single
phrase:  suum cuique, or "to each his own."  As this is put in
Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis, "Justice is a habit whereby a man
renders to each one his due with constant and perpetual will." 
Aristotle instructs us that the prevalence of injustice makes clear
the meaning of justice.  Also Aristotle remarks that it is unjust to
treat unequal things equally -- a principle to which I shall return in
my later lectures.  Of the virtue called justice, Saint Augustine
declares, "Justice is that ordering of the soul by virtue of which it
comes to pass that we are no man's servant, but servants of God
alone."
<P>
     Upon such ancient postulates, classical or Christian, rests our
whole elaborate edifice of law here in these United States -- even
though few Americans know anything about the science of jurisprudence. 
For public order is founded upon moral order, and moral order arises
from religion -- a point upon which I mean to touch later in this talk
of mine.  If these venerable postulates are flouted or denied -- as
they have been denied by the Marxists in the present century, and were
denied by sophists in Plato's time -- then arbitrary power thrusts
justice aside, and "they shall take who have the power, and they shall
keep who can."
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     All these brief definitions require explanation.  But for the
moment I pass on to the common understanding, the common sense, of the
meaning of justice.  All of us here present, I suppose, entertain some
notion of what justice signifies.  From what source do we obtain such
a concept?  Why, very commonly, from observation of a just man or a
just woman.  We begin by admiring someone -- he may be some famous
judge, or he may be an obscure neighbor -- who accords to every person
he encounters that person's due.  Just men, in short, establish the
norm of justice.  When I began to write my book The Conservative Mind,
I discovered that the abstraction "conservatism" amounts to a general
term descriptive of the beliefs and actions of certain eminent men and
women whom we call "conservative" because they have endeavored to
protect and nurture the Permanent Things in human existence.  So it is
with justice:  in large part, we learn the meaning of justice by
acquaintance with just persons.
<P>
     In the ancient world, the most just of men was Solon, Athens'
lawgiver, poet, and hero.  As Solon wrote of his reform of the
Athenian constitution -- 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Such power I gave the people as might do, Abridged not what
     they had, nor lavished new; Those that were great in wealth
     and high in place My counsel likewise kept from all
     disgrace.  Before them both I kept my shield of might, And
     let not either touch the other's right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     To each class, that is, Solon gave its due, and so preserved the
peace:  that is social justice. 
<P>
     But we need not turn to the pages of Plutarch to discover just
men:  they are not an extinct species, though perhaps an endangered
one.  I think of my grandfather, Frank Pierce, a bank-manager in
Plymouth, twenty miles north of Detroit.  He was the leading man of
Lower Town (now called Old Town), near the railroad yards -- not
because he was either rich or charismatic, but because he was just. 
Justice, of course, is one of the cardinal virtues; and like the other
virtues, justice is said to be its own reward -- which is well, the
virtue of justice seldom earning material rewards.  When a member of
the town council, my grandfather refused to supply water free of
charge to the town's principal industrial plant, on the grounds that
if the factory couldn't pay water bills, who could?  For that offense,
the firm's president swore he would have Pierce discharged by the
bank; but the bank's president happening also to be a just man, my
grandfather's livelihood was not swept away.  My grandfather's counsel
was sought by everyone in the Lower Town who needed advice; and his
kindliness even moved him, on occasion, to extend interest-free
personal loans, from his own pocket, to young married couples who
could not meet the requirements for loans from the bank.  (His salary
was two hundred dollars a month.) I do not mean that he was
indiscriminately sentimental; not at all.  On the several occasions
when robbers invaded his branch bank, he successfully repelled them,
at great risk:  for the just man defends vigorously whatever is
entrusted to his charge, and sets his face against the lawless.  He
was just to children, too:  taking me on long walks, during which we
talked of everything under the sun, but rapping sharply on the dining-
room table when I waxed impudent at meals -- I immediately abashed and
repentant.  By watching this kindly paterfamilias, and listening to
what he said, I came to apprehend justice quite early.  For Frank
Pierce gave every man his due, without fear or favor.
<P>
     In every society, from the most primitive to the most decadent,
there are found some persons, like my grandfather, whom everyone
recognizes as just.  (Even bank-robbers and kidnappers -- for he was
kidnapped once by desperados -- remarked that Frank Pierce was a just
man.) From what source do such just men and women derive their habits
or principles of justice?
<P>
     Are they familiar with jurisprudential theories?  Only rarely: 
even most judges on the bench nowadays are not well grounded in the
philosophy of law.  My grandfather, who possessed a substantial
library -- perhaps the only library in Plymouth's Lower Town -- read
history, but not philosophy or law.
<P>
     Are their concepts of justice learnt in church?  Not so,
ordinarily.  My grandfather never attended church:  he came from a
family that began as Pilgrims to Massachusetts and gradually moved
through all the American stages of the dissidence of dissent.  He
never read the Bible at home.  He inherited Christian morals, but not
Christian faith in the transcendent.
<P>
     Do they create for themselves a rough-and-ready utilitarian
scheme for the administering of justice, founded principally upon
their private experience of the human condition?  Only infrequently, I
think; for most of them would subscribe to the maxim of Benjamin
Franklin, "Experience is a hard master, but fools will have no other."
<P>
     Well, then, how do just men and women apprehend the meaning of
justice?  From tradition, I maintain:  from habits and beliefs that
have long persisted within family and within local community. 
Aristophanes, contradicting Socrates, argued that virtue cannot be
taught in schools or by tutors:  rather, virtue inheres in old
families.  I believe that to be especially true of the cardinal virtue
called justice.  Or this tradition of justice, families and
communities aside, may become known through private reading, perhaps: 
anyone who attentively reads the great Victorian novelists, say,
cannot well escape absorbing, even if unaware of his acquisition,
principles of personal and social justice.  More obvious, if more rare
nowadays, is the influence of the Greek and Roman classics toward
forming an affection for justice.  Until well into the nineteenth
century, Cicero was studied in every decent school; and this passage
from that statesman-philosopher implanted an apprehension of the
nature of justice:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Law is the highest reason, implanted in nature, which
     commands what ought to be done and forbids the opposite. 
     This reason, when firmly fixed and fully developed in the
     human mind, is law.  And so they believe that law is
     intelligence, whose natural function it is to command right
     conduct and forbid wrongdoing.  They think that this quality
     has derived its name in Greek from the idea of granting to
     every man his own, and in our language I believe it has been
     named from the idea of choosing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     In short, there exists a literary tradition expounding the idea
of justice.  The most recent popular example of this tradition is to
be found in an appendix to C.  S.  Lewis's little book The Abolition
of Man.  Therein Lewis sets side by side, drawn from various cultures,
illustrations of the Tao, or Natural Law.  He groups these precepts or
injunctions under eight headings:  the law of general beneficence; the
law of special beneficence; duties to parents, elders, ancestors;
duties to children and posterity; the law of justice; the law of good
faith and veracity; the law of mercy; the law of magnanimity. 
Everywhere in the world, in every age, Lewis is saying, wise men and
women have perceived the nature of justice and expressed that nature
in proverb, maxim, and injunction.
<P>
     At this point one may inquire, "Are you implying that just men
and women find in religious doctrines -- Hebraic, Christian, Moslem,
Hindu, Buddhist -- the fountains of justice?"  Yes, I am so reasoning. 
The sanction for justice will be found, ultimately, in religious
insights as to the human condition, and particularly in Revelation. 
Our so-called "Western" concepts of justice are derived from the
Decalogue, Platonic religious philosophy, and the teachings of the
Christ.  Somewhere there must exist an authority for beliefs about
justice; and the authority of merely human, and therefore fallible,
courts of law is insufficient to command popular assent and obedience.
<P>
     It does not follow, however, that all just men and women
recognize the ultimate source of ideas about justice, or appeal to
that ultimate source.  My grandfather never read a line that Saint
Thomas Aquinas wrote, though his understanding of justice accorded
well enough with what Aquinas expresses so convincingly in the Summa. 
To my grandfather the justice-concepts of the Hebraic and classical
and medieval cultures were transmitted through British and American
moral, legal, and literary traditions, and through long custom and
habit within his family and within the small-town American communities
where he had lived.  If pressed as to why he held a certain
understanding of the word "justice" -- indeed, he once compulsorily
engaged in a dialogue on that subject with a rather Nietzschean
desperado intent on persuading my grandfather to open his bank's safe
-- I suppose that Frank Pierce would have replied, "Because good men
always have so believed."  Securus judicat orbis terrarum, bonos non
esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quacunque parte terrarum,
Saint Augustine of Hippo instructs us -- "The calm judgment of the
world is that those men cannot be good who, in any part of the world,
cut themselves off from the rest of the world."  The word justice
implies obligation to others, or to an Other.
<P>
     Thus far I have been describing the concept of justice that
prevailed in the Western world down to the closing years of the
eighteenth century.  Behind the phrase "to each his own" lay the
beliefs that divine wisdom has conferred upon man a distinct nature;
that human nature is constant; that the idea of justice is implanted
in the human consciousness by a transcendent power; and that the
general rule by which we endeavor to do justice is this:  "to each
man, the things that are his own."
<P>
     What is meant by this famous phrase?  To put the matter very
succinctly, the doctrine of suum cuique affirms that every man,
minding his own business, should receive the rewards which are
appropriate to his work and duties.  It takes for granted a society of
diversity, with various classes and interests.  It implies both
responsibility toward others and personal freedom.  It has been a
strong protection for private property, on a small scale or a great;
and a reinforcement, for Jews and Christians, of the Tenth
Commandment.  Through the Roman law, this doctrine of justice passed
into the legal codes of the European continent, and even into English
and American law.
<P>
     Injustice, according to this doctrine, occurs when men try to
undertake things for which they are not fitted, and to claim rewards
to which they are not entitled, and to deny to other men what really
belongs to those other men.  As Plato puts it, in The Republic, quite
as an unjust man is a being whose reason, will, and appetite are at
war one with another, so an unjust society is a state afflicted by
"meddlesomeness, and interference, and the rising up of a part of the
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is
made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
natural vassal -- what is all this confusion and delusion but
injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every
form of vice?"
<P>
     Edmund Burke re-expressed this doctrine of "to each his own"
when, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, he wrote of true
natural rights:  "Men have a right to the fruits of their industry,
and to the means of making their industry fruitful.  They have a right
to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and
improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to
consolation in death.  Whatever each man can separately do, without
trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has
a right to all which society, with all its combinations of skill and
force, can do in his favor."
<P>
     And yet in Burke's own time, there arose a very different idea of
justice, the Utilitarian concept, expounded by Jeremy Bentham.  From
Bentham's jurisprudence there is descended the powerful present-day
school of legal thought that we call legal positivism or legal
realism.  Positivistic jurisprudence arose in alliance with
nineteenth-century nationalism and with scientific mechanism and
materialism.  To the legal positivist or realist, laws are the
commands of human beings merely.  There exists, for the positivist, no
necessary connections between law and morals, or between law as it is
and law as it ought to be.  The positivists' legal system is a closed,
logical system without need for referring to social aims, policies, or
moral standards.  So-called "moral judgments," to the positivists, are
"value judgments" merely:  and value judgments cannot be established
or defended by rational argument.  This positivistic understanding of
justice and law looms large in American courts today.
<P>
     But in this lecture I do not have time to analyze the strengths
and weaknesses of legal positivism.  For the present, I do no more
than to point out that nineteenth- and twentieth-century positivism
stands in harsh opposition to both the classical and the Christian
understanding of justice and law.  In Catholic universities, at least,
some defense still is offered of the Augustinian virtue of justice and
the venerable theory of natural law.
<P>
     It is my purpose in today's remarks to state the classical and
the Christian concept of justice, as opposed to the positivists'
denial of any source for justice except the commands of the sovereign
state.  And I will touch glancingly upon the connections among
religion, justice, and law.  (Justice and law are not identical,
though they may be closely related:  in a good commonwealth, law is an
attempt to maintain standards of justice, so far as that may be
achieved in a bent world.)
<P>
     All law is derived from the religious understanding -- that is,
all law in the traditional societies of the West; law in totalist
states is another matter entirely.  Moses came down from Horeb and did
justice upon criminous Israelites:  the prophet as lawgiver.  Solon
reformed the laws of Draco:  the religious poet as lawgiver.  When law
is divorced from the moral sanction of religious convictions,
presently the law is corrupted by passion, prejudice, private
interest, and misguided sentimentality.
<P>
     The church is concerned with the inner order:  the order of the
soul.  The state is concerned with the outer order:  the order of the
commonwealth.  Between state and church, nevertheless, relationships
are ineluctable.  Among these relationships is an understanding of
justice.
<P>
     Such relationships took shape in the West so early as the fifth
century of the Christian era.  We perceive them in the connections
between Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, and his friend Boniface, Count of
Africa.  In theory, all Christians of the West believe in separation
of church and state -- though sometimes that principle has been more
honored in the breach than in the observance.
<P>
     The church recognizes the necessary end of the state, and so
submits to the state's laws.  Because of human sinfulness, the Fathers
of the Church taught, the state is ordained of God.  As best it can,
the state restrains the three chief forms of lust:  cupidity, the lust
for possessions; the libido dominandi, the lust for power; and sexual
lust, the abuse of the gift of procreation.  When the state is
enfeebled, these lusts work the ruin of the person and the republic.
<P>
     So it is that the church, even in Roman imperial times, has
taught obedience to civil magistrates.  Saint Augustine reasoned that
the good citizen, the believing Christian, should obey every command
of the state, save one:  an order to worship false gods and to serve
Satan.
<P>
     Yet church and state have different ends, though both uphold
justice.  There runs through the history of Christianity the doctrine
of the two swords:  the church's sword of faith, the state's sword of
secular justice.
<P>
     Knowing that this earthly existence is not the be-all and end-
all, the church holds that perfect justice is in the power of God
alone, beyond the confines of time and space.  In this world here
below, we mete out justice as best we may.  Sometimes we err in our
administering of justice; it cannot well be otherwise; we are not
perfect or perfectible creatures.
<P>
     To apprehend the church's stand on mundane justice, it is
desirable to make distinctions between crime and sin.  A crime is an
act or omission which the law punishes on behalf of the state, whether
because that act or omission is expressly forbidden by statute, or
because it is so injurious to the public as to require punishment on
the ground of public policy.
<P>
     A sin is a transgression against moral law, with that law's
divine sanctions.  It is God, not the State, who punishes or forgives
sins.
<P>
     Not all sins are crimes.  We have it on the authority of Saint
Paul that the greatest of the theological virtues is charity. 
Therefore uncharitableness is a great sin; yet lack of charity is not
an offense at law.  A man may be all his life snarling, sneering,
contemptuous, envious, abominable in his language toward his wife, his
children, and others to whom he owes obligations -- that is, perfectly
uncharitable; yet he will run no risk of being haled before the bar of
criminal justice.  The uncharitable may be dealt with at the Last
Judgment.  But mundane courts of law do not touch the sinner unless
his sins result in violence or fraud or substantial damage to others. 
The state is unconcerned with sins unless they lead to breaches of the
peace, or menace the social order.  This separation of function
accords with the doctrine of the two swords.
<P>
     Quite as the state -- that is, the constitutional state -- does
not lay down religious dogmata in recent times, so the church does not
decree the laws of mundane justice, as expressed through courts of
law.  When the church has endeavored to impose its doctrines through
the operation of the state's criminal law, the church has erred.
<P>
     I have been speaking of orthodox Christian doctrine, interwoven
with principles of law in America, Britain, and many other countries
-- interwoven, that is, until recent decades.  But great confusion has
fallen upon us in these years near the end of the century. 
Increasingly, the state -- aye, the democratic state, too -- separates
itself from the religious understanding of the human condition.  And a
good many churchmen abandon Christian realism for a sentimental
humanitarianism.
<P>
     Let me remind you of the true signification of this word
"humanitarianism."  Properly defined -- and this is the definition one
still finds in the Oxford English Dictionary -- humanitarianism is the
doctrine that Jesus of Nazareth possessed a human nature merely, not
being divine; and, by extension, the doctrine that mankind may become
perfect without divine aid.  A humanitarian is a person totally
secularized in his convictions.  Yet erroneously many people use
"humanitarian" as a term of commendation.  "He was a great
humanitarian," they say of Albert Schweitzer.  That charitable and
heroic man, a professing Christian, would have rejected indignantly
that label.
<P>
     Now what has this distinction between humanitarianism and charity
to do with justice?  The point is this:  the humanitarian denies the
existence of sin, declaring that what we call "sins" are not moral
matters at all, resulting instead from circumstance, faulty rearing,
or social oppression.  In the view of the humanitarian, sins -- and
crimes, too -- are the work of "society"; and sinners and criminals
are victims, rather than unjust offenders.  Such reasoning is the
consequence of holding that man and society may be perfected through
mere alteration of social conditions, without the intervention of
divine grace.
<P>
     The humanitarian frequently proclaims his abhorrence of severe
punishments -- perhaps of any punishments.  Why?  First, because of
his illusion that no human being possesses the ability to make moral
choices.  Second, because of his horror of inflicting pain.  He leaves
no ultimate justice to God, because he fancies that no God exists. 
The mere preservation of one's comfortable earthly life is his
obsession, he fancying that man is not made for eternity.
<P>
     On the other hand, the humanitarian fulminates against those who
disagree with his principles.  Thus there occurs the phenomenon called
"the humanitarian with the guillotine."  (The recent French film
called Danton sufficiently illustrates this ferocious love of all
humankind.) As Edmund Burke put it, speaking of the humanitarian
Jacobins, men who today snatch the worst criminals from the hands of
justice tomorrow may approve the slaughter of whole classes. 
Humanitarian apologies in our own time for butchery by communist
revolutionaries sufficiently suggest the persistence of this curious
intolerant humanitarianism.  The ideologue need merely proclaim that
his object is universal happiness here below, and he is approved
uncritically by the humanitarian.  As Solovyev wrote, the banners of
the Anti-Christ will bear the legend, "Feed men, and then ask them of
virtue."
<P>
     In this disordered age, when it seems as if the fountains of the
great deep had been broken up, our urgent need is to restore a general
understanding of the classical and Christian teaching about justice. 
Without just men and women, egoism and appetite bring down a
civilization.  Without strong administration of justice by the state,
we all become so many Cains, every man's hand against every other
man's.  The humanitarian fancies himself zealous for the life impulse;
in reality, he would surrender us to the death impulse.  The
humanitarian's visions issue from between the delusory gates of ivory;
justice issues from between the gates of horn.
<P>
     Public instruction that ignores both our classical patrimony and
our religious patrimony may fail to rear up just men and women. 
Positivist jurisprudence that denies any moral order and any religious
sanction for justice may end in a general flouting of all law.  We
prate of "peace and justice" in a dissolving culture, without
apprehending tolerably the words we employ.  "Shrieking voices/
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,/ Always assail them."  These
are the voices of the ideologue, the neurotic, and the nihilist,
pulling down the old understanding of Justice, "to each his own."
<P>
     "Justice is a certain rectitude of mind, whereby a man does what
he ought to do in the circumstances confronting him."  So Thomas
Aquinas instructs us.  At every college and university, the doctors of
the schools ought to inquire of themselves, "Do we impart such
rectitude of mind?  And if we do not, will there be tolerable private
or public order in the twenty-first century?"

<title>The Crime Bill's Faulty Math Means a $28 Billion Unfunded Liability to the States -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><I> THE CRIME BILL'S FAULTY MATH MEANS A $28 BILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY TO THE STATES </i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott A. Hodge</a><br>
Grover M.  Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary
Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

F.Y.I. No. 29<br>
August 16, 1994<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>
 
President Clinton is making a last-ditch effort to revive the $33
billion crime bill that Congress rejected last week on a procedural
vote. Among the arguments Clinton is using to sway lawmakers is the
claim that if Congress passes this measure, the bill's $8.8 billion
Community Policing grant program will add 100,000 new cops to local
police forces over the next six years.
    <P> Clinton is wrong. The numbers just don't add up. The crime bill
provides full funding for only 20,000 permanent new cops. Meanwhile,
it saddles state governments with a $28 billion unfunded liability
over the next six years if the bill is to result in 100,000 new
officers. States such as California and New York will have to raise
some $3 billion each to meet the Administration's promise.
 <P>   The reason this happens is that the Community Policing grant
program is intended only to provide "seed" money to local governments
to hire new police officers, not to fully fund these positions. So the
bill assumes that once these new officers have been hired with
Washington's help, state and local governments will find the billions
of new dollars needed to keep them on permanently. The bill provides
just one-fifth of the funds needed over six years to hire and keep
100,000 new cops on the street in high-crime areas. (For more
information on these calculations, see Scott A.  Hodge, "The Crime
Bill:  Few Cops, Many Social Workers," Heritage Foundation Issue
Bulletin No.  201, August 2, 1994.) Thus, if cities do not cut back on
other services or raise taxes, the funds provided in the bill can keep
at most just 20,000 permanent cops on the street over the six-year
life of the bill. Even more problematic for state and local officials,
if they use federal funding to hire the new police officers and then
cannot raise the funding needed to keep them, officials will have to
start laying off cops after the first year of the bill.
  <P>   Another way to look at this financial sleight-of-hand is to
calculate how much funding the bill provides per police officer per
year. On average, the bill authorizes $1.475 billion per year for
100,000 new officers. This amounts to just $14,750 per cop per year --
roughly the poverty level for a family of four. Police officers
cannot, of course, be hired for minimum wage salaries, and so state
and local governments would have to absorb the remaining cost of
hiring and keeping each of these new cops.
   <P>  To give taxpayers a better understanding of the total cost of the
crime bill, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the amount of
new resources states will have to raise over six years if they choose
to apply for the federal Community Policing grants. As is seen in the
following table, these calculations show that state governments will
have to raise a total of over $28 billion of their own funds to meet
Clinton's promise.
 <P>   Eight states (California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio) will have to absorb more that $1
billion each in new costs over the next six years to fully fund their
share of the 100,000 new cops. At the bottom end of the scale, the
fourteen states likely to receive the minimum amount of federal aid
for new police officers -- and, of course, the fewest number of new
cops at 500 per state -- will still find themselves liable for over
$143 million each in added expenditures to meet the bill's lofty goal.
  <P>   Large states, such California and New York, will be particularly
hard hit. Although California is estimated to receive 10,827 new cops,
it will have to absorb some $3.1 billion in new costs to keep them on
the street. Similarly, New York is estimated to receive 10,407 new
cops but will be burdened by some $3 billion in new costs. Neither of
these states is in the fiscal condition to bear this expense. Texas
could hire nearly 6,400 new officers but would face an unfunded
liability of over $1.8 billion by doing so.
 <P>    In reality, the unfunded liability for some large states will be
even higher than these estimates suggest. This analysis assumes that
the Community Policing grants will be distributed proportionately
according to a state's share of the national police force (see
technical notes in the appendix). But the crime bill allows 75 percent
of the Community Policing funds to be distributed at the discretion of
the Attorney General. This means that the Administration may play
politics with these funds and reward loyal mayors and local
politicians in politically important states -- or House members the
White House needs to win passage of the bill. (Last year, Congress
passed an emergency supplemental bill which included $150 million in
aid to hire 2,000 new police officers.  Nearly 45 percent of these
funds went to four key states:  California, Florida, Illinois, and
Texas.) But, ironically, this will raise the taxpayer liability in
these states even higher. 
   <P>  The dirty little secret of the crime bill is that it will not put
100,000 new police officers on America's streets unless the states
raise taxes or cut other spending to finance a massive $28 billion
unfunded liability. Once most states realize the magnitude of these
new costs it is likely that far fewer permanent cops will actually be
hired. However the computation is made, the result is the same: Bill
Clinton's crime bill actually funds only a fraction of the promised
100,000 new cops.
<P>
     
<B> TECHNICAL NOTES </B><P>
     These calculations have been made using a conservative estimate
of the average cost of hiring and keeping a police officer on the beat
in small and large cities. In small cities, such as Elkhart, Indiana,
the total cost of putting a permanent cop on the beat is $50,000 to
$55,000 per year. In large cities, such as San Francisco, this cost
rises to $70,000 to $75,000. The average used in this analysis is
$62,500. This figure includes salary and fringe benefits, training,
and some administrative costs. It does not include equipment costs
such as police cars and radios. In most cities, a new police cruiser
is needed for every three or four officers hired.
<P>
     This analysis assumes that the Community Policing funds and,
thus, the 100,000 new cops, will be distributed proportionately among
the states according to the current state-by-state distribution of
roughly 534,000 police officers nationwide. The source for these data
is the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics -- 1992, published by
the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
    <P> The crime bill requires that no state receive less than 0.5
percent of the Community Policing funds. Thus fourteen small states,
whose share of the nation's police force is less than 0.5 percent,
were automatically allotted this minimum share of funds for new
officers. The remaining funds and new cops were then distributed
proportionately among the other states.
   <P>  The federal contribution per state for new cops is based upon the
$14,750 per cop per year the bill authorizes. The state liability is
then based upon the residual amount of $47,750 ($62,500 - $14,750).

<title>Reining in Federal Judges: The Crime Bill's Unexpected Gift to the States -- Heritage</title>

F.Y.I. No. 40<br>
October 11, 1994<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>

     Although criticism of the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994 concentrated on its wasteful social spending,
equally disturbing is the Act's expansion of federal government
intrusion into areas of clear state and local responsibility. However,
largely unnoticed in the Act, which President Clinton signed into law
last month, is an amendment sponsored by Representatives Charles
Canady (R-FL) and Preston Geren (D-TX ) that places the first, long-
overdue limits on the power of federal courts to interfere arbitrarily
in the administration of state and local prisons. By prohibiting
prisoners from using class action suits against state prisons to
remedy alleged overcrowding, the amendment requires that individual
plaintiffs demonstrate that they have suffered actual harm from
overcrowding before the courts can use that rationale as a basis for
their decisions. And by limiting the power of federal judges to place
arbitrary population caps on state prisons, the legislation will help
stop the courts from releasing felons onto the streets.
  <P>   Federal judicial encroachment into all aspects of state prison
administration has grown rapidly since the mid-1960s. Much of this has
been prompted by alleged shortcomings in the states' treatment of
prisoners, but federal judges have gone far beyond simple remedial
measures. Federal courts regularly issue detailed instructions
covering every aspect of prison life, forcing states to provide
prisoners with state-of-the-art law libraries, the full inventory of
recreational equipment, including pool tables and specific board
games, air conditioning, and even color televisions. These federal
decisions and consent decrees, which are supposedly voluntary
agreements with the courts that in reality often are coerced by the
threat of more severe judicial action, have cost the states millions
of dollars in legal fees and compliance costs.
    <P> While these impositions are costly, there is a more direct threat
to the safety of law-abiding citizens: the use by federal judges of
"population caps" and prisoner releases from state prisons and jails
to relieve the "overcrowding" that these federal judges say violates
the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. These
releases, begun in earnest in the early 1980s, have resulted in the
early parole, pre-trial release, and probation of hundreds of
thousands of violent criminals across the nation. And even in those
prison systems not under direct federal court supervision, there has
been a chilling influence as many states have opted for early release
of prisoners in an effort to avert federal court action against them.
  <P>   Section 20409 of the Crime bill (the Canady-Geren amendment) has
the potential to change this situation by prohibiting federal judges
from using population caps or forced releases "unless crowding is
inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified
prisoners." Previously, no harmful impact on any individual prisoner
needed to be demonstrated; any judge, pursuant to unwritten standards,
could determine that such harm was being inflicted on the prison
population in general. Now, actual harm to specific individuals must
be demonstrated. Similarly, the bill limits the ability of courts to
accept class action suits on overcrowding, stating that such crowding
can be deemed unconstitutional only if "an individual plaintiff inmate
proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual
punishment of that inmate." 
  <P>   Previously, federal judges have forced cities and states into
consent decrees without ever investigating whether alleged abuses were
in fact occurring or whether a population cap or forced release would
actually remedy the problem--or even considering the effect of early
releases on society. For example, after a population cap was imposed
on Texas prisons by federal judge William Wayne Justice in 1981, the
state parole board increased early prisoner releases by over 400
percent; by the late 1980s, inmates served an average of only two
months for every year sentenced. The same consent decree required the
state to keep its prison population at 95 percent of prison capacity.
As a result, over the last several years, violent felons continued to
be regularly released before completing their terms even though the
state had over 6,000 empty beds in its prisons.
   <P>  Philadelphia has been suffering from the same type of arbitrary
federal intervention, mostly due to two consent decrees entered into
in 1986 and 1991 between then-mayor Wilson Goode and federal judge
Norma Shapiro. In order to reduce perceived overcrowding, these
decrees prohibit pre-trial detention except for the most violent
criminals. As a result, Philadelphia authorities are effectively
prevented from detaining large numbers of robbers, carjackers,
stalkers -- and even terrorists -- because the decrees do not classify
them as "violent" criminals. According to Mayor Ed Rendell, this has
made the city a more dangerous place. Despite the sweeping nature and
negative effects of these consent decrees, however, in neither case
was Judge Shapiro required to determine that the Constitution had in
fact been violated through any specific overcrowding or that any
general overcrowding had resulted in cruel and unusual punishment
being inflicted on any individual prisoners. 
   <P>  Today, 39 states and 300 of the nation's largest jails operate
under some form of federal court direction. Court orders cover the
entire prison systems of nine states; Essex County in New Jersey, Cook
County in Illinois, and Philadelphia are but a few of the local
jurisdictions that still operate prison systems under the direction of
federal courts. 
   <P>  The effects of these policies have been dramatic: early releases
have been a major factor in high levels of violent crime. Nationally,
almost one-third of all violent crimes are committed by people on pre-
trial release, probation, or parole. In Florida, 20,350 criminals were
released early last year to comply with a statewide prison population
cap imposed by a federal court. In Cook County, approximately 30,000
prisoners each year are released from pre-trial detention under a
similar cap and commit an additional 7,500 violent crimes annually. By
the mid-1980s, violent criminals on average were spending less than a
third of their sentences behind bars. Although those numbers have
improved slightly, in 1993, criminals in state prisons served on
average only 37 percent of their sentences behind bars.
   <P>  Canady-Geren removes many of the pretexts heretofore used by the
federal courts to maximize their interference into state and local
prison administration. For example, in the past, many federal judges
have used the "totality of circumstances" in state prisons as an
excuse to throw a wide net over all aspects of state prison
administration, prescribing detailed instructions for everything from
magazine subscriptions to the permitted wattage of lightbulbs. By
requiring federal judges to deal in demonstrable specifics, rather
than broad generalities, Canady-Geren makes it more difficult for
these judges to abuse their authority. Federal judges also are barred
from issuing population caps unless the cap is the least intrusive
means available to remedy the situation.
  <P>   In addition to the limits on arbitrary actions by federal judges,
the Canady-Geren amendment also provides state and local governments
with tools to reopen burdensome judicial decrees and findings and to
seek redress through appellate review. Some of the most onerous
federal consent decrees are over a decade old. In Texas, for example,
Judge Justice established an ongoing consent decree that, until last
year, bound the state to requirements set in the early 1980s.
  <P>   To address this problem, a provision of the Canady-Geren
amendment requires federal judges to reopen and review any court order
or consent decree at least every two years if requested by the
affected city or state. Until the amendment became law, decisions were
reviewed only at the whim of the federal judge, regardless of any
changes in circumstances or pleas from the affected jurisdictions. And
even now, these can only request a reexamination, but cannot force a
revision of the decree. However, the legislation does provide the
possibility of additional relief through broadened provisions for
appellate review of the decrees, which previously was rarely possible.
   <P>  For all of its potential benefit, the Canady-Geren amendment
addresses only one aspect of federal judicial encroachment into state
prison administration. A companion amendment that would have
prohibited frivolous inmate suits in federal courts was defeated in
committee. Congressmen Newt Gingrich (R-GA) is proposing to
reintroduce it in the next Congress as part of a broader strategy to
return power to communities on issues of crime. 
   <P>  However, the Canady-Geren amendment is an unexpected ray of hope
for states and local governments. By itself, this amendment will not
eliminate the early release of violent prisoners. But state officials
who are determined to stop the revolving door in America's prisons now
have a tool to prevent federal judges from running roughshod over
state and local governments.

<h3>LESS FROM WASHINGTON, MORE FROM US: A CITIZENSHIP AGENDA FOR A RISING, SHINING AMERICA</h3><P>

<b>By Lamar Alexander</b><br>
Candidate for the President of the United States<br>
January 5, 1996<br>

<P>
<b>A Wake-Up Call</b><p>
In only nine weeks, we will know who Republicans will nominate to be the first President of the next century. This year, the race is a 40-yard dash. Washington is already telling us to expect a Dole-Clinton contest, a debate about what is going on in Washington, and then another Clinton presidency. I am here today to challenge the Washington wisdom and deliver a wake-up call to the Republican Party.

<P>Republicans know in our hearts that we cannot defeat Bill Clinton with a message that is only about cutting government in Washington. Yet, so far, that is all the debate has been about: more or less government, more or less spending, CBO numbers versus OMB numbers, a Senate bill versus a House bill. The public is being cheated out of the most important conversation. The debate we should be having is beyond the budget.

<P>It is about ending 60 years of the New Deal/Great Society mentality that has looked to government to meet every social need. It is about ending the equation between compassion and government spending. It requires the courage to stand up and say this equation is a lie, it is false, and it is hurting people. Most important, the debate we should be having is about creating a new understanding of the respective roles of citizens, communities, and government.

<P>Most Americans in the real world are living lives beset by anxiety and fear; the breakdown of our families, neighborhoods, and schools; and the upheaval brought about by the computer age and disappearing jobs. Hearing and watching this dance in Washington, they must be wondering, "Is that all there is?"  Does everyone there wear green eyeshades, talk about OMBs and CBOs, believe that the solution for every problem involves getting some bill out of a subcommittee?  Is there nobody willing to talk with us about what kind of America we will have in the year 2000 and beyond, and how we're going to get there?  If the coming presidential campaign is about government rather than citizenship, about budget bills rather than communities, about what goes on in Congress rather than what goes on in our neighborhoods, churches, schools, and families, and Republicans offer no more vision than what is provided in their charts, then the prospects are indeed bleak for 1996. The combination of a President Clinton and a Speaker Gephardt is a nightmare we don't want to wake up to on November 5. After all, we should not forget that 1928 was the last time a Republican Congress was re-elected. 1994 was a realigning election, but how secure is the realignment?

<P>We already have a good idea of what the President's re-election strategy is. Clinton will run as a caring visionary offering adult supervision for the excesses of the Republican revolution. So we cannot defeat Bill Clinton tactically. We have to defeat him by giving the electorate a clear choice of two visions of America: a vision of an America that works, family by family, community by community, versus an America of group rights, declining opportunities, and children trapped in schools where they can't learn.

<P>Here's the truth: Charts and graphs, even when they score the right economic points, will never win the larger debate. Big government, by itself, did not create all the problems we have today, and less government, by itself, will not solve those problems. Which is why we need to focus in a positive way on where we are going. It may be more fun to explain what's wrong with the Great Society programs and the welfare state we want to dismantle, but we have both a moral and strategic imperative to do more than that: We need to paint a clear picture of the kind of America we want to see.

<P>My purpose today is to invite you to join me in setting a different agenda for the Republican presidential contest:<ul>

<li>To move the debate outside Washington, D.C., and beyond the budget.

<li>To capture the moral high ground, without which no party can be a majority party.

<li>To paint a picture of our country's future that provides voters with a real choice.

<li>To offer a New Promise of American Life that depends upon expecting less from Washington and more from ourselves, with the emphasis on more from ourselves.</ul>

<p><b>A Vision Contest</b><p>

On my walk across New Hampshire, I came across a lady taking a break from her work at a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander, and I'd like to be your next President."

<p>The lady looked at me and at my red and black shirt and said, a little alarmed, "That's all we need. Another President!"

<p>Given the President we've got, I can understand how the lady feels. At a time when our greatest problem is teaching our children the difference between right and wrong, Bill Clinton is exactly the wrong man to have in the White House as President of the United States of America.

<p>That doesn't mean he won't talk a good game. He gets up on both sides of the bed every morning. He is disappointing because he lacks a vision, but he is dangerous because he can fake a vision. And the American people are hungry for a vision contest about what kind of country we will have in the year 2000 and beyond.

<p>We must not present them with a choice between a Democratic President faking a vision and a Republican nominee who is too decent to fake one. President Clinton is rejoicing, and Speaker Gephardt is measuring his new office.

<p>Let me ask you to imagine what will happen next October. There will be a presidential debate. Forty million Americans will be watching. We know what Bill Clinton will do. Someone will ask him a question. He'll move out from behind the podium and walk over to the questioner. He feels the questioner's pain. He gives a very good answer. If the Republican nominee's response is to start talking about how to get a bill out of a subcommittee, or OMBs and CBOs, Bill Clinton will be President and Dick Gephardt will be ready to take the Speaker's chair.

<p>That is why the Republican Party needs a wake-up call.

<p>We must nominate someone who can paint a picture of the future based upon conservative principles that is brighter and more compelling than the picture Bill Clinton paints based upon whatever he woke up believing that day.

<p>It is time for a new generation of leadership.

<p>Losing the White House, losing the House of Representatives -- losses that would have been laughed at a few months ago -- are, all of a sudden, part of the Republican conversation. There is a surprising number of Republicans who make themselves feel better by assuming that even if Bill Clinton is re-elected, Newt Gingrich will continue moving the revolution forward as Speaker of the House.

<p>But where is it written in stone that Newt Gingrich will be Speaker in 1997?  The upcoming race will be a referendum on the Republican agenda. Our nominee's job will be to persuade more than half of America that the surest course into the new century is with a Republican government: a Republican President and a Republican Congress.

<p>If the nominee is unable to articulate the vision of the revolution, he will not only fail to win the White House, but could drag others to defeat with him, putting the House and the revolution itself at risk. With the increase we have seen in straight ticket voting in the last few elections, this prospect is now more likely than ever.

<p>Whether Republicans like it or not, Bill Clinton will make the 1996 election about principles and values -- he already is doing so -- not just about policy. So the standard bearer of our party had better be a leader who can articulate both the party's vision and the complete message of the Republican revolution.

<p>I am the only candidate with a realistic chance of winning the nomination who can defeat President Clinton by pitting against his campaign rhetoric a true vision of the country's future that can capture not only the minds, but the hearts of the American people.

<p><b>A Rising, Shining America</b><p>

The goal of the Republican revolution is not just to balance the budget, but to renew our institutions and rebuild America.

<p>This is the America I can see in the next century:<ul>

<li>An America in which parents can drop their children off at school in the morning, confident that they will be safe and that they will learn.

<li>An America in which you are not afraid to take a walk in your own neighborhood after dark.

<li>An America in which the number of abortions and divorces is declining, where families stick together, and fathers stick around.

<li>An America with a 4 percent home mortgage rate so that a working family can afford its home and where there's a good new job for every job that disappears.

<li>An America strong enough to defend itself and wise enough not to become involved in anyone else's civil war unless we are prepared to pick one side and win the war.

<li>An America in which our first thought about each other is something other than the color of our skin.

<li>An America where we are not ashamed but proud to call ourselves "One Nation Under God."

<li>An America where instead of constant complaining about what is on TV, we can almost hear millions of TVs clicking off as families spend more time together and parents actually raise their children.
</ul><p><b>
The New Promise of American Life: Changing the Way We Think</b><p>

To build the good society in the new century, we must change dramatically our thinking about how we get there. For most of this last century, we have measured our progress by a beautiful idea called the promise of American life: the idea that, in America, tomorrow will be better than today and that every single one of us will have an opportunity to be a part of that future. But whenever we have said "We must do more" to extend the promise of American life to more people, "we" has always meant "Washington."  More from Washington has been the thinking that has dominated our civic life since the New Deal and the Great Society. The failures that have resulted from this kind of thinking are now too obvious to ignore. Republicans have successfully made the case against this view of government. We have convinced the public that they need less government in their lives. But less government is only half the equation. To move ahead, to create a new agenda for our party and for our country, we need to talk about the other half of the equation: Less from Washington has to go hand in hand with more from ourselves.

<p>The Republican revolution, after all, was never just about dismantling Washington, D.C. That was a necessary step, but only a first step. What the revolution is also about is making it easier for Americans to rebuild those institutions that bind us together: the family, the neighborhood, the church, the synagogue, the school, and the community. And, finally, it is about putting those institutions to work.

<p>That is the central message of my campaign. And I believe it must be the heart of the Republican agenda leading to November. The Clinton re-election strategy is predicated on the idea of a Republican Party that talks only of tearing things down and taking things away. We must not fall into his trap, not only because this is the way to lose, but, more important, because this would be a betrayal of our responsibility to articulate a positive vision for rebuilding America.

<p>Less from Washington and more from ourselves is a difficult message, and an inconvenient one. But it is time to tell the truth. The answers to many of our most serious problems are not in legislative solutions and are not in Washington, D.C. And any political leader who shrinks from speaking this truth does not deserve the nomination of the party of the revolution.


<p>In 1994, I edited, together with Checker Finn, a book of essays entitled <i>The New Promise of American Life.</i> Our purpose was to present a picture of what America would look like if we reversed our thinking and moved more responsibility out of Washington. This past fall I published a book, <i>We Know What To Do,</i> a collection of stories of the most interesting men and women I met on an eight-week drive across America. All of these are examples of my belief that we know exactly what to do and thousands are already doing it: Father Jerry Hill, who runs the Austin Street Shelter in Dallas; Rev. Henry Delaney, a 500-pound minister who took back an inner-city street in Savannah; the police chief of Charleston, Reuben Greenberg; Sister Jennie and her Puente Learning Center in Los Angeles. Their stories illustrate how to replace the current failed systems, and they demonstrate that it takes a bigger heart to say "I will help you" than "I will lobby the government to help you."

<p><b>Less from Washington, More from Ourselves: A Citizenship Agenda</b><p>

<p>Often, when I am in Washington, I am asked why I would want to come here as President if I simply want to send everything back home. My answer is that I am not seeking the job of President of Washington, D.C. I want to be President of the whole country.

<p>Less from Washington and more from us is not a Washington message, of course. But it is the theme that, as President, will define my agenda, guide my thinking, and help a Republican administration focus on the most important issues: citizenship, personal responsibility, and giving Americans more control over their own lives. We need to stop studying the problems and start solving them. We need a sense of urgency that permeates what we do today, and every day, because so much is at stake. We need a President who is determined enough, even stubborn enough, not to let special interests and defenders of the failed status quo get in the way of a citizenship agenda that will eliminate the obstacles standing between the American people and all that they can be -- for themselves, for their families, and for their communities. I intend to throw myself into the fulfillment of this agenda with everything I have, tolerating no institutional excuses or bureaucratic delays.

<p>Here is what I would do as first President of the next century to give us less from Washington.

<p><b>An Entrepreneurial Economy and Vouchers for Job Training.</b> My first goal would be to remove the barriers that stand in the way of unleashing entrepreneurial creativity and community action. I will know I have succeeded when creating a new job becomes easier than getting an unemployment check. I would focus on the job spigot instead of the job drain, so that every year we would create enough new jobs to replace the ones we are losing. By entirely abolishing the capital gains tax and drastically simplifying our tax code, and by turning the $25 billion in federal job training programs into job training vouchers for workers changing jobs, we would transform a bureaucratic and stifling industrial age environment into one that is flexible and responsive to the changing needs of an America on the threshold of a new century.
<p>
I am comfortable talking about these ideas because I've done what I think every politician should be forced to do: lived under the rules I helped create. In 1987, after I left the governor's office in Tennessee, I helped start a company that today employs 1,200 people. So I know what is involved in starting a new business. And I know what removing Washington's barriers would do to encourage others to start new businesses of their own.
<p>
<b>A GI Bill for Kids.</b> But nothing will change in this country until we change an educational system that keeps poor children trapped in failed schools where they can't learn and from which they cannot escape. In the 1960s, George Wallace stood in the courthouse door telling the black children of Alabama they could not get in. Today, the teachers' unions and politicians beholden to them are standing in the school doors telling poor children they cannot get out.
<p>
Fighting this opposition will be one of our toughest challenges. I know. I fought the teachers' union in Tennessee for a year and a half in order to pay teachers more for teaching well. They beat me once, but I came back and succeeded. I am prepared to do it again. So step number one is to abolish the U.S. Department of Education and put responsibility for education back where it belongs, in the families and in the classrooms. And to make it easier for middle- and low-income parents to have a choice about where their children go to school, I would introduce a $1 billion GI Bill for Kids that would provide scholarships for children who need them.
<p>
<b>Put Welfare Decisions in the Hands of Citizens.</b> In the area of welfare, there is widespread consensus that it needs to be reformed. Walking in New Hampshire, I met a couple that had just returned from the welfare office, where they were encouraged to separate in order to get higher welfare benefits. This is an example of the compassion by bureaucracy that has undermined personal responsibility and our social responsibility for those in need. Ending welfare as an entitlement is a first step, but Congress has still ended up with a bill that runs more than 800 pages full of rules and regulations. Less from Washington and more from us means going beyond block grants and ending entirely Washington's involvement in caring for those in need.
<p>
Giving communities and individuals a real stake in how we help the poor means keeping the money that is now sent to Washington at home and letting communities create their own nonprofit corporations so they can decide how to help people in need. We also should have a tax credit, as Senator Coats has suggested, so that Americans can directly support local charities instead of handing the money over to the federal tax collector.
<p>
<b>Cut Their Pay and Send Them Home.</b> But it is very hard to change the bankrupt culture of Washington if you are the culture of Washington. That is why we need a part-time citizen Congress. The best way for Congress to understand the citizenship agenda is to begin practicing it by spending less time in Washington and more time in their communities. I would cut the pay of Congress in half and send them home for half the year. Even a Republican Congress would be a better Congress if it were a part-time citizen Congress. To accelerate this fundamental change in our political system, I would lead the national call for term limits and an end to the million dollar pensions that reward members of Congress for making politics a lifetime career.
<p>
<b>What Would America Look Like?</b>

<p>Earlier this week, the New York Times published a funny piece about my red and black plaid shirt. The Times pointed out that in many places, the shirt is better known than I am. That shirt, which I wore as I walked across Tennessee in 1978, and which I have worn as I walked across New Hampshire this summer, has been the butt of many jokes. But there is a serious point I am trying to make with my plaid shirt, too.

<p>It stands for the folks I've been talking to for the past two years in neighborhoods, churches, schools, and communities from one end of our nation to the other. I've found far more wisdom in the plaid shirts of America than in all the empty suits in Washington. The folks in plaid shirts understand what's wrong with America, and more important, they know what to do to fix it.

<p>I am often asked: After these changes come about, who would help the poor?  Who would teach the children who need the most help?  Who would help the homeless?

<p>Across America, I've seen firsthand what works. It is Americans in their everyday lives, doing extraordinary things in suburbs as well as in the trenches of our inner cities, giving us a glimpse of what America could look like.<ul>

<li><b>In Dallas,</b> Father Jerry Hill. Father Hill was outraged that the federal government was paying $446 a month to drug addicts who then wanted to come into his shelter. "How can I help them," he says, "when they have that kind of support for their dependency?"

<p><li><b>In Savannah,</b> Rev. Henry Delaney. "Why don't they ask me about welfare?"  he said to me. "I work every day with people who need help. I know what to do."

<p><li><b>In Charleston,</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg. He fought for two years for permission to throw known crack dealers out of housing projects so that single mothers who were following the law could live there in safety.

<p><li><b>In Milwaukee,</b> the remarkable people who helped give low-income parents a voucher so that their children would not be stuck in a bad school. When the courts stopped the program Governor Thompson had instituted just after the school year had begun, the community rushed to its defense. There was an emergency campaign which raised $1.8 million to send almost 5,000 children from poor families to the private schools of their parents' choosing -- complete with a talk show host offering to match up to $1,000 in donations with his own funds, and an elderly couple celebrating 52 years of marriage by sending in the $50 they had set aside for an anniversary present. Bill Bennett and I visited these schools in September, and what we saw were parents and teachers who, despite the court order and despite the media attention, wanted to get the best education they could for their children. They had been given an opportunity to make decisions for themselves and their children, to act as involved citizens, and they were seizing it.</ul>

<p>These stories are not isolated examples. They are the American way of life. They are the tinder for a prairie fire of personal and social responsibility that, with lots of encouragement, could sweep across our country.

<p>The next President needs to be a little bit of a preacher willing to say the most important words the first President of the next century can say: We should spend less time trying to figure out what the government owes us and who to blame for what goes wrong and more time accepting personal responsibility for the consequences of our own actions.

<p>If our children are running around the streets where we live, we should go get them. If they are not learning to read, we should read to them. My first library card came from my mother, not from the President of the United States. If the television is trash, we should turn it off. If the babies in a Detroit hospital are born already exposed to cocaine because their mothers are crack addicts, we can shoot down a drug plane and appoint a new czar, but in the end, the problem is not in Washington; it is in Detroit.

<p>A few months ago, I visited Mt. Dora, a wonderful little community in Florida. As I was leaving, a reporter told me an eighth grader had murdered a classmate. The reporter then asked me what I would do about that as President. The answer a Senator might give is: Pass a federal law against guns in schools. But I replied: The answer is not in Washington; the answer is in Mt. Dora. Only the families, neighborhoods, churches, and schools of Mt. Dora can keep a tragedy like that from happening again.
<p>
<b>The Role of the Presidency</b>
<p>
Earlier I mentioned how I have been asked why I would want to come to Washington to serve as President if I think we should move so much out of Washington. To ask this question is to fundamentally misunderstand the role of the presidency. We seem to be forgetting what the job of the President actually is. The President is the nation's agenda setter. A President has the power to move a crisis to the center of the public debate and to national attention, and to energize millions of Americans to deliver the solutions.

<p>But in my administration, the opportunity to educate, persuade, and motivate through the megaphone that our Constitution and the TV age have given the President will be devoted to my citizenship agenda.

<p>When I say I am an outsider, it is not because I don't know Washington, but because I know unequivocally that the solutions are outside Washington. I don't trust Washington solutions, and I don't trust Washington predictions.

<p>The majority of Republican primary voters are looking for a new generation of leadership that will build on the beginnings of the Republican revolution and carry it forward to the next century. I believe I will be that candidate.

<p>The choice voters will face, as I said at the outset of this speech, is a Republican Party that persists in speaking only about legislation and budgets versus a Republican Party that shifts the agenda to one of citizens, communities, families, churches, synagogues, and schools. Once that candidate, who can carry the citizenship agenda, has been brought to the forefront, the alternative will suddenly become clear, and the defining political debate will be heard not just on weekend talk shows, but in front of millions of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, throughout New England, across the South and the rest of the country.

<p>I intend to be that alternative because I will advance what I think is the right agenda and the winning agenda for the Republican future.

<p>So the Republican nominating process of 1996 really begins this week. It is a contest about where the country will go and who can paint the most compelling picture of its future. My job -- our job -- is to ensure that voters have the right choice in that contest so that, three months from now, we are setting the agenda rather than reacting defensively to an agenda set by Bill Clinton. And ten months from now, if we are the ones who set the agenda, we will have a truly historic opportunity to lead the Republican revolution into the next century.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Only one major health care reform proposal guarantees secure and
portable health insurance coverage for every American family while not
destroying jobs, according to a recent study conducted for the
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's
largest association of small business owners. That reform proposal is
The Heritage Foundation's Consumer Choice Health Plan. (See Stuart M.
Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide to the Health Care Crisis, Part II:
The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Talking
Points, February 28, 1992; Stuart M. Butler, "Using Tax Credits to
Create an Affordable Health System," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder,
No. 777, July 26, 1990; Stuart Butler and Edmund F. Haislmaier, eds.,
A National Health System for America (Washington, D.C.: The Heritage
Foundation, 1989).)
<P>
     CONSAD Research Corporation, which conducted the study, is a
major health care research firm based in Pittsburgh. (CONSAD Research
Corporation, The Employment Impact of Proposed Health Care Reform on
Small Business, May 6, 1993. Available from the NFIB Foundation, Suite
700, 600 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20024.) Its
calculations are based on labor impact models developed for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. In the NFIB study, CONSAD
concludes: "The Heritage Foundation's proposal is estimated to have no
effect, severe or moderate, on employment." The other universal health
care proposals analyzed by CONSAD were the "managed competition" plan
developed by the so-called Jackson Hole Group, the employer mandate
plan designed by California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, and
the "play or pay" bill introduced in 1991 by the Democratic leadership
in Congress. Each of these would lead to heavy job losses, because of
the extra labor costs they would impose on firms. Another proposal
examined by CONSAD, the Conservative Democratic Forum plan, would not
cost jobs. But unlike the other plans modelled, including the Heritage
proposal, it would not lead to universal coverage.
     <P>
THE HERITAGE PLAN
<P>
     Under the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, each worker would
have the right to use the money currently paid by his or her employer
for health coverage to purchase any other health insurance plan of the
worker's choice, from any source. Any resulting savings would go
directly to the family. In addition, the worker could direct these and
other funds into a medical savings account to pay for future health
expenses. These workers, as well as workers currently without
employer-provided insurance, would receive a substantial tax credit
for the payments made for family health insurance premiums, medical
savings account contributions, or out-of-pocket health expenses. The
credit would be "refundable," meaning that families near or below the
tax threshold would receive the equivalent of the tax credit in the
form of a voucher.
<P>
     Through this market-oriented plan, consumers are given broad,
powerful market incentives to consider the costs and benefits of
different health insurance plans, and the medical services they buy
directly. They would tend to avoid unnecessary health care. And since
consumers would be far more directly concerned with costs, doctors,
hospitals, and insurers would compete far more vigorously to reduce
costs. Such market incentives and competition, not government price
controls, are the most effective means for reducing costs. (Edmund F.
Haislmaier, "Why Global Budgets and Price Controls Will Not Curb
Health Costs, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 929, March 8,
1993.)
<P>
     At the same time, the Heritage Plan would require each individual
to purchase a basic catastrophic health plan, just as in most states
automobile drivers are required to purchase at least a minimum
liability insurance policy. This health insurance requirement is to
protect other members of society from having to pay for the cost of
care for the uninsured. Through the refundable credit, low-income
Americans would be given government assistance to pay the premiums. 
<P>
     The Heritage Plan thus provides for universal coverage without
imposing extra costs on employers -- and so would not reduce

<P>               No jobs lost or put at risk.  
 
<P>THE JACKSON HOLE PLAN
<P>
     The ability of the Heritage Plan to achieve universal coverage
while protecting jobs contrasts sharply with the managed competition
proposal advanced by the Jackson Hole group of policy experts,
including Professor Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, physician
Paul Ellwood, and others. (Peter J. Ferrara, "Managed Competition:
Less Choice and Competition, More Costs and Government in Health
Care," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 948, June 29, 1993; Robert
E. Moffit, "Overdosing on Management: Reforming the Health Care System
through Managed Competition," Heritage Lecture No. 441, April 15,
1993.) This proposal would require all employers to purchase at least
a set of standard federally designed health insurance plans for their
employees and their families, through regional insurance cooperatives
-- or directly from insurers in the case of larger employers. The
proposal seeks to steer workers into Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs) or similar managed care networks in which the consumer's choice
of doctors and services is limited. This proposal is typically called
"managed competition," or the "Jackson Hole Plan." 
<P>
     The CONSAD study concludes that because of the cost of the
mandate to employers, the managed competition proposal would put 16.3
million small business jobs, or almost 25 percent of all small
business employment, "at risk." This means that workers would be
subjected to prolonged layoffs, reduced compensation, or future job
cutbacks and plant closings. The study estimates that between 900,000
and 1.5 million small business jobs would be lost once the proposal
was implemented. These negative effects would occur because the
mandated employer payments for health insurance would raise the cost
of labor and, consequently, encourage many employers to reduce
compensation or to cut jobs.

<P>
CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES 
 <P>
     900,000 to 1.5 million jobs directly lost.  
  <P>   16.3 million jobs put at risk.  
 
<P>
THE GARAMENDI PLAN 
<P>
     Another proposal analyzed in the CONSAD study is advanced most
prominently by the Insurance Commissioner of California, John
Garamendi. This proposal would be similar to the managed competition
proposal, but would finance the health insurance package through a
payroll tax. Under the proposal, employers and employees would pay a
combined 9 percent payroll tax to regional cooperatives, which would
make available to families a range of plans meeting minimum
specifications.
<P>
     This proposal bears the closest similarities to the plan being
developed by the Clinton Administration. The CONSAD study estimates
that this proposal would put about 6.6 million small business jobs, or
about 10 percent of all small business employment, at risk of reduced
work or benefits, with from 390,000 to 650,000 jobs eliminated
altogether. This loss again occurs because the payroll tax on
employers raises the cost of labor. The study notes, incidently, that
the proposed 9 percent payroll tax probably would be insufficient to
finance the expected benefits, which would include workmen's
compensation and health care for auto injuries. If a higher payroll
tax were necessary, as is likely, it would cause larger job losses.

 <P>
          390,000 to 650,000 jobs directly lost.  
   <P>       6.6 million jobs put at risk.  
 
<P>
THE PLAY OR PAY PLAN
<P>
     Another major proposal examined in the CONSAD study is the "play
or pay" plan advanced in recent years by leading congressional
Democrats. (Stuart M. Butler, "Why 'Play or Pay' National Health Care
Is Doomed to Fail," Heritage Lecture No. 329, August 14, 1991; Edmund
F. Haislmaier, "The Mitchell HealthAmerica Act: A Bait and Switch for
American Workers," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 170, January
17, 1992.) This is the primary proposal for employer-mandated health
insurance being considered in Congress. Under this proposal, employers
have a choice: Either they must purchase health insurance providing at
least certain specified benefits to their employees and their
dependents, or pay a tax for similar coverage to be provided by the
government. 
<P>
     The CONSAD study concludes that the additional labor costs
imposed on many firms by this requirement would put 11.5 million small
business jobs, or about 17 percent of all small business employment,
at risk of reduced work or compensation. CONSAD estimates that from
650,000 to 1.1 million Americans would lose their jobs.

<P>
      
     CONSAD ESTIMATE OF JOB LOSSES:   
 <P>
          650,000 to 1.1 million jobs directly lost 
  <P>       11.5 million jobs put at risk.  

<P>
THE CDF PLAN
<P>
     The final major proposal studied is a version of managed
competition included in a bill (H.R. 5836) introduced by
Representative Jim Cooper, the Tennessee Democrat, and other members
of the Conservative Democratic Forum, a caucus of conservative
Democrats in the House of Representatives. While similar to the
Jackson Hole Group's proposal, this bill differs in a crucial respect:
It would not require employers to pay for employee health insurance.
It would require employers only to make such insurance available
through regional cooperatives for purchase by workers if the employer
did not choose to pay for it. 
<P>
     Since the CDF bill would not require any increase in labor costs,
the CONSAD study found it would have no significant negative effect on
employment or jobs. The bill, however, does not achieve universal
coverage, unlike any of the other plans analyzed, since the uninsured
likely would remain without insurance. The reason: Neither employee
nor employer would have any new requirement or assistance to purchase
coverage.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
     Most of the leading health care reform proposals, including the
emerging Clinton plan, seek to finance expanded health insurance at
least in part by imposing new financial obligations on employers. This
method of finance has a political advantage. It hides much of the cost
of coverage from those who will ultimately pay the cost -- American
workers. This cost is not just financial. By increasing the cost of
labor in many firms, it would mean fewer jobs and reduced wages paid
to those with jobs.
<P>
     This effect is well understood by economists and business owners,
if not, unfortunately, by the workers most affected. The CONSAD study
actually quantifies these effects. The study indicates that three of
the five major proposals examined -- and by implication the emerging
Clinton plan -- would mean heavy job losses and put millions more jobs
at risk.
<P>
     There are only two plans that would not cost jobs. One is the
proposal advanced by the Conservative Democratic Forum. But while it
avoids job losses by not imposing a mandate on employers, it does not
achieve universal coverage. There is only one plan that leads to
universal coverage with no job losses. That is the Heritage Foundation
Consumer Choice Health Plan.

Heritage Lect: Federalism and the Environment
 -- Heritage </title>
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 534</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>A Federalist's Approach To Protecting the Environment</h3>
<p>
Governor Symington of Arizona delivered the keynote address at the Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank conference, "An Environmental Agenda for the Twenty-First Century" on June 19, 1995.
<p>
<br>
Whenever I join the environmental debate, as I often do, I'm reminded of a problem that conservatives always face. The left regard our environment as their issue, their ideological property. Whatever ideas we might have, whatever arguments we might offer, our motives are always suspect. Here as elsewhere, liberals have a way of turning every rational debate into a contest of emotional authenticity. Any who would challenge them must first demonstrate enough "sensitivity" for the liberals' satisfaction.
<p>
The absurdity of this posture strikes me every time I come to Washington. Often I'm here seeking relief for my state from one or another environmental regulation, edict, or fine. This means constant haggling with Washingtonians eager to tell me what's best for Arizona.
<p>
It's always fascinating to leave behind my hiking boots and the mountains of Arizona, and come here to be lectured by "naturalists" whose rugged trails run through Georgetown, Dupont Circle, and Rock Creek Park. In fact they seem to revere everything about our state -- except for the opinions and livelihoods of the people who live there.
<p>
I have been asked to describe a federalist approach to protecting the environment. Most environmentalists, I suppose, would regard that juxtaposition as some sort of bold intellectual synthesis, as if the two ideas were opposites to be reconciled. By philosophy and instinct, they just equate the environmental cause with centralized federal power. Tonight, I'll explain why I reject that connection -- why, in fact, just the opposite is true. I'd also like to set down some specific proposals for reform and conclude with my vision of wise environmental reform.
<p>
Let's begin in the most basic, common-sense terms.
<p>
Federalism is not some elaborate theory of government. It's the simple insight that most problems are best left to the people nearest to the problem, people with direct knowledge of the circumstances. The more you remove the influence of local power, the more you atrophy the dynamism of local decision making. Government in a federalist system tends to be more efficient, and the people tend to be freer.
<p>
Environmentalism, stripped of the quasi-religious nonsense that today often goes with it, amounts in the end to simple stewardship. At its best, it's the sense all decent people have that with the natural riches given humanity comes a duty to use them wisely. A moral duty, a civic duty, but a quite practical one as well.
<p>
To me, the connection between these ideas -- stewardship and self-government -- could not be more apparent. Obviously, we have to manage our land, water, air, timber, minerals, and wildlife with care. And just as obviously, that duty is usually best understood and carried out by the people living upon that land.
<p>
Sure, there are exceptions. We all recognize that some resources and natural treasures are a national responsibility. Historically, I suppose you could trace this sense of national responsibility back to 1849, when we established the Department of the Interior. In fact, we should restore the Department to its staffing level of 1849. It was the first federal department created after 1789, so its federalist credentials are pretty sound. There is a consensus as to our national stake in good stewardship, and it is of long standing.
<p>
But if we have this consensus, why is there so much bitterness to our environmental disputes?  As I see it, there are two reasons. 
<p>
First, the bitterness, the anger, the endless controversy arise from the methods by which environmentalists and the federal government attempt to carry out their aims. Good stewardship, it seems to me, has to begin with a higher opinion of human nature than many environmentalists today bring to the matter. There would be a lot less bitterness if they did not rely so much upon government dictate and coercion, if they were not always eyeing their fellow citizens with such deep distrust.
<p>
My brand of environmentalism begins with these three assumptions:  Conservation is a public good. Government coercion is a political evil. And the two things cannot go together.
<p>
The other, related reason is that many environmentalists today have forgotten Theodore Roosevelt's reminder that "conservation means development as much as it does protection."  With Teddy Roosevelt, I reject the notion that economic development and environmental stewardship are natural, predestined enemies. In fact, from modern history I draw exactly the opposite lesson.
<p>
Think back for a moment to our first post-Cold War glimpse of the dead lakes and dying forests of the old communist world. This was stewardship, socialist style. And yet even today, it's hard to shake the suspicion that for some environmentalists, the cause is just a pretext for airing their larger grievances against the free market. The extreme wing of the environmental movement has been well described as America's last enclave of socialism. For them, every new industry seems to pose a menacing ecological threat.
<p>
It is the free market that is moving us away from the old smokestack industries and into the age of the computer, which does not pollute and is now our prime aid in understanding and safeguarding the environment. In fact, to free enterprise we owe all the technologies that today make for a more efficient use of natural resources. Think of just about anything in modern life which affords ordinary people comfort, health, peace, and security -- and you'll find a product of free enterprise. What's more, in free market economies alone do people even have the wealth, education, and luxury to sit back to reflect on our duties to nature. Put another way, how's the environmental movement shaping up in India or Cuba?
<p>
My own belief is that if we can overcome these two problems -- the coercion of government and the snobbery of environmentalists -- Americans can truly come together to meet the challenges of nature. This is just another way of saying that the best environmental policy is democracy.
<p>
Now let me give you some examples of the kind of problems we've run into in Arizona. We had one particularly interesting incident just last week.
<p>
Back in the fall, an environmental activist group went to federal court seeking an order that the Fish and Wildlife Service come up with critical habitat designations for the Mexican spotted owl. The judge was Carl Muecke, a retired Federal District Court judge. He duly issued the order. But there were a couple of problems. First, the plan Fish and Wildlife came up with, about four million acres altogether, included Arizona's Prescott National Forest -- where, literally, no owl had ever been spotted. And second, between court order and deadline, Congress passed a moratorium on new federal regulations. Faced with this, the good judge replied in essence:  "Do it anyway!"
<p>
So last week, against the will of Congress, the plan went into effect. Result:  All the state's own forest health initiatives must be put off. We have gridlock in our national forests. In the end we will destroy these habitats. And Mexican spotted owls now have a new vacation spot -- only they don't read court orders, and so they still don't come anywhere near Prescott National Forest. Congressional will was simply disregarded by one arrogant federal judge goaded on by a litigious band of environmental zealots.
<p>
Someone has observed that deep down in every liberal is a commissar yearning to be saluted. On our federal benches are the finest examples of the trait. And with the electoral tide turning against liberals, the situation may get a lot worse before it gets better.
<p>
Here's another example. I have been urging Congress, and will again at every opportunity, to repeal the Endangered Species Act. Why?  Because it is a complete disaster -- to the states, the people, and even the species it was meant to help. Because it has thrown entire regions of the Western United States into profound uncertainty. Because, however noble its original aim, in practice the law has become a tool for radical environmental groups to shut down entire industries. Even more bewildering, it prevents the wise management by the states of forest lands, which has led to pestilence and fire.
<p>
The EPA has long been pushing Arizona to adopt what's known as the California standard of air quality. We've been pushing back, so the case is still in litigation.
<p>
In all its philosophical complexity, our basic argument is this:  Arizona is not California. For example, we have a lot more desert land than they do. The desert raises up a lot of dust and various pollen from its unique vegetation. As a matter of fact, we have found that if the California standard were forced upon Arizona, we could not meet it even square in the middle of Organ Pipe National Monument, which is square in the middle of nowhere. 
<p>
 We've also pointed out to the EPA that air quality is an inconstant thing. When there's construction underway in a given area, obviously that's going to affect the air quality -- but only temporarily. So, for example, the EPA will take its measure in Chandler, where we currently have thousands of new homes under construction and the largest industrial project on Earth.
<p>
I could tell you many more such stories -- I have a collection of them I'll match with any governor in the Union. Solomon Bridge near Safford, Arizona, was washed out, requiring people to drive their kids to school on dangerous roads. The Fish and Wildlife Service said that they couldn't fix the bridge because of an endangered minnow that lived in the river beneath the bridge. We told the people of Safford to go ahead and fix it anyway. They went into the river and fixed the problem, and nobody has heard a peep from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
<p>
But let me end by trying to sort out the lessons I draw from these experiences. Given the audacity of environmentalists, and their cavalier approach to democratic procedures, how can we restore self-government to environmental decisions?
<p>
I believe we need a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on federal judges:  Ten years, and it's time for a good long hike into the real world. They need to go back and live in the world they helped create. This would put an end to the scandalous abuses of our courts by environmental groups, among many other liberal activist groups that can advance their aims only by judicial dictate.
<p>
That's reform number one. If any of you doubts this can be done, I would remind you that there is a political revolution going on. Even if you don't hear it talked about in the U.S. Senate, people are fed up. We are going to return power to the states. States are getting ready to receive this power. And we didn't get this far by thinking small.
<p>
My second proposal is purely organizational. We talk loosely of "federal environmental policy."  But, really, there is no single coherent policy to speak of. What we actually have is a confusion of federal voices, each barking a different set of orders at each state and often competing for bureaucratic turf against one another. In land management the problem is particularly costly and inefficient.
<p>
We have recently read threats of closing national parks and the reinvention of the Forest Service. Unfortunately, in both instances the President has offered sophomoric solutions to significant management problems. The White House and their agencies need to get out of the box and look at efficient reorganization. They must accept the challenge of smaller budgets as an opportunity to make public lands more beneficial to all Americans. Tomorrow I will offer Congress a deal:  You give our State Parks Department management authority over three of your federal monuments and 90 percent of current funding, and we will run them more efficiently and, more than likely, make a profit.
<p>
The situation today is intolerable. There is too much overlap, too much rivalry, too much confusion -- and too little actual service to the public.
<p>
I have a third proposal:  The President should also streamline the Environmental Protection Agency. There are approximately 8,000 EPA employees in the regional offices. It is unclear what these employees do that is not already done by the states. There is nothing that is done in the regional offices that cannot be done in the state environmental agencies.
<p>
I recognize and agree that there needs to be a functional liaison between the states and EPA, but I also believe the present EPA organization is an overly expensive and an increasingly ineffective way to interact with the states. I propose we eliminate the regional offices and establish state offices that are co-located with the primary state agency responsible for the implementation of the nation's environmental laws. Each state office would have 25 to 50 federal employees to work with the state to implement federal laws.
<p>
This partnership would allow for programs to be developed once in partnership rather than developed by each state, only to be second-guessed by the regional offices. This arrangement would also allow the federal employees to better understand state issues because they would be directly involved from the beginning. Even if each office had 50 employees, this would only be 2,500 nationwide -- a reduction of over 68 percent from current staffing.
<p>
Next, there is the problem of unfunded mandates. Congress, of course, has done something about this. But, frankly, the central problem remains. It seems almost too obvious to point out, but the staggering thing about these mandates is the undemocratic capriciousness of it all. Hardly anyone even dares question the practice. Seldom are we even dealing with specific provisions in the laws Congress has passed.
<p>
Over the years, Congress fell into the habit of enacting grand new laws as confusing in effect as they are high-sounding in name:  the Clean Air Act, the Critical Endangered Species Act, whatever. And then, well, they just left it for the bureaucrats to sort out the details. Not surprisingly, the details invariably turn out to confer greater and greater powers upon the interpreters. Challenged by citizens thrown out of work by their regulations, or in danger of losing their property or seeing its value plummet, these various agencies then seek out like-minded jurists like Judge Muecke. And so, using yet more public money to litigate, they almost always get their way. It is truly an insidious practice. The freedom revolution will not be complete until we put a stop to it once and for all.
<p>
In the long term, we need to scrap the whole irrational regulatory structure that has been dragging our economy down, costing us tens of billions of dollars, and ensnaring countless productive citizens trying to make a decent life for themselves.
<p>
There are tens of thousands of people in Washington whose sole mission in life is to think up and enforce environmental regulations. Between these rule-makers and the ruled, there is a chasm wider than any in the natural world. The folks making policy are too far removed from the folks living under it. If we are serious about reform, we will retain only a very few of these rule-makers, placing statutory limitations on the number of people each agency may employ. What will become of all the others?  Phase them out, buy them out, do whatever it takes. But it is time for them to pack up their knapsacks. Somewhere down the trail lies an honest living.
<p>
That's the long term. In the short term, we should apply a sunset law to all existing federal mandates. After a given period -- say, five years -- all regulations that are not demonstrably protecting the health and safety of the American people should be scrapped.
<p>
And one final reform. In some quarters environmentalism is not merely a cause anymore, but something more resembling a cult. One reason for this is that, at present, some 30 states have laws mandating "environmentally conscious" public school curricula. Arizona had one such law passed in 1990. It required, among other things, that our children be instructed in "environmentally correct behaviors" and in various methods of political activism.
<p>
We changed that law last year, preferring instead educationally conscious public schools, free of political indoctrination. I would urge other states to take a good look at these curricula, which amount to nothing more than another left-wing power play aimed at our children. About the last thing our children need right now are more lessons in airy liberal pieties, ideological half-truths, and cheap sentimentality masquerading as hard science.
<p>
We are critical of the environmental movement of today. But at the same time, there is much good within it. It comes from a very noble impulse. Within it are many sincere and idealistic people. We need such people.
<p>
But at least in its political ranks, I often sense that something is missing from the cause. There is something fearful, grudging, resentful, and deeply pessimistic about environmentalism as we hear it advanced. They forget about human ingenuity, the ability of free people to rise to the problem, to produce more, to be good stewards of the Earth. They forget human nature, which is never quite as blind and grasping and brutal as our more fretful environmentalists seem to assume.
<p>
I guess I prefer the term "stewardship" because it captures both the responsibilities and the opportunities we meet every time we step into nature's province. It captures both sides of human nature -- that side which bows before nature and that side which rises to master it, rises to build homes and cities and lay up stores while still leaving those spaces of quiet in between. I like it, too, because it conveys a little bit more humility than we observe among today's environmentalists. This is the sense of the old saying that God creates and people merely rearrange; that "Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed."
<p>
My friends, these are revolutionary times. On this issue, as elsewhere, the moment has arrived. In place of fear and fretting and false alarms, we must offer a vision of true stewardship -- reclaiming our nation in every sense. It is not a time to be timid. The moment has come to reclaim, all at once, the rich endowment entrusted to America by nature and the freedom entrusted to us by the Founding Fathers.

<P>

      A few days past, my wife fell into casual conversation with
three medical men.  All three of the doctors were dismayed at the
present situation and future prospects of the American people, and,
unsolicited, expressed at some length their vaticinations.  A surgeon,
after remarking that on the imminent breadlines people would be armed
and fighting, claiming rights but denying duties, then groaned.  "It's
all over!  I thought we had more time!  We lasted only two hundred
years!"
<P>
      This mood of despondency is widespread today.  "Shine, perishing
Republic!"  in the line of Robinson Jeffers.  The parallel with Roman
decay is sufficiently obvious.  As the American economy staggers under
a burden of taxation that soon, we are promised -- under Clinton
Caesar -- will be increased, the federal government sends the Marines
to Somalia to take two million Somalis under our spread-eagle wings. 
It was thus the Romans occupied Greece, for the sake of the wayward
Greeks -- and never left Greece until the Greek cities were ruined in
the collapse of the whole Empire.  Whom the gods wish to destroy, they
first make mad.
<P>
      Yesteryear's great expectations are blasted.  For the first
time, a great many Americans suspect that America's culture is
decadent.  Some of them seem well content with the sickness of our old
culture.  "What do you mean by 'culture?'  the Governor of New York
exclaimed four months ago.  "That's a word they used in Nazi Germany." 
This uncultured and unscrupulous demagogue is mentioned by President-
elect Clinton as a praiseworthy future associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.  When such persons are elevated to
great power in the Republic, indeed there exists reason to raise the
question of social decadence.
<P>
      Defining Culture.  There has appeared a spate of books about the
present "Culture War."  And much obloquy is cast upon the so-called
"cultural elite" of the United States.  Succinctly, how may we define
this "culture" that has grown controversial?  In my newest book,
America's British Culture, published this week by the sociological
firm of Transaction, I examine at length such definitions; but for the
present, let us take a definition by Christopher Dawson, the great
historian of culture, whose works, in twenty-two volumes, I have begun
to edit in a uniform edition, at the request of the Homeland
Foundation.  Here, extracted from Dawson's first book, The Age of the
Gods (1928), is that definition:
<P>
 <UL> A culture is a common way of life -- a particular
      adjustment of man to his natural surroundings and his
      economic needs....  And just as every natural region tends
      to possess its characteristic forms of animal and vegetable
      life, so too will it possess its own type of human
      society....   The higher culture will express itself
      through its material circumstance, as masterfully and
      triumphantly as the artist through the medium of his
      material.</UL>
<P>
      Just so.  Our American culture, derived in large part from
centuries of British culture, has grown in this continent to a
tremendous civilization; President Bush takes pride in the fact that
America is now the only superpower.  Pride goeth before a fall.  That
is why I am conversing with you on the subject of whether this
civilization of ours may endure during the twenty-first century of the
Christian era.  What, if anything, may you and I do to renew this
shaken culture of ours?
<P>
      In my preceding three lectures, I dealt with three menaces to
the survival of our civilization:  first, the fraud called
multiculturalism, which is a device to pull down the inherited culture
of these United States; second, the endeavor of militant secular
humanists to undermine the religious heritage of the American people;
third, the ideology called democratism, the heresy of democracy, which
proclaims that one man is as good as another (or perhaps a little
better), and that the voice of the abstract People is the voice of
God.  Of course these movements or attitudes are not the only reasons
why our civilization appears to be in the sere and yellow leaf, but
they are of fairly recent origin and constitute a clear and present
danger.  How may you and I contend with a tolerable hope against these
forces, thus shoring up the footing of the edifice of the American
common way of life?
<P>
      Well, before we endeavor to prescribe remedies, we need to
ascertain the causes of our difficulties.  We must remind ourselves,
to begin, that culture arises from the cult:  out of the religious
bond and the sense of the sacred grow any civilization's agriculture,
its common defense, its orderly towns, its ingenious architecture, its
literature, its music, its visual arts, its law, its political
structure, its educational apparatus, and its mores.  Christopher
Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and other historians of this century have made
this historical truth clear.
<P>
      Decay of the Cult.  Modern society's gravest afflictions,
conversely, are caused by the decay of the cult upon which a society
has been founded, or by the sharp separation of the trappings of a
sophisticated civilization from the nurturing cult, with its glimpse
of the transcendent.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Templeton Address
at London, put this plainly enough:
<P>
 <UL> Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success
      but in the quest of worthy spiritual growth.
<P>
      Our entire earthly existence is but a transition stage in
      the movement toward something higher, and we must not
      stumble or fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung
      of the ladder....   The laws of physics and physiology will
      never reveal the indisputable manner in which The Creator
      constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of
      each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of
      existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die.  In the
      life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit moves with no
      less force; this we must grasp in our dark and terrible
      hour.</UL>
<P>
      Thus it should be understood that the ideology of secular
humanism, the ideology of democratism, and the ideology of negritude
that lies behind professed "multiculturalism," all are assaults upon a
common way of life that has developed out of Christian insights -- or,
if you will, Judeo-Christian insights -- into the human condition. 
Ideology always is the enemy of religion, and endeavors to supplant
its adversary among humankind.  But ideology has been unable to
produce a counter-culture that endures long -- witness the collapse of
the Soviet Union after seven decades of power.
<P>
      The relationship between religious faith and a high culture,
described here by Solzhenitsyn, has been denied or ignored by the
intellectuals, although not forgotten by the humble.  At the beginning
of his Templeton Address, Solzhenitsyn made that point.  "Over half a
century ago, while I was still a child," Solzhenitsyn said, "I recall
hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for
the great disasters that had befallen Russia. ' Men have forgotten
God; that's why all this has happened.'"  They were right, and so are
their counterparts in the United States today.
<P>
      About eight years ago, the Brookings Institution published a
careful study by James Reichley, entitled Religion in American Public
Life.  In a chapter entitled "Religion, Politics, and Human Values,"
Mr.  Reichley examined eight value-systems, and found only one of
those sufficient to balance individual rights against social
authority, so bringing about harmony in a culture.  That one value-
system he called "theist-humanism":  most people recognize it as
Christianity, in Reichley's description.  It is only a renewed sense
of the sacred, I am suggesting -- by a return to Christian
understanding of the human condition and its limitations, I am
suggesting, that the American nation may withstand the designs of
ideology and restore those common ways of life that we call America's
culture.
<P>
                         

      The governor of Mississippi has been reproached for declaring
that America is a Christian nation.  Despite objections, he was quite
right; his opponents seem not to understand the meaning of the word
"nation," except as it is incorrectly employed by the daily
journalist.  True, the United States of America is not a Christian
state, for the country's Constitution forbids the establishment of a
national church by Congress, and stands tolerant of all religions. 
But the words state and nation signify different concepts.  "State"
means the governmental organization of a country, political society
with sovereign power; while "nation" means the people of the land,
with their culture -- and not merely the people who are living just
now, but also their ancestors and those who will descend from them: 
that is, a nation is extended in time and shares a culture:  those
participants in a common culture who are living today, and the
participants in that culture who have preceded them in time, and those
participants in the common culture who are yet to be born.  One might
call a nation a community of souls.
<P>
      In that proper understanding of what a nation amounts to, the
American nation is Christian, although more Christian formerly,
perhaps, than it is just now.  For Christianity, if sometimes in a
diluted form, is the religion of the majority of Americans nowadays;
and beyond church communicants, there are millions of Americans who do
not attend churches, but nevertheless are strongly influenced by
Christian morals; moreover nearly else who has lived long in the
United States, though he be Jew or Moslem or agnostic, conforms in
large degree to American folkways and customs and conventions that are
Christian in origin:  in short, the American culture, with its
Christian roots, is everywhere dominant in these United States, among
the larger "minorities" of the population as well as among Americans
of European descent; that is, the Christian ethos is no less strong
among blacks and persons of Latin-American descent than among
Americans who can trace their descent in this country back to the
seventeenth century.
<P>
      So the Governor of Mississippi is quite right:  America is a
Christian nation; this is a matter of fact, not of opinion.  Whether
America will remain a Christian nation is matter for argument,
perhaps:  the creation of special rights for pathics, for instance,
indicates that Christian morals are going by the board; and the
prevalence of abortion, the deliberate destruction of one's offspring,
is another suggestion that both Christian belief and Christian morals
have begun to succumb to total religious indifference, if not yet to
atheism.  But if Christian faith and morals will be generally rejected
by the coming of the twenty-first century, then probably the whole
culture will disintegrate, the material culture as well as the
intellectual and moral culture; and human existence here will become
poor, nasty, brutish, and short:  unless some quite new culture, which
as yet nobody can imagine, should rise up.  Any such unnameable
innovative culture, to endure, would require some transcendent
sanction, perhaps some theophanic event -- something more enduring
than mere Marxist ideology, which was a violent attempt at a new faith
and a new culture.
<P>
      Why have an increasing number of Americans endeavored to break
with our inherited culture and its religious roots?  The reasons are
diverse; but the fundamental impulse to reject a religious patrimony
is expressed by T.  S.  Eliot in his choruses for "The Rock,"
especially in the following lines:
<P>
 <UL> Why should men love the Church?  Why should they love her laws?<BR>
      She tells them of Life and Death, and of all that they would
         forget.<BR>
      She is tender where they would be hard, and hard where they like
         to be soft.<BR>
      She tells them of Evil and Sin, and other unpleasant facts.<BR>
      They constantly try to escape<BR>
      From the darkness outside and within<BR>
      By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be
         good.</UL>
<P>
      Religion restrains the passions and the appetites:  and sensate
natures flout restraints.  The more perverse the pleasure, the more it
is sought by some.  So it is that public funds have been employed
recently to subsidize obscene representations of Jesus of Nazareth;
this seems to some titillatingly smart.  I find it odd that, so far as
I know, nobody has compared these "works of art" to the obscene
representations of Jews in which Joseph Goebbels and his colleagues
rejoiced during the regime of Hitler. 
<P>
      Religious Renewal. I have been suggesting, ladies and gentlemen,
that for our culture -- our inherited ways of life that have nurtured
our American society in the past -- to be reinvigorated, a renewal of
religious faith is required.  So long as many of us deny the dignity
of man and indulge what T.  S.  Eliot called "the diabolic
imagination," our culture limps downward.  Our public schools, almost
totally secularized, starve the religious imagination; federal and
state courts often tend to frown upon Christian morals and churches'
claims to independence.  Will a time arrive when religion is indulged
by public authorities only on sufferance?
<P>
      What can be done to restore the religious imagination within our
common culture?  One cannot look to many seminaries for such a
vigorous work of renewal:  most of those institutions are pursuing
theological or quasi-theological novelties, and are caught up in the
humanitarian spirit of the age.  No one can sincerely embrace a
religious creed merely because it might be socially beneficial to do
so.  Conceivably some great preacher or great novelist or great poet
may move minds and hearts toward the transcendent again, opening eyes
that had been sealed; there come to mind the examples of John Wesley
in eighteenth-century England, Chateaubriand in France at the end of
the French Revolution, T.  S.  Eliot in this century.  Or possibly men
of the natural sciences may come to perceive design in the universe,
purpose in mutations.  Or, as in ages past, we may be given a Sign.
<P>
      Some people, after the fashion of T.  S.  Eliot, may turn toward
Christianity once they have discovered how unendurable a place the
twentieth-century world would become were that faith altogether
lacking.  Others, myself among them, may come from much reading and
meditation to conclude that Augustine of Hippo and Sir Thomas Browne
and Samuel Johnson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman,
professed Christians and apologists too, were no fools.  Whether
enough such persons may take up the cause of Christian teaching to
alter the spirit of the age -- why, who can tell?  C.S.  Lewis and
Malcolm Muggeridge succeeded in moving intellects and consciences, and
a half-dozen American writers continue to do so among us today.  By
the way, I particularly commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, a new
book by William Kirk Kilpatrick, Why Johnny Can't Tell Right from
Wrong:  Moral Illiteracy and the Case for Character Education.  Say
not the struggle naught availeth:  this earnest book very effectively
exposes the mischief being done by those educators who in Britain are
called "the crazies."  At one American gathering of that educationist
clan, hard haters of old moral principles, all the major religions of
the world were dismissed as "male chauvinist murder cults."

<P>

      Short of a mighty reinvigoration of the religious imagination,
what may you and I do to redeem the time?
<P>
      Confining ourselves to the three causes of cultural decadence
that I discussed in my three previous lectures, I declare that we can
do much, in a practical way.
<P>
      With respect to multiculturalism, it is entirely possible to
resist this silly, malign movement, despite its temporary successes,
and to begin to restore a decent curriculum to schools, colleges, and
universities; if we succeed, nine-tenths of the students will bless
us.  At the University of Texas, recently, the multicultural program
was opposed by a majority of the faculty in a secret ballot; and the
university's president resigned in consequence, praise be.  A little
more courage on the part of college administrators and professors
would undo this anti-cultural tyranny.  And yet the advantages still
lies with the aggressors.  At one Michigan college, this year, black
militant students engaged in wild demonstrations.  Far from
disciplining the student offenders, the woman president of the college
ordered two or three members of the faculty to undergo sensitivity
training, so that they would learn to be sufficiently servile to
militant students.  A mad world, my masters!  Let us prod some
university presidents and trustees into defense of true academic
freedom.
<P>
      With respect to the assaults upon religious belief, which has
been the source of all high culture over the ages, it is high time for
us to oppose most strenuously those governmental policies which
discriminate against religion and received morality.  In New York
City, very recently, Dr.  Russell Hittinger, a redoubtable learned
champion of the doctrines of natural law, issued from the platform a
virtual call to arms against the enemies of moral order -- some of
them entrenched behind the federal bench.  Let us remember that not
even the Supreme Court of the United States is endowed with arbitrary
and absolute power:  Congress, if it so chooses may remove from the
Court's appellate jurisdiction certain categories of cases, and in
other ways may remind the judiciary that it is not a constitutional
archonocracy.  But I leave to your ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen,
the devising of ways to resist and even to intimidate those zealots
for the abolition of all restraint upon sensual impulse.
<P>
      In connection with this possible restoration of the religious
imagination, it is of the first importance to bring about more choice
in education at every level -- so that those parents and others who
would have their children obtain religious knowledge may be enabled to
do so.  The national administration of President Bush gave at least
lip-service to this cause:  and more than ever before, there exists a
possibility of persuading state legislators to pass such measures. 
<P>
      Third, I urge you friends, to resist manfully and womanfully the
thoughtless centralization of political and economic power.  Not
content with having reduced the several American states, nominally
sovereign, to impotent provinces, America's centralizers, with their
dream of a New World Order, have commenced to acquire provinces
overseas -- Somalia the first in this decade, perhaps.  "Take up the
white man's burden," certain liberal voices exhort us.  One can
imagine the nightmare of a universal domination of egalitarian
"democratic capitalism" directed by the Washington bureaucracy --
unimaginative, arrogant, everywhere resented in the twenty-first
century -- draining America's resources and energies as Rome was
drained by her empire.  The more centralization, the less freedom and
the less energy.
<P>
      Is this the manifest destiny of the United States to become the
New Rome?  Have you and I no choice about that?  Nay, not so.  In
1795, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke, in his first Letter
on a Regicide Peace, denied that great states have to obey some
irresistible law of progress or decay; Burke set his face against the
attitude now called "determinism."  Permit me to quote a key passage:
<P>
 <UL> It is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to
      find any proportion between the apparent causes we may
      assign, and their known operation.  We are therefore
      obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance; or,
      more piously (perhaps more rationally), to the occasional
      interposition and the irresistible hand of the Great
      Disposer.  We have seen states of considerable duration,
      for which ages have remained nearly as they have begun, and
      could hardly be said to ebb or flow.  The meridian of some
      has been most splendid.  Others, and they the greatest
      number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different
      periods of their existence a great variety of fortune.  At
      the very moment when some of them seem plunged in
      unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster, they have
      begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning, and even in
      the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of
      their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and
      durable greatness.  All this happened without any apparent
      previous change in the general circumstances which had
      brought on their distress.  The death of a man at a
      critical juncture, his retreat, have brought innumerable
      calamities on a whole nation.  A common soldier, a child, a
      girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of
      fortune, and almost of Nature.</UL>
<P>
      In those two sentences, Burke may refer to the reverses of
Pericles, to the death of the Constable of Bourbon and other startling
historical instances of a country's fate hanging upon a single life. 
His common soldier is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the
Austrian lances at Sempach; his child is Hannibal, taking at the age
of twelve his oath to make undying war upon Rome; his girl at the inn
is Joan of Arc.  Providence, chance, or strong wills, Burke declares,
abruptly may alter the whole apparent direction of "that armed ghost,
the meaning of history" (Gabriel Marcel's phrase).
<P>
      Even such as you and I, my friends, if we are resolute enough
and sufficiently imaginative, may alter the present course of events. 
God, we have been told, helps those who help themselves.  In the face
of increasing tribulations, sometimes conservatives and liberals are
making common cause in the defense of America's culture.  Both Arthur
M.  Schlesinger, Jr., and your servant have written books in
repudiation of multiculturalism.  Once more, say not the struggle
naught availeth.  A great number of the American people already have
taken alarm at the drift of policy and morality in this land. 
Reactions may be salutary:  as the poet Roy Campbell used to say, a
human body that cannot react is a corpse; and so it is with society. 
Up the reactionaries against decadence!
<P>
      Permit me, in conclusion, to quote a heartening passage from a
book, Our Present Discontents, published in 1919, a year in some
respects like the year 1992.  The author was William Ralph Inge, then
Dean of St.  Paul's in London, commonly described by journalists as
"the Gloomy Dean."  The passage I offer you, however, is one of hope:
<P>
       <UL> There may be in progress a store of beneficent forces
      which we cannot see, There are ages of sowing and ages of
      reaping; the brilliant epochs may be those in which
      spiritual wealth is squandered; the epochs of apparent
      decline may be those in which the race is recuperating
      after an exhausting effort.  To all appearances, man still
      has a great part of his long lease before him, and there is
      no reason to suppose that the future will be less
      productive of moral and spiritual triumphs than the past. 
      The source of all good is like an inexhaustible river; the
      Creator pours forth new treasures of goodness, truth, and
      beauty for all who will love them and take them, "Nothing
      that truly is can ever perish," as Plotinus says; whatever
      has value in God's sight is for evermore.  Our half-real
      world is the factory of souls in which we are tried as in a
      furnace.  We are not to set our hopes upon it, but learn
      such wisdom as it can teach us while we pass through it.</UL>
<P>
       America has overcome the ideological culture of the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics.  In the decade of this victory, are
Americans to forswear the beneficent culture that they have inherited? 
For a civilization to arise and flower, centuries are required; but
the indifference or the hostility of a single generation may suffice
to work that civilization's ruin.  We must confront the folk whom
Arnold Toynbee called "the internal proletariat" as contrasted with
the "external proletariat" from alien lands.  Otherwise we may end,
all of us, as fellow-proletarians, culturally deprived, in a nation
that will permit no one to rise above mediocrity.

<h3>U.S. Agricultural Policy: An Australian Perspective</h3>
<p>
Delivered June 7, 1995  by The Honorable Bob Collins,<br>
Minister for Primary Industries and Senator for the Northern Territories, Australia.
<p>
Australians who watch policy debates in the United States have been impressed by the contribution The Heritage Foundation has been making, especially since last November's congressional election and the emergence of a Republican-controlled Congress.
<p>
The recent Heritage Foundation study on U.S. agriculture policy and its recommendations for reforms in agriculture policy in the 1995 farm bill is one we applaud -- although, before starting on my main points, I might say that I don't oppose all forms of government support for agriculture. Personally, I support government contributions to agriculture research and development, and in Australia we have developed what I consider is a very effective form of R & D partnership between government and industry. Also, we have developed what I believe is an effective form of adjustment assistance to farmers, which we call our rural adjustment scheme. 
<p>
Our policy, in essence, is not to provide those forms of assistance which directly intervene in the pricing or production processes. 
<p>
Australia is a major agriculture producer and exporter which has a fundamental interest in seeing liberalization in world agriculture. We export around 80 percent of our agriculture produce, and for many commodities the figure is higher. We are the world's largest exporter of wool, meat, and sugar and a leading exporter of wheat, coarse grains, dairy products, rice, fruit and vegetables, and cotton.
<p>
You may not be aware of the large trading surplus the U.S. currently enjoys with Australia. Last year the surplus was over $7 billion -- the largest trading surplus the U.S. had with any country. The trade balance is currently running at 3:1 in your favor. 
<p>
From Australia's perspective, our trade deficit with the U.S. as a proportion of GDP or on a per capita basis is larger than the U.S. deficit with Japan, and we are all aware of the bitterness that imbalance has caused.
<p>
It is little wonder that Australian governments and farmers react with some hostility to U.S. agriculture policies which subsidize U.S. exports into markets which are of significance to Australia or erect barriers to Australian agriculture exports to the U.S. Our agriculture is  almost totally unsubsidized, and, along with New Zealand, we are the only OECD nations which can claim such status. With a vital interest in bringing about uncorrupted world markets in agriculture, Australia for many years has been a strong advocate for global agriculture policy reform. No sector of world commerce or trade suffers more government intervention or trade-distorting measures than agriculture.
<p>
At the beginning of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, Australia convened a group of 14 fair trading nations in agriculture which became known as the Cairns Group. Australia continues to chair the Cairns Group, which has become the third force in world agriculture after the U.S. and Europe. Australia and the Cairns Group welcomed the outcome in agriculture in the Uruguay Round, although we were disappointed that the final outcome was less than initial expectations. 
<p>
The Uruguay Round outcome is regarded only as a first step. Cairns Group ministers recently met in Manila and reaffirmed that the group would be active in seeking further reform in world agriculture trade. In particular, the Group will be vigilant in ensuring that there is no circumvention, either in the spirit or letter, of Uruguay Round commitments. The Group intends to monitor very closely developments in agriculture policy in major countries, including the U.S., the E.U., Japan, and Korea.
<p>
Australia and the Cairns Group believe that the 1995 farm bill is an important test of the agriculture reform process and an opportunity to develop more market-oriented agriculture reforms. We acknowledge that the U.S. farm bill is largely a domestic policy process, but countries such as Australia have a legitimate role in the debate as U.S. agriculture policies have a significant impact on world agriculture markets. 
<p>
We have been seeking to play an active and constructive role in the debate. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has published a number of studies highlighting the impact of U.S. policies on world agriculture markets and the positive   benefits that would accrue from market-oriented reforms. In fact, ABARE have just released a research monograph on U.S. agricultural policies. We intend to make the report widely available here in Washington to assist those involved in developing proposals for the farm bill.
<p>
In short, we would like to see the 1995 farm bill move in the direction of fundamental market reform and many of the more market-distorting individual commodity programs eliminated. Certainly, the 1995 farm bill should be consistent with the letter and spirit of U.S. commitments in the Uruguay Round, but I also believe that some of the lessons we have learned at home could well be applied in the 1995 farm bill. When we came to office, we were faced with the need to cut our budget deficit; this year we brought our budget back into surplus. We believe strongly that, in our own interests, we should move the whole economy towards a greater market orientation. We therefore decided to pursue a farm policy which would require our farmers to confront the realities of the world market.
<p>
Not surprisingly, many of our farmers were very fearful of this approach, especially those industries which received subsidies, such as our dairy industry, which I'll use as an illustration of the practical effects of our policies. Ten years ago, our dairy industry was on the verge of collapse, and it was widely believed that Australia would have to rely on New Zealand for supply of dairy products. Since we began the reform process, the industry as a whole has blossomed, increasing its production and profitability and doubling its exports over the last ten years. 
<p>
Our farmers are rising to the challenge of a competitive world market. They, like you in America, view the booming Asian markets as a very strong source of growth. Adjustment has taken place, and the number of dairy farmers has fallen by 30 percent. However, over the past ten years, the production of milk in Australia has increased by one third, and the volume of exports has more than doubled. Industry profits and land prices have improved considerably, and the 70 percent of farmers remaining are now contemplating a sustainable future -- provided a fair trading environment exists.
<p>
The dairy support system in the United States is a good example of why Australia has a  legitimate interest in the farm bill debate. It is a complex web of artificial mechanisms designed to support domestic prices for dairy products and is administered by thousands of bureaucrats who balance the effect of those programs. On the export side, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is used as a tool to draw surplus product away from the U.S.    domestic market to maintain consumer transfers to dairy farmers, estimated by ABARE at $9 billion each year (resulting in almost all dairy exports being effectively subsidized).     Expansion of the DEIP into Asia will depress prices for everyone and would have the effect of Australian dairy farmers paying for those subsidies as well.
<P>
I could give other examples from our rural sector. Since reforms were introduced, the     rural sector's volume of output has grown significantly despite a reduction in farm numbers consistent with international trends. Land values, while fluctuating, have not declined in real terms. There is no comprehensive safety net for Australian farmers. The application of sound policy principles to agriculture has benefited not only the economy generally, but   agriculture itself. 
<P>
Our efforts to create an internationally competitive agriculture sector are hampered,    however, by the continued presence of export subsidization by the U.S. and the European Union. 
<P>
While in Washington this week, I met personally with E.U. Commissioner Fischler and expressed our continuing strong concerns with E.U. subsidies. I am conscious of the concerns in the U.S. about Canadian grain subsidies, but I believe your problems with Canada should be resolved through NAFTA rather than in third markets. While we acknowledge U.S. assurances that their programs are not aimed at Australia, we are concerned by the emerging trend towards the use of subsidies as a market development tool. In particular, forthcoming announcements under the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) for 1995/96 are a matter for serious concern.
<P>
I have been leaving a strong message in Washington that EEP and DEIP not be further extended in Asia/Pacific markets. We have sensitive markets for wheat, wheat flour, barley, rice, and barley malt and dairy products in the Asia/Pacific region. The U.S. is correct in identifying these markets as key targets for growth, but the large future volumes in these markets will obviate the need for subsidized sales.
<P>
The other aspect of the bilateral relationship that still causes us concern is access for our products. Beef access has improved under the Uruguay Round with the disappearance of the meat import law. Access for Australian sugar and dairy products remains restricted, mainly because of the domestic programs for these commodities, which I have mentioned.
<P>
There are many common characteristics between U.S. and Australian farmers. Our     farming, like yours, is built on the family farm; 95 percent of Australian farms are still family-owned. We both have a lot of land under farming. Some 60 percent of Australian land is used for farming; most is range land extensively grazed by sheep and cattle. The U.S. has a smaller percentage of land under farming, but compared to much of our land, your land is highly productive, enjoying higher crop yields and better pasture.
<P>
Your farmers have an enormous domestic market and an internal transport and distribution system second to none. We have no doubt that, given the underlying strengths, U.S. agriculture would continue to expand without subsidies. Your agriculture would probably be stronger and, as a result, provide stiffer competition for us in world markets. We believe that all farmers would be better off with less government intervention. Foreign consumers, not farm exporters, are the real beneficiaries from export subsidies.
<P>
The fundamental difference I have noted between our two countries is that, in Australia, we have created an environment where our farmers farm for the market and respond to  market signals. American farmers seem to spend a lot of their time farming for government programs, so much so that much of U.S. agriculture loses sight of the product it is supposed to be selling. As a result, the U.S. entrepreneurial spirit is lost.
<P>
The EEP and DEIP were originally designed to counter E.U. subsidies in the particular markets to which they were applied. In Asia, however, the E.U. do not have a significant presence, with only an average 15 percent of the Asian dairy market, for example. Extension of the EEP and DEIP into Asia would be impossible for the U.S. to defend and would put a substantial strain on the excellent relationship which has existed between our two countries.
<P>
For this reason, the major purpose of my visit has been to attempt to ensure that the important decisions that the U.S. is to make on agriculture policy in the coming months do not undermine the good relationship between our two countries. I will be leaving here shortly to put that case to the Secretary, Dan Glickman. I hope, for both our sakes, our message is heeded.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT></B>ust the other day, it seems, the national debate about the U.S. role in the United 
Nations turned for the most part on the issue of money--on U.S. contributions and U.N. 
waste, and how reducing the former might diminish the latter. That issue remains. In 
1994, the U.S. spent no less than $3.5 billion on a largely dysfunctional U.N. system--
with scant returns as measured by U.S. national interests. (See sidebar.)</P>
<P>	But the debate has a scary new dimension. The U.N. is reinventing what used to 
be called "peacekeeping." In the last several years, that do-good concept has been 
stretched to encompass a range of U.N. operations that typically involve the use of force, 
even the waging of war. Moreover, President Clinton's U.N. representatives are willing 
collaborators in developing a one-size-fits-all justification for multilateral interventions 
that bear only the most attenuated relation to U.S. interests--if any at all.</P>
<P>	And that, along with peacekeeping's mounting bills, adds up to serious business 
indeed.</P>
<P>	It is now the business of the 104th Congress. As a component of its Contract with 
America, the House of Representatives already has passed the National Security 
Revitalization Act, which reins in the wild proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping, limits U.S. 
participation in these operations, and imposes some controls on U.S. contributions to the 
U.N. generally. The next orders of business are to fend off efforts in the Senate to weaken 
these provisions--which constitute only a minimal package--and then to be vigilant 
about implementation. The question still to be answered is what the U.N. is worth to us--
whether, that is to say, the U.S. gets back in national priorities anything commensurate 
with its $3.5 billion annual investment.</P>
<P>	Ten years ago, there was a consensus in the United States that radical surgery was 
called for. Numerous studies and investigations, many of them instigated by the U.N. 
itself, had revealed a pattern of waste, mismanagement, and duplication (see sidebar, page 
66). The U.N.'s socioeconomic agenda called for the redistribution of wealth from the 
industrialized democracies to the less-developed countries of the Third World. On the 
political side, national-liberation movements (good) and colonialism (bad) were the 
buzzwords of choice.</P>
<P>	As a result, a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1984 overwhelmingly approved 
the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment to the authorization of the U.S.'s 25 percent share 
of the U.N.'s administrative budget. The terms of the amendment seemed unambiguous: 
Shape up, impose fiscal discipline on yourself, and move toward some form of weighted 
voting on the U.N. budget in the General Assembly, with "bonus" votes for big 
contributors in rough proportion to their contributions, or else suffer an annual 20 percent 
withholding of the U.S. payment.</P>
<P>	Now, let the record show that Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and 
Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) had the right idea then--that the U.N. had to be 
reformed if ever it were to become a useful agent of world order--and it is the right idea 
still. But for the most part, Kassebaum-Solomon failed. Congress is now back at work on 
the problems of a dysfunctional U.N., using the power of the purse as one lever of 
reform. The problems have deepened, however, both in complexity and in their deadly 
import. The U.N. has recently engaged in the promiscuous use of force under the 
authority of resolutions that may violate its own charter, and the Clinton administration 
has been willing, even eager, to plunge into the resulting swamp.</P>

<H3>The Peacekeeping Trap</H3>
<P>	Kassebaum-Solomon <I>redux</I> is embodied in the new House act; and, in the Senate, 
a companion bill covers some of the same ground. Both are reasonable first cuts at 
shaping a long-term policy. U.S. costs and U.N. waste are still at issue. But these bills 
focus on U.N. peacekeeping--which is itself a misnomer, and a dangerously misleading 
one.</P>
<P>	The U.N. peacekeeping budget and its expansive peacekeeping agenda are 
escalating out of control. In 1994, the U.S. was assessed almost $1.2 billion for what the 
U.N. calls peacekeeping operations. (The U.S. share is supposed to be fixed at 30.4 
percent, but in fact has crept up to 31.7 percent.) On top of that, the U.S. volunteered in-
kind operational support services--ranging from air- and sealift to armored personnel 
carriers to state-of-the-art communications and intelligence assets--that are valued in the 
House bill's "findings" at $1.7 billion in 1994. (Sources within the national-security 
establishment set their value at close to $2 billion. The administration claims that a major 
part has been reimbursed, but exactly how much is unclear.) These costs were skimmed 
off U.S. defense appropriations that were never intended for peacekeeping or any other 
U.N. program.</P>
<P>	This has contributed to a state of unreadiness in the U.S. military. Appearing 
before a House appropriations subcommittee on January 25th, General John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Defense Secretary William 
Perry conceded as much. They attributed about half of a $2.6 billion defense 
supplemental request to "unanticipated" U.N. peacekeeping costs: $600 million for Haiti 
alone, another $312 million for Bosnia, and lesser amounts for other operations.</P>
<P>	As recently as 1990 or 1991, U.N. peacekeeping was pretty much just that: the 
assignment of ad hoc U.N. forces to monitor truces, police cease-fires, and provide 
buffers between contending parties. These forces prided themselves on scrupulous 
neutrality, and were deployed with the agreement of the parties. The models were 
Kashmir, Cyprus, Lebanon, or the Sinai (where it all began in the 1950s). These were the 
renowned Blue Helmets, drawn from the armed forces of smaller countries (such as Fiji, 
Ghana, Ireland, and Norway); they collectively and deservedly received two Nobel Peace 
prizes. The U.N. peacekeeping budget was appropriately modest and generally 
predictable from year to year. A decade ago, the entire U.S. contribution to the U.N. for 
all programs was less than the U.S. assessment for peacekeeping alone in 1994 
(excluding the "free" support services).</P>
<P>	But now U.N. peacekeeping means almost anything--feeding the hungry, 
responding to "911 calls" (Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's favorite 
formulation), holding elections, building national infrastructure--that the U.N. wants it to 
mean. And this is a U.N. that is avidly seeking "new" missions in the post-Cold War 
world.</P>
<P>	In Cambodia, peacekeeping meant preparing for "free and fair" elections in what 
essentially remains a war zone. Yet the Vietnam-controlled regime that lost the elections 
is still effectively in power. Cost: in excess of $2 billion.</P>
<P>	In Somalia, peacekeeping meant pacifying warring tribal factions, then feeding 
the war's innocent victims, then (unsuccessfully) running the principal warlord to ground. 
Now the warring factions are back at it. Cost: $1.5 billion and counting, plus 30 
Americans and scores of other troops dead. In Haiti, peacekeeping meant invading a 
sovereign country (without opposition or casualties, fortunately) to restore a deposed 
president. With operational control now passing from the U.S. to the U.N., there are 
disquieting signs that violence could resume. Cost: as much as $1 billion so far, and no 
telling how much more for how much longer (one estimate is about $180 million for the 
next six months).</P>
<P>	In Bosnia and Croatia, peacekeeping has become surreal. A force of almost 
25,000 keeps open supply lines to civilian populations--whenever the Serbs choose to let 
the convoys through. The U.N. command has demarcated various "safe havens," which 
the attacking Serbs have violated with impunity. Retaliatory NATO airstrikes, which 
require U.N. concurrence, have been too little, too late. This U.N. peacekeeping force 
cost more than $1 billion in 1994. A "peace-enforcement" operation of open-ended 
duration, with peace nowhere in sight, may require at least 50,000 troops at an annual 
cost of $3 billion. The recently retired U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose of the United Kingdom, may have said more than he intended in a BBC 
documentary: "We are not here to protect or defend anything other than ourselves or our 
convoys."</P>
<P>	The point is not that these U.N. operations are all without merit. But all of them 
were set in motion under Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter as responses to "threats 
to peace and international security"--and, except for Bosnia, where even the U.N. claims 
only a "humanitarian" mission, not one of them meets that rigorous standard. They are of 
questionable legitimacy, and the U.S. picks up 31.7 percent of the tab.</P>
<P>	Besides paying the biggest share of the bills, the U.S. has acceded to all of these 
operations as one of the Security Council's permanent five. In Haiti and Somalia, the U.S. 
committed armed forces as well. Right now, anywhere from 50,000 to 70,000 U.S. 
military personnel are assigned to U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Exactly how many is 
in dispute. The House puts the number at 70,000; Perry testified to "just under 50,000" as 
of late January.) Some are serving in war-zones, some are off-shore or in aerial 
surveillance and interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving 
under the authority only of U.N. Security Council resolutions as implemented by the U.S. 
commander-in-chief.</P>

<H3>What Can Be Done?</H3>
<P>	This is the range of problems that Congress now confronts. The bills pending in 
Congress address the issue of U.S. contributions to an open-ended U.N. entitlement 
program in the guise of peacekeeping. But they also raise a genuine constitutional issue: 
the commitment of U.S. armed forces--arguably, the ultimate exercise of public 
authority--without the explicit consent, or even involvement, of Congress.<P>
</P>	The House act passed in February inhibits, but does not prevent, the president 
from engaging U.S. armed forces in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and in particular from 
putting U.S. forces under "foreign" and/or U.N. command. (In the latter case, the U.S. 
officers in direct command of U.S. troops would retain the right to report to and to appeal 
any orders they receive to "superior U.S. military authorities." The president, moreover, 
would have to state in a prior legal memorandum to Congress the grounds for believing 
that such an action is not a violation of the Constitution; the burden of proof is on the 
president.) The president has to give Congress 15 days prior notice of any action 
contemplated or, in an emergency, report within 48 hours afterward. The president has to 
justify the action taken as "necessary to protect national security interests of the United 
States," and project as best he can both the cost and the duration of the operation. These 
requirements should have a chilling effect on the president's propensity to undertake such 
commitments lightly. One can only wonder, had this been the law at the time, how the 
president would have justified our engagements in Somalia or Haiti, and on the grounds 
of what "essential" U.S. national interest.</P>
<P>	There is more. The House act makes it very difficult indeed to fund any expansive 
U.N. peacekeeping operations at all, especially new ones. Effective October 1, 1995, 
there is to be a 25 percent cap on the U.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping--period. 
Moreover, no defense appropriations can be used for any U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping, whether assessed or voluntary: All contributions have to be funded 
explicitly, from earmarked appropriations. Finally, the president is required to present an 
annual accounting of the "fair market" value of all voluntary in-kind contributions 
provided to the U.N. in the prior year and, unless reimbursement is received, offset the 
total "incremental" cost of these contributions against the U.S. assessment for the year 
ahead.</P>
<P>	The loophole opened here, and it's a huge one, is the definition of "incremental." 
Presumably the base pay of U.S. military personnel would be the same whether or not 
they served in a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But what about tanks and jeeps and 
aircraft, or air- and sealift? How in such cases are add-ons computed, as against the 
"base" cost of the U.S. military establishment's sophisticated hardware? And how are 
costs assigned to wear and tear on the U.S. forces as well as to providing necessary 
downtime and retraining? The proof of this effort to restrain peacekeeping costs will 
depend on the rigor with which the test is applied. Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) of 
the House Committee on International Relations estimates that the offset will be in the 
range of $300 million to $400 million, rather than the $1.7 billion for total voluntary 
contributions in 1994.</P>
<P>	In his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, in September 1993, President 
Clinton said that he favored a 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping assessments and that 
the U.N.--and he might have added, the U.S. representatives there--would simply have 
to learn to say "no" to all but the most urgent requests for "peace" operations. The bills 
now in Congress take him at his word.</P>

<H3>How Not to Reform the U.N.</H3>
<P>	It is instructive to recall the lessons of the Kassebaum-Solomon experience. No 
sooner had the amendment taken effect than the ranks of the U.N.'s leadership were filled 
with born-again reformers. The fewer the U.S. dollars, the greater their zeal. The then-
Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, appointed a select experts' committee that 
very nearly--the Soviets said "no" at the last minute--recommended a major U.N. 
restructuring that would have satisfied about 99 percent of the amendment's intent. The 
experts' committee was able to enact the requirement that the administrative budget could 
move from committee to the General Assembly plenary only by consensus. This 
consensus procedure amounted to a U.S. veto on the U.N. budget.</P>
<P>	But a veto is only as good as the will to use it. Budget growth in the following 
two years was held to zero, but not a finger was laid on the waste, duplication, and 
overlap, nor on the obsolete programs that beset the U.N. then, and still do. On the basis 
of that two-year record, the president--Ronald Reagan himself--certified to Congress 
that the "spirit" of Kassebaum-Solomon had been satisfied, and full U.S. funding 
resumed.</P>
<P>	The U.N. paid no price at all for the endemic inefficiencies and uncontrolled 
spending that gave rise to the congressional reforms in the first place. The dollars that 
were withheld are now being paid up. These are the very "arrearages," in fact, that have 
fueled charges that the most generous contributor to the U.N. is the world's number one 
deadbeat.</P>
<P>	There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this experience. First, merely 
focusing on the process by which the administrative budget is adopted is not enough. The 
loophole of "going along" is too big, and offers too easy a way out. Second, the budget 
itself is not quite the issue: the programs funded by the budget, and the priorities among 
them, have to be scrutinized year after year. Finally, for any U.N. reforms to take firm 
hold--which calls for a persistent effort by the U.S., leading a coalition of the like-
minded within the U.N.--the president and Congress have to be reading off the same 
page. Most of the job, in fact, has to be done by presidential appointees and the 
permanent bureaucracy responsible to them. Congress can (and should) establish the 
benchmarks; but, in the absence of determined executive action, nothing much will be 
accomplished.</P>

<H3>Tightening the Screws</H3>
<P>	This time around, Congress is considering sterner measures: a stronger version of 
last year's Pressler amendment. Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) tied full U.S. funding of 
U.N. operations to the president's certification that an independent U.N. Office of 
Inspector General was up and running. This, in turn, was a follow-up to the key 
recommendation of the Thornburgh Report, in 1992-93, that an inspector general with 
clout was essential to jump-start meaningful U.N. reform. The House act requires the 
withholding of 50 percent of the U.S. peacekeeping assessment and all voluntary 
contributions every year, as well as 20 percent of the regular assessment, pending the 
president's annual certification that an independent U.N. inspections office is in operation 
and that the inspector general has been chosen on the basis of professional credentials, 
has subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records, issues annual and unexpurgated 
public reports, and that the inspector general's recommendations are being implemented.</P>
<P>	Congress, for its part, has to be prepared not to take "yes" for an answer. The best 
way for the U.S. to save money is for the U.N. not to waste it--and that means probing 
behind the numbers to the U.N. programs that ought to be trimmed back, or zeroed out, or 
rejected in the first place. Congress must be on the right track, because administration 
witnesses are already warning of the imminent collapse of the West--maybe even of 
U.N. peacekeeping as we now know it--if this total legislative package is enacted. And 
that, of course, is the point.</P>
<P>	I would add two modest proposals to the package. First, the U.N. ought to 
overhaul the present scales of assessments. Congress should require the president to open 
negotiations at once to revise both the administrative and peacekeeping assessment scales 
within one year. Capping the peacekeeping assessment at 25 percent is only a start: all of 
the allocations, which are supposed to correspond to the GNPs of the U.N. members, are 
hopelessly out-of-date. Russia, for example, pegged at 10 percent for the administrative 
budget and 11.5 percent for peacekeeping, pays too much. China, on the other hand, 
which claims a GNP in excess of $2 trillion, pays less than 1 percent on both scales. The 
spread overall is from 25 and 30.4 percent for the U.S. (for the administrative budget and 
peacekeeping, respectively) to one-hundredth of 1 percent for 85 countries--close to a 
majority of the U.N.'s total membership of 185. Saudi Arabia and Brunei are ranked 
equally with Benin and Bangladesh.</P>
<P>	A second proposal refers to the sidebar on "The High Cost of U.N. Membership": 
What in fact do we spend on the U.N., on all of its various parts, including also the value 
of the in-kind voluntary services that the U.S. routinely contributes? No one, as best I've 
been able to determine, keeps an authoritative ledger; someone ought to. Congress should 
require that the president submit an annual, comprehensive U.S./U.N. budget request. 
That way, we might better be able to answer the question with which we began.</P>

<H3>What Is the U.N. Worth to Us?</H3>
<P>	On balance, I believe the answer has to be "not much." Even if the U.N. were to 
be substantially reformed--which in my judgment is very unlikely--the answer would be 
only slightly more upbeat.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is what we made it. There is little evidence that, in the late spring of 
1945, the U.N.'s founders had any inkling of the proliferation of mini-states that would 
result from the breakup of the colonial empires in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
Simply gathering together all the countries in the world into one grand and ill-assorted 
institution did not then, and does not, now constitute a "community" at all, and certainly 
not a community of like-minded liberal democracies with a consensus on how to design 
and maintain the framework of a tolerable world order. Yet that is the fundamental 
premise built into the U.N. Charter--which today is essentially a fraud.</P>
<P>	At least half, and as many as two-thirds, of the U.N.'s 185 members should, on 
the Charter's own principles, either be expelled or suspended. Yet they comprise a 
working majority of the U.N. General Assembly. They adopt the budget, allocate 
resources, and permit a significant part of these resources to be wasted. Much of the 
waste, as noted already, is on redundant socioeconomic programs that they perceive to be 
beneficial to themselves; the rest pays for plum jobs in the Secretariat for their own elites. 
The fact that these programs do more harm than good, by confirming them in their bias 
toward statism, cuts little ice. The U.N. is their organization. Not surprisingly, they use it 
in their own interests.</P>
<P>	Now, it will be objected that all this is beside the point, that the General Assembly 
itself is beside the point: simply a shadow-play, in which the mini-states debate toothless 
(if often mischievous) resolutions that nobody heeds. Subsidizing this exercise is, so the 
argument goes, the price we pay for maintaining a functioning U.N. when we need it.</P>
<P>	"When we need it": This always is the mantra of last resort. It apparently refers to 
those "threats to peace and international security" to which only the U.N. Security 
Council can respond with force or the threat of its use. Thus Warren Christopher argued, 
in vigorously opposing the limits on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping, that their 
effect would be to force the U.S. to "go it alone." It's either the U.N., such as it is, or 
isolation. But "going it alone" looks not so bad, if it means standing aside from, even 
vetoing, ill-defined, open-ended "peace" operations that arguably exceed the U.N.'s 
authority and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence. Secretary 
Christopher may make unapologetic isolationists of us all.</P>
<P>	In some circumstances, our government's own judgment of the national interest 
may coincide with U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating forceful responses to 
"threats to peace." North Korea's invasion of the South was one such circumstance, 
Iraq's aggression against Kuwait another. But in both cases, it was the prior U.S. 
judgment, and its firm commitment to resist aggression, that carried the day in the 
Security Council. The U.S. and its like-minded allies would have taken the actions they 
deemed necessary, with or without the cover of U.N. resolutions. It may well be, in fact, 
that the U.N. served more to inhibit than to unleash the resulting "peace-enforcement" 
operations, and limited their effectiveness as a consequence.</P>
<P>	Looking back over these last 50 years of U.S. national security policies, what is 
most striking is the almost total absence of the U.N. from the historical record. When 
something does matter, whether it is an alliance to deter aggression (NATO) or carrying 
out an effective foreign assistance program (the Marshall Plan) or negotiating the rules of 
free and fair international trade (GATT), the United States invariably has entered into 
multinational engagements with the genuinely like-minded. This should come as no 
surprise. It is the mark of a serious country, seriously pursuing its national interests.</P>
<P>	Most of the U.N.'s success stories have in fact been those of the results-oriented 
specialized agencies--as, for example, the virtual eradication of smallpox (WHO), the 
care and feeding of refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), and the 
green revolution in South Asia (several agencies involved). Many of these agencies 
predate the U.N. itself. And the most successful have been those most careful to insulate 
themselves from the "political" U.N. in New York.</P>
<P>	For now, it is probably enough just to cut back on the U.S. commitment to the 
U.N., to be discriminating in acceding to the use of force in U.N. "peace" operations, and 
to prevent as much costly mischief as possible. The approach being taken by Congress 
seems about right--but no less will do.</P>
<P>	The threat to withhold consensus on the administrative budget, vigorously 
applied, could squeeze a useful amount of fat from the Secretariat. Insisting on an 
independent inspector general is not about to produce a lean and mean U.N. bureaucracy 
overnight, but every little bit helps. In the specialized agencies, picking and choosing 
among programs worth supporting--as we do in UNESCO, even as a non-member--
makes a lot of sense. A runaway Security Council calls for particular vigilance, and an 
ever-ready veto, which the total package of congressional limitations should satisfy--yes, 
Mr. Secretary, even at the risk of "going it alone."</P>
<P>	I fear that putting the U.N. out of its misery altogether would incur unacceptable 
costs. The predictable firestorm among our allies would weaken relationships that are far 
more important to us than the U.N. itself. It may be cowardice, or it may simply reflect 
the enormous effort involved in fundamental U.N. reform for a rather modest payoff. But 
I would settle for putting the U.N. back in its box and keeping our eye on it. A wary eye, 
and a parsimonious one.</P>

<H3>The High Cost of U.N. Membership</H3>

<P>	Somewhere in the United States Budget for Fiscal Year 1996 there is an entry for 
just about everything, from midnight basketball to research on the reproductive cycle of 
fruit flies. But search as you will, nowhere in that huge tome that documents the roles and 
responsibilities of $1.6 trillion's  worth of national government is there a total for 
projected U.S. contributions to the United Nations.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is not exactly a new kid on the block. It will celebrate its 50th birthday 
this June; and after tens of billions of dollars in U.S. contributions over the years, it might 
be supposed that someone would want to assess the value to us of membership in this 
multinational conglomerate. A total annual budget figure would help.</P>
<P>  To get started on such an evaluation, here are the numbers for the 1994 calendar year, as 
best as I have been able to put them together:</P>
<UL><LI>  The U.S. share (25 percent) of the U.N. administrative budget, which funds all 
Secretariat staff and programs: $298 million.
<LI>  The U.S. share (31.7 percent) of the peacekeeping budget: $1.2 billion.
<LI> U.S. contributions to all U.N. specialized agencies (World Health Organization, Food 
and Agriculture Organization, High Commissioner for Refugees, et cetera): $368 million, 
exclusive of capital contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</UL>
   Cumulative total: almost $2 billion.<BR>
<P>   This total does not include the value of goods and services that the U.S. contributes 
voluntarily to the U.N. system as a whole. For U.N. peacekeeping operations alone, 
voluntary contributions in 1994 represented about $1.7 billion in "fair market" value, and 
some sources put the total in excess of $2 billion. (The administration claims some of this 
total has been reimbursed, but does not say how much.) For other programs, a reasonable 
estimate is even more difficult for an outsider, but there is a steady flow of experts from 
the Washington bureaucracy to U.N. headquarters, and similar ties with the specialized 
agencies. Add in these numbers, and the total approaches $4 billion.</P>
<P>	That isn't small change. Now that we know roughly what membership costs us, 
the question we need to answer: What does our investment in the U.N. buy us?</P>


<H3>The U.N.'s Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	In 1992 and 1993, former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh served as 
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management with a specific 
mandate to evaluate the U.N.'s effectiveness. After a year on the job, he prepared a report 
on U.N. mismanagement and waste and tried repeatedly to galvanize the secretary general 
into effective action. In frustration, he went public with his recommendations and 
testified on March 5, 1993 before the House Subcommittee (of International Relations) 
on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. Here are some 
highlights of his report and testimony:</P>

<B>Inspector General.</B> Key recommendation: to uncover "waste, fraud, and abuse" within 
the Secretariat, an independent, professional Inspector General has to be named, with full 
subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records.<BR>
<B>Peacekeeping Field Operations.</B> A McKinsey & Co. management audit uncovered no 
less than $100 million in annual waste owing to duplication and overlap, managerial 
incompetence, and lack of communications within the field structures.<BR>
<B>"Featherbedding."</B> One example: 500 typists employed to transcribe the dictation of 
translators. Use of basic word processors would save about $20 million a year.<BR>
<B>Financial Management.</B> McKinsey & Co. recommended improvements in foreign 
exchange transactions, centralization of cash management, and automated payments. 
Projected annual savings: $12 million to $15 million.<BR>
<B>Career Service.</B> Nearly 90 percent of all staff assessments are positive. As Thornburgh 
notes, not only does incompetence carry no penalty, there is no incentive for meritorious 
service. Top jobs in the U.N. Secretariat are compensated up to 150 percent of 
comparable U.S. supergrades--and it's all tax-free.<BR>
<B>"Consultants."</B> Although it is in violation of the U.N.'s own regulations, top bureaucrats 
are routinely "retired" (with lump-sum separation pay up to $500,000) and then 
immediately rehired as "consultants" at 85 to 100 percent of previous pay.<BR>
<B>Procurement.</B> In 1990-91, of 5,450 contracts let, only 17 percent were put out for 
competitive bidding, contrary to U.N. regulations for all except "emergency" cases.<BR>
<B>Printing.</B> About two-thirds of all printing needs are generated during the annual three-
month General Assembly. Yet the print shop is fully staffed year-round. Contracting out 
during peak times would, according to Thornburgh and a 60 Minutes investigation 
(broadcast September 20, 1993), save "tens of millions" annually.<BR>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B><P>
     Over the last three decades violent crime in America has
increased by more than 500 percent. The United States leads the
industrialized world in rates of murder, rape, and violent crime.
Nearly three out of every four convicted criminals are not
incarcerated. And fewer than one in ten serious crimes results in
imprisonment. Behind these statistics is, of course, human carnage. In
our inner cities in particular, the body count continues to mount.
This is the inevitable, tragic result of a breakdown of the moral
order and of our criminal justice system.
  <P>   The American public will not accept widespread lawlessness
indefinitely. If violent crime continues to rise, then people will at
some point look for a police state to restore order. Our free
democratic institutions cannot withstand much more crime without a
terrible counterreaction. Social anarchy often triggers an
authoritarian backlash.
    <P> We must regain control of our streets. The first responsibility
of government, after all, is the security of its citizens. The
relevant public policy question is: How do we once again provide basic
security? And here a caution is in order: Passage of the current crime
bill is not synonymous with achieving safe streets. Flawed legislation
wrapped in good rhetoric is still flawed legislation. A close analysis
of the crime bill demonstrates where it falls short. (See Paul J.
McNulty, "Rhetoric Versus Reality: A Closer Look at The Congressional
Crime Bill," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 189, May 16,
1994.)
  <P>   Regardless of their rhetoric, Members of Congress are not going
to cure America's epidemic of violent street crime with the enactment
of a federal crime bill. Street crime is largely a matter of state and
local law enforcement; indeed, more than 98 percent of all such
violent crimes falls under the jurisdiction of state and local law
enforcement authorities. But more important, Members of Congress are
using the crime issue as a pretext for doing what they do best:
increasing federal spending on social programs. In this instance, they
are increasing social spending on everything from midnight basketball
leagues to arts and crafts programs. And while legislators are using
ruthless rhetoric against violent criminals, they are seriously
considering the establishment of a racially based, death penalty quota
system ensuring that the imposition of the death sentence is
effectively ended at both the state and the federal level. Indeed, the
measure now before Congress would likely further emasculate the
independence and the authority of state and local law enforcement
officials in fighting violent street crime.
 <P>    Instead of a fundamentally flawed crime bill, which pointlessly
federalizes local street crime, state and local officials should be
empowered and given the resources to combat violent criminals, locking
up felons for their full sentence and ending "revolving door justice."
Instead of establishing a new federal "anti-crime" regime, Congress
should aim at maximizing state and local flexibility, while stopping
the intrusion of the federal judiciary in the administration of state
prison systems. Instead of hamstringing state and local law
enforcement with new federal regulations, Members of Congress should
make changes in federal law to stop the endless appeals of convicted
violent felons and encourage state and local officials to adopt the 24
effective anti-crime measures recommended by former Attorney General
William Barr. (For more information on these recommendations, see Mary
Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a
Safer America," Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 944/S, June
7, 1993.)
  <P>   And finally, Members of Congress can really help in a tangible
way by giving state residents a federal tax rebate proportional to
increased state spending to fight violent street crime at the state
and local level.
<P>
<B> SOME GOOD PROVISIONS </B><P>
     Given Americans' growing fear of violent crime, it is
understandable that Members of Congress would want to support another
federal crime bill, even if it falls far short of effective
legislation. The House and Senate versions of the bill have "truth in
sentencing provisions" which would require violent criminals to serve
at least 85 percent of their time. (James Wootton, "Truth in
Sentencing: Why States Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time,"
Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
If actually funded, these provisions would incapacitate large numbers
of violent criminals. But in the inevitable congressional horsetrading
on Capitol Hill, new social programs are likely to be more politically
potent than new prison space.
   <P>  On key issues, the House and Senate are far apart on the details.
Proposed federal money for state prisons amounts to $13 billion in the
House bill and $3 billion in the Senate version. And there is also
federal money for hiring community police ($9 billion in the Senate
version, and $3.5 billion in the House bill). But even if Members of
Congress agree on the right funding formulas, there is yet no adequate
funding mechanism in the crime package. Currently, Members of Congress
are considering a special trust fund created by the elimination of
252,000 federal jobs over the next five years. This funding provision
appears in the Senate bill; the House bill has no funding mechanism at
all. Thus, Congress can promise funding for anti-crime measures, but
without an explicit and effective funding mechanism, the entire
congressional anti-crime enterprise could become another rhetorical
exercise.
<P>
<B> A BATCH OF BAD IDEAS </B><P>
     While American taxpayers are promised more police on the streets
and more prison space for violent criminals, the major effect of the
federal crime bill is to federalize violent street crime, burdening
state and local authorities with even more federal rules and
regulations while making them increasingly dependent on Washington's
largesse. For example:
<P>
More Social Spending. 
 <P>    In spite of the fact that Washington has racked up a record of
failure in social programs, the House version of the crime bill
contains roughly $9.2 billion in Sixties-style social programs to
"prevent crime." This includes $40 million for business partnerships
administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
midnight basketball with federal rules even detailing the composition
of neighborhood teams, "self-esteem" classes, arts and crafts, dance
classes and physical training programs, and "conflict resolution"
training.
<P>
Outcome-Based Executions. 
  <P>   In the House version of the bill, a provision called the "Racial
Justice Act" would enable a person convicted of a capital crime to
invoke statistical evidence that his execution would reinforce a
pattern of racial discrimination. Moreover, the burden is on the state
to prove it was not discriminating in imposing the death penalty. And
because the provision is retroactive to all those now on death row --
a total of 3,800 -- it could tie up the courts for years. Indeed, a
California case where the convict used such a defense took over three
years -- at a cost of $1 million -- before the state could execute the
sentence. But the worst feature of this provision is the message that
it sends: race, not the crime, would be the most important factor in
the imposition of the death sentence. The result: a death sentence
could be invalidated by irrelevant data.
<P>
More Federal Intrusion Into State Law Enforcement. 
  <P>   Virtually all violent street crime is under the jurisdiction of
state and local government. State legislators, not Members of
Congress, have primary responsibility for combatting violent street
crime. Yet in the Senate version of the bill, more crimes are added to
the federal crime code. For example, trafficking in stolen credit
cards, defrauding a person of more than $1,000 in credit card
stealing, telemarketing fraud, and increased street gang activity are
to be put under federal jurisdiction. In the meantime, the House
version of the bill has added 66 new federal death penalties, coupled,
of course, with the House adoption of the "Racial Justice Act" to make
sure they are never actually carried out. And while Members of the
House of Representatives have been posturing on the death penalty, the
Clinton Administration has been cutting back on federal law
enforcement agent strength, both at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
This is, of course, a recipe for bitter cynicism on the part of
America's taxpayers.
<P>
More Federal Control Over Local Police. 
 <P>    Both the White House and Capitol Hill are committed to increasing
the number of police. While the Clinton Administration has asked for
100,000 more police officers, the House version contains 50,000
additional slots. While no personnel decision is more important than
the hiring of a cop -- a job where individual merit is paramount --
the House bill calls for state and local authorities to adopt racial,
ethnic, and gender guidelines in police hiring. While these are not
explicit quotas, in practice they are likely to become so, especially
given the heavy dependence on centralized federal financing. Over 88
percent of the funding is controlled not by states and localities, but
by the Executive Branch. And because the funding for these police
slots will end in five years, localities will either have to cut their
police force, a politically unattractive option, or lobby Washington
for even more federal funding and concomitant federal control.
<P>
<B> A BETTER IDEA </B>
   <P>  American taxpayers are not going to feel safer because Congress
talks tough on crime, while it increases spending on arts and crafts
for juvenile delinquents. While there are good provisions in the
Senate and House package, the heavy mixture of bad proposals or a
variation of them are certain to survive in the congressional
logrolling that normally characterizes House and Senate conference
business.
<P>    Instead, Members of Congress should do it right. They should
recognize that combatting violent street crime is a state and local
responsibility. They should target their efforts to helping the state
and local police upgrade the detection and apprehension of criminals,
and assist state and local authorities in prosecuting and
incarcerating violent criminals. 
<P>     Toward this end, Members of Congress should: 

Establish a special trust fund for the states to fight crime. 
    <P> Under a proposal by Representative James Sensenbrenner (R-WI),
H.R. 4592, Congress would set aside an amount equal to 2 percent of
the personal income tax revenues, and rebate it to the states to cover
increased state expenditures to combat violent crime. State
expenditures would include spending on police, construction of the
operation of prisons, and other aspects of the state criminal justice
system, including truth in sentencing. The Sensenbrenner proposal
would rebate between $45 billion to $55 billion to the states to fight
crime over the next five years.
<P>
Eliminate federal judicial micromanagement of state prison systems. 
 <P>    Congress can restrain federal judges from arrogating wide-ranging
administrative powers to themselves, overriding state executive and
legislative authorities, and imposing "prison caps" that result in the
early release of criminals.
<P>
Reform key federal rules governing the criminal justice system. 
 <P>   This would include habeas corpus reform, to prevent convicted
felons from tying up the court systems with endless appeals. Such
reform would also include establishing a "good faith" exception to the
exclusionary rule, meaning criminals would not be able to beat the rap
because the police secured otherwise solid evidence in a technically
imperfect search and seizure operation.
<P>
     While Members of Congress could assist state and local
authorities in very tangible ways, there is no reason why the Justice
Department could not publish a "Wall Chart," comparing states and
localities with each other, with a rank ordering of their performance
in combatting violent crime, including arrests, convictions,
imprisonment, and adherence to truth-in-sentencing standards. With a
way to compare performance, taxpayers could bring pressure to bear on
lax state and local officials far more effectively than through the
ministrations of federal officials.
  <P>  In the meantime, Members of Congress should refrain from talking
tough about violent street crime while they promote policies that
would only further erode their already damaged credibility. Instead,
they should salvage the few sound policy options left in the crime
bill, and make a fresh start on a tough problem.
 <P>    Of course, we should not allow the discussion of legislation to
obscure the most obvious points. The best approach to crime control is
to keep young people from ever falling into the criminal justice
system in the first place. We now ask prisons to do what fathers once
did and ask the entire criminal justice system to do what parents,
schools, and neighborhoods once did. More broadly, as a society we
simply need to become more civilized. I say "simply" because there is
a tendency to over-intellectualize our task or to throw up our hands
in despair. Intelligent, tough-minded public policies can help achieve
greater domestic tranquillity. But in the end, regeneration in a free
society must come from within. We need to revivify old republican
virtues like self-control, prudence, honor, and fidelity to
commitments. They have been, and remain, the cornerstones of civil
society.
     <P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT></B>f 1992 was the "Year of the Woman" in American politics, then 1994 was the 
"Year of the Conservative Woman." Nine women incumbents--all liberal Democrats--
lost their House seats in the November elections. Seven conservative Republican women 
were elected to the House freshman class, while moderate Republican Olympia Snowe 
moved from the House to the Senate.</P>
<P>	The new Republican women in the House do not claim sisterhood with the so-
called "women's agenda." Instead, they define the GOP's Contract with America as a 
"women's issue," and their campaigns centered on tax cuts, congressional reform, and 
reducing or eliminating scores of government programs and entire agencies. Sue Myrick, 
a two-term mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, was named to the House Budget 
Committee because of her experience controlling municipal spending. She's also a co-
chairman of the GOP "freshmen task force" to eliminate the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. Since the mid-1960s, she says, HUD and other federal agencies 
have spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty, and poverty won.</P>
<P>	Barbara Cubin of Wyoming and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho intend to protect 
women and men alike by calling for an overhaul of federal regulation. They've been 
active in the effort to defend property owners from intrusive federal regulators, and to 
give states more flexibility in controlling natural-resources development on public lands 
within their borders. Both Chenoweth and Cubin are on the GOP task force to reform the 
Endangered Species Act to protect animals and plants without jeopardizing jobs or 
property rights. Sue Kelly, of New York's Westchester County, is the only pro-choice 
woman in the crowd, and styles herself an economic conservative. She'll be pushing tax 
and regulatory relief for small businesses.</P>
<P>	These women participate in the first Republican-led Congress in 40 years, which 
offers them unprecedented opportunities for influence. Policy Review looks at three of 
the new lawmakers, who should be on anyone's list of members to watch in 1995 and 
beyond:</P>

<P><B>Andrea Seastrand (CA-22)</B></P>
<P>	For many, the death of a spouse means a time for quitting--a time when long-held 
hopes are wrapped up and put into storage. Not for Andrea Seastrand.</P>
<P>	When her husband Eric, a California assemblyman, died in their 26th year of 
marriage, Seastrand ran for his seat and won. They were a team, "movement 
conservatives" devoted to making government work, by fighting bureaucracy and red 
tape. But it was always Eric who worked in the limelight of elected office. She was 
supportive, in the background, stuffing envelopes and going door to door. "I was the one 
writing the letters and getting others to write," she says. "I never saw myself as the one to 
receive the letters."</P>
<P>	She would be receiving a lot of them. Elected in 1990, Andrea served four years 
in the General Assembly. Then, last year, she saw an opportunity to run for the Santa 
Barbara-area congressional seat vacated by Michael Huffington in his bid for the U.S. 
Senate. She ran on the Contract with America and immigration reform, calling for 
speeding up the deportation of illegal aliens convicted of and imprisoned for serious 
crimes. She supported Proposition 187--the state ballot initiative to end state services to 
illegal immigrants--because she thinks legal aliens are most likely to play by the rules 
and build lives for themselves and their families. "I'm a believer in immigration--legal 
immigration," she says. "I want to help people who are here legally to work through the 
red tape to become citizens more quickly."</P>
<P>	Seastrand's political education began at the all-girls Catholic high school she 
attended in Chicago. During a visit to the school, a bishop who had been exiled from 
Lithuania explained what communism meant in his country, and described the deadening 
effect of a totalitarian government on its citizens. The experience made the 15-year-old 
staunchly anti-Communist. The nuns at school gave Seastrand what might be called a 
practical civics lesson: "No matter where you come from, no matter what your 
background, if you use your God-given abilities and talents, and work hard, the sky is the 
limit to what you can achieve." This simple principle has affected her views on 
everything from welfare reform to school choice.</P>
<P>	The former elementary-school teacher learned another lesson from her nuns: The 
importance of living by example, of mentoring young people in basic conservative values 
of family and citizenship. Fulfilling a promise with her husband, Andrea has continued 
"adopting" students, taking them under her wing for national conventions and boosting 
their involvement in civic life. Her students typically serve as interns in her office, 
community volunteers, and political and neighborhood activists. One of the students she 
took to the Republican National Convention in 1984 is now her congressional district-
office director. An immigrant from Mexico who once served as an intern is now a Wall 
Street banker. Another former intern is a lobbyist in California for a transportation trade 
association.</P>
<P>	Shortly after the death of her husband, Andrea established the Eric Seastrand 
Memorial Youth Fund, using her skills at grassroots political organizing for non-political 
community-outreach projects. Her fund has benefitted dozens of students by providing 
scholarships, supporting 4-H programs, buying a wheelchair to enable a child to 
participate in the Special Olympics, and supplying train tickets for grade-school field 
trips.</P>
<P>	Like most freshman Republicans, Seastrand's immediate objective is to pass all 
provisions in the Contract With America. But her top legislative priority is to free the 
commercial space-launch industry from the bureaucratic maze of regulation by 
overlapping agencies. She's sponsoring a bill that would create a single agency for 
oversight and regulation, and permit tax-exempt bonds to fund the conversion of obsolete 
military bases into spaceports.</P>
<P>	Her plan would require no direct federal expenditures. Seastrand says her bill 
would help the U.S. compete in the global market for commercial launches, and create 
high-tech jobs in a depressed area severely hurt by base closures and declining military 
expenditures. As a state legislator, Seastrand successfully pushed through commercial 
spaceport legislation, creating the California Spaceport Authority and the first 
commercial spaceport in the nation at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In Congress, she has 
secured positions on the two committees that would handle this issue: Science and 
Transportation.</P>
	
<P><B>Linda Smith (WA-3)</B></P>
<P>	The House Republican leadership calls her "the woman who wouldn't blink." 
When the House wrangled over the Balanced Budget Amendment, Linda Smith insisted 
that it include a provision to prevent Congress from raising taxes without a three-fifths 
majority vote. It was a daring move for a freshman, for it amounted to a rebellion against 
the leadership of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey. Though the tax-limitation provision 
was part of the Contract, its most vocal supporters soon backed off when it became clear 
that it lacked broad congressional support. But not Smith and a handful of her colleagues. 
They convinced the GOP leadership to promise to vote next year on whether tax hikes 
should require a three-fifths majority.</P>
<P>	This came from a woman who didn't even run for Congress. Ten days before the 
primary in her congressional district in southwest Washington, the leading GOP 
candidate suddenly withdrew. Smith, a state legislator, was persuaded to run as a write-in 
candidate because she had organized a strong grass-roots base of more than 10,000 
volunteers. Smith's volunteers hit the streets and got out the vote. She won the primary as 
the first successful write-in candidate in state history, and then won the general election 
with 51 percent of the vote.</P>
<P>	 During her tenure in the state legislature, Smith launched two successful state 
ballot initiatives. The first, concerning campaign-finance reform, ushered in a new code 
of conduct for incumbent legislators, and outlawed public financing of elections. </P>
<P>	The other, the Taxpayer Protection Act, imposed a limit on state government 
spending, and called for voter approval of tax increases.</P>
<P>	That sort of lawmaking gets noticed in the new Congress: Two weeks after Smith 
came to Washington, Representative Jan Meyers tapped her to be chairman of the Small 
Business Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance. The best way to promote small 
business, she argues, is to get government out of the way. One of her top priorities is to 
reduce capital-gains taxes to lighten the load on small businesses and spur economic 
growth.</P>
<P>	Years spent navigating the federal tax system motivates this agenda: Smith 
worked as a tax planner in Washington state for 16 years, without giving politics much 
thought. In 1983, after a series of tax hikes, Smith watched her state legislature double 
the tax rate on small businesses. That's when she decided to leave the tax-consulting 
business to get into the tax-limitation business. Not only did Smith, with no political 
experience, run for a seat in the state Assembly, but she ran against a veteran in a 
Democratic stronghold--the man who'd cast the deciding vote to raise taxes. Her own 
party assured her that a conservative woman had no chance of getting elected in her 
district. Nevertheless, she won in a landslide. After four successful years in the state 
Assembly, Smith ran for the state Senate against an incumbent considered unbeatable. 
Again, she shocked her political opponents. Her come-from-behind victory helped give 
state Republicans their first legislative majority in 33 years.</P>
<P>	There is no way to explain Smith's political successes outside of her populist 
appeal. She describes her mission in Washington in the simplest of terms: "Clean up 
Congress, get rid of the debt, and secure our future." If Smith sponsors even half as much 
legislation as she shepherded in her home state, she'll be known as one of the most 
reform-minded House members in recent history.</P> 
<P>	In addition to tax reform, she wants to enact a campaign-finance reform plan that 
prohibits the transfer of political funds from one person's campaign to another. She 
believes that candidates alone should be responsible for their fundraising activities. This 
widespread practice, if outlawed, would cut against the grain of all members, regardless 
of party affiliation. It would mean that in a tight race, where an infusion of last-minute 
cash might influence the outcome, a candidate's campaign could no longer receive 
thousands of dollars in surplus funds from another politician's war chest. </P>
<P>	Smith would restrict out-of-state campaign contributions to less than half of a 
candidate's financing. She would subject political-action committees to the same 
restraints currently placed on individual contributors--$1,000 per election cycle, rather 
than the current $5,000. She wants to prohibit incumbents from using the congressional 
frank for mass mailings of constituent newsletters within three months prior to an 
election. Believing that politicians have the million-dollar advantage over their 
challengers--by way of a taxpayer-funded congressional budget--Smith contends that 
bulk mailings unfairly boost an officeholder's name identification.</P>
<P>	Smith is not known as a compromiser. Critics say that her stubbornness in 
pushing through her agenda borders on arrogance. Smith, on the other hand, likes to 
remind them that she did not run for office; she was drafted. She says her populist reform 
agenda is part of a larger movement in the newly elected House membership. "Don't 
break the spirit of this freshman class," she warns the GOP leadership. "This spirit is 
what the country needs."</P>

<P><B>Enid Greene Waldholtz (UT-2)</B></P>
<P>	Ever since Utah's Enid Greene Waldholtz was elected to Congress, she has been 
passionately concerned about her job's fringe benefits--she wants to amend, slash, and 
eliminate them. Waldholtz wants all members of Congress to reduce their retirement 
benefits, eliminate automatic pay raises, and roll back their salaries to $89,500--a 31 
percent cut--all in the name of good government.</P> 
<P>	And that's just for starters. She wants Congress to cut its own budget by 25 
percent, return to its former status as a part-time legislature, and restrict the ability of 
lobbyists to wine and dine members and their staffs. "Everything about the federal 
government needs to change," Waldholtz says.</P>
<P>	Her top priority is reform of congressional pensions. Members of Congress now 
receive retirement benefits that are roughly double that of individuals in the private 
sector. Waldholtz has co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the existing plan and replace it with 
a 401(k) employee-contribution plan.</P>
<P>	Talk about putting your money where your mouth is: Waldholtz has declined to 
accept her own congressional pension, and she has refused government-paid health 
coverage. She and her husband will purchase their own coverage until Congress acts on 
meaningful health-care reform, including portability of insurance benefits, for all 
Americans. She is also trying to figure out how to reduce her annual salary or funnel the 
difference between her current pay and her proposed salary toward charity or reducing 
the debt. She specifically intends to prevent the money from returning to the House 
Speaker's slush fund, the current repository of all unspent funds from congressional 
budgets.</P>
<P>	Although critics contend that she is feigning sacrifice, because of her personal 
wealth, she argues that to effect real political change on Capitol Hill, "the government 
must lead by example." She says it is essential that members "show that we are cutting 
our own budget, that we are living under the same conditions and rules that people in the 
rest of the country are."</P> 
<P>	Reform of congressional pay and benefits is vital, says Waldholtz, when Congress 
is asking sacrifices of its constituents in order to control federal spending and eliminate 
the deficit. Waldholtz says voters in her 2nd district of Utah understand the need for 
shared sacrifice; they know the budget cannot be balanced painlessly. "People in my 
district will support reduction in government even if it means fewer benefits to some of 
them," she says, "as long as they know Congress did it in a fair way, that they were not 
unduly penalized, or asked to take more than their fair share of the burden." </P>
<P>	Waldholtz, a longtime conservative on social issues, was a Bush supporter in the 
1980 presidential race who has since become more conservative on fiscal issues as well. 
She is a good listener, has the negotiating skills of a diplomat, and is well respected by 
both conservatives and centrists within the GOP. This is perhaps one reason why Newt 
Gingrich gave her a highly coveted slot on the Rules Committee, the gatekeeping body 
that determines which legislation makes it to the floor for debate. The first freshman 
appointed in over 80 years, she represents a part of a coalition charged with helping to 
shape legislation to appeals to a majority of the Congress.</P>
<P>	When it comes to welfare reform, for example, such a coalition will need both her 
experience and her bargaining skills. While serving as the deputy chief of staff to Norman 
Bangerter, a Utah governor, she served as his liaison for social services and spent a great 
deal of time in welfare offices talking to case workers and welfare recipients. Her 
conclusion: "The current welfare system verges on immoral," she says. "It penalizes 
people for getting married, for holding a job, and for acting responsibly. It also 
encourages recipients to have more children out of wedlock. The system is completely 
backwards, and it traps people in poverty."</P>
<P>	All of these women gained national office through more than hard work, or savvy 
campaigning, or the incompetence of their opponents. They were propelled by a common 
disgust for the status quo in Washington--a disdain shared by an overwhelming majority 
of the voting electorate last November. As Waldholtz puts it, "The federal government 
has created a hostile atmosphere for states, for communities, and for families to take care 
of themselves."</P>
<P>	Undoing this state of affairs is not thought of as an issue on a women's-rights 
agenda. But it has become the central issue for these women, because they see themselves 
not only as women, but as citizens. That may make them our best hope for bringing more 
citizenship, and less tribalism, into our politics.</P>

 <a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
In contrast to his mishandling of relations with Japan and China, President Bill Clinton advanced American interests in Asia with his July 11 executive order to establish formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Opening formal relations with Vietnam not only will allow the United States to increase trade with that country, but may in the long run encourage Vietnam to move away from Communism. A prosperous and free Vietnam could become a valuable friend in Asia for the United States. 
<p>
For this to occur, however, the Clinton Administration needs to fashion a strategy that goes beyond normalization and advances American interests in the region. Such a strategy should include continued efforts to resolve the disposition of Americans listed as missing in action during the war with Vietnam; promoting an expansion of economic freedom in Vietnam to allow for greater American trade and investment; promoting political freedom by helping Vietnam evolve from its communist political system; and supporting democratic reform in Cambodia as an example for Vietnam's future.
<p>
<a name="norm"><h4>WHY NORMALIZATION BENEFITS AMERICA </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
While establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam is discomforting to many Americans, doing so now advances American goals in Asia. First, it acknowledges that Vietnam has taken concrete steps to respond to the "roadmap" for normalization outlined by President George Bush in 1991. These include offering assistance, beginning in 1988, in resolving the fate of over 1,618 Americans listed as missing in action during the war; the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia in 1989; and the settlement of American property claims in 1994. Normalization at this time also sends an important message to China and North Korea: Relations with the U.S. can improve if a country stops threatening its neighbors and satisfies American concerns. 
<p>
Second, a formal relationship with Vietnam will enable the United States to pursue its economic interests in expanding trade and investment opportunities for American business. Vietnam's market of 70 million consumers remains highly underdeveloped, but economic reforms begun in 1989 are rapidly opening the Southeast Asian country to global commerce. Vietnam may spend an estimated $7 billion on infrastructure projects over the next five years. American brands, technology, and expertise are in demand. Of the $14 billion that other countries have invested in Vietnam, the U.S. accounts for the eighth largest share. About 300 American companies have opened offices in Vietnam since the 1994 lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Now that diplomatic relations have been established, the process of granting most-favored-nation trading status will begin. This process will offer the United States opportunities to convince Vietnam to increase economic freedom by reducing barriers to trade and investment.
<p>
Third, a normal relationship will enable the U.S. to advance its concerns about the status of human rights in Vietnam and eventually to support Vietnamese who may press for greater political freedoms. Vietnam's communist regime wants to promote economic growth and suppress political freedom. As has been the experience with other communist regimes, this is very difficult to sustain in the long term. Vietnam also may learn that totalitarian or even authoritarian control is incompatible with economic growth.
<p>
<a name="strat"><h4>A STRATEGY FOR FUTURE RELATIONS </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Future relations with Vietnam will present major challenges for American policy. The Hanoi regime has proven to be tenacious and stubborn in war and peace; future relations may entail considerable friction. Washington must craft a long-term strategy to advance U.S. economic and political goals with Vietnam while realizing that their attainment may take many years. Such a strategy should include:
<p>
<a name="reso"><b>Resolving the MIA question.</b></a><br>
Washington should tell Hanoi that it must continue to cooperate to the maximum extent possible in resolving the question of American servicemen missing from the war. This is a humanitarian concern that transcends all other issues in the relationship. Of the 2,202 Americans missing from the war, 1,618 were lost in Vietnam. This year the U.S. Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, which is leading the effort to investigate the fate of MIAs and recover their remains, will spend about $100 million. This effort should be continued. Despite increased cooperation by Hanoi in recent years, Hanoi's actions over the history of the MIA issue fuel continued suspicion that it has not divulged all relevant information. Washington should continue to press Hanoi and Moscow -- Hanoi's former ally -- to release all relevant records, including internal government documents, pertaining to missing Americans. 
<p>
<a name="expa"><b>Expanding economic freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should use every opportunity to encourage Vietnam's leaders to expand economic freedom. Only greater economic freedom will sustain Vietnam's economic growth. As recently as 1978, Vietnam tried to abolish private enterprise; but in 1986, out of grave necessity, it embarked on a market reform program. The reforms proved effective, reversing chronic food shortages and leading to greater openness to foreign investment. However, Vietnam still maintains many barriers to trade and investment that must be addressed as the United States considers not only conferring most-favored-nation trade status, but whether to admit Vietnam to the World Trade Organization. Vietnam has only 6,300 private enterprises, and all but two percent of foreign joint ventures are contracted with state-owned firms. Investors face daunting barriers: arbitrary laws and regulations, a ponderously slow bureaucracy, and pervasive corruption. In the Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom,</i> Vietnam ranks number 99 in economic freedoms out of 101 countries surveyed. As a consequence, most Vietnamese are very poor; average per capita annual income is about $200. 
<p>
Vietnam will join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this month. ASEAN (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), formed in 1967 in part to oppose communist expansion, now promotes the common political and economic interests of its members. Vietnam wants to join an impending ASEAN Free Trade Area, which will require Hanoi to lower tariffs to 5 percent by the year 2007. While welcoming Vietnam's intention to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area, Washington should press Hanoi to make trade and investment rules more transparent, simplify investment procedures, rapidly privatize state-owned enterprises, and accelerate tariff reductions. 
<p>
<a name="prpo"><b>Promoting political freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should begin a campaign to promote political freedom in Vietnam. Vietnamese themselves inevitably will demand such freedom as a consequence of economic growth, greater contact with foreigners, and Vietnamese exiles' returning to do business. Today, however, the Vietnamese Communist Party insists on total control of political power. There is no rule of law, no freedom to oppose the government, no free press, no freedom of assembly, and the government closely monitors religious groups. Dissidents are regularly jailed. 
<p>
After attending the annual ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers at the end of July, Secretary of State Warren Christopher intends to visit Hanoi. Christopher should begin a dialogue with Vietnamese officials at the ASEAN meeting, to be continued in Hanoi, urging greater tolerance of political freedom. In future meetings, U.S. officials should tell their Vietnamese counterparts that they will not be able fully to join Asia's rapid economic growth until economic liberalization incorporates greater political freedom.
<p>
Washington should move cautiously in developing any strategic relationship with Hanoi. While the United States and Vietnam oppose China's territorial claims to the South China Sea, the U.S. should resist the temptation to build up Vietnam as a counter to China. Vietnam and China will remain traditional adversaries regardless of the extent of U.S.-Vietnamese ties. Potential U.S.-Vietnam military cooperation could suffer the same fate as U.S.-China military relations: military ties built during the 1980s to counter the Soviet Union were dashed in 1989 over human rights issues. U.S.-Vietnamese military-to-military contacts already are extensive over the MIA issue. Today, however, Vietnam has closer political relations with Cuba and Iraq than with the United States. A useful military relationship with Vietnam may not be possible until it evolves significantly away from communism. 
<p>
<a name="prfe"><b>Promoting freedom in Cambodia.</b></a><br>
To provide a positive example of life after communism for Vietnam's leaders, the U.S. should work to consolidate Cambodia's tentative transition from communist rule to democracy, and to promote sustained economic growth. Vietnam put the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in power after its military occupation of Cambodia in 1979. In 1993 the CPP lost United Nations-sponsored elections, but today the CPP dominates a coalition government in Cambodia. Washington should strongly urge the CPP-dominated government to resist such authoritarian measures as a pending law that threatens to curb press freedoms and cease measures to suppress opposition politicians like Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy. 
<p>
<a name="conc"><h4>CONCLUSION </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Normal relations with Vietnam will disappoint many Americans, especially those who made great sacrifices during the war and believe that Vietnam's communist regime was and remains untrustworthy. Yet twenty years after America's withdrawal from South Vietnam, it is becoming clear that America's sacrifice -- including the lives of 58,128 servicemen -- was not in vain. The Hanoi regime's totalitarian control is eroding as it surrenders power out of necessity to capitalist forces of trade and foreign investment. 
<p>
The United States must plan to promote not only economic freedom in Vietnam, but political freedom as well. This process may take many years and cause great friction with Vietnam. But there are better prospects now to realize America's original goal: a free Vietnam that becomes a valued economic and political partner in Asia. If this occurs, the Vietnam War may turn out to have been only a lost battle. The forces of freedom and democracy for which America fought will prevail.

<h3>
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE BROOKS AND BIDEN CRIME BILLS </h3>

By Paul J. McNulty<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><Br>

Issues Bulletin No. 184<br>
November 8, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>


<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>
     The fear and frustration gripping America because of violent
crime is the direct result of one tragic fact. A dysfunctional
criminal justice system continues to release extremely dangerous
career criminals into the community when they should still be in
prison. The common factor in nearly every violent crime receiving
widespread publicity, including the recent murders of Florida tourists
and the killing of basketball star Michael Jordan's father, is that
the suspects were previously convicted of violent crimes, yet had soon
been permitted to return to the streets. Arrest, conviction, and
imprisonment did not stop them. (Half of all current state prisoners,
approximately 350,000 inmates, have three prior felony convictions,
"Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     This is why President Bill Clinton's plan to combat violent
crime, now being considered by Congress, completely misses the mark.
The main features of the President's plan are contained in legislation
offered in the House (H.R. 3131) by Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat,
who is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and in the Senate
(S. 1488, S. 1607) by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat, who heads
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<P>
     The House and Senate bills supported by Clinton ignore the real
problem by merely proposing to:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Add only 60,000 more police across the entire country over the
     next six or more years;
<P>
     Control gun possession for everyone except violent criminals, for
     whom getting guns will remain easy;
<P>
     Overturn landmark Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
     enforcement;
<P>
     Offer more spending promises, amidst a deficit crisis, on
     programs for non-violent offenders and unnecessary study
     commissions; and
<P>
     Establish softer penalties than President Bush's plan would have
     done for gun crimes by violent criminals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Yet the Brooks and Biden bills do not target the root cause of
the wave of violent crime -- the career criminals who are not kept off
the streets. Among the most serious problems with these bills and the
Clinton plan:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> One-third of Clinton's promised new police positions are not for
     police officers at all, and many others will not be available for
     many years. Moreover, the bills do not indicate where the money
     for community policing positions will come from. And more police
     to deter crime in some neighborhoods is no substitute for longer
     incarceration of career criminals.
<P>
     The bills authorize billions of dollars for "boot camps" and
     other "alternative" punishments, and for drug treatment programs
     within prison walls. Yet drug treatment programs show limited
     effectiveness, and money spent on treatment and alternative
     punishment means less money available for building prison space
     to keep career violent criminals off the streets.
<P>
     While they increase the number of crimes subject to the federal
     death penalty, the bills contain death penalty procedures that
     will make it difficult, if not impossible, to impose the death
     penalty.
<P>
     The bills contain habeas corpus reforms that likely will spur
     more petitions, not fewer.
<P>
     The Brooks bill would automatically give a violent criminal a new
     trial when an invalid confession was used in the original trial,
     even if such use had a harmless effect.
<P>
     The bills drop all the mandatory minimum sentence provisions for
     serious firearms offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill, and S. 1607 repeals mandatory sentences for certain
     drug offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>    Competing Republican measures avoid these deficiencies. These
bills, based on the original Bush crime bill introduced last year,
would, among other things, spend $3 billion over the next three years
on new regional prisons to house the most dangerous violent criminals.
These alternative bills recognize that only a partnership between
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies which targets the
most dangerous criminals, particularly those who use firearms, and
removes them from the streets will give Americans real security from
the threat of violent crime.
<P>

<B> A DECADE OF WEAK CRIME LEGISLATION </B>
<P>
     Congress is frequently accused of being enmeshed in gridlock,
unable to produce legislation on important matters of public policy.
When it comes to crime legislation, however, this criticism is seldom
heard. Indeed, anti-crime legislation has been a consistent exception
to Congress's "productivity" problem over the past decade. On this
subject, there has been no lack of desire or ability to produce new
laws. 
<P>
     Lawmakers have responded to the public's growing fear of crime by
passing four major federal crime bills in less than a decade. (The
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and the Crime Control Act of
1990.) A fifth bill came within a few votes of reaching President
Bush's desk last year. Together these bills have added hundreds of new
crimes, penalties, and procedures to the U.S. Code. Most
significantly, the combined effect of this legislation, coupled with a
dramatic increase in the federal law enforcement budget, (Spending for
federal law enforcement rose by nearly 60 percent in the Bush
Administration.) has greatly expanded the role of the federal
government in the fight against violent crime and drug trafficking.
<P>

<B> The Truth Behind the Signing Ceremonies
</B><P>
     Despite this apparent agreement between Republicans and Democrats
on the importance of fighting crime and drug abuse, sharp differences
have remained unresolved on the most important criminal justice
issues. A bipartisan coalition of moderate and conservative members in
both houses still has been unsuccessful during the past decade in
winning passage of their three top priorities. These are a
comprehensive federal death penalty, habeas corpus reform (limiting
repetitious legal challenges by death row inmates), and exclusionary
rule reform (by allowing in-court use of evidence seized without a
warrant by police officers acting in good faith).
<P>
     These three reforms so far have been blocked by a small liberal
group of highly influential lawmakers despite the support for the
measures by large majorities in both houses of Congress. The group has
been able to do this because they are high-ranking members of the
House and Senate Judiciary Committees. For example, on several
occasions over the past ten years, proposals to reform the
exclusionary rule have been adopted by the House, and habeas corpus
reform amendments have won approval in the Senate. Yet with the
exception of the death penalty for murderous drug traffickers, a
narrowly tailored provision that was passed in 1988, no amendment
concerning these three major issues has ever survived a House-Senate
conference. 
<P>

<B> The New Strategy </B>
<P>
     Apparently fearing that their blocking tactics might no longer be
successful, the Judiciary Committee liberals devised a new strategy in
1991. Rather than relying solely on obstruction, they offered their
own versions of these proposals. Their legislation had the same titles
as the anti-crime amendments, but in reality were quite different.
What was called habeas corpus reform, for example, turned out to be a
plan to gut current law by overturning more than a dozen Supreme Court
decisions which had established some limitations on habeas corpus
petitions. 
<P>
     In the end, the strategy worked. Many Members of Congress and the
media became so confused by the complicated legal debates over the
differing proposals that they did not appreciate the real effect of
the measures. As a result, in 1991, the Senate agreed to a "reform" of
the exclusionary rule offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden. This amendment actually restricted, not expanded, the current
admissibility of certain evidence. Later that year a liberal version
of habeas corpus reform passed the House by a few votes. Judiciary
Committee Democrats wasted no time in crafting a conference report
containing these destructive amendments, among other anti-law
enforcement proposals. President Bush fiercely opposed the conference
report and announced he would veto it if it was not significantly
amended. As a result, this "crime bill" died in the Senate in 1992
after several attempts to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster.
<P>
     This is the same crime bill that President Clinton has endorsed
and now serves as the core of H.R. 3131, introduced by Representative
Jack Brooks, and S. 1488 and S. 1607, introduced by Senator Joseph
Biden.
<P>
     Unlike Presidents Reagan and Bush, President Clinton has chosen
not to transmit to Congress an actual legislative proposal. Instead,
he held a press conference this August at which he outlined five
components of crime legislation that Congress should approve. The
crime bills introduced by the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Judiciary Committees largely include the President's five elements.
<P>
     The President chose this unusual course for two apparent reasons.
First, his support for the 1992 crime bill conference report made it
unnecessary to fashion a new bill from scratch. Any new ideas, such as
grants for more police, could simply be added to the 1992 bill.
Second, forming a new bill would have required the agreement of at
least four parties -- the White House, the Justice Department,
moderate Democrats such as Senator Biden and Representative Charles
Schumer, the New York Democrat who is Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Crime and Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee, and
liberal Democrats such as Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and
Representative Don Edwards of California, who is Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights. Given Attorney
General Janet Reno's personal opposition to the death penalty and her
preference for social programs addressing the "root causes" of crime,
agreement on a new crime bill would have been extremely difficult. By
deferring to the preferences of Chairmen Brooks and Biden, the
President at least temporarily avoided a clash within his own party. 
<P>

 <B> THE PRESIDENT'S FIVE PRIORITIES </B>
<P>
     President Clinton has called on Congress to pass a crime bill
containing at least the following five elements:
<P>
1.   More Police;
<P>
2.   Gun Control;
<P>
3.   Boot Camps and Drug Treatment;
<P>
4.   Federal Death Penalty; and
<P>
5.   Habeas Corpus Reform

<P>



<B> Element #1: More Police </B>
<P>
     Putting 100,000 more police on America's streets was the
centerpiece of candidate Clinton's anti-crime message during his
presidential campaign. This promise apparently was well received by
the voters. Even though George Bush had an exceptionally strong record
on law enforcement, he did not maintain an edge over Clinton on the
crime issue -- in contrast with Bush's battle with Michael Dukakis in
1988.
<P>
     The President's plan for adding 100,000 police includes the
following specifics:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> An additional 50,000 new officers over the next six years in
     community policing programs, at a cost to the federal government
     (in addition to state and local costs) of $3.4 billion (Senator
     Biden increased this to 60,000 officers and $5.2 billion in S.
     1607;
<P>
     Between 4,000 and 5,000 "Police Corps" officers after 1999, when
     they complete four years of government-supported college
     education (The federal government's cost: $100 million);
<P>
     An additional 4,000 security guards and police officers for
     public schools over five years, at a federal cost of $475
     million;
<P>
     An additional 5,000 security guards and police officers for
     public housing over five years at a federal cost of $700 million;
<P>
     Up to 25,000 "National Service" participants (college students)
     working in law enforcement-related fields for one or two years;
<P>
     Between 6,000 and 7,000 officers for community policing in
     "Empowerment Zones" and "Enterprise Communities," at a cost to
     the federal government of $500 million; and
<P>
     An additional $10 million for the Labor Department to retrain up
     to 1,500 former military personnel for police positions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Analysis: The Administration argues that more police will
suppress crime because criminals are less willing to break the law in
the presence of police officers. More suppression means less crime and
fewer arrests, which will alleviate some of the burden currently
weighing down the criminal justice system.
  <P>   Supporters of the President's plan also point out that community
policing, in particular, has become an extremely useful program for
developing stronger ties between police and the communities they
serve. The visible presence of law enforcement officers "walking the
beat" not only discourages potential law breakers, but it also gives a
sense of security to citizens.
<P>
     A closer examination of this proposal, however, reveals at least
the following three serious flaws:
<P>
Flaw #1: It is too little, too late. As much as one-third of the
proposed 100,000 new positions
     are not police officers. The list includes up to 35,000 unsworn
     security personnel and "National Service" students who are
     serving one or two years in public safety organizations to pay
     back college loans. These individuals are not authorized to make
     arrests, and most will not be engaged in confrontations with
     criminals. This is hardly what Americans expected when they
     expressed strong support for more "cops on the beat."
     Furthermore, approximately 5,000 of the new police officers who
     would come from the Police Corps program will not be on the job
     until 1999 at the earliest, because they must complete four years
     of college education before they begin service. 
<P>
Flaw #2: The money may come from other law enforcement programs. There
is a big difference
     between an authorization to spend money for state and local law
     enforcement and an actual appropriations bill containing the
     funding. The President's proposal would merely give permission to
     congressional appropriators to search for some extra money to
     fund the police programs. The Brooks and Biden bills propose
     nearly $3.4 billion to $5.2 billion over five or six years for
     just half of the 100,000 police jobs, and there are several other
     expensive provisions in the bills. Yet, federal funding for state
     and local anti-crime grants have been frozen at slightly less
     than $500 million for the past three years. So if Congress is to
     expand the level of financial assistance for state and local
     government without violating its overall budget constraints, the
     money likely will have to come from the federal law enforcement
     budget -- which has already been targeted by the Clinton
     Administration for sharp reductions.
<P>
Flaw #3: More police alone will not keep criminals off the streets.
Perhaps the most significant
     flaw with merely promising more police is that it fails to
     address the real problem. Suppressing crime through more police
     seeks to stop crime the same way locks on doors, bars on windows,
     citizen patrols, and anti-car theft devices do. They reduce the
     opportunities for criminals. But there is a hard core of career
     criminals on the streets; they are not easily deterred, and they
     are the main cause of the crime wave. As long as they continue to
     be released from prison long before their sentences have been
     served, Americans will not enjoy genuine security. To keep these
     criminals off the streets -- rather than merely dissuade them
     from operating in certain neighborhoods -- requires more
     prosecutors, judges, and prisons.
<P>
     With more police on the streets, more arrests will and should be
made. This places an increased burden on the courts, prosecutors, and
prisons. But the President ignores the entire criminal justice
pipeline. Ironically, when the system receives more offenders than it
can handle, more offenders must be "let off" in various ways (such as
dropped charges, plea bargains, and probation). Criminals then can
return to the streets with greater confidence in their ability to
"beat the system." 

<P>
<B> Element #2: Gun Control </B>
<P>
     The second element of the President's anti-crime plan is gun
control. Clinton has challenged Congress to enact the Brady Bill, a
proposal named after President Reagan's Press Secretary, James Brady,
which would establish a national waiting period for background checks
of handgun purchasers. He also has proposed a ban on the importation,
manufacture, sale, and possession of so-called assault weapons.
Analysis: The debate over the Brady Bill, which is a provision of the
Brooks bill only, is largely a symbolic one. Those supporting the
Brady bill are cast as being "for" a tough measure to deny guns to
criminals. Those opposing the bill are said to be "against" that goal.
<P>
     In reality, the legislative differences between the gun control
and the anti-gun control forces are minor. The Brady Bill would
establish a five working-day waiting period for the purchase of a
handgun, during which time local law enforcement officials would be
able to conduct background checks on the prospective gun buyers. These
checks would include a search of the criminal history records
currently available to law enforcement agencies at the state and
federal levels. 
<P>
     Major improvements in the automation and accuracy of these
criminal history records would permit fast and reliable access. When
this is achieved, or after five years, whichever is sooner, the Brady
Bill's waiting period requirement would sunset, because by that time a
background check could be conducted almost instantly. Lawmakers
opposed to the Brady Bill favor an instant check system. Their
proposal calls for the development of an automated system over the
next five years for determining, at the time the handgun is being
sold, whether the buyer is a convicted felon. The only difference is
that no national waiting period would exist during this period of
time.
<P>
     Since many Americans already live in jurisdictions with either a
waiting period or some other preferred method to screen gun buyers,
the actual effect of the Brady Bill would be minimal. The real
difference between the two sides has more to do with underlying
philosophies for dealing with violent crime. Many gun control
supporters believe crime is the result of the environment within which
criminals live. They cite such factors as the availability of guns,
television violence, and economic and educational deprivation. The
anti-gun control proponents, on the other hand, are more interested in
the accountability of the violent criminal.
<P>
     In the case of a ban on assault weapons, the 101st and the 102nd
Congresses dealt with this issue at great length. Assault weapons, as
defined by past legislation, are the semi-automatic firearms popular
with violent criminals because of their menacing appearance. Among the
features of such weapons are folding stocks, pistol grips, large
ammunition clips, and bayonet attachments.
<P>
     The controversy over the proposal to ban the weapons arises from
the inability to define, to the satisfaction of most lawmakers, the
words "assault weapons." Aside from their appearance, assault weapons
actually are no different from any other semi-automatic firearm. The
simple fact is that all semi-automatic firearms function in the same
way. Opponents argue that a ban might eventually and easily be
expanded to include many more popular types of semi-automatics, such
as widely owned target shooting and hunting rifles.
<P>
     So strong is this objection that neither the Brooks nor the Biden
bill includes a proposal on assault weapons.
<P>
<B> Element #3: Boot Camps and Drug Treatment </B>
<P>
     The third component of President Clinton's anti-crime plan is an
expansion of boot camps and drug treatment for prisoners. The Brooks
and Biden bills authorize $600 million and $800 million respectively
in new spending for "boot camps" and other "alternative punishments"
at the state level. The bills also propose "residential drug
treatment" grants of $300 million over three years for state prisons,
and they require federal prisons by 1997 to provide drug treatment to
every prisoner with a substance abuse problem. State prisoners under
the age of 29 would be eligible for the alternative punishments
programs even if they are violent criminals.
Analysis: The shortage of federal funding for state law enforcement
programs is by far the biggest problem with the boot camps and drug
treatment proposals. The President has said that funding for more
police is his top priority. But there will be difficulty in finding
money even for that, let alone these other measures. It is very
doubtful, therefore, that any money will be available in practice for
these new projects. Law enforcement officials at the state and local
level will be particularly irritated if funding for drug treatment is
taken from programs that support their anti-crime efforts. 
 <P>    The provision concerning residential drug treatment for federal
prisoners raises a more serious funding problem. This section requires
the federal Bureau of Prisons to provide by 1997 the opportunity for
residential drug treatment to every prisoner with a substance abuse
problem. By the end of fiscal year 1995, at least 50 percent of this
goal must be achieved, and by the end of 1996, the requirement
increases to 75 percent. If Congress does not provide additional
funding to the Bureau for this mandate, other Bureau programs may
suffer --  such as prison construction, which already has felt
substantial reductions.
<P>
     As for drug treatment grants to the states, it is important to
note that treatment for prisoners already is widely available. A third
of all state inmates have participated in drug treatment programs
while in prison, and among those who had used a drug during the month
before their current offense, nearly half received treatment after
entering prison. ("Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     While some may argue that this is short of what is needed, it
must also be understood that treatment is often unsuccessful. A 1991
survey of state prisoners who had used drugs during the month before
their crime, for example, found that 31 percent had been in treatment
before and 25 percent had been in it twice. (Ibid.) Moreover, the
prospect of serving prison time in a "residential treatment" program,
defined as confinement "set apart from the general prison population,"
may have the effect, at both the federal and state level, of drawing
prisoners who are marginally in need of treatment but attracted to the
"soft time."
<P>
     Finally, some serious consideration should be given to the
proposal that federal tax dollars be used for putting young violent
offenders into "alternative" corrections programs. Releasing such
criminals into community-based programs poses real risks to public
safety.

<P>
<B> Element #4: The Death Penalty </B>
<P>
     The President has called for the enactment of a comprehensive
federal death penalty as his fourth priority. He supports the 1992
crime bill death penalty language that contained more than fifty
capital offenses. The Biden and Brooks bills have slightly fewer
offenses because the death penalty for drug kingpins was dropped from
both bills at the insistence of the Justice Department. The reason is
that the provision would have permitted the death penalty for a major
drug kingpin convicted solely of trafficking extremely large
quantities of drugs. No proof of a specific murder would have been
required.
<P>
     Analysis: One criticism often leveled against a federal death
penalty is that it is largely symbolic because nearly all murders are
in violation of state law and fall outside federal jurisdiction.
Indeed, many of the federal capital offenses found in H.R. 3131,
S. 1488, and S. 1607 are extremely limited in their reach, such as
terrorist murders or assassination of the President. However, a few of
the offenses in the Biden and Brooks bills could apply widely. For
example, imposing the death penalty for killing with a firearm in the
course of a federal violent crime or serious drug trafficking offense
could apply to much of the violence now occurring on the streets of
nearly every city in America.
<P>
     This proposal does prompt objections among those concerned about
principles of federalism. The aggressive use of such a federal death
penalty would tend to lead to a more frequent use of the death penalty
in states where capital punishment rarely, if ever, occurs. Thus a
state reluctant to impose the death penalty would, in effect, be
overriden by the federal government.
<P>
     Federalists need not worry, however, about the Democrats' death
penalty proposal. Capital punishment at the federal level will occur
only when the statutory procedures allow. And the Biden and Brooks
bills contain death penalty procedures that will make it difficult, if
not impossible, actually to impose a death sentence.
<P>
     First, the bills allow for "standardless jury discretion." This
means that any juror can block the sentence of death, regardless of
how aggravated the crime may have been. This is inconsistent with
current law, which permits juries to be instructed that a death
sentence must be imposed if they determine that the aggravating
factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (See Boyde v. California, 110
S.Ct. 1190 (1990) and Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 110 S.Ct. 1078
(1990).) 
<P>
     Second, the procedures contain no habeas corpus limitations.
Thus, federal capital defendants can endlessly delay their executions,
as most state prisoners currently do. The habeas reform proposals in
H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S. 1607, as ineffective as they are, apply
only to state prisoners. 
<P>
     Third, the bills prohibit federal prosecutors from using elements
of an offense as aggravating factors. As an example, consider a case
of a person convicted of murdering a child in the course of violating
the federal law against child sexual abuse. Under the Brooks and Biden
bills, the government could not use the fact that the victim was a
child as an aggravating factor -- contrary to current law. (See
Lowenfeld v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988).)
<P>
<B> Element #5: Habeas Corpus Reform </B>
<P>
     The last element of the President's anti-crime package is habeas
corpus reform. In his August statement, the President drew attention
to a bill introduced by Senator Biden which is now incorporated into
S. 1488 and S. 1607. He described the bill as a "breakthrough" because
it enjoys the support of district attorneys, state attorneys general,
as well as Administration officials. The President characterized the
Biden proposal as one which "will, for the first time, limit inmates
to filing a single, federal habeas corpus appeal within a six month
time limit." It will also, he said, require death penalty states to
provide every indigent capital defendant with a team of highly
qualified and experienced defense lawyers.
<P>
     The Brooks bill also contains a habeas corpus proposal, which
differs in some important aspects from the Biden version. One key
difference is that H.R. 3131 substantially expands the control and
influence of activist criminal defense lawyers in matters relating to
the representation of indigent capital defendants.
Analysis: The battle over habeas corpus reform in recent years has
been extremely complex and divisive. At its root, the debate is about
the extent and nature of federal court review of actions by state
criminal justice systems, actions which involve difficult legal and
constitutional questions. It is divisive because in many cases it is
also about life and death. 
  <P>  The primary goal for supporters of habeas corpus reform is to
limit significantly the ability of prisoners on death row to delay the
imposition of capital punishment by raising frivolous legal claims in
federal courts. The Biden and Brooks bills apply to non-capital cases
as well. The current system allows such prisoners to attack their
convictions by repeatedly filing federal habeas corpus petitions,
requesting federal judges to review their cases after they have lost
all of their direct appeals and their state-level habeas corpus
claims. These filings can result in years of delay, and consume
enormous amounts of the time, energy, and money of the already over-
burdened legal system.
<P>
     Senator Biden deserves credit for initiating negotiations with
prosecutors in crafting his habeas corpus proposal. One result of this
is that representatives of the National District Attorneys Association
and some state attorneys general have expressed support for his bill.
However, a growing number of state prosecutors are expressing
opposition to the language, now that they have fully examined what
their Washington representatives achieved. (California Attorney
General Dan Lungren is leading the drive to defeat the Democrats'
habeas corpus proposal.)
<P>
     The objections to the Biden and Brooks bills are that they not
only fall far short of what is needed to end habeas corpus abuse, but
they also dramatically weaken existing law. The claim is that habeas
corpus abuse would be worse, not better, if these proposals became
law. The bills broaden the legal basis on which habeas claims could be
made, make it easier to file a second, third, or fourth petition than
it is today, and mandate the states to bear large costs in providing
to indigent capital defendants the best defense attorneys available in
all phases of capital litigation.
<P>
     Retroactive Decisions. Under current law, a convicted criminal is
generally unable to challenge his conviction based upon subsequent
changes in the law. "New rules" are not normally retroactive to past
cases. The Supreme Court announced this in the 1989 landmark case of
Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989). ) in which the Court held that a
defendant's claims of constitutional violations in most cases must be
judged in accordance with the law existing at the time his conviction
became final. Without such a principle, the Court explained, appellate
judges would have to be prophets and there would never be finality in
the criminal justice system. All of this means that a prisoner may not
challenge his conviction in a habeas corpus petition on the grounds
that the Supreme Court has established a "new rule" in a particular
area of the law that may be relevant to the prisoner's original case.
<P>
     Reversing Teague through federal legislation, or at least
substantially reducing its effect, has been a top goal of Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill for the past few years. The aim has been to
define by statute "new rule" in a manner that is narrower than the
definition in Teague and later cases. Achieving this change would mean
that many more decisions would be retroactive to past cases, allowing
prisoners new opportunities to overturn their convictions using habeas
petitions.
<P>
     New Grounds for Petition. Since the primary purpose of habeas
corpus reform is to drastically limit the ability of a prisoner to
file a second or successive petition following disposition of the
first, any exception to this "one bite" rule would have to be minor.
President Bush proposed that such petitions be permitted only when
they raised constitutional claims involving new evidence of actual
innocence. But the Clinton approach, embodied in the Biden and Brooks
bills, is very different.
<P>
     New petitions would be permitted under several circumstances.
Among them: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> A retroactive Supreme Court decision which changes the law in
     existence at the time the prisoner's case became final;
<P>
     The emergence of new evidence, such as a relative's affidavit
     asserting an alibi for the petitioner, even if it is unrelated to
     a violation of constitutional rights; and
<P>     The discovery of additional evidence relating to mitigation
     against the sentence of death. (This is a direct repudiation of
     the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Sawyer v. Whitley, (112 S.Ct.
     2514, (1992).) which held that successive habeas petitions may
     not attack a sentence of death on the basis of new mitigating
     factors.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Standards for Defense Counsel. California Attorney General
Daniel Lungren refers to the lengthy provisions involving mandatory
standards for defense lawyers as the "Capital Defense Attorney
Employment Act of 1993." He rightly objects to the new federal
standards being forced on the states even though they are not required
by the Constitution. Moreover, the proposal establishes mandatory
standards on state trials and appeals, not just federal habeas
proceedings, and, in the case of H.R. 3131 and S. 1488, cuts off law
enforcement funding for states that do not "choose" to comply.
<P>
<B> OTHER BIDEN-BROOKS CRIME BILL PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     There are several other problems with H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S.
1607. Two provisions are particularly in need of modification:
<P>
1.   Repeal of the Harmless Error Rules. H.R. 3131 overturns Arizona
     v. Fulminante (111 S.Ct. 1246, (1991).) and possibly other
     "harmless error" cases. In Fulminante, the Supreme Court held
     that a criminal conviction should not be reversed when a
     defendant's invalid confession was admitted into evidence if it
     appears beyond a reasonable doubt that without the confession the
     other evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant. H.R. 3131
     would require convictions in such cases automatically to be
     reversed for new trials.
<P>
2.   Deletion of Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Mandatory minimum
     sentences have become an issue of great controversy. The debate
     usually focuses on the wisdom of mandatory sentences for certain
     types of drug offenders. The Biden and Brooks bills go much
     further by dropping all the proposals for new mandatory sentences
     for serious firearm offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill. For example, the 1992 crime bill contained a ten-year
     mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who used a semi-automatic
     firearm in the course of a violent crime or serious drug
     trafficking offense. H.R. 3131, S. 1488 and S. 1607 do not
     contain this proposal. Instead they simply instruct the
     Sentencing Commission to "provide an appropriate enhancement" for
     this offense. Furthermore, S. 1607 repeals mandatory minimum
     sentences for non-violent drug traffickers. This could
     substantially weaken the ability of federal prosecutors to obtain
     the cooperation of such offenders because they would no longer
     have an incentive to provide valuable information regarding
     trafficking conspiracies.

<P>
<B> REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     The Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House began
working on violent crime bills in the spring of this year, and
introduced their comprehensive plans in early August. Large parts of
the bills (H.R. 2872 and S. 1356) look very much like the proposals
transmitted to Congress by President Bush on two occasions during his
Administration. The strength of these bills is that they contain both
important reforms for the federal system and incentives for system
reforms at the state evel.
<P>
     The provisions in these bills dealing with the federal death
penalty, habeas corpus reform, and the exclusionary rule contain none
of the flaws found in H.R. 3131 and S. 1488. The measures also include
proposals that would have a significant effect on the ability of
federal and state prosecutors to convict criminals committing acts of
sexual violence.
<P>
     A major provision in the Republican bills deals with regional
prisons. The bills propose to spend $3 billion over the next three
years to build and operate large regional prisons. This would be
undertaken in financial partnerships with groups of states. In a
contrast to normal congressional practice, the Republicans also
explain how they would pay for the prisons by identifying specific
spending cuts.
<P>
     These new prisons would be used to house criminal aliens and
certain categories of the most dangerous violent criminals currently
located in state prisons. For a state to be eligible to participate in
this program, it must demonstrate its commitment to combatting violent
crime by reforming its criminal justice system. The key reform is so-
called truth-in-sentencing, which means that violent criminals and
serious drug traffickers must serve at least 85 percent of their
sentences.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION
</B><P>
     The anti-crime plans offered by President Clinton and
congressional Democrats will do nothing to address the wave of violent
crime now plaguing America. At best, these plans offer unfunded
promises to state and local law enforcement. Given the pressing need
for additional resources throughout the criminal justice system, such
empty-handed promises cannot be viewed as acceptable solutions. 
<P>
     Beyond the hollow nature of these proposals lies the damage that
would be done when the criminal justice system is weakened by
provisions overturning Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
enforcement. If Congress were to enact these provisions, it would be a
major setback for crime control. Instead, Congress should adopt
measures that would remove violent criminals from America's streets.

<title>Report From Russia: Politics, Economics, and The Nato Expansion Issue -- Heritage </title>

<b>Heritage Lecture 537</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3> Report From Russia: Politics, Economics, and The NATO Expansion Issue</h3>
<p>
By Evgueni Volk, Director, Heritage Foundation Moscow Office, before the Political Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly on May 28, 1995.
<p>
	The domestic situation in Russia and the NATO expansion problem are closely interrelated and influence each other in a number of important directions. It is extremely difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of such an interaction, but it seems obvious that the process will be long, complicated, and even painful.
<p>
	Russia is undergoing a difficult transition in its social, economic, and political systems. The point of departure is more or less clear:  Russia was once a totalitarian communist system. As for the point of destination, no public consensus yet exists. When speaking of democracy, civil society, the rule of law, and the market economy, the Russian people differ in their understanding of these concepts. Moreover, the psychological legacy of the past has engendered a negative attitude toward these internationally accepted values. The pace of reforms has been significantly hampered by a lack of agreement concerning these values.
<p>
	Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in building a genuine democratic system. The privatization process is one of them. Its main outcome to date has been the gradual formation of a new entrepreneurial class with private ownership and commercial and political initiative. Despite its numerous controversial features, privatization generally continues, and it is the chief litmus test for Russian economic reform.
<p>
	Politically, a free electoral system is the principal result of reform. It is the first experience for the Russians in choosing their representatives to the legislative power and, by this, influencing the policy of the government.
<p>
	The freedoms of the press and expression are another major gain of the Russian reform. They guarantee the irreversibility of the democratic process. The mass media also play a significant part in the system of checks and balances, and their position is hard to ignore. However, the press is often subjected to intimidation and financial pressure from legal and illegal centers of power.
<p>
	Russian reforms are facing severe obstacles. No real anti-totalitarian revolution has taken place, and the communist <i>nomenklatura</i>, ill-equipped for a democratic environment, remains the source of political and economic power. In many cases privatization merely legalized the monopolistic control of industrial giants on the market, entailing inflation and stagnation. And the market has yet to break down Russia's highly militarized economy.
<p>
	Executive power is far stronger than the legislative power and is further consolidating its position. In fact, Russia's bureaucracy is more powerful, wasteful, and arrogant than its Soviet predecessor. A lack of public control mechanisms contributes to an unprecedented spread of corruption. People feel unprotected against arbitrary bureaucratic rule.
<p>
	The Russian economic mentality is still largely based on paternalist and egalitarian ideas. People believe that the government should take care of them in every situation. This provokes an increase in overregulatory governmental functions, with direct interference in all the spheres of economic life. Bureaucratic control over the economy is growing. Egalitarian trends predetermine a negative attitude toward industrious and wealthy people who succeeded in building their well-being by honest labor. This is particularly true in rural areas, where private farmers are discriminated against and preference is given to the old collective farms. The vested interest of the old economic <i>nomenklatura</i> in preserving its economic power hinders the progress of reform and impedes the efficiency of production.
<p>
	The weakness of democratic political and economic institutions has contributed to the rising crime rate. About 75 percent of private companies have to pay up to 20 percent of their income as protection money to mobsters. More and more people are joining businesses owned and operated by criminals. The law enforcement agencies are highly corrupted. The taxation rate is so high (up to 90 percent of income) that the majority evades it by concealing revenues.
<P>
	The Russian political scene demonstrates the weakness of Russia's democratic institutions. There exist several hundred political parties, but very few of them have influence and virtually none can get an overwhelming majority in the parliament. Confrontation between center-right democrats and left-wing communists continues, and the centrist parties are not playing a significant role. Democrats are not in good shape, as people tend to attribute the failure of reform to their ideas rather than to a lack of persistence in their implementation. But neither communists nor nationalists have any efficient remedies. Attempts to consolidate a "centrist" party of power such as Chernomyrdin's "Our Home-Russia" are made again and again, but only time will show how solid this bloc will be.
<p>
	Many of the political differences of the parties arise from different economic interests. The sectors of the economy that depend on further international cooperation (such as the oil, gas, trade, and banking industries) are internationalist and more open to the West. Others that suffer either from competition with the West (such as the agricultural sector and consumer industries) or from the relaxation of tension (such as the military-industrial complex) are more isolationist and nationalist.
<p>

<b>RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY AND NATO EXPANSION</b>
<p>
	The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a profound crisis in Russia's national identity. Russia's role as a world power has decreased, and an inferiority complex has emerged. As a result, Russians are becoming more nostalgic for the Soviet past when their country was, in their eyes, more powerful and wealthy. Many Russians still view themselves as Soviet and not Russian citizens and believe that the disintegration of the USSR was a mistake. The rise of a nationalist sentiment, including its aggressive component, is a response to political and economic challenges the society faces. Psychologically, many people doubt that the newly independent states are truly independent. The feeling of Orwell's "Big Brother" is as widespread as the conviction that these states cannot survive without Russia. 
<p>
	 The idea of a "great power" today is based largely on nuclear potential. It clearly does not rest on Russia's economic performance. Two-thirds of the Russian population live below the minimum subsistence level. According to all major social and economic indicators, Russia can hardly be regarded as a prosperous country. This engenders a bitterness that is often the fuel of extremist political parties.
<p>
	The expectation after the demise of communism was that the Western alliance would pay for Russia's transition to democratic capitalism. When it became evident that this would not occur, Russians were profoundly disappointed. The result has been a rising anti-Western mentality among the Russian people. This sentiment is easily manipulated by communists and extreme nationalists.

<p>	The Chechen crisis shocked Russian society. It clearly exposed the fact that little had changed in the new democratic Russia. Excessive secrecy, anti-democratic decision-making, neglect of impartial expertise and public opinion, lies, and brutality toward peaceful citizens were rampant throughout the Chechen operation, as they were during Soviet times as well. Few Russians doubt the criminal nature of Dudayev's regime in Chechnya. But they ask how he was allowed to gain power and to obtain enormous amounts of weapons. Until there is a definite political answer, no prospects for a peace settlement are feasible. The guilty are seeking ways to evade responsibility by waging a bloody war to wipe away all evidence of their crime.
<p>
	Foreign policy issues are not that important to the average Russian. The ordeal of day-to-day survival is far more important for a large majority of Russians. But for exactly these reasons, some politicians are trying to change the subject from their domestic policy failures to foreign policy. In this respect the NATO expansion issue is the perfect target for channelling popular discontent into a foreign policy issue.
<p>
	The Russian attitude toward the NATO expansion debate is 99 percent domestically motivated. The following ingredients create a nutrient medium for resisting NATO expansion plans, irrespective of their true nature and timing:  the alleged failure of the Western development model, disappointment with insufficient Western assistance, the growth of nostalgic pro-communist and xenophobic sentiments brought about by low living standards, an aggressive nationalist and isolationist stand, and weakness of democratic tradition and institutions.
<p>
	The Russian public, in fact, knows very little about NATO. Nearly 100 percent of the common people, if asked about the issue, would say that NATO was an "aggressive military bloc."  The power of the Cold War stereotypes is still great, and even Russian politicians -- some deliberately, some unintentionally -- suffer from myopia as far as NATO is concerned. While never doubtful of the peaceful intentions of the U.S., U.K., Germany, or France individually, Russians easily and illogically become fearful of the NATO alliance as a whole.
<p>
	The Russian debate on NATO is lacking in expertise and competence. The NATO evolution process -- through the Harmel Report to the Declaration in Rome and others -- is completely overlooked, as are numerous non-military spheres of action, including political consultation, and economic, scientific, and ecological cooperation. Restricting NATO to a mere military function is a favored means for its opponents to criticize it. Unfortunately, little has been done in recent years by NATO and the Russian democratic movement to dispel the alliance's false image with the Russian public. No matter what the reason -- a lack of political will or resources -- there is no excuse for this failure.
<p>
	I share the views of those Russians who see no problems with NATO expansion. I even welcome it. The North Atlantic alliance remains the most efficient and viable security structure in the world. It has long ceased to be just a military alliance (if it ever was) to become a politically motivated organization projecting and disseminating democratic values. Political goals have always been central to this strategy, and the 50 years of peace in Europe can be attributed to NATO's resolve to defend freedom and democracy. The plans to incorporate new members mean further guarantees of democratic and stable development in Central and Eastern Europe with no threat to anybody.
<p>
	Only people with a confrontational mentality can presume that the NATO enlargement will jeopardize Russian security interests. But should, to Russia's great misfortune, those interests be usurped and misinterpreted by extremist forces, NATO would undoubtedly act in keeping with its political and military deterrence function in order to maintain international security and stability.
<p>
	Russian political forces who associate themselves with the Western alliance are by no means numerous. But this fact does not mean that there is an anti-NATO consensus, as some people in Moscow claim. The absence of an accepted national security strategy provides ground for arbitrary interpretation of national interests and threats and challenges. It prevents Russian foreign policy from adopting a consistent, long-term approach to any international problem. As a result, the NATO expansion issue cannot be put in proper perspective. Thus, old Soviet-era prejudices often get the upper hand in the debate. 
<p>
	 Of course, the Russian military has a vested interest in opposing NATO expansion. In order to survive and maintain a high profile, the armed forces believe that they must have a clearly identified and strong adversary. NATO is the largest military power closest to the Russian borders, and wishful thinking can easily attribute the "enemy image" to it. Moreover, cooperation with NATO requires that the armed forces be more open in the way they conduct their business. This is something the Russian military is not used to. After the Chechen events it seems clearer that traditional secrecy was designed largely to conceal the limitations rather than merits of the Soviet Army, and this trend is likely to persist. Finally, existing arms control agreements do not suit the Russian military, as they impose restrictions on their ambitious military plans and programs.

<p>	Regardless of the obstacles, NATO expansion should proceed in conformity with European and global security and stability interests. NATO may not be perfect, but no other more efficient mechanisms exist on the continent. I appreciate the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's important political role in the West-East dialogue (since I participated in its diplomatic process, too). However, the OSCE has not shown itself to be an adequate substitute for NATO. As far as the CIS security structure is concerned, its shape undoubtedly faces serious difficulties, and the ultimate result is still unclear.
<p>
	In the course of its expansion, NATO should be well aware of misperceptions and apprehensions that are sometimes exaggerated in Russia. Political and informational effort should be made to dispel them. Therefore: 
<p><ul>
<li>Versatile bilateral cooperation between NATO and Russia should develop; <br>

<li>The new generation of Russian politicians, military men, and researchers should be more resolutely involved in NATO and North Atlantic Assembly activities; <br>

<li>The issue of NATO special educational programs for Russia should be addressed;<br>

<li>The Russian military should be brought under civilian and public control to avoid future Chechnyas; and<br>

<li>Russia's active participation in the Partnership for Peace program is a precondition for building up mutual confidence and security.
<p></ul>
	If these steps are taken, close political contacts between NATO and Russia could develop into a special partnership. Russia's full membership in NATO, which looks quite improbable today, could become a reality in the 21st century.<p>

      In commencing this second lecture on the sorry state of
political parties in these United States, I ask you to indulge me in
quoting a passage from Edmund Burke's Thoughts on the Present
Discontents, a political tract, published in 1770, mordantly critical
of the ways of George III with Parliament.  In this famous essay Burke
defines the phrase "political party":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they
      will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a
      contemptible struggle.... 
<P>
      Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint
      endeavors the national interest upon some particular
      principle in which they are all agreed.  For my part, I
      find it impossible to conceive that anyone believes in his
      own politics, or thinks them of any weight, who refuses to
      adopt the means of having them reduced into practice.  It
      is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the
      proper ends of government.  It is the business of the
      politician, who is the philosopher in action, to find out
      proper means towards those ends, and to employ them with
      effect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Now I confess myself to be one of those speculative
philosophers, mentioned by Burke, whose business it is to mark the
proper ends of government; I do not pretend to possess remedies for
all the political ills to which our nation is heir.  But I venture to
criticize those politicians, in either great party, who, far from
being philosophers in action, are merely what Burke and his
contemporaries called "placemen":  that is, seekers after the power
and the emoluments of public office, not scrupulous as to the means by
which advantages for themselves may be obtained.  The demagogue seeks
for himself a cozy place in the political sunshine.
<P>
      In my previous lecture of this series, I touched upon some
errors of the Republican Party, under George Bush, in affairs domestic
and in affairs abroad.  Today I turn to the errors of the Democratic
Party, under leaders of recent years.  For the past decade the
Democrats have been an opposition party -- that is, in opposition to
the national Executive Force.  In their opposition the Democrats, with
some honorable exceptions, have gained little credit for themselves.
<P>
      Difficult Attitudes.  The Democratic party claims descent from
Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, but any remaining relationship to
Jeffersonians is difficult to discern.  In its origins, the Democratic
Party at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the champion of
the agricultural and rural interest, the defender of states' powers as
opposed to political centralization, the advocate of hard money and
the opponent of national debt.  Democratic attitudes nowadays are very
different.
<P>
      For at Democratic national conventions, the cry is all for
grander federal expenditures and piling up of more debt, in
consequence.  With few exceptions, the leading Democrats would
centralize everything, not bothering to reflect upon what the word
"federal" signifies.  For the most part ignoring the remnant of
America's rural population, the Democrats are subservient to organized
"minorities" in America's great decayed cities; upon the proletariat
they are sedulous to confer more "entitlements," on humanitarian
principles.  Senator Moynihan and a handful of other Democratic
legislators think seriously about our urban afflictions, seeking
practical remedies, a difficult task; but most Democrats in office
hold by the exploded notion that legislative bodies can sweep away
social conundrums by throwing money at them.
<P>
      Democratic Majorities. In presidential contests, the Democrats
have won only one of the past six elections, and take a dim view of
their own prospects in the election of 1992.  The ethnic coalition
from which they drew a great part of their support in the Roosevelt
and Truman years has been dissolving; the labor unions that delivered
a massive Democratic vote have been diminishing in numbers and in
zeal; white voters in the Old South have shifted, a great many of
them, to the Republican ticket; the Democratic party seems devoid of
imagination and deprived of true leadership.  How is it, then, that
Democratic majorities prevail in House and Senate?
<P>
      The answer to that question seems to be that in presidential
elections, the voting public becomes fairly well aware of the issues
in dispute and of the personalities of the candidates:  massive
television coverage, prolonged newspaper discussion, and candidates'
debates give the typical voter some notion of what the Republican
presidential candidate and the Democratic candidate respectively think
and propose.  So informed, the majority of citizens then vote for the
Republican, having found him nearer to their hearts' desire.
<P>
      For the Democrats, in their endeavor to cater to even the most
unlikely "minority," have alienated the majority in nearly every state
of the Union.  The American public is conservative in its sentiments,
for the most part; and when the contest occurs between candidates
recognizably conservative and candidates recognizably liberal or
radical, the public prefers the conservative.  The governor of New
York, Mario Cuomo, so often mentioned as a possible Democratic
presidential candidate, at present is vigorously advocating a bill in
the New York legislature to confer special privileges upon
homosexuals.  The fancied political advantage to be gained by pleasing
pathics will be overwhelmed by public opinion if ever Mr.  Cuomo
confronts President Bush or any other Republican nominee who does not
endeavor to reward sexual deviancy.  What a genius the Democrats this
past quarter-century have developed for misjudging public opinion!
<P>
      Republican Goal.  How is it, then, that nevertheless the
Democratic party holds a majority, most of the time, in both Senate
and House?  Why, in the election of Senators and Representatives, the
typical voter is ill informed about the views of the respective
candidates, and knows next to nothing of their voting records,
supposing them to be incumbents of the offices at stake.  The voter
tends to approve a candidate according to what the candidate claims to
have accomplished by way of securing benefits at federal expense for
his state or his congressional district, regardless of the chief
political issues of the hour.  Also the voter in many such elections
is powerfully influenced by name-recognition, so that Democratic
incumbents, long entrenched in office, are almost impossible to
dislodge in many districts and states.  In the long run, possession of
the executive branch of the federal government by Republicans will
work to erode the Democratic majority in both legislative houses.  But
to achieve that success, Republican presidential candidates might have
to forgo the goal of winning all fifty states for their personal
triumph, and instead spend money and time upon electing senators and
representatives.  Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, although
virtually certain to be elected by wide popular and electoral
majorities, somewhat neglected their duty of trying hard to bring in
Republican Congresses -- or at least their campaign managers failed
them in that respect.
<P>
      However that may be, time is not on the side of the Democratic
Party:  their leaders talk the language of yesteryear.  Mr.  Carter,
addressing the Democratic convention that had nominated him in 1976,
made promises and employed a rhetoric that would have gone down very
well in 1932 or 1936, but were absurdly archaic in the very different
era of the Bicentenary.  Nevertheless, Mr.  Carter won the election --
not because of what he said, but in spite of it.  His successors as
Democratic presidential candidates have behaved with equal absurdity
-- being their own worst enemies -- but did not enjoy the good fortune
to run against a Republican candidate who fancied that Poland was not
Soviet dominated.  Like the Bourbons, the Democrats since F.D.R.  have
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

<P>

      Time has been when the Democratic leaders were great men.  One
thinks of John C.  Calhoun, or Grover Cleveland.  It has been
otherwise since World War II.  An impartial observer -- from Mars, say
-- necessarily would regard with some misgiving a party headed by
Lyndon Johnson, whose infamy has been exposed by careful biographers;
or a party whose most conspicuous United States Senator nowadays is
the amorous and bibulous gentleman from Massachusetts.  Yet have there
not been Democratic leaders of recent decades who were veritable
Galahads or Percivals, you may inquire?  Why, there were some honest
and able men among those leaders; yet not, perhaps, precisely those
eminent Democrats whom the party panegyrists delight to honor.
<P>
      Take, for instance, the Honorable Hubert Humphrey, long United
States Senator from Minnesota, who since his death has been
politically canonized.  Once upon a time I debated Mr.  Humphrey
before a huge audience in Ann Arbor.  I found him an amiable man,
courteous, forthright when assailed by a band of student fidelistas in
the crowd; but excessively fond of the sound of his own voice, for
which indeed he apologized to me at the debate's end.  Yet Senator
Humphrey did not lead a career free of all stain and reproach.  I do
not refer to peccadillos of the sort committed by Mr.  Gary Hart: 
rather, I mean a conflict of interest of the gravest kind, in which
Humphrey put his own interest above the interest of the foreign policy
of the United States -- a case involving the security of the North
Atlantic Treaty allies.
<P>
      Primary Defeat.  What I am about to tell you never has been
published before, although some reference to it will appear in my
memoirs.  Let me preface my narration by reminding you, ladies and
gentlemen, of the hard-fought Democratic primary in West Virginia
during the year 1960.  Senator Kennedy was pitted against Senator
Humphrey; a vast amount of money was expended by both presidential
aspirants.  Eugene McCarthy, a Democrat as honest as he is
interesting, said to me once that this West Virginia primary was the
most corrupt episode in the political history of the United States. 
However that may be, Humphrey lost the primary, if somewhat narrowly;
therefore he lost his party's presidential nomination.  And he was
left forlorn with a great mass of West Virginia debts upon his
shoulders.
<P>
      So much for that, just now.  Our scene shifts from West Virginia
to Turkey; the events to be described occur three to four years after
Hubert Humphrey's defeat.  I am about to quote to you, verbatim, a
report made to me by a retired Foreign Service officer who at the time
of those events was assigned to duties in the Near East and the Middle
East.  I have known this former diplomat for a good many years and
have complete confidence in his veracity.
<P>
      "One of the kindest and most helpful men in the Senate," my
informant commences, "was Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota." 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
           He seemed sensitive to the national interest, willing
      to resist special interests of the financial or ethnic
      sort, and always ready to understand State's views, to
      advise, and to help when he could.  He even "condescended"
      to me socially in the grand old meaning of that word.
<P>
           In the mid-fifties, the legendary hero Ismet Inonu,
      successor to Kemal Ataturk, surprised the world by
      permitting a free and fair national election, and by giving
      up power peacefully when he lost to Adnan Menderes. 
      Menderes, with broad peasant support, won handily and
      installed his own regime in place of that of Inonu, who
      became leader of the Opposition.  Within a short time the
      Menderes government became the stage of typical Third World
      financial corruption, much of it involving rake-offs in
      alleged "development" contracts with foreign firms.  When
      Menderes began to deprive the Opposition of its political
      rights and even threatened the personal safety of Inonu,
      the armed forces, feeling that their role in society had
      been betrayed, threw out Menderes and his friends and
      reinstalled Inonu.
<P>
           Inonu, whose administration was reasonably honest by
      Turkish standards, had the backing of the Army in bringing
      to trial and punishment Turkish politicians and officials
      believed to have been among the worst of the grafters.  In
      one of many cases, several officials were punished for
      accepting large bribes from an American ("The Promoter")
      who had contracted to provide a complete small steel mill
      to Turkey.  It was shown in the trial that the "mill" was
      actually the old, rusted, and broken-down hardware from a
      plant on the southern U.S.  coast which had been closed as
      obsolete and sold by the owners to The Promoter for one or
      two million dollars; for the plant owners it was of value
      only as scrap.  The Turkish regime was no more than amused
      when The Promoter, who would have been arrested for fraud,
      bribery, and conspiracy if he had entered Turkey, formally
      asked the Turkish government for his final payment of ten
      million dollars under the contract.  He pointed out that
      the machinery in question had been delivered, even though
      it was just rusting on the docks in Turkey.  The Turkish
      government refused, noting that expert testimony in the
      trial had proved the machinery to be inoperable, worthless,
      and not as specified in the contract.  It suggested that if
      The Promoter wished to pursue his claim further, he follow
      the contract and file suit in a Turkish court, and that if
      he felt this clause was not binding, that he join the
      Turkish government in submitting the dispute to
      international commercial arbitration through established
      private institutions.  The Promoter refused to accept that
      he had not fulfilled his contract, refused to pursue the
      matter through either of the suggested channels, and again
      demanded early payment.  The Turks paid no further
      attention to him; they were convinced he would lose an
      arbitration and be assessed the costs of arbitration.

    <P>  
           The annual foreign-aid legislation then came before
      the Senate.  To our stupefied surprise, Senator Humphrey
      offered and pushed to adoption an amendment so worded as to
      apply only to The Promoter's claim, to the effect that no
      U.S.  military assistance would be provided to any country
      under the bill as long as claims by an American contractor
      for goods or services already provided had not been met in
      full.  It was further specified that the alleged quality of
      goods/services delivered could not affect the requirement,
      nor could any provisions of a contract providing for means
      of adjudicating or arbitrating the amount claimed.  This
      was called The Humphrey Amendment, and was an object of
      amusement or outrage at State and on Capitol Hill, but was
      never the subject of press inquiry, analysis, or interest. 
      The White House and State queried Humphrey's staff about
      the possibility of a compromise, but were told that if
      Senator Humphrey were to be kept on board the entire
      foreign-aid project, the Amendment must become law.  Our
      own bureau queried the staffs of Senators Fulbright and
      Mansfield to see if they couldn't make Humphrey back off or
      at least compromise.  One of Fulbright's top staffers told
      me that Humphrey, very uncharacteristically, refused to
      discuss the Amendment, except to say that it was a matter
      of principle to avoid the robbing of one of his
      constituents (The Promoter), and that he, the Senator,
      would not change a word of it.  Humphrey's prestige was
      such that he easily beat back the half-hearted move to
      reconsider the Amendment, and the Administration did not
      want to tangle with him over a measly ten million dollars.
<P>
           The bill became law with the Amendment.  Reluctantly
      we told the Turks that deliveries of new material as
      provided in the legislation and as planned by NATO could
      not be made until The Promoter was paid.  The Turks, who
      were as loyal as any ally we had, and Inonu, who had always
      co-operated with us fully, pointed out the effect on the
      Turkish armed forces of the delay of scheduled deliveries,
      and, conversely, the effect on Turkish public opinion as to
      both the U.S.  and Inonu government if the money were paid
      to The Promoter.  There was nothing we could do.  Finally
      Inonu had to ask his Parliament for ten million dollars in
      public funds to pay The Promoter before hundreds of
      millions of dollars worth of NATO materials could be
      delivered.  The Opposition pointed out with gusto the
      overwhelming proof advanced in earlier legal proceedings
      that the project was one of bribery and fraud from the
      beginning, and that the machinery was nothing but scrap. 
      Inonu swallowed the dishonor, got the money, paid The
      Promoter, and got the arms and ammunition.
<P>
           While the legislation was still before the Senate, we
      enlisted the help of a friendly office of the FBI, which had
      helped us in the past, to check The Promoter's background on
      this and earlier deals, in the hope of finding something which
      could be used to influence other Senators.  The world-weary FBI
      man, an old friend, who had conducted most of the search and
      directed it all, came in to tell me that The Promoter was quite
      shady and could be termed a boardroom confidence man, but that
      he had never been convicted -- only a couple of unpursued
      indictments in minor scandals.  As we talked I opined that The
      Promoter just couldn't by himself wield that much influence with
      the Senator -- that there must be a more weighty partner in the
      woodpile.  I asked him if he could, strictly on his own and to
      satisfy my personal curiosity, try to dig up such a partner. 
      The FBI man came in a week or two later, warned me that this
      meeting with me was not occurring, and informed me that there
      was a partner on halves with The Promoter who bought in for a
      pittance during the past year, and that the partner's name was
      the maiden name of Muriel Humphrey.
      <P>
           During the rest of my assignment at State we continued
      to receive the best possible co-operation from Senator
      Humphrey in all other matters, and his personal affability
      was undiminished.  On reflection, and considering the
      common gossip that Humphrey was tragically in debt
      following his primary collision with the Kennedy moneybags,
      I could not work up much indignation against the Senator
      personally.  I saved my indignation for the interface
      between foreign aid and the American political system, and
      slowly began to drift toward the conclusion that any good
      done by foreign aid was outweighed by the damage it caused
      here and abroad.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      At this point, my friend's narrative ceases.  Permit me to
comment that I have no animus against Hubert Humphrey.  I recount this
episode merely to suggest that even the more genuine of democratic
idols may be found to have feet of clay.  At least Senator Humphrey
needed the money in question.  During the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, probably the richest man in the Senate was the most
corrupt of senators:  Kerr of Oklahoma, whose devious enriching ways
are candidly described by his lieutenant, Bobby Baker, in the latter
scoundrel's memoirs.  To perceive how deep in peculation was President
Johnson himself, assisted by his agents Bobby Baker and Billy Sol
Estes, one may turn to the recent memoirs of a Republican of
integrity, Senator Carl Curtis, entitled Forty Years Against the Tide.
<P>
      Doubtless a number of persons present today have read Henry
Adams' novel Democracy.  In that book, an elderly diplomat from
Eastern Europe grows exasperated with a pompous American senator whose
character is suspect.  Baron Jacobi is referring to political
corruption about the year 1870:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           You Americans believe yourselves to be exempted from
      the operation of general laws.  You care not for
      experience.  I have lived seventy-five years, and all that
      time in the midst of corruption.  I am corrupt myself, only
      I do have the courage to proclaim it, and you others have
      it not.  Rome, Paris, Vienna, Petersburg, London, all are
      corrupt; only Washington is pure!  Well, I declare to you
      that in all my experiences I have found no society which
      has had elements of corruption like the United States.  The
      children in the street are corrupt, and know how to cheat
      me.  The citizens are all corrupt, and also the towns and
      the counties and the States' legislatures and the judges. 
      Everywhere men betray trusts both public and private, steal
      money, run away with public funds.  Only in the Senate men
      take no money.  And you gentlemen in the Senate very well
      declare that your great United States, which is the head of
      the civilized world, can never learn anything from the
      example of corrupt Europe.  You are right -- quite right! 
      The great United States needs not an example.  I do much
      regret that I have not yet one hundred years to live.  If I
      could then come back to this city, I should find myself
      very content -- much more than now.  I am always content
      where there is much corruption, and ma parole d'honneur!" 
      broke out the old man with fire and gesture, "The United
      States will then be more corrupt than Rome under Caligula;
      more corrupt than the Church under Leo X; more corrupt than
      France under the Regent!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Baron Jacobi's prophecy has come to pass, more than a century
later.  Everyone in this room is aware that two very eminent
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, last year found it
prudent to resign their seats rather than face expulsion.  Everyone
also knows of the several senators who betrayed their trust in
connection with the savings and loan disaster.  Everyone has read of,
if not experienced, the maladministration of demagogic mayors elected
on the Democratic ticket in certain great cities, Washington
especially.  Corruption is not confined to the Democratic party's
placemen, of course; but corruption seems to have become epidemic in
the Democratic Party during recent decades.
<P>
      Accepting bribes, pocketing public funds, and selling political
influence are not the worst forms of political corruption.  For more
malignant still is that professed political humanitarianism which is
merely a mask for a politician's lust for power and place.  Such
politicians, and they are legion in today's Democratic apparatus,
extemporize flimsy measures that will procure for them an evanescent
popularity.  Senator Carl Curtis tells of a conversation, some years
ago, with a senatorial colleague of this stamp.  That colleague had
been active in the passage of a fiscal bill that in the long run would
be immensely costly -- almost insupportable.  Curtis expostulated on
what would be the consequences thirty years in the future.  "But I
won't be in the Senate when that happens," said his colleague. 
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
<P>
      Grim Mistake. My point is this:  the greatest error of the
Democratic Party nowadays is dishonesty.  Here permit me to quote one
of my less-favorite authors, Voltaire:  "It was worse than a crime: 
it was a mistake."  When a Democratic Congress appropriates vast sums
for new federal undertakings, but reproaches the executive branch for
increasing the national debt, the Democrats are dishonest -- as they
are in other great concerns.  Such political hypocrisy is not a crime
for which public men may be indicted; but it is a grim mistake.  For
presently a party that so behaves will be recognized by the public as
a dishonest party, and then its days will be numbered.
<P>
      When Ronald Reagan was re-elected to the presidency by so
overwhelming a majority, I suggested in public addresses that
conceivably the Democratic Party might begin to split into factions
and to follow the Federalist Party and the Whig Party down to dusty
death.  That process may be at work, despite temporary Democratic
majorities in the Congress.  More than the Republicans, the Democrats
have become suspect to a great part of the American public.  They are
suspected of ignoring the national interest.
<P>
      This present decade, just begun, will be a time when the United
States of America must make irrevocable decisions, in affairs domestic
and affairs international.  We would be foolish to fancy that a pax
Americana will settle upon the world.  Rather, our situation is very
like that of Britain just two centuries ago.  As Burke wrote then:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> I despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public
      mind.  There is much to be done undoubtedly, and much to be
      retrieved.  We must walk in new ways, or we can never
      encounter our enemy in his devious march.  We are not at an
      end of our struggle, nor near it.  Let us not deceive
      ourselves; we are at the beginning of great troubles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Party Reform. Just so.  In our time of troubles, either great
political party requires high prudence, high imagination, high
honesty.  Surely the Bush Administration, which I criticized somewhat
mordantly in the course of my preceding Heritage lecture in this
series, ought to be the object of severe but honest scrutiny by the
opposing Democrats.  There are yet active in the Democratic ranks many
honorable men and women capable of working a party reform.  May they
come forward, for the sake of the Republic!
<P>
      After all, reform is within the power of honest members of the
party.  Here I quote Burke's Thoughts on the Present Discontents once
more:
<P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE> Until a confidence in government is re-established, the
      people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed
      attention to the conduct of their representatives. 
      Standards for judging more systematically upon their
      conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and
      corporations.  Frequent and correct lists of the voters in
      all important questions ought to be procured.
<P>
      By such means something may be done.  By such means it may
      appear who those are that, by an indiscriminate support of
      all administrations, have totally banished all integrity
      and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded
      the best men with the worst; and weakened and dissolved,
      instead of strengthening and compacting, the general frame
      of government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      From the precinct and the township upward, conceivably, the
Democratic Party may be chastened and reinvigorated.  Certain
Democratic office-holders need to be taught afresh the old lesson,
"Honesty is the best policy."  In a genuine parliamentary system, at
least two strong and principled parties are required.  A party
dominated by frauds and fantastics cannot long endure.  If the
Democrats fail at reform, some other party, the nature of which cannot
now be predicted, will supplant the Democratic Party.  That is what
happened to the Liberal party in Britain.  Democratic reform lacking,
the American public may be tempted to shout an old Republican partisan
cry:  "Rotten eggs and dead cats are good enough for Democrats!"

<h3> AN EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY FOR ELIMINATING NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME </h3>

By Carl F. Horowitz, Ph.D.<BR>
 Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 814<br>
March 25, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>




<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     A common and false allegation about urban life in America is that
conditions in poor neighborhoods "force" residents into a life of
crime. This view initially gained popularity after the urban rioting
of the 1960s, specifically in the report of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission
Report. 
<P>
While some criminologists hold that poor neighborhoods are
"breeding grounds" for crime, evidence shows these experts actually
reverse the real sequence of events. It is not that poverty in general
breeds crime; it is crime, especially violent crime, that exacerbates
poverty in neighborhoods. (See data in John J. DiLulio, Jr., "The
Impact of Inner-City Crime," The Public Interest, Number 96, Summer
1989, pp. 28-46.) Crime makes not only the victim, but also the
neighborhood poorer. Crime sets in motion a cycle of flight by law-
abiding citizens, and disinvestment in housing and business; this then
triggers further flight that devastates the poorest neighborhoods and
communities, dooming to failure even well-designed anti-poverty
efforts. 
<P>
     Ultimate Tax. Writes former Director of the National Institute of
Justice, James K. Stewart: "Crime is the ultimate tax on enterprise.
It must be reduced or eliminated before poor people can fully share in
the American dream." (James K. Stewart, "The Urban Strangler: How
Crime Causes Poverty in the Inner City," Policy Review, Number 37,
Summer 1986, p. 8.) Controlling crime is a precondition to improving
the lives of the urban poor because no neighborhood can grow
economically unless it is first safe. As sociologist Charles Murray,
Visiting Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, notes, the key
to reducing crime is to create an atmosphere of lawfulness. (Charles
Murray, "Crime in America," National Review, June 10, 1988, p. 35.)
Low-income neighborhoods explicitly should project the message to the
would-be criminal, whether a resident or not, that crime is not
tolerated, that moral principles are observed and enforced. 
<P>
     Government at all levels must launch an aggressive strategy to
create such an atmosphere if a national urban anti-poverty effort is
to succeed. This strategy especially should explore ways of involving
the law-abiding urban poor in anti-crime activities. In this
empowerment strategy, the poor themselves work with police and other
local officials to identify sources of potential crime and restrict
access of potential criminals to their neighborhoods and housing
projects. In particular:<ul>
<P>
<li> Local governments should help neighborhood groups form anti-crime
     patrols, stimulate interest among residents in joining existing
     patrols, and hire private guards to augment the activities of
     local police forces. Public housing projects as well as more
     traditional neighborhoods should be the focus of such efforts.
<P><li>
     State legislatures should require stricter sentencing for repeat
     offenders and for all offenders convicted of using firearms in
     committing a burglary or robbery.
<P><li>
     The federal government should beef up the efforts of cabinet-
     level agencies, particularly the Department of Justice and the
     Department of Housing and Urban Development, to stem violent
     crime and drug dealing in housing projects. 
<P><li>
     Congress should make real the threat to stop funding the Legal
     Services Corporation if this agency continues to defend the
     "civil rights" of drug dealers facing eviction from public
     housing. 
<P><li>
     Most important by far, the President and the rest of the federal
     government should emphasize to the American public and
     particularly to the minority community that crime is less the
     outcome of poverty than its cause, and that until strenuous and
     innovative efforts are taken to defeat crime in the inner city
     anti-poverty programs cannot succeed.</ul>
<P>

<B> CRIME AND THE LOW-INCOME URBAN POOR: THE HIDDEN COSTS</B>
<P>
     Crime is increasing rapidly in America's cities. By November of
last year, eight of the twenty largest cities already had set new
records for homicides in a single year. (These and all other
statistics on crime incidence, unless otherwise noted, are derived
from local police departments and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, released semi-annually and
annually. The data reflect only those crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies, not necessarily the total crimes committed. The
crimes are separated into violent crimes (murder, forcible rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson).) By year's end, New
York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston easily had broken
records set in 1989. The more than 2,200 people murdered in New York
City alone represented a more than 10 percent increase over the 1989
figure. In Washington, D.C., the 434 murders in 1989 and 483 murders
in 1990 amounted to one murder for about every 1,400 residents. 
<P>
     Horror stories abound. In Detroit, an annual pre-Halloween arson
rampage, customarily known as "Devil's Night," torched hundreds of
buildings this October 29th through 31st, despite maximum precautions
taken by local officials. ("Halloween Fires, Arrests Rose in Detroit,"
Washington Times, November 5, 1990.) Remarked one resident living next
to a home that burned two years ago, "I'm afraid. It's like you're a
prisoner in your own house. I wouldn't go out." ("Detroit Pulls Out
All Stops to Foil Arson on Devil's Night," Washington Times, October
31, 1990.) 
<P>
     Most obvious, of course, are the immediate costs of crime; the
victim's injuries or loss of some wealth. The poor usually suffer most
not just because they have little wealth to lose but also because they
live in neighborhoods where crimes are common. Less obvious but often
more important, are the indirect costs of crime, affecting not only
the person robbed but anybody living in the same neighborhood. These
indirect costs are of two types: crime that creates poverty among the
innocent, whether or not they have been actual crime victims, and
crime that creates poverty among criminals. 
<P>

<B> How The Innocent Pay</B>
<P>
     Fear of crime forces innocent people into forms of behavior that
would be unnecessary in a crime-free environment. The fear of being
beaten, robbed, or murdered can make it impossible for residents of a
crime-infested neighborhood to become productive employees or business
owners. Writes the National Institute of Justice's Stewart: "The
traditional means by which poor people have advanced themselves --
overtime, moonlighting, education to improve future opportunities --
can be easily obstructed by crime and fear. Why risk a late job or
night school if the return home means waiting at deserted bus stops
and walking past crowds of threatening teenagers?" (Stewart, "The
Urban Strangler," p. 6.)
<P>
     Perhaps nothing illustrates the fear gripping so many of today's
low-income urban neighborhoods than the construction by the City of
Los Angeles of a concrete wall around one of its junior high schools
to keep stray bullets from hitting children on the playground. (James
Q. Wilson and John J. DiLulio, Jr., "Crackdown," New Republic, July
10, 1989, p. 21.) 
<P>
     Depressing Property Values. Fear of criminals depresses the
willingness of families to move into and stay in neighborhoods. This
then depresses property values. If potential buyers of property,
whether occupied or vacant, believe that it is in a high-crime
neighborhood, they offer a lower price for the property than they
would have in the absence of crime. (For evidence that crime hurts
property values, see Wesley G. Skogan, Disorder and Decline: Crime and
the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods (New York: Free Press,
1990), pp. 65-84. See also R. P. Taub, Paths of Neighborhood Change:
Race and Crime in Urban America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1984).) 
<P>
     This has a devastating effect on the poor. If they are homeowners
-- many poor own their own homes (Thirty-eight percent of America's
below-poverty-line households own their own homes, and 58 percent of
these are non-elderly. See Robert Rector, Kate Walsh O'Beirne, and
Michael McLaughlin, "How 'Poor' Are America's Poor?" Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 791, September 21, 1990, p. 9.) -- their
principal asset is devalued. This is the equivalent of criminals
robbing a family's savings account. If residents are apartment owners,
they may be unable to find any buyers when they wish to sell, and they
have difficulty finding responsible renters. This in turn discourages
the landlord from spending money on maintenance, which in turn
triggers the cycle of crime and further decay.
<P>
     Housing Stock Deteriorates. Even those owners who want to improve
their property are deterred by crime. Since crime reduces property
values, homeowners and apartment owners alike may find it very
difficult to obtain credit for purchase or improvement loans. The
result: The housing stock deteriorates despite intentions of owners.
Much of the "redlining" allegedly practiced by mortgage lenders (a
practice by which lenders designate certain neighborhoods as too risky
for loans) actually is a rational response to fears that falling real
property values will impose a huge loss on the lenders in the event of
default. For this reason even creditworthy borrowers in such
neighborhoods are denied the capital to improve their properties.
Explains a resident of a heavily vandalized Chicago neighborhood: "If
you tell a bank that it is the Wicker Park area you want to buy into,
they'll refuse you credit." (Skogan, Disorder and Decline, p. 79.)
<P>
     Enormous Burdens. The resulting property deterioration and
subsequent abandonment is documented in every urban neighborhood in
America where criminals reign. It is especially true in public
housing. In Chicago, for example, over 5,000 publicly-owned dwellings
stand vacant, most as a result of vandalism and youth gang violence.
(John McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?" Newsweek, January, 2,
1989, pp. 24-26.) In New Orleans' decaying Desire housing project,
sixteen residents were slain in just the first nine months of 1990.
(Guy Gugliotta and Michael Isikoff, "Violence in the '90s: Drugs'
Deadly Residue," Washington Post, October 14, 1990.)
<P>
     Tallied among crime's costs too are the higher taxes paid by all
of a city's residents, including those in high-crime neighborhoods,
because of the heavy cost of police protection and running courts,
jails, and prisons. Violent crime also imposes enormous burdens on the
health and social service systems. 
<P>
     In cities of more than 500,000 people, police, fire protection,
and social service portions of municipal budgets not only rose rapidly
during the 1980s, they did so at rates well exceeding the overall
municipal budgets. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, City Government
Finances, Series GF, No. 4 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office), annually.) In Washington, D.C., during 1982-1987, for
example, expenditures for these three combined areas rose by 66.2
percent, compared with the increase for the entire local budget of
43.3 percent. 
<P>
     Crime-Expenditure Linkage. Yet when local governments respond to
the costs of crime by raising taxes or fees, they risk driving out
law-abiding residents and businesses. Cities faced with high crime
rates typically face heavy tax burdens. An analysis of crime and taxes
over a 30-year period by Northwestern University political scientist
Herbert Jacob reveals just how close the crime-expenditure linkage is.
While all cities in a ten-city survey showed large increases in police
expenditures, by far the ones with the largest increases were the ones
with the highest increases in crime rates. (Herbert Jacob, "Policy
Responses to Crime," in Paul Peterson, ed., The New Urban Reality
(Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1985), pp. 225-52.)
<P>
     Another cost of crime is that employers are reluctant to expand
or relocate in high-crime neighborhoods even if given economic
development incentives. When an office, store, or factory is said to
be in a dangerous neighborhood, employers have difficulties finding
and retaining a work force. The evidence on business location
decisions shows that fear of crime strongly encourages employers to
avoid establishing facilities in poor neighborhoods or to relocate
existing facilities to safer neighborhoods or jurisdictions. (Stewart,
"The Urban Strangler," p. 7; DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City
Crime.") If the firm compensates for the fears of employees by
offering higher wages and salaries, its labor costs rise, hence making
it less competitive with firms outside such areas. 
<P>
     Losing Neighborhood Businesses. Local residents, fearing crime,
are unwilling to patronize neighborhood businesses during evening
hours. Business owners may be willing to bear the risk of crime in
order to attract evening customers, but if residents are too
frightened to shop, many of the businesses will not survive. As a
result, many inner city residents no longer enjoy the convenience of
having neighborhood stores. A lengthy trip thus may be required for
groceries, clothing, and other household goods. 
<P>
     New small businesses in high-crime areas often cannot obtain
property insurance or small business loans except at high rates -- if
at all. Small business in New York City alone loses about $1 billion a
year from arson, shoplifting, burglary, robbery, and other crimes.
(Cited in George F. Will, "Giuliani: He's No Fiorello," Washington
Post, October 26, 1989.) Such crimes can be calamities for inner city
businesses. The recent default by investors in a commercial mall in a
high-crime area in the Northeast section of Washington, D.C.,
underscores how retail activity housed in a new, attractive complex,
even with substantial pre-opening publicity, may not be able to
survive.
<P>
     When fear of crime drives out or cuts back the hours of
neighborhood enterprises, employment opportunities shrink. This is
especially harmful to teenagers seeking their first jobs. If they are
to enjoy productive lives as adults, avoiding the welfare dependency
trap, they must develop marketable skills before they enter adulthood.
<P>
     Fear in Schools. Urban schools deteriorate. According to Karl
Zinsmeister, crime and education expert at the American Enterprise
Institute, each year about 3 million crimes are attempted or completed
inside schools or on school grounds. (Karl Zinsmeister, "Growing Up
Scared," Atlantic, June 1990, p. 61. All the educational data here
come from this article.) Assaults alone constitute about 10 percent of
these offenses. The response to the climate of fear by some children
is to avoid school altogether. A significant portion of today's
truancy problem, observes Zinsmeister, results from a child's fear of
being terrorized. He notes that about 8 percent of all urban junior
and senior high school students miss at least one day of classes each
month because they fear physical assault by other students. It is not
simply students who are fearful. According to Zinsmeister, about one
in five teachers are assaulted on the job each year, with 12 percent
hesitant to confront the guilty party for fear of reprisal. Not
surprisingly, talented and ambitious teachers will avoid transfers to
crime-ridden schools, reducing the ability of the school to provide a
good education.
<P>
<B> How Even Criminals Eventually Pay</B>
<P>
     When a criminal robs a business owner or pedestrian of cash, or
receives hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a single drug deal,
naturally he feels this beats what he may see as a low-paying "dead
end" job. As Robert J. DeFauw, former Director of the Detroit office
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), noted in 1984: "Our
major problem is, how are we going to reach these kids? I mean, do you
tell them to work at J.L. Hudson's for $45 a week when they're making
$2,000 a week selling drugs on the street? They'll just laugh at you."
(Howard Blum, "U.S. Helps Detroit to Attack Drug Rings," New York
Times, January 28, 1984.) His words remain applicable today.
<P>
     Despite what appear to be financial advantages for the criminal,
the evidence shows that he or she, too, ultimately becomes a victim.
This is true for several reasons.
<P>
     First, an inner city criminal career often leads to serious
injury or death. In Washington, D.C., for example, police estimate
that over half of the murders in their jurisdiction during 1985-1988
involved a dispute between drug dealers. (U.S. News and World-Report,
"Dead Zones," Special Report, April 10, 1989, p. 25.) 
<P>
     Second, while an individual crime results in incarceration less
than 2 percent of the time, (U.S. Department of Justice, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Crime in the United States (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office), annually.) a teenage criminal faces
strong odds of eventually being arrested and convicted if he maintains
his activity into his 20s. This is because street crime requires
almost daily activity to be profitable. It takes several felonies each
week just to rob the equivalent of what could be earned honestly at a
modest job. (Samuel Walker, Sense and Nonsense About Crime: A Policy
Guide, 2nd ed. (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1989), p. 258.) The
odds catch up with many. Over 3.5 million American adults are on
parole or on probation in addition to the 700,000 currently in state
or federal prisons. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, Probation and Parole 1987, Bulletin NCJ-113948, and
Probation and Parole 1988, Bulletin NCJ-113948, reprinted in U.S.
Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics -- 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department
of Justice, 1990), p. 556.) 
<P>
     Aside from the loss of potential income while in prison, an adult
with a criminal record once released finds himself unemployable in
many jobs. According to a Justice Department study, some 40 percent of
ex-prisoners who have been free for under one year make less than $500
monthly. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, Special Report NCJ-109926
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, January 1988), p. 3.)
With the range of legitimate employment choices diminished, the
temptation to return to the streets is greater. Over 60 percent of
criminals released from prison are rearrested for another offense
within three years, and most of them are convicted. (U.S. Department
of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners
Released in 1983, Special Report NCJ-116261 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Department of Justice, April 1989), p. 5.) According to Washington,
D.C., Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, it is common for the same person,
once out of prison, to be arrested eight or nine times in the same
neighborhood within weeks. (DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime,"
p. 40.) 
<P>
     Third, a criminal's frequent refusal to finish high school
severely reduces lifetime earning capacity. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Recidivism of Prisoners, p. 5. According to this study, 67.3
percent of all sampled released adult prisoners had less than a high
school degree. In fact, close to 20 percent had no education beyond
the 8th grade.) Recent studies show that the decision to drop out of
high school reduces the individual's income over the long run, and
increases the likelihood of unemployment. (Michael McLaughlin, "High
School Dropouts: How Much of a Crisis?" Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 781, August 3, 1990, pp. 8-9; Wayne J. Howe, "Do
Education and Demographics Affect Unemployment Rates?" Monthly Labor
Review, Vol. 111, No. 1, January 1988, pp. 3-9; James P. Markey, "The
Labor Problems of Today's High School Dropouts," Monthly Labor Review,
Vol. 111, No. 6, June 1988, pp. 36-43.) About one in six high school
dropouts are unemployed, a rate roughly triple to that of the general
labor force. (Markey, "The Labor Problems of Today's High School
Dropouts," p. 36.) 
<P>
     The lack of education and the decision to pursue a criminal
career reinforce each other. Just as poor performance in school makes
a life of crime more attractive, a young criminal's initially
successful forays into crime induce him to believe that education
"isn't worth it." This is especially true among minors, because even
if convicted of an offense, they rarely get more punishment than a
warning. Typically, they conclude that crime does pay. (For recent
evidence, see "Kids and Crime," Special Report, Insight, July 30,
1990, pp. 9-13.) 
<P>
     Fourth, criminals are less likely than others to develop the
personality and values necessary for entering into and sustaining a
marriage. They tend to marry less -- fewer than half of the adult
inmates in state prisons ever have been married. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, p. 3.) A stable
marriage not only has the capacity to induce a man to be gainfully
employed, it also steers him away from crime. (See Marvin E. Wolfgang,
Terence P. Thornberry, and Robert M. Figlio, From Boy to Man, from
Delinquency to Crime (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp.
138-43. The authors found that while marriage significantly reduces a
man's willingness to lead a life of crime, merely cohabitating with a
woman and/or fathering her child do not.) If during a marriage, a man
remains a criminal, or reverts to being one, the odds are substantial
that his wife will leave him. With this realization, a man who values
a marriage avoids crime. Equally important, his children are less
likely to become criminals if he stays with his wife. (The evidence is
persuasive that children and teenagers are less likely to grow up with
problems of mental illness, violence, drug use, and poor school
performance when both parents are present in the home. For a review of
recent studies, see Nicholas Davidson, "Life Without Father: America's
Greatest Social Catastrophe," Policy Review, Number 51, Winter 1990,
pp. 40-44.)
<P>

<B> HOW TO REDUCE NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME</B>
<P>
     There is a growing realization that the best strategies for
fighting crime in residential neighborhoods are those where the police
work closely with resident organizations. Such community-based
strategies require residents to believe that others in their
neighborhood are committed to a crime-free environment. Then they will
be more willing to take part in public or private anti-crime programs,
and be mobilized by police forces. "Community-oriented policing," as
this is known, attempts to prevent crimes rather than investigate them
after the fact. As crime experts James Q. Wilson, Collins Professor of
Management at UCLA, and George Kelling, Fellow at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Community-oriented policing means changing the daily work of
     the police to include investigating problems as well as
     incidents. It means defining as a problem whatever a
     significant body of public opinion regards as a threat to
     community order. It means working with the good guys, and
     not just against the bad guys. (James Q. Wilson and George
     L. Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," Atlantic, February
     1989, p. 49.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Community groups and police forces now have a considerable body
of experience drawn from successful experiments in community-oriented
policing. This evidence suggests that several tactics are key to a
successful approach, and that government policies can help in a number
of ways. Among these:
<P>
1) Create more police foot patrols. 
<P>
     The evidence indicates that deploying more foot patrol police
officers in a high-crime neighborhood can make substantial headway
against crime. Charleston, South Carolina, is a case in point. (Edwin
Meese III and Bob Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," Policy Review,
Number 54, Fall 1990, pp. 26-27; Suzanne Fields, "Safer with Fleetfeet
on the Beat," Washington Times, November 8, 1990.) When Reuben
Greenberg in 1982 took over as Police Chief of that city of 80,000, he
inherited one of the nation's most crime-ridden cities for its size.
One of his first steps to tackle the problem was to create an elite
unit of foot patrolmen. Friendly and cooperative with neighbors, yet
tough and agile enough to chase and catch a fleeing suspect, these
patrolmen have deterred criminals, especially drug dealers, from
preying on poor neighborhoods.
<P>
     Under Greenberg, crime in Charleston has fallen 42 percent. So
successful is his strategy viewed that he was invited early last year
by Mobile, Alabama, with a population of 200,000, to design a similar
program for that city. Five months after Mobile adopted the Greenberg
plan, Mobile's serious crime fell by 18 percent. (Ed Foster-Simeon, "A
Matter of Taking Back City Streets," Washington Times, November 6,
1990.)
<P>
     Results from other cities are also encouraging. In Flint,
Michigan, a city of nearly 150,000, foot patrol officers since 1979
have been trained to refer citizens to social service agencies when
the police detect domestic problems or alcohol and drug abuse. The
idea is to prevent residents with such problems from falling into a
pattern of crime. In the fourteen experimental areas established by
the Flint police as high-crime districts, crime rates declined an
average of 8 percent in the first three years of the program; by
contrast, rates rose 10 percent in areas without the program. (Meese
and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp. 23-24.) In Los Angeles, a
foot patrol program, Secured Areas Footbeat Enforcement (SAFE), begun
last year but now discontinued due to budget cuts, was popular in
several of that city's poorer neighborhoods.

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Foot patrol programs have proven to be a successful method of
deterring street crime. The U.S. Justice Department and state justice
departments should consider making law enforcement assistance to
localities contingent upon local government at least exploring the
merits of a police or private guard foot patrol program. 
<P>
2) Create citizen patrols. 
<P>
     Unarmed community volunteers, working together and with the local
police force also seem able to deter street crime. Like police foot
patrols, their presence itself warns drug dealers and other criminals
that the neighborhood has been put "off-limits."
<P>
     A good example is in Washington, D.C., where more than 130
neighborhood crime watch groups involve about 6,000 residents. In
several neighborhoods, residents armed with video cameras and walkie-
talkies film drug transactions and write down license plate numbers,
later relaying the information to the police. The aim is to target
drug customers rather than dealers, and thus to reduce the demand for
drugs. Their effort has closed dozens of crack houses and reduced
open-air drug dealing. Other Washington neighborhoods have expressed
enthusiasm for similar groups.          
<P>
     Establishing community patrols makes residents appreciate their
own power to change the neighborhood. Explains Jim Foreman,
coordinator of the Metro Orange Coalition, the umbrella organization
for local crime watch groups in Washington, "Usually when you go out
to see a group, they are afraid about what is on the street. Once you
get them there, they see the power of togetherness, what they can do."
(Mark Vane, "Community Patrols Help in Drug War," Washington Times,
November 26, 1990.)
<P>
     The Guardian Angels pioneered such neighborhood patrols. The
organization first gained national attention a decade ago for their
efforts in fighting crime in New York City's subways. No volunteer
organization has done more to make America's streets less dangerous.
With dozens of active chapters, the Guardian Angels are scrupulous
about maintaining good relations with local police. They enter a
community only at the invitation of residents. They have substantially
reduced crime in a number of Washington, D.C.-area apartment
complexes. ("Apartment Security Is Heaven-Sent," Insight, June 4,
1990, pp. 20-22.) The Angels have worked hard at building a reservoir
of good will among public officials. Francis Keating, General Counsel
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
acknowledges that they are a key element in HUD's Drug Elimination
Program, which makes available grants to housing authorities to assist
in the elimination of drug-related crime in public housing projects.
(Ibid., p. 22.)
<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Governments should seek ways to establish citizen crime patrol
programs in low-income neighborhoods. The bureaucratic obstacles to
such arrangements have been overcome where neighborhood groups and
police work closely. HUD, for example, works with housing authorities
around the country in providing technical assistance to tenant anti-
crime patrols. In Baltimore, for instance, elderly residents in the
city's public housing projects, with walkie-talkies, report to local
police suspicious and illegal behavior they see. 
<P>
     Localities should encourage low-income resident associations to
take the lead in establishing patrols. Beside patrolling, these
patrols could provide literature to neighborhood residents to
encourage them to leave on their lights at night, trim their shrubs
and bushes for greater visibility, and arrange for the Post Office not
to deliver mail when they are out of town. These groups also could
give city building inspection and police departments information on
vacant dwellings, especially those that may function as drug houses.
<P>
3) Make public housing safe. 
<P>
     Crime rates in public housing projects tend to exceed the city
average. Thus, while Chicago's serious crime rate already is almost
quadruple the national average, the rate in three of its most
notorious projects -- Cabrini-Green, Stateway Gardens, and Rockwell
Gardens -- ranges from double to quadruple even that of the whole
city. (McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?") 
<P>
     In the late-1980s, federal and local agencies began taking
decisive action to tackle public housing project crime. HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp was prompted to do so after the March 1989 murder of an
Alexandria, Virginia, police officer who tackled a crack dealer
holding a tenant hostage in a public housing project. It subsequently
was learned that other project residents knew that the apartment long
had been used for drug dealing and had complained to housing
officials. Complex eviction procedures, however, had made it
impossible to remove the drug-dealing tenants. Under this procedure,
it normally took one to two years to evict someone from public
housing. Since the Alexandria murder, HUD has waived these eviction
requirements for close to 40 states and the District of Columbia.
(James P. Moran, Jr., "High Noon in Alexandria: How We Ran the Crack
Dealers Out of Public Housing," Policy Review, Number 53, Summer 1990,
pp. 78-81.)
<P>
     A police response to public housing tenant requests for better
protection can reduce crime. When the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA)
in late 1988 asked police to raid suspected gang hideouts and crack
dens in one of the Rockwell Gardens buildings, violence dropped
dramatically, and residents no longer felt they had to sleep in
closets and bathtubs for safety from flying bullets. (McCormick, "Can
Chicago Beat the Odds?" pp. 24-25. For an excellent full treatment of
reforms recently undertaken in Chicago's public housing program, see
Andrew Cooper, Enabling the Underclass: Vince Lane's Campaign to
Restore Rights and Responsibilities in Chicago's Public Housing,
Public Entrepreneurship Series, No. 2 (Washington, D.C.: Progressive
Policy Institute, December 1990).) CHA Director Vincent Lane vows to
make every project free of gangs and drugs. Similar results were
reported in a get-tough program started by Omaha's Housing Authority.
(Robert L. Armstrong, "Something Upbeat Is Going On in Omaha's Public
Housing," Governing, December 1990, pp. 36-41.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Public housing authorities should establish comprehensive
programs to combat crime and drug abuse in public housing. These
programs should include better screening of prospective tenants;
neighborhood foot patrols; information-sharing with police and housing
authorities on criminals, suspected drug activity, and vacant
apartments; and tenant drug education and referral outreach services. 
<P>
     In each program, tenant involvement is critical. Without it, the
fear established by drug dealers and other criminals will not be
removed. The housing authorities of Orlando, Florida, and Savannah,
Georgia, have taken major steps in this direction. In both cities,
police act as community organizers working closely with tenants.
Officers take children on field trips and to ball games, introducing
them to a world of non-criminal activities. As a result of this, drug
activity in projects of both cities, especially Savannah, has been
greatly reduced. ("Orlando, Savannah Report Success in Fighting Drug
Problem," Housing and Development Reporter, January 21, 1991, p. 790.)
<P>
     With the enactment last fall by Congress of the HOPE
(Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere) program, the
federal government now can play an important role in reducing public
housing crime. HOPE provides funding to tenant organizations to manage
or own their housing projects, and puts housing authorities in a
better position to eliminate public housing decay. When law-abiding
tenants have responsibilities in running their projects, they will be
apt to take action against the criminal element. HUD should further
streamline its eviction procedure for all states in response to
widespread tenant complaints. Because drug dealing is often a family
activity, the new procedure, where based on good evidence, should
allow for the eviction of the family.
<P>
     Misguided Defenders. The primary obstacles to ridding projects of
criminals, especially drug dealers, are the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), and the federally-funded Legal Services Corporation, and
the backing these groups receive from their allies in Congress. These
organizations consistently have opposed eviction and other crime
prevention measures in public housing on the grounds that they violate
the civil rights of low-income persons. That most tenants in housing
projects are both poor and law-abiding, and that they plead for such
action, apparently is of little concern to these radical legal
organizations. Congress should consider eliminating support of the
Legal Services Corporation if it continues to use any money for
defending drug dealers. 
<P>
4) Hire quality private security guards. 
<P>
     When security guards work closely with residents and police, they
can be a valuable tool in reducing crime in low-income neighborhoods.
Between 1975 and 1988, the number of private security guards increased
from 400,000 to 1.4 million nationwide. By contrast, the number of
full-time public police officers rose from 400,000 to just 600,000
during this period. (Richard Neely, "Law and Order -- Do It Yourself,"
Washington Post, October 21, 1990.) 
<P>
     Private security guards normally are not as well-trained as
policemen, and usually carry no firearms. Yet they can be an effective
and comparatively inexpensive addition to police forces if both
cooperate and communicate closely. According to Richard Neely, Chief
Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and a recognized
crime expert, it costs far more to put a uniformed police officer than
a private guard on the street. (Ibid.) This is because guards are
hired to prevent crimes rather than investigate them. The average
police officer spends about two percent of his or her time actively
patrolling, with the bulk of time devoted to such activities as
responding to calls, doing paperwork, and testifying in court. Private
guards devote about 90 percent of their time to patrolling and crime
prevention.
<P>
     The use of private guards, paid and volunteer, has cut crime in
housing projects in the nation, particularly in Starrett City, a
moderate-income high-rise apartment development in New York City, and
in drug-infested Mayfair Mansions, a Washington, D.C. public housing
complex whose tenants for years had been calling upon the housing
authority to take action. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local government and housing authorities can hire private
security guards from among residents of low-income neighborhoods and
housing projects themselves. Training such persons to be guards, who
work closely with police, would announce clearly that a neighborhood
will be thoroughly patrolled, even if not by police. It also would
provide primary or secondary employment for these residents. HUD
allows payment for such guards from federal Drug Elimination Act funds
and the public housing operating budget. 
<P>
5) Clean up neighborhoods. 
<P>
     The worse a neighborhood looks, the more crime it tends to
suffer. According to UCLA's Wilson and Harvard's Kelling, broken
glass, uncollected trash, abandoned cars, graffiti, vagrants, and
prostitutes proclaim to criminal and resident alike that a community
cares little about what happens in its streets. (James Q. Wilson and
George L. Kelling, "Broken Windows," Atlantic, March 1982, pp. 29-38;
see also Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe.") This is an
open invitation to criminals and helps drive away those who otherwise
might live or open businesses there. This is confirmed statistically
by recent research, especially by the Director of Northwestern
University's Program in Law and the Social Sciences, Wesley G. Skogan.
(Skogan, Disorder and Decline. See also Daniel Lewis and Greta Salem,
Fear of Crime: Incivility and the Production of a Social Problem (New
Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1986); D.J. Kenny, Crime, Fear,
and the New York City Subways (New York: Praeger, 1987).) 
<P>
     The reverse also is true. When residents take the simple step of
cleaning their neighborhood, it tells criminals that the residents
care about their community and thus are more likely to report criminal
behavior. Where conscientiously applied, a clean-up strategy cuts
crime. Example: The New Briarfield Apartments in Newport News,
Virginia, suffered a massive increase in crime during the mid-1980s,
terrorizing its low-income residents, and driving many away. Nearly
one-fourth of the apartments were being burglarized at least once a
year. In an attempt to take control of the neighborhood away from the
criminals, the police in 1984 began to work with other municipal
agencies and with tenants in launching a campaign to clean up trash,
fill potholes, haul away abandoned cars, and sweep the streets. The
result was a 35 percent decline in burglaries within three years.
(Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," pp. 46-47.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local governments should sponsor frequent community clean-up days
in high-crime neighborhoods. Working with resident organizations,
state and local governments can be more diligent about towing away
abandoned vehicles. New York City is now aggressively removing
graffiti from public buildings and subway cars and stations; other
cities with graffiti problems should follow New York's lead. Graffiti
vandals, especially gang members who typically use graffiti to mark
turf, should be dealt with harshly by the courts and sentenced to
perform community service in addition to serving a jail term.
<P>
     One obstacle to a clean-up program is the unwillingness of local
bureaucracies to encroach upon each others' territories. To avoid
this, separate inter-agency task forces should be created, with
employees from various agencies consulting with neighborhood residents
in developing strategies in their own agency's programs. (Ibid., p.
52.) 
<P>
     Additionally, local governments should privatize sanitation,
street cleaning, public housing management, and certain other
services. Through privatization, these services would be provided more
efficiently, and at lower cost. As a result, fewer "broken windows"
would be visible to the criminal.
<P>
6) Create physical barriers to crime. 
<P>
     An increasingly common technique of community policing is
limiting access to a neighborhood. In many cases, the police, with the
cooperation of resident leaders, erect barricades and guard posts at
street intersections. Well-known is the Los Angeles Police
Department's "Operation Cul-de-Sac." (See discussions of the program
in Eloise Salholz, "The 'Walled Cities' of L.A.," Newsweek, May 14,
1990, pp. 24-25; Meese and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp.
27-28.) When a crack cocaine epidemic hit the south Los Angeles
neighborhood of Newton in the late-1980s, gang members terrorized the
neighborhood. Of the 873 murders in Los Angeles in 1989, 100 were in
Newton. 
<P>
     Working with residents, police created a "Narcotics Enforcement
Area" in February 1990. Police limited access to the community by
constructing entry gates at street entrances and exits. They also
interrogated suspicious persons where there was a legal basis to do
so. As a psychological barrier, the police put up the sign, "OPEN TO
RESIDENTS ONLY" at each gate. The program enjoyed the strong support
of the residents, many of whom had been too terrified to leave their
homes after dusk. Within six weeks, violent crime in Newton had fallen
by 90 percent; attendance at the nearby 2,600-student Jefferson High
School had risen by 150 to 200 students a day; and residents
rededicated a park that previously had been controlled by gangs. Then
the barricades were removed -- and crime, including several drive-by
shootings -- returned. The police brought back the barricades. Los
Angeles police also instituted street barricade programs in the
Sepulveda area of the San Fernando Valley. Within months, crime had
been cut by about one-third. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Through close links with community leaders, local governments can
adopt the tactics of Operation Cul-de-Sac to limit access to some
neighborhoods. This of course needs broad neighborhood support, lest
the operation harass and thus anger law-abiding persons living in,
visiting, or passing through these neighborhoods. Police departments,
with the help of neighborhood groups, should identify where the crime
problems are, and then cordon off the key intersections and provide
residents with opportunities to report suspicious-looking behavior. 
<P>
     One possibility is privatization of streets. St. Louis, for
example, since the 19th century has had America's most extensive
system of privately-owned and maintained residential streets. Though
originally seen as a way of avoiding the city's taxing and spending
limitations, one of its side effects has been crime prevention. (Oscar
Newman, Community of Interest, (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1981),
pp. 124-56.) 
<P>
7) Steer children away from crime. 
<P>
     The evidence shows that reaching troubled children during their
pre-adolescent years has the greatest effect on deterring them from
becoming adult criminals. (Wolfgang, Thornberry, and Figlio, From Boy
to Man.) Instilling values of respect for property, hard work, and
respect for the nuclear family reduces criminal behavior. By contrast,
children who become criminals often have suffered parental abuse or
neglect. (According to the director of a Boston-area settlement house,
the incidence of child abuse in underclass families -- black and white
-- is "nearly 100 percent." See Morton Kondracke, "The Two Black
Americas," New Republic, February 6, 1989, p. 19.) 
<P>
     Several police forces well understand the importance of
preventing crime by exposing children to its futility. "We absolutely
have to target the real young kids," states Philadelphia Police
Commissioner Willie Williams, adding that police and community leaders
must "completely educate them about drugs, sex and how to protect
themselves from family members leading them to drugs." (Quoted in Tom
Morganthau, "Children of the Underclass," Newsweek, September 11,
1989, p. 24.) The Los Angeles Police Department's sponsors several
youth intervention programs, such as the Jeopardy Program, in which
officers visit the parents of youth involved with gangs, and DARE
(Drug Abuse Resistance Education), in which officers come into school
classes, and lecture students about the dangers of drug abuse.
Similarly, New York City has launched a program, "Cops and Kids,"
aimed at keeping children in school, improving reading skills,
preventing drug addiction, and creating after-school jobs and sports
programs, among other activities. (Felicia R. Lee, "Havens for Youths
in Anti-Crime Plan," New York Times, October 11, 1990.) These police-
sponsored programs are models for other cities. 
<P>
     Community groups and private institutions have established
similar programs. In Washington, D.C.'s Kenilworth-Parkside Gardens, a
former public housing project now owned by its tenants, the managers
sponsor a program that teaches youths how to develop business skills
that will keep them out of trouble. Children also are employed in
project-sponsored businesses to bake, package, and sell cookies.
Working on commission, many youngsters earn up to $45 a day. (See
DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime," p. 45.) Also, D.C. police
are sponsoring nighttime basketball games to get teenagers off the
streets during hours in which they might be tempted by crime, and
involve them in recreation that tests their strength and athletic
skills. Working with the D.C. local government, the National
Basketball Players' Association, Anheuser-Busch Companies,
Incorporated, and The Coca-Cola Company are acting as co-sponsors of
this "Late Night Hoops" program. (Ruben Castaneda, "'Hoops' Offers
Sanctuary from Streets," Washington Post, November 29, 1990.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     The federal and state government should promote youth
intervention programs. One possibility would be to use Project Head
Start more frequently as a crime prevention program. Local police can
work with parents of assisted children to educate them on the dangers
of drugs.
<P>
     Public school drug education programs should shift some of their
emphasis away from students in high school and junior high schools and
toward those in elementary school, since most -- though not all --
children that age have not yet begun to use drugs and deal in them.
States and localities should establish educational tax credit voucher
programs that enable low-income parents to choose private schools that
provide a drug-free environment.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
     Reducing crime is a key to neighborhood revitalization and
economic improvement. The evidence is clear that one of the best ways
of accomplishing this is by forging resident-police programs to
discourage crimes rather than simply using the police to investigate
crimes after they have happened. Only when residents feel they can
work closely with police will fear of crime subside. 
<P>
     The argument that crime is of secondary concern, and is a
byproduct of poverty, misunderstands the causal relationship between
poverty and crime. Tackling crime is the precondition to a successful
war on poverty -- tackling poverty is not the key to reducing crime.
<P>
     In tackling crime, public officials at all levels must adhere to
the following principles:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> A police anti-crime program in low-income neighborhoods requires
     maximum face-to-face communication with resident leaders.
<P>
     Crime prevention is less expensive and more effective than crime
     investigation.
<P>
     No neighborhood or housing project, no matter how seemingly
     hopeless, can be written off. Success stories can and have
     happened even in the most crime-ridden neighborhoods.
<P>
     Economic development strategies to help the poor will work best
     when linked to areas with local crime prevention programs.
<P>
     Neighborhood space should be perceived by resident and non-
     resident alike as being under control of the law-abiding, not the
     lawless. Removal of graffiti, abandoned housing, litter, and
     other evidence of decay must have a high priority in municipal
     budgets.
<P>
     The drug culture must be eliminated. This means above all
     educating children and adolescents about the destructive and
     self-defeating nature of the drug world, and giving landlords and
     housing authorities the right to evict drug dealers with a
     minimum of impedence from misguided "civil rights" groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Relationships. To rid poor urban neighborhoods of their
criminal element, public officials at all levels must encourage the
creation of new relationships between low-income resident
organizations and local police forces. Central to this strategy is to
give residents the confidence that they can take steps themselves to
reduce crime. In this way, America may one day have a real chance of
declaring victory in a war on urban poverty.

<h3>MEDICARE REFORM:<br>
HOW TO PROVIDE CHOICE AND<br>
SECURITY FOR AMERICA'S ELDERLY</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Physicians Council Report No. 1<br>
August 3, 1995<br>
</center><hr width=50%>                                                         
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An intense debate has begun on the future of Medicare. The majority leadership Congress has made the case that structural reforms of Medicare are necessary to deal with the impending financial collapse of the program and to improve the quality and efficiency of medical services for the elderly. They have said in recent weeks that savings from any reforms of the program should be used to stabilize the finances of Medicare to assure its ability to deliver benefits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics of this view contend "reforming" Medicare and achieving "savings" in future outlays in reality is merely a smokescreen for cutting benefits. Most of these critics, including the White House, have not proposed any significant reforms in the Medicare program. But the recently released Report of the Board of Trustees of Medicare indicates that the program is in such bad financial shape that the only way to continue Medicare without reforms would be through huge future tax increases. Significantly, of the seven Medicare trustees, five are senior officials of the Clinton Administration -- three of whom are Cabinet secretaries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are only two choices available to Congress:
<p><blockquote>
<b>CHOICE #1: Do not change the way in which Medicare is run by the government, and pay for future benefits by raising new revenues through higher payroll and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs.</b> This means Medicare survives only by draining money away from the rest of the budget or by raising taxes.
<p>
<b>CHOICE #2: Change the way Medicare is run so that benefits are delivered more efficiently, avoiding future tax increases or a diversion of money from other programs.</b> Making the program more efficient would improve the quality of benefits and the choices available to retirees while reducing the double-digit rate of outlay increases. This would slow the depletion of the trust fund and stabilize the program
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1995 Trustees Report explains that if Medicare is not reformed, the cash flow of the HI trust fund (Part A), which finances hospital benefits for the elderly, will go into the red in fiscal year 1997 and the fund will run out of money and become insolvent in the year 2002. The Report then provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li> To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years, a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxes -- and hence raise the cost of employing Americans -- by an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. For a worker earning $45,000 per year, it would mean an additional payroll tax of $585 per year.
<p>
<li>To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the program -- that is, to put it on a permanently sound footing -- taxes could be raised now or raised by a higher amount in the future. If the HI trust fund were to be made permanently sound by raising payroll taxes immediately, an additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p>
<li> If tax increases were delayed until the cash flow of the HI trust fund of an unreformed Medicare system actually went into the red (FY 1997), a 3.65 percent increase would then be required to stabilize the fund permanently. If action were delayed until the fund actually ran out of money seven years from now, the payroll tax hike would have to be 3.91 percent. In this latter case, the payroll tax hike for the $45,000 per year worker would be $1,760 per year.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These calculations, moreover, apply only to the hospital insurance program (Part A of Medicare) paid for out of payroll taxes. Retirees also are entitled to enroll in Part B of Medicare, a voluntary program which covers much of the cost of physician and other services. Part B is approximately 75 percent subsidized by the taxpayer (eligibility for the subsidy is not means tested) and only 25 percent paid for by beneficiaries. Understandably, almost all eligible Americans enroll in Part B, also known as Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trustees point out that, like HI costs, SMI expenditures have been growing sharply. "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last five years. For the same period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program." With the trustees "'intermediate" estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will grow from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated $89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>WE MUST REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Trustees' Report shows that whether lawmakers and advocates for the elderly like it or not, Medicare cannot be separated from the budget. The reason for this is quite simple. Without reform, the HI trust fund will run out, will require heavy new taxes or subsidies, and the taxpayer cost of the SMI program will spiral rapidly upward. The result: The rest of the federal budget must be restructured to keep Medicare afloat through a combination of taxes and money diverted from other programs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only alternative to this bleak scenario is to reform the program so that outlays are brought under control and Medicare does not have to "crowd out" other programs or impose heavy new taxes on working Americans. <I>Bringing costs under control does not mean cutting medical care for the elderly, however, as critics of reform charge.</I> What it means is bringing the obsolete Medicare program up to date by incorporating innovations that are routine in the private sector and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP (which covers Members of Congress and federal workers, many of whom are retired). These innovations would improve efficiency -- and typically give wider benefit choices than under Medicare today -- and so allow services to be delivered at less cost.
<P>
<b> A MODEL FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If all retired Americans were offered the same type of medical coverage enjoyed by retired federal employees and Members of Congress, Medicare's looming funding crisis would be averted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By switching from the current "defined benefit ;" Medicare system to a "defined contributions" system similar to the FEHBP, the structural problems causing skyrocketing Medicare costs would be solved and senior citizens would wind up with more health care choices than they have now.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Currently, the federal government reimburses each Washington-approved health care service according to a set payment schedule that defies comprehension and ignores market realities. Instead the government should make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice. The result would be a system that costs less, while giving American seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their coverage and range of benefits, just as retired Members of Congress and federal employees do -- and save money at the same time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of the health plans offered under FEHBP provide coverage against long-term "catastrophic" illness and most offer prescription drug coverage, neither of which is provided by Medicare.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An FEHBP-style Medicare system would give senior citizens the opportunity to choose premiums that include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Dental care, out-patient medical services, routine physicals, diabetic supplies, chiropractic care, and other health care services not provided by Medicare.
<p>
<li> Advice and consumer information.</b> Just as various organizations help congressional and federal retirees choose their health care plans, senior citizens would receive similar help in deciding what level of care they need. Some may choose "Cadillac" health plans, for which they would pay more, or less expensive programs that more closely fit their needs.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An FEHBP-style reform would not only yield these advantages, it would result in fiscal stability for Medicare. The free-market dynamics that come with consumer choice would push Medicare into long-term financial stability. FEH BP premium costs have been increasing at just half the rate of Medicare. And this year, federal workers and retirees saw their health care premiums reduced by an average of 3.3 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both long- and short-term action must be pursued by Congress to end the Medicare crisis. In addition to switching to a FEHBP-style system, action should be taken to reduce the heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare Part B premiums. Some options to do this include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing</b> the current subsidy for more affluent senior citizens, using some of the savings to perhaps raise the level of subsidy for the elderly with very low incomes.
<p>
<li><b>Restoring</b> the premium paid by seniors to its original 50 percent from the current level of 25 percent. This could be done gradually over five years and save approximately $37 billion. Increasing the percentage seniors pay should not be regarded as a tax increase since enrollment in Part B is voluntary.
</ul><p>
<b>TIME TO REFORM IS NOW</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trustees, including three Clinton Cabinet secretaries, urge Congress to take "prompt, effective, and decisive action" to control the escalating costs of the Medicare program. Critics of Medicare reforms who argue that change should not be "budget driven," including some senior Clinton Administration officials not among the trustees, ignore the simple fact that an unstable and unreformed Medicare program increasingly is driving the budget deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 If Congress fails to undertake fundamental reform, there can be only two alternatives: Either the elderly will suffer a dramatic reduction in the quantity and quality of their health care coverage, or already overburdened working families will be forced to pay sharply higher taxes to maintain the current levels of benefits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the other hand, a Medicare system based on consumer choice and market competition would mean choice and security for today's elderly and a strong and solvent retirement health care system for future generations as well.

<title>To Promote Israel-PLO Peace, Press Arafat to Crack Down on Terrorism -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>TO PROMOTE ISRAEL-PLO PEACE, PRESS ARAFAT TO CRACK DOWN ON TERRORISM</i></h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 260<br>
September 26, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 963, "Beyond the Israeli-PLO Peace Agreement:  The U.S. Role in Consolidating Peace," October 31, 1993.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
	The interim Israeli-Palestinian agreement to be signed at the White House on September 28 is the product of grueling negotiations that ultimately may be doomed to fail. Israelis, who have taken the biggest risks in the negotiations and made the only concrete concessions, have become increasingly disillusioned with the deal they have struck with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. Arafat has failed to meet his commitment to halt Palestinian terrorism and instead has sought a political truce with Hamas, the radical Islamic movement violently opposed to peace with Israel. Palestinians, whose expectations have been raised by Arafat's over-selling of the negotiations, have been disappointed by Arafat's capricious leadership, his construction of a repressive regime riddled with corruption, cronyism, and inefficiency, and the continued fall in Palestinian living standards due to security-motivated closures of the border, which have deprived them of trade and jobs in Israel.
<p>
	The 460-page document to be signed at the White House extends Palestinian self-rule, already established in Gaza and Jericho, to include about 30 percent of the West Bank and most of the Palestinian population. It fleshes out the vague guidelines set forth in the September 1993 Declaration of Principles for interim Palestinian self-rule until a final settlement is negotiated and takes effect in May 1999. Although the full details of the agreement will not be made public until after the Israeli Cabinet votes on its approval, it is known to include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from six Palestinian cities and over 400 villages, along with the transfer of authority to Palestinian police forces in these areas within six months after the agreement is signed. Israeli security forces are to retain control of Israeli settlements, military bases, and the roads that connect them, as well as a zone in the city of Hebron, where 400 Israeli settlers live in close proximity to 120,000 Palestinians.
<p>
	After the Israeli troop redeployment, elections are to be held for a Palestinian Council of 82 members and a chief executive. The Council will assume many of the powers of a sovereign government, excluding the conduct of foreign affairs, external defense, and control of its borders with Egypt and Jordan, its airspace, or its use of communications wavelengths. It will have the right to establish courts, but those courts will lack jurisdiction over Israeli citizens, settlements, or military bases. Israel agreed to release a significant number of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails in three stages. Arafat agreed to revoke provisions in the Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call for the destruction of Israel. He had pledged to do so two years ago but did not follow through; this time, a deadline is set:  within two months of the inauguration of the Palestinian Council.
<p>
	This week's White House signing ceremony is likely to be a sober affair, in contrast to the euphoria that enveloped the White House on September 13, 1993, when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat signed the Declaration of Principles that outlined a framework and a timetable for a negotiated peace. Two years ago, the White House festivities celebrated a political wedding of sorts. Arafat and Rabin, after a breathless courtship, for better or worse had joined their political fortunes. Now the honeymoon is over. This week's ceremony more closely resembles the early stages of divorce proceedings between the Israelis and Palestinians, with Arafat seeking Palestinian statehood while Rabin seeks "separation."  It sets the stage for protracted and bitter negotiations on the final status of long-disputed territory that Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
<p>
	The mood at the White House also is likely to be dampened by the knowledge that the thorniest issues in dispute have been postponed until negotiations on final status issues begin in May 1996. These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The question of Palestinian statehood.</b> Arafat insists that he will gain a Palestinian state, while Israel opposes such a solution due to security concerns.
<p>
<li><b>The demarcation of borders.</b> The PLO demands the return of all territory that Israel captured in the 1967 war, while Israel seeks some modifications of the 1967 border as necessary to assure Israeli security.
<p>
<li><b>Security arrangements.</b> Israel seeks early warning stations and military bases along the Jordan River and West Bank ridge lines, restrictions on the size and armament of Palestinian security forces, and undisputed control of Palestinian airspace, among other security precautions.
<p>
<li><b>The status of Jerusalem.</b> The PLO seeks to gain sovereignty over East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1967, while Israel insists that Jerusalem is its "indivisible and eternal capital."
<p>
<li><b>The future of Israeli settlements.</b> The PLO seeks to expel Israelis from the territories occupied in 1967, while Israel opposes the removal of its 120,000 settlers.
<p>
<li><b>The question of Palestinian refugees.</b> Israel seeks to minimize the number of Palestinians that will be allowed to return to the West Bank and Gaza and opposes the return of Palestinians to Israel. The PLO wants to maximize the number of returning refugees and gain compensation for those who lost property or are not permitted to return.
<p>
<li><b>The allocation of scarce water resources.</b> Israel draws approximately one-third of its water supplies from the territories.
</ul><p>
	The theory behind the two-stage negotiating process was that the two sides would conduct a two-year experiment in coexistence that would allow them to build confidence in each other and demonstrate good faith. It was hoped that this would give each side greater flexibility when it came time to address the most contentious issues. But the experiment in coexistence has been a nightmare. Continued terrorist attacks, particularly the use of car bombs against civilians inside Israel, have undermined Israeli support for peace negotiations and fanned distrust of Arafat's PLO. Even the diminishing number of Israelis who believe that Arafat is sincere in his disavowal of terrorism have come to question the value of an agreement with a weak leader who is unable to deliver on his promises. If unchecked, terrorism and the resulting erosion of Israeli support for the negotiations soon will make a final status settlement unreachable, if it is not so already.
<p>
	To help consolidate a genuine and lasting Arab-Israeli peace that will advance U.S. national interests, Washington should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Maximize pressure on Arafat to crack down on terrorism.</b> Terrorism is the chief threat to peace, yet the U.S. has not done as much as it can to press Arafat to abide by his commitment under the Declaration of Principles to halt terrorism. Part of the problem is that the U.S. has not fully used the leverage afforded by its 1993 pledge to provide the Palestinians with $500 million over five years as a reward for negotiating peace. Under the terms of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA), which set aside prohibitions against U.S. government funding for the PLO, the executive branch must certify that the PLO has lived up to its commitments, including a halt of terrorism, before the MEPFA is periodically renewed. The State Department's compliance reports have been a "whitewash," according to House International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY). This has allowed the MEPFA to become little more than an entitlement program. Instead of allowing the Clinton Administration to judge PLO compliance, Congress should strengthen congressional oversight over the disbursement of scarce aid resources and judge PLO compliance with its commitments for itself. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) and Representative Michael Forbes (R-NY) have introduced legislation, the Middle East Peace Compliance Act, to do just that. This would be a step in the right direction that would give the PLO increased incentives to abide by its commitment to halt terrorism.
<p>
<li><b>Encourage the two sides to negotiate with each other, not with Washington.</b> The Clinton Administration should resist the temptation to leap into diplomatic action every time the two sides reach a negotiating impasse. This ultimately retards negotiating progress as the parties become increasingly dependent on American intervention.
<P>
<li><b>Let the two sides stretch out the negotiating timetable to allow a realistic chance of peace.</b> The target deadlines set by the Declaration of Principles have been missed repeatedly in the interim negotiations. This week's signing has come more than a year later than proposed by that overly optimistic agreement. Given the much more difficult nature of the issues remaining to be resolved, it is unrealistic to expect that the May 1999 deadline for a final settlement will be met. It will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a genuine peace. The U.S. therefore should not press the two sides to rush to meet arbitrary negotiating deadlines that could undermine the chances of a lasting peace.

<h3> A TAXPAYER'S GUIDE TO THE MEDICARE CRISIS </h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare is going broke. The huge national health insurance program that covers over 38 million elderly and disabled Americans will be insolvent by 2002, according to the 1995 report of the Medicare Board of Trustees, a seven-member federal body that includes three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries. Not only does hospitalization insurance (HI, or Part A) face bankruptcy,<sup>1</sup> but the cost of supplemental medical insurance (SMI, or Part B), which covers doctors' fees and other services, is exploding. And while recent surveys show that most elderly Americans believe they already have paid for their health benefits,<sup>2</sup> the truth is that the system is subsidized heavily by the taxpayers. Without significant program changes, the taxes working families will have to pay in coming years -- just to sustain Medicare benefits at current levels -- will be enormous.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Members of Congress realize increasingly that quick fixes, including price controls and cost shifting, no longer work. Serious policymakers also realize that Medicare's mounting problems are fundamental and structural. Even Medicare's trustees recognize that the "program is clearly unsustainable in its present form."<sup>4</sup>  The majority in Congress is searching for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program to a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. One prominent model recommended by Heritage Foundation analysts is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the 35-year-old system that serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A Single-Payer System.</b> Medicare is America's first major experiment with single-payer, government-run health insurance. Created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's so-called Great Society -- in essence, a major expansion of domestic social programs -- Medicare emerged as a compromise among Members of Congress who wanted to establish full-scale national health insurance. Thus, from its inception, the system assumed the need for central planning.

	According to its authors in Congress, Medicare also was designed to be "fiscally responsible," so Members of Congress and government actuaries attempted to project both costs and revenues well into the future. This was especially true of Part A, the hospitalization program. In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee reported that "Congress has very carefully considered the cost aspects of the proposed hospital insurance system [and] very strongly believes that the financing basis of the new hospital insurance program should be developed on a conservative basis."  Initial cost projections proved to be wildly wrong. For example, federal actuaries projected that a hospital stay would cost $155 per day in 1985 and that Part A costs would reach $9 billion by 1990. Instead, the costs of a hospital stay reached $600 per day in 1985, and Part A costs reached $63 billion in 1990.<sup>6</sup> Given the heavily subsidized structure of the Medicare system, it is unlikely that any government planner could have projected the explosion in costs that has characterized the part of Medicare that reimburses physicians (supplemental medical insurance, or Part B).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, changing demographics guarantee enormous future tax burdens on working families. In 1965, there were almost six workers for every retiree. Today, there are only four workers for every retiree, and by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two. The Washington-based Committee for Economic Development warns that payroll taxes just to finance Medicare and Social Security could consume up to 28 percent of a worker's paycheck by that time.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Planning and Price Controls.</b> Federal officials have had even less success in controlling the true costs of the Medicare program. Instead of relying upon competition and consumer choice to control costs, Congress has relied on a complex array of price controls. Since the inception of the program, Congress has adopted 75 options to cut reimbursement to doctors alone. This system of controls has ranged from simple freezes on physician reimbursement to increasingly complex formulas governing hospital reimbursements. In theory, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) officials are trying to find the right price for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments, or specialists and other providers. In practice, this invariably means that Medicare pays doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers either too much or too little. Such a system encourages doctors, hospitals, and other providers to attempt to "game" the elaborate fee schedule and price control systems by such things as picking a diagnosis that will maximize their payments. This helps explain why it also has proven largely ineffective in controlling overall program costs. At the same time, like all price control systems, it has proven very effective in shifting rising costs to the less-regulated private health insurance system serving workers and their families.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicare cannot control costs, since all of the system's incentives are designed to drive up costs. Congress created Medicare as a generous new entitlement to health care services without sufficient incentives to offset the new demand:
<blockquote>
	The planners seemed to have overlooked the fact that if you shift the demand curve outward without moving the supply curve, prices will go up. The original 1965 cost projections allowed for a 10 percent increase in hospital admission rates among the elderly, but in fact hospital admission rates among the Medicare eligible rose immediately by 25 percent, the rates for surgical procedures by 40 percent, and the number of hospital days by 50 percent.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under current law, expenses for supplemental medical insurance (Part B) are projected to double by the year 2002. Like Part A, this will mean a bigger tax burden for working families. In establishing the financing arrangements for Part B, Congress deliberately undermined its original copayment requirements, making sure that the taxpayers would subsidize 75 percent of the premium rather than the 50 percent agreed to in the original legislation. Moreover, Congress has held deductible and coinsurance requirements at artificially low levels.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, the deductible for Part B services is only $100. This figure not only has nothing to do with economic reality, but also is an incentive to increase demands on the system. The major reasons for the explosion in Medicare costs -- far beyond the federal government's own cost projections -- are rising demand and the increase in the volume and intensity of medical services.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Bureaucracy and Red Tape.</b> While Medicare relies on central planning and price controls to project and control costs, it also must rely upon a huge and elaborate system of federal regulation. Thousands of pages of federal rules, regulations, and guidelines, as well as a huge and growing body of case law, now govern the behavior of doctors, hospitals, and patients. To administer this complex system of planning, Congress in 1977 created the HCFA, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). With over 4,000 employees, HCFA is responsible for managing the giant health care trust funds and the Medicaid program, in addition to:  1) writing rules and regulations for the system; 2) contracting with private insurance companies in the states and regions to serve Medicare beneficiaries; 3) improving the productivity of Medicare contractors; 4) overseeing the surveys and certification of doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers; 5) enforcing standards of eligibility for providers and care for patients; 6) determining what medical services to the elderly will or will not be reimbursed; 7) deciding whether or not Medicare beneficiaries will have access to new treatments or procedures; 8) combating the admittedly rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system; 9) collecting reams of data on doctors and patients; and (10) conducting research, demonstrations, and evaluations. In other words, virtually no aspect of the financing and delivery of medical services to the elderly is free of HCFA's interference.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Government-Standardized Benefits.</b> Medicare's standardized health care benefits are set by law and government regulation. Either Congress or the Health Care Financing Administration must decide whether a new benefit, treatment, medical procedure, or technology will be included in the Medicare package for reimbursement. Since the program's inception, Congress has taken approximately 70 actions to increase or modify benefits. Unfortunately for the elderly, this is a highly politicized process. The addition or subtraction of a benefit, procedure, or medical device invariably is a political event. Perhaps the most notorious example of this politicization was the celebrated debate over the addition, and then the repeal, of the Medicare Catastrophic Benefit in 1988 and 1989.<sup>10</sup> That disaster proved that both Congress and HCFA are subjected to intense lobbying by doctors, hospital groups, special interests, or medical specialty societies. As Jeremy Rosner, formerly of the Progressive Policy Institute and now an official in the Clinton Administration, has written, "The history of Medicare is replete with cases of organized groups acting through Congress to add coverage for specific illnesses or procedures, or to affect changes in specific prices."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Cumbersome Process.</b> The congressional process for deciding whether a particular health insurance benefit should be available to the elderly and disabled is inherently cumbersome. First come committee hearings, followed by mark-up and reporting of bills to add or subtract benefits, and then House and Senate floor consideration and amendment of these measures. This process is followed by a House-Senate conference to resolve any differences and then, finally, by another vote by both chambers on a final package. HCFA's decision-making process, with its notice of proposed rule making, internal deliberations, and public comment on items published in the Federal Register, is deeply flawed. With its size and complexity, the federal regulatory regime inherently resists change, flexibility, and innovation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A New Model.</b> If Members of Congress want to retain the single-payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, they must resort to much higher taxes or to even more draconian price controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services that resembles limitations found in the British National Health Service. For example, while coverage for end-stage renal dialysis is an entitlement in Medicare, it is not available to elderly citizens in the British national health system. For the British government, this is a clear public policy choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The private, employer-based health insurance market is not a model of free-market efficiency. It is plagued by distortions born of the perverse tax treatment of employment-based insurance, which drives up health care costs and contributes directly to rising insurance rates.<sup>12</sup> But even this distorted market, encumbered by a restrictive tax policy, is capable of a level of experimentation and innovation that is virtually unimaginable in the Medicare system. The rapid change and flexibility in the private health insurance market, including the experimentation with managed care plans, is nowhere to be seen in the Medicare system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for Medicare reform, Members of Congress should examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Long proposed by Heritage Foundation scholars as a model for reform, the FEHBP is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association.<sup>13</sup> To an increasingly broad range of policy analysts, including those associated with the Progressive Policy Institute, think tank of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council,<sup>14</sup> the FEHBP has a number of advantages. Congressional and federal retirees and their dependents do not have a government-standardized benefits package imposed on them, but can choose from a wide variety of health care plans and options. Unlike most Medicare enrollees, they do not have to buy supplemental packages like Medi-gap coverage, extra insurance plans that cover services that Medicare cannot or will not provide. More important, they can pocket the savings resulting from their choices, a fact that gives them incentive to choose their medical coverage wisely. In Medicare, there are no meaningful choices. The imposing bureaucratic structure and deep regulatory reach of the Medicare program are nothing like the relative openness and flexibility of the FEHBP system. Unlike Medicare, the FEHBP is administered by 164 staffers at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It is highly flexible and is governed by less than 100 pages of federal regulations. In terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot compete with the FEHBP's market-based system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Cost Controls.</b> The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program has a much broader range of choice; better packages of benefits, including catastrophic coverage and prescription drugs; and a superior record in controlling health care costs.<sup>15</sup> While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, overall private-sector costs rose just 4.4 percent this year and FEHBP premium costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. And according to OPM, the average premium cost will rise only four tenths of one percent in 1996.<sup>16</sup> If Members of Congress wish to reform Medicare so that the security of America's elderly can be assured and the taxpayers' money can be used as efficiently and productively as possible, they must act now to harness the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
<p>
<b>HOW MEDICARE IS FINANCED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Medicare trustees admit that the Hospital Insurance (Part A) Trust Fund will be insolvent by the year 2002. But "The roots of Medicare's crisis... go back to its creation in the 1960s as an open-ended federal entitlement. With Uncle Sam paying all bills, the private market in medical care for the elderly was destroyed. Patients and providers have had no incentive to restrain their use of care, and... costs to the taxpayer have risen relentlessly."<sup>17</sup>  The reasons for this looming fiscal crisis include congressional mandates expanding covered benefits without providing offsetting changes in copayments or coinsurance, medical inflation, longer life expectancies, and the continually increasing use of medical services by a rapidly aging population.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare provides payments for inpatient hospital care, some inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, hospice care, physician and supplier services, and outpatient services. The program is divided into two parts. Part A finances the hospital insurance (HI) portion, and Part B finances the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) portion which covers physicians' fees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Part A:</b>  Generally, Part A of Medicare provides premium-free coverage for part of the costs associated with certain hospital stays and limited follow-up services. Part A is financed through mandatory payroll taxes levied on employees and employers and paid into a so-called trust fund. When Medicare was enacted, federal actuaries estimated future expenditures for Part A so that a payroll tax could be established based on potential costs. But the government's estimates fell far short of the actual costs of running this portion of the Medicare program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before January 1, 1994, the HI tax rates of 1.45 percent on employees, 1.45 percent on employers, and 2.9 percent on the self-employed were applied on earnings of up to $135,000. As part of President Clinton's effort to reduce the deficit, the Administration proposed that all earnings be subject to the HI tax beginning on January 1, 1994. This tax increase was approved by Congress in 1993 and signed into law on August 19, 1993, as part of the Clinton Administration's Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). Since the HI tax took effect in 1966, the maximum taxable income level has been increased on 23 separate occasions.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Contrary to widespread belief, HI revenues and expenditures do not go into a real trust fund. As a matter of fact, no real trust fund exists.<sup>19</sup> According to the annual reports issued by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Program, the federal government has never saved the tax revenues needed to cover the future health care needs of employees. The reason:  Medicare began paying out HI benefits at the same time it began collecting taxes.<sup>20</sup> Retirees in 1965 were collecting Medicare benefits without having paid into the system. As a result, younger workers on average are contributing more to the Social Security and HI fund each year as their earnings increase, but these contributions are not being saved. The trust fund is a myth. The funds are being transferred and spent almost immediately on the current Medicare population.<sup>21</sup> Despite the constant transfer of revenues, therefore, the future outlook for the program is grim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HI taxes go toward the general federal revenue pool. When the government receives new revenues, it posts new interest-bearing federal securities to the HI fund; when it spends monies on HI, it writes off some of these securities. In other words, these securities are not assets, but future obligations the government has issued to itself. As long as the HI trust fund maintains a balance, the U.S. Treasury is authorized to make HI payments for it. The higher limit on earnings subject to the HI tax proposed by the Clinton Administration was designed to reduce the deficit, not the HI trust fund.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A Graying America.</b> According to the Trustees' Report, long-range HI projections show that Medicare's hospital costs will rise at a much higher rate than inflation.<sup>22</sup> Compounding this troubling statistic is the near-term issue of insolvency confronting the HI trust fund. The trustees examine the solvency of the HI trust fund under three alternative sets of assumptions:  low-cost, intermediate, and high-cost. For purposes of illustration, consider the intermediate set of assumptions as the most reasonable. These assumptions reflect the trustees' best estimate of the expected future economic and demographic trends that will affect the financial status of the program. Under them, the present financing structure for the HI program is sufficient to ensure the payment of benefits only over the next seven years:  "As a result, the HI trust fund does not meet the trustees' short range test of financial adequacy."<sup>23</sup>  Thus, structural reforms will have to be made in the immediate future because the demographics supporting the existing HI program will shift radically downward. Currently, the approximate ratio of workers to people 65 or over is 4:1. This ratio is projected to decrease to 2.4:1 in 2035.<sup>24</sup> In short, the only way to sustain the solvency of the HI trust fund is to increase the HI tax rate (currently set at 2.9 percent) or significantly reduce benefits and payments. Not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the HI program inadequate to offset this demographic change, report the trustees, but under all the sets of assumptions, the trust fund will become exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins to occur.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
Q:  When will the HI trust fund go bankrupt?
<p>
A:  According to the trustees, it starts going broke in 1996 and is bankrupt by 2002.
<p>
Q:  So the HI trust fund will go broke even before the retirement of the nation's 77 million baby boomers?
<p>
A:  Correct. "Under all the sets of assumptions," say the trustees, "the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins."<sup>26</sup>  If nothing is done, the situation simply will go from bad to catastrophic.
<p>
Q:  Is the Clinton Administration proposing measures to insure the solvency of the HI trust fund?
<p>
A:  The Clinton Administration recently proposed to reduce Medicare spending by a claimed $128 billion over a period of seven years. According to the Administration, however, Medicare reform must take place within the context of "overall health care reform"<sup>27</sup> broadly similar to the Clinton plan that Congress rejected last year.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
Q:  Isn't Clinton's $128 billion savings plan far less draconian than the $270 billion reduction proposed by the majority in Congress?
<p>
A:  Not really. If you use the same nonpartisan CBO baseline rather than the White House baseline, the Administration actually is calling for $192 billion in savings, not $128 billion; this is a difference of just $78 billion over a period of 7 years.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
Q:  Isn't it true that taxes paid by beneficiaries during their working years cover the cost of the hospital insurance portion of Medicare?
<p>
A:  No. Many elderly Americans think they are only getting back what they paid into the system, but seniors are getting much more than they contributed, if they contributed at all. The Medicare health benefit package offered tomorrow will be more valuable than the one granted today, which is much more valuable than the one offered yesterday.<sup>30</sup> Benefits are generous and have risen consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and B) per enrollee is expected to be worth approximately $4,800 in 1995. According to the HCFA, spending is expected to continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value of Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is over $185,000.<sup>31</sup> As the following table indicates, the benefits received over a beneficiary's lifetime are far greater than his contributions to the system.
<p>
Q:  If HI trust funds are depleted, won't HCFA officials pay Medicare hospital bills anyway?
<p>
A:  No. "Under present law," according to the trustees, "there is no authority to pay hospital insurance benefits if the assets of the HI trust fund are depleted."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
Q:  Can't HCFA just borrow the money?
<p>
A:  Under current law, no.
<p>
Q:  Do the Medicare trust funds operate like a private pension trust fund?
<p>
A:  No. Medicare is a pay-as-you-go system. Coverage and services come from revenues raised through direct payroll taxes or otherwise taken from general revenues. What an individual pays into Medicare bears no relation to what he receives from it.
<p>
Q:  Medicare's trustees say the HI trust fund will go bankrupt in just seven years. Why hasn't Congress heard of this problem before now?
<p>
A:  It has. The trustees have been warning Congress for years that the HI trust fund would be exhausted shortly after the end of the century. During both the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Congress was told that corrective action was vital to avoid the onset of serious and devastating adjustments in the Medicare program, and President Clinton himself published an account of the seriousness of the matter well before he took office.
<p>
Q:  So Congress has failed to heed the trustees' warnings?
<p>
A:  Unfortunately, yes, and these attitudes persist. For example, Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, says the insolvency issue is exaggerated:  "I've read these trustees' reports for years. They're all pessimistic. I don't panic over the insolvency question."<sup>33</sup>
<p>
Q:  What are the short-term cash flow projections for the HI trust fund?
<p>
A:  According to the Trustees' Report, the positive cash flow is expected to be $3.4 billion in 1995. It becomes a negative flow in 1996. According to Robert Helms, former Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at HHS and currently resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, "The situation is expected to get progressively worse -- annual losses are estimated to be $26 billion in the year 2000 and $65 billion in the year 2004."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
Q:  What burdens will Americans have to assume to keep the HI program afloat?
<p>
A:  Big tax burdens for working Americans or big benefits cuts for the elderly. According to former HCFA Chief Actuary Guy King, "Just to keep the income and outlays in balance over the next twenty-five years (that is, before the baby boomers have all retired) will require either a 30 percent reduction in expenditures or a 44 percent increase in the HI tax."<sup>35</sup>
<p>
Q:  What would this mean for ordinary families?
<p>
A:  It depends. The Medicare trustees have outlined three tax increase scenarios. As a short-term, 25-year solution to the trust fund crisis, Congress could adopt a 1.3 percent tax increase. This would mean an extra $585 per year in taxes for a person making $45,000 per year. To put the trust fund on a permanently sound basis would require an additional 3.52 percent tax increase, or $1,584 for a person making $45,000 per year. If the trust fund went broke, the tax increase required would be an additional 3.9 percent, or $1,760 for anyone making $45,000 per year.<sup>36</sup>
<p>

<b>Part B:</b>  Part B is voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll in the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program by paying a monthly premium -- as of January 1, 1995, $46.10 per month. This contribution level constitutes a mere 29 percent of the actual cost of the Part B premium; the remaining 71 percent is paid by taxpayers. Part B provides coverage for physician, laboratory, outpatient hospital, and other medical services. It pays 80 percent of the allowed charge as determined by the federal government (after the annual $100 deductible is met), and beneficiaries are responsible for the remaining 20 percent coinsurance required by law.
<p>
	Congress established Part B to create a subsidy for the nation's elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently being provided. Until 1973, SMI premiums were set by law to finance one-half the benefit and administrative costs, in addition to a small contingency amount to go into a separate trust fund. When costs began to increase faster than inflation, Congress decided to limit the percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage as Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Under this new formula, revenues from Part B premiums decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent of expenditures. This is because Part B costs, much like Part A costs, increased at a much faster rate than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Beginning in the early 1980s, Congress has taken the politically safe path of voting to set enrollees' Part B premiums at a level which would cover only 25 percent of program costs. Thus, enrollees in 1995 pay only $46.10 per month for insurance that covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100. The illusion that their Medicare benefits package is inexpensive explains why the elderly have little incentive to control costs -- and why working families must pay even larger shares of the Part B cost out of general revenues.
<p>
Q:  How has the SMI trust fund grown?
<p>
A. Total receipts of the SMI trust fund grew from $324 million in 1966 to $58 billion in 1993. Expenditures for medical benefits were $56 billion in 1993.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
Q:  What will Medicare enrollees pay for SMI (Part B) services next year?
<p>
A:  Beneficiaries will pay just 25 percent of program costs. Under current law, that means enrollees will be paying $43.70 per month in 1996. The premium will rise to $60.80 per month by the year 2002 and $113.90 per month in the year 2005.
<p>
Q:  Has this 25 percent cost-sharing rule always been the case?
<p>
A:  No. The premium for Part B was designed to cover 50 percent of the program's cost. In 1972, Congress limited the annual premium increase to the percentage increase in the Social Security COLA. As a result, the beneficiaries' share of the premium cost fell, reaching a low point of 24 percent in 1981. In 1984, Congress set the premium for beneficiaries to cover 25 percent of the program's cost. In 1990, Congress reinstituted the linkage between the Part B premium increase and the Social Security COLA. Unless Congress changes this, premiums actually will fall next year, even though the program's costs will rise.
<p>
Q:  Is the SMI trust fund financially sound?
<p>
A:  Yes. Because it is funded mostly by general revenues, the taxpayers are forced to subsidize the program, thereby ensuring the trust fund's solvency.
<p>
Q:  So the SMI program is in good shape?
<p>
A:  Not from the standpoint of taxpayers. The problem with the SMI trust fund has been the program's explosive growth, which dwarfs both the rise in medical inflation and the growth in the economy. According to the Medicare trustees, "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in the aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the past five years."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
Q:  How will this affect the rest of the national economy?
<p>
A:  According to Guy King, the SMI trust fund will grow from 0.99 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3.18 percent of GDP in 2025, rising to 3.97 percent of GDP by "the middle of the next century."<sup>39</sup>  While Medicare Part B does require a modest premium, it is now an income transfer program, taxing away income from the working segment of the population and redirecting it to the retired segment without regard to retirees' income.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
Q:  Why can't Congress just freeze or reduce payments to Medicare providers, doctors as well as hospitals?
<p>
A:  That's precisely what Congress has done since the inception of the program. But price controls do not work. Since 1966, Congress has imposed 75 different actions to cut Medicare payments to doctors alone.<sup>41</sup> In spite of congressional efforts to contain costs through price controls, fee schedules, and caps, Part B growth has shown no signs of slowing and is projected to get far worse. No serious health policy analyst regards this rate of growth as sustainable.
<p>
Q:  But aren't price caps on provider payments the most effective way to reduce outlays?
<p>
A:  No. As King notes, "If we merely reduce payments to providers (as has been tried in the past), we would have to save between $330 billion and $340 billion over the next seven years."<sup>42</sup>
<p>
Q:  If Congress raised Medicare enrollees' portion of the Part B premium, adjusting the increase for enrollees' income, wouldn't that amount to a tax increase for our elderly?
<p>
A:  No. An increase in the Part B premium is not a tax. Individuals receiving an explicit service from government -- especially one which could be provided by the private sector -- should pay the full cost of that service absent a compelling reason for a subsidy (such as poverty).<sup>43</sup> As noted earlier, Part A hospitalization is a forced savings program in which workers contribute mandatory, income-related payments. Therefore, there is reason to argue against means testing Part A or reducing its benefits. Part B is voluntary. Reducing the taxpayer-provided subsidy as income increases simply reduces Medicare outlays.
Unsustainable Spending. Medicare is growing at an alarmingly fast rate. The Congressional Budget Office has projected an annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent over the next seven years:
Q:  Has the federal government been able to forecast how much Medicare will cost?
<p>
A:  As the table on the following page demonstrates, government projections vary significantly from Medicare's actual expenditures.
<p>
Q:  Why are actual expenditures far greater than projected expenditures and growing at over ten percent each year?
<p>
A:  While the easily identifiable reasons are congressional mandates expanding covered benefits and eligibility requirements, medical inflation, and a rapidly aging population that is living longer, the main reason is the structure and design of the overall program. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement. The demand for health care services, already high among the elderly, is significantly greater among the very ill who also require more expensive medical treatment and services during the latter stages of life. Since the program is structured around a fee-for-service and third-party payment system, patients and providers do not have to worry about the price or quantity of services being provided as they spend the taxpayers' money.<sup>44</sup> In other words, there is virtually no incentive, absent a minimal cost-sharing requirement, for the Medicare population to help contain costs. Combining a government-organized fee-for-service structure with a third-party payment system serves as a catalyst for unlimited increases in the volume and intensity of services provided to patients, without regard for the efficacy or cost-effectiveness of those services.<sup>45</sup>
<p>

<b>HOW THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY RUNS MEDICARE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1977, Congress established the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to run the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HCFA is an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its Administrator, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is a powerful federal official who directs the "planning, coordination and implementation" of Medicare, Medicaid, and other HCFA programs and "directs the development of effective relationships between these programs and private and federally supported health related programs."<sup>46</sup>  The Administrator is assisted by a "general deputy Administrator" and reports directly to the Secretary of HHS.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA currently operates with a budget of $262 billion, mostly to pay for Medicare and Medicaid services, and a staff of 4,129. For FY 1996, the Clinton Administration is requesting a total of $274 billion for Medicare and Medicaid benefits and operating costs, an increase of $28 billion over FY 1995. Spending for Medicare represents 64 percent of the HCFA budget, and spending for Medicare and Medicaid combined represents 38.2 percent of the total HHS budget.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA is comprised of 25 offices and bureaus, including the Office of the Administrator, and ten regional offices. The direct administrative cost of HCFA is projected at $3 billion.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
Q:  Does HCFA have a large overhead?
<p>
A:  No. Administration consumes an estimated $3 billion -- only 1 percent -- of the agency's budget.
<p>
Q:  So, as far as bureaucracy is concerned, HCFA is cheap?
<p>
A:  Not at all. Known and direct administrative costs -- those shown on the federal budget -- do not include transactional costs incurred by doctors, hospitals, and other providers forced to comply with HCFA rules, regulations, requirements, standards, and guidelines. In identifying a regulation for elimination, Vice President Al Gore cited the fact that just one requirement, a physician attestation form for persons being discharged from hospitals, is responsible for 11 million forms which consume an estimated 220,000 hours of physician time and $22,500 in labor costs per hospital per year.<sup>49</sup>
<p>
Trust Fund Management. HCFA's mission, beyond program management, is to administer the Medicare trust funds. The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is financed by federal payroll taxes and overseen by the Medicare Board of Trustees, a panel composed of the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Administrators of the Social Security and Health Care Financing Administrations, and two "public" (non-government) members. Medicare is set up so that taxes paid by current workers are used to pay the hospitalization benefits of current beneficiaries. Any income not immediately needed to pay for these benefits is held in the HI trust fund.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Also administered by HCFA and governed by the Medicare Board of Trustees is the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. This fund holds all income not immediately needed to pay physician and outpatient medical benefits under the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program and all related expenses. Unlike the HI trust fund, the SMI trust fund is financed by annually established standard monthly premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries and by federal government contributions based on actuarial rates estimated by HCFA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>HCFA's Regulatory Regime.</b> The major source of regulatory authority for the Health Care Financing Administration is Title XVIII of the United States Code. Medicare regulations are developed within HCFA but, because HCFA is an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services, issued as HHS regulations. According to an analysis conducted by Jeremy Rosner of the Progressive Policy Institute, Medicare is governed by 1,050 pages in the U.S. Code, 1,156 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, and guidelines in the form of 19,150 pages in HCFA "manuals" and another 1,000 pages of HCFA "rulings."  Beyond these are approximately 2,000 more pages of "Provider Reimbursement Review Board Hearing Decisions" and "HCFA Administrator Decisions."<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA's regulations are developed in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The Secretary of HHS approves all regulations developed by HCFA, after which they are submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Following OMB approval, they are published in the <I>Federal Register</I> and open to public comment before taking effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA regulations have generated a large body of case law because they have the practical force of law. For example, the five-volume <I>Commerce Clearing House (CCH) Medicare and Medicaid Guide</I> for members of the legal profession is twice the size of the <I>Encyclopedia Britannica:</I>  more than 43,196 pages, approximately two thirds of which are devoted to Medicare-related topics.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beyond formal federal regulations published in the <I>Federal Register</I>, HCFA develops and publishes "guidelines" that govern doctors, hospitals, insurance contractors, and other health care providers in the program. Like HCFA regulations, these guidelines are numerous, extensive, and intricate. And like the regulations, for all practical purposes, they control doctors and hospitals.
<p>
Q:  What is the legal status of an HCFA regulation published as a Final Rule?
<p>
A:  It has the force of federal law.
<p>
Q:  Are HCFA guidelines for doctors and hospitals subject to the Administrative Procedures Act?
<p>
A:  No. For example, revisions in the Medicare Reimbursement Manual are exempt from the public notice and comment requirements of the Act, and the Supreme Court has upheld this exemption.<sup>51</sup> Not surprisingly, legal experts fear that this could be a way for HCFA officials to avoid going through the more public process of publishing formal regulations.
<p>

<b>HOW HCFA CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE CARRIERS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HFCA delivers hospital and physician services through more than 80 contracts with private health insurance carriers in all 50 states. These contractors process insurance claims, make benefit payments, review Medicare payments to make sure they are "necessary and appropriate," and make improvements in the delivery and productivity of Medicare services under HCFA guidelines and regulations. They also are responsible for reviewing payments to providers in accordance with HCFA rules. HCFA thus relies upon a huge number of contractors to process Medicare's claims and perform a series of ancillary services. As the GAO has observed, "The Medicare program operates through a complicated administrative structure."<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA funds a "payment safeguards" program for Medicare contractors to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO has described the safeguards as cost-effective but insufficient and has criticized HHS budget reductions in the "safeguards program."<sup>53</sup>  The program funds auditing, reviewing bills to make sure that services are "medically necessary," and establishing procedures to make sure that other health insurers who cover the elderly "pay first" if that payment is appropriate. This is directed primarily at employer-provided insurance. In 1965, Medicare was to be the "secondary payor" for beneficiaries covered by both Medicare and Workers Compensation. In the 1980s, Congress made Medicare secondary payor to certain employer-based plans and under automobile insurance. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress specified that employer-provided benefits would continue to be primary to Medicare (meaning that Medicare would be a "secondary payor" of health bills) until October 1, 1995. Employers, under current law, are required to provide beneficiaries with information to that effect.
<p>
Q:  What are the civil penalties for private employers who do not pay first for beneficiaries, or who fail to supply information to eligible beneficiaries that Medicare is a secondary payer?
<p>
A:  A private employer can be fined up to $1,000 per employee for failing to supply such information. Moreover, the federal government can impose an excise tax of 25 percent on private health plans that fail to comply with secondary payer rules.<sup>54</sup> HCFA is seeking to extend the data match among itself, the IRS, and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify the "primary payers" for Medicare enrollees.
<p>
Q:  How serious are waste, fraud, and abuse?
<p>
A:  Very serious. Senator William Cohen (R-ME) says that, based on federal investigations of the problem, Medicare fraud costs taxpayers $45 million per day.<sup>55</sup>
<p>
Q:  The GAO has estimated the cost-effectiveness of the HCFA safeguards program. Has either the Congressional Budget Office or the HCFA Actuary ever quantified the savings produced by the general payment safeguard program?
<p>
A:  No. While HCFA officials are likely to claim that these procedures have had a positive effect on Medicare costs, independent reports suggest that they are not enough. For example, according to a 1992 GAO report, "In recent years, the Medicare program has lost billions of dollars to waste, fraud and abuse. Though Medicare's losses cannot be quantified precisely, health industry experts estimate that fraud and abuse could account for as much as 10 percent of the nation's total health care costs."<sup>56</sup>
<p>
Q:  How do these abuses occur?
<p>
A:  According to the GAO, HCFA does not follow up adequately on Medicare beneficiary complaints about waste and abuse; nor do Medicare's contractors. In one case, for example, hospitals owed Medicare over $170 million in overpayments, but contractors "did little to reclaim the money."  In another, contractors paid an estimated $2 billion in claims that "should have been paid by other health insurers."<sup>57</sup>  Some abuses are particularly brazen. For example, a chain of home health care agencies billed Medicare $85,000 for gourmet popcorn for doctors and another $3,200 for "expenses incurred at a golf shop."<sup>58</sup>
<p>
Q:  How many complaints from senior citizens about fraud and abuse are we talking about?
<p>
A:  Millions. In FY 1990 alone, Medicare contractors reported getting 18 million complaints. Over half of these complaints were not referred to the contractors' investigative staffs. Furthermore, those that were referred often were not "adequately investigated."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
Q:  But why wouldn't the private insurance contractors in Medicare follow up aggressively on fraud, waste, and abuse?
<p>
A:  The incentives are not strong in Medicare. It's not their money; it's the government's -- which means the taxpayer's -- money.
<p>
Q:  What does the GAO recommend to combat these problems?
<p>
A:  Stronger policing and even tighter regulation by HCFA. This includes improving oversight of contractor activities, reducing excessive payments, and instituting tighter controls over who is allowed to bill under Medicare.<sup>60</sup> Given the program's monopolistic structure, such recommendations are hardly surprising.
<p>
<b>Claims Processing.</b> Medicare claims processing, despite congressional attempts to improve it, remains very complex. Hundreds of millions of claims are processed annually in an explosion of confusing paperwork for doctors, hospitals, and insurance contractors alike. In a June 1990 review of the system, the GAO reported that the "paperwork required to process claims under the Medicare program is burdensome and confusing to many of Medicare's beneficiaries, as well as to providers of Medicare-covered services."<sup>61</sup>  Because doctors and patients were often unclear as to what was required on the forms, claims were submitted with incorrect or insufficient information. HCFA then requested additional information to clear up the confusion, further delaying the process. In responding to beneficiaries, HCFA communications also were often unclear, and this generated even more frustration and delay. Doctors likewise have found that the information from Medicare contractors was "frustrating and burdensome."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, HCFA has imposed uniformity on this process simply by putting the burden on doctors to submit all Medicare claims. It also has been moving aggressively toward electronic claims processing. Before 1990, doctors who did not "participate" in the Medicare program (did not accept Medicare "assignment" or payment for services as full and final payment) were not subject to Medicare billing requirements. But in September 1990, pursuant to congressional authorization, HCFA began requiring doctors to submit all claims on behalf of their patients, even when patients wished to submit their own claims and even when doctors were not "participating physicians" in Medicare. In other words, Medicare claims submitted by patients could no longer be accepted legally. Under current law, claims are to be submitted within one year of providing medical care. Doctors may not charge for, or be reimbursed by HCFA for, the costs of completing and submitting claims. Civil monetary penalties may be imposed on any doctor who fails to submit all Medicare claims properly.
<p>
Q:  What if a physician fails to submit an assigned claim as required by law and regulation?
<p>
A:  The Secretary of HHS is to reduce the amount of reimbursement by 10 percent.
<p>
Q:  What kind of penalty can be imposed on doctors who refuse to submit claims properly?
<p>
A:  A fine of up to $2,000 per claim.
<p>
Q:  What if a doctor does not submit the Medicare claim?
<p>
A:  Doctors who "knowingly and willfully" violate the statute are subject to exclusion from Medicare for up to five years. They also are subject to exclusion from state health programs and can be assessed civil monetary penalties.
<p>
Q:  What will happen if a Medicare patient, rather than his doctor, submits a claim?
<p>
A:  HCFA can investigate the doctor to see whether the failure was deliberate and therefore warrants legal sanction.
<p>
Q:  What if a doctor wants to treat an elderly person for free as an act of personal charity?  Is he still required to submit a Medicare claim?
<p>
A:  Yes. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, all physicians must submit claims for services to all Medicare beneficiaries.
<p>
Q:  What is the law concerning the right of an elderly person to purchase the services of a physician or other entity independent of Medicare?
<p>
A:  Section 1395(b) of Title 42 of the United States Code provides:  "Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to preclude any state from providing, or any individual from purchasing or otherwise securing, protection against the cost of any health service."  Moreover, in Stewart v. Sullivan, a landmark 1992 case in Newark, New Jersey, federal Judge Nicholas Politan, examining the legal question of the right of elderly persons to contract independently with physicians in 1991, noted that there was no regulation and no clearly articulated policy against private contracting.<sup>63</sup>
<p>
Q:  Even so, do HCFA or Medicare's contractors allow elderly citizens to contract privately with physicians?
<p>
A:  Statutory language and recent federal case law to the contrary, HCFA officials consistently deny that the elderly have any such right unless they drop out of Part B; they also threaten doctors who assert any such right with sanctions.<sup>64</sup> Congress thus far has failed to clarify the matter.
<p>
Q:  How will the general movement toward electronic claims processing affect efforts to combat Medicare fraud and abuse?
<p>
A:  FBI Director Louis Freeh is concerned that electronic claims processing may make it even harder to deal with fraud and abuse precisely because there is no "paper trail."<sup>65</sup>
<p>
<b>NO COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unlike private plans which compete directly for consumers' dollars in the FEHBP, Medicare contractors do not compete on the basis of price, quality, or service. Instead, Congress establishes detailed standards for their performance in such matters as paying bills or processing claims. For example, Congress has established claims processing timeliness standards for Medicare contractors, and HCFA is responsible for seeing to it that they meet these standards. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 established timeliness ceilings for claims payments, specifying that 95 percent of Medicare claims were to be paid in no more than 30 days in 1987, 26 days in 1988, 25 days in 1989, and 24 days in 1990 and thereafter. Moreover, "participating physicians" were to be paid 7 days faster than "non-participating" physicians, beginning in FY 1988. Then, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, not satisfied with ceilings, Congress mandated that Medicare operate on the basis of claims payment floors. Contractors implemented a floor of ten days in July 1988; by September, 59 percent of the carriers were meeting the ten-day floor. But the law increased the floor level to 14 days. By November 1988, 80 percent of Medicare's contractors were meeting the 14-day requirement. HCFA officials have said that the change from 10 to 14 days caused some difficulties, but that contractors have been working to meet congressional specifications.
<p>
Q:  So congressional rules are designed to ensure that bills are paid as quickly as possible?
<p>
A:  Not necessarily. As noted, there are ceilings as well as floors in Medicare's claims processing. Incredibly, Congress has imposed statutory limitations on paying bills too fast. In 1989, for example, bills were to be paid no later than 25 days but no sooner than 14 days after receiving a health provider's claim.
<p>
Q:  Do these congressional timeliness rules apply to plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for Members of Congress and federal workers?
<p>
A:  No. Consumers in this unique market can punish and reward plans annually, based on their service. Both <I>Consumer Reports</I> and <I>Washington Consumers Checkbook</I> survey customer services in FEHBP plans in such diverse claims-related areas as simplicity of claims procedures, speed and fairness of claims payment, procedures for providing information on benefits and procedures, and the courtesy, helpfulness, and competence of the company's staff. Moreover, <I>Washington Consumers Checkbook</I> lets consumers compare performance by listing or ranking plans by the number of disputed claims per 1,000 federal employees and retirees. Medicare does not make public similar information.
<p>
Q:  What is the Clinton Administration doing to reform HCFA claims processing?
<p>
A:  The Clinton Administration, as part of its effort to reform HCFA's unwieldy regulatory process, has proposed a new national Medicare Transaction System (MTS) to replace the nine different claims processing systems now operated by 72 insurance companies at 57 sites around the country. The object is to simplify administration and improve Medicare services. In January and March of 1994, contracts were awarded to private companies for "design, development, testing and implementation" of the MTS.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
Q:  Are there any estimates of the potential savings in Medicare's computer software for claims processing?
<p>
A:  Yes. The General Accounting Office estimates that with an investment of $20 million in "off-the-shelf commercial software," Medicare could save nearly $4 billion over five years by "detecting fraudulent claims by physicians -- primarily manipulation of billing codes."<sup>67</sup>
<p><b>Regulating Quality.</b> Beyond entering into contracts with and establishing standards for Medicare contractors and imposing price controls, HCFA is responsible for assuring the "quality" of health care services to the elderly and disabled. It attempts to fulfill this responsibility in a variety of ways. First, it certifies health care providers who are qualified to deliver medical services:  doctors, hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinical laboratories, renal dialysis facilities, home health agencies, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, and nursing homes. Each provider must meet HCFA requirements or "conditions of participation."  To assure quality, HCFA negotiates with the several states to perform surveys of the approximately 2,000 health care facilities that deliver Medicare and Medicaid services to the elderly and the poor. The states thus become instruments by which HCFA can ensure compliance with its rules, regulations, and instructions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, this survey and certification role has expanded. During the second Reagan Administration, HCFA issued its first state-by-state guide to the nation's 15,000 nursing homes. Designed to assess the quality of care given to the elderly, the guide was billed as a snapshot of conditions using 32 "key measures of the quality of care."  The first report was issued as a screening tool for consumers. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 1987, HCFA also recertifies skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988, Congress expanded the agency's survey and certification responsibilities to include clinical laboratories serving Medicare beneficiaries. Approximately 38,000 laboratories around the country are registered with HCFA, all subject to routine inspections on an annual basis. These broad efforts are funded by HCFA out of its Program Management account. HCFA thus has an oversight role over state agencies it funds to do this work.
<p>

Q:  With Medicare administered by contractors at the state level, what about quality of care and access to medical technology?
<p>
A:  It is very uneven. Despite thousands of pages of HCFA rules and guidelines, notes Dr. Lonnie Bristow, President of the American Medical Association, in actual practice dozens of Medicare contractors often set their own rules and standards:  "For example, an older woman is 180 times more likely to be turned down for a mammogram in southern California than in northern California. A chest X-ray that's billable in South Carolina is 500 times more likely to be denied in Illinois."<sup>68</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MEDICARE STANDARDIZES BENEFITS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since the enactment of Medicare in 1965, Congress has adjusted the system by increasing benefits, expanding eligibility, and then implementing price controls to offset the effects of its own initiatives. Benefits are unrelated to income or prior contributions and are applied uniformly toward all enrollees. Every participant is subject to a standardized package with no ability to make adjustments in price or in the scope or range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare benefits are divided into two parts:  Part A, the Hospital Insurance (HI) program, and Part B, the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Part A will pay for:<blockquote>
	All reasonable expenses for the first 60 days of inpatient hospital care, minus a deductible ($696 in calendar year 1994) in each benefit period. For days 61-90, a coinsurance amount ($174 in calendar year 1994) is deducted. When more than 90 days are required in a benefit period, a patient may elect to draw upon a 60-day lifetime reserve. A coinsurance amount ($348 in calendar year 1994) also is deducted for each reserve day.
<p>
	Up to 100 days (following hospitalization) in a skilled nursing facility for persons in need of continued skilled nursing care or rehabilitation services on a daily basis. After the first 20 days, there is a daily coinsurance ($87 in calendar year 1994).
<p>
	Home health visits for persons who need skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech therapy on an intermittent basis.
<p>
	Hospice care services provided to terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries with a life expectancy of 6 months or less, up to a 210-day lifetime limit. A subsequent period of hospice coverage is allowed beyond the 210-day limit if the beneficiary is recertified as terminally ill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Part B generally will pay 80 percent of the approved amount (fee schedule, reasonable charges, or reasonable cost) for covered services in excess of an annual deductible ($100). Services covered include the following:<blockquote>

	Doctor's services, including surgery, consultation, and home, office, and institutional visits. Certain limitations apply for services rendered by dentists, podiatrists, and chiropractors and for the treatment of mental illness.
<p>
	Laboratory and other diagnostic tests, X-ray and other radiation therapy, outpatient services at a hospital, rural health clinic services, home dialysis supplies and equipment, artificial devices (other than dental), physical and speech therapy, and ambulance services.
<p>
	An unlimited number of medically necessary home health visits for persons not covered under Part A. The 20 percent coinsurance and $100 deductible do not apply for such benefits.<sup>69</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has established Medicare as a program of defined benefits, in essence promising the nation's senior citizens a laundry list of benefits under Part A and Part B without informing them of or effectively offsetting the true cost. As opposed to protecting the elderly from catastrophic accidents and unforeseen illnesses, Medicare is much like a pre-paid medical services program. Over 95 percent of the elderly receive Medicare benefits today because Congress has created financial incentives for seniors to enroll in the program. The combination of rigid reimbursement -- actually price controls -- for health providers and artificially low premiums and deductibles for enrollees has resulted in a popular but financially unstable and costly social insurance program.
<p>
Q:  How has the structure of Medicare affected private health insurance and working Americans?
<p>
A:  Unfortunately, it has led to overuse of health services by a price-immune population, severe distortion in the private-sector health care market, and an ever-increasing financial burden (tax) on today's and tomorrow's work force, including the almost 40 million uninsured Americans who are mostly workers. Most of these households lack insurance coverage because they cannot afford it; they must spend hundreds of dollars a year to purchase health care for the elderly through the Medicare payroll tax.<sup>70</sup> If Congress had increased Part B medical deductible and premiums to keep pace with inflation and acted to end or decrease the open-ended subsidy of Medi-gap plans, Part B outlays would be significantly less than they are projected to be.<sup>71</sup> As the following table indicates, however, premiums and deductibles have not kept pace with inflation, so Medicare's beneficiaries have been shielded from the true costs of their health care.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Decisions often are political, not medical or scientific, in setting benefits. Since Congress defines the Medicare benefits package, it can add or subtract from it. Historically, however, Congress has added benefits instead of trimming them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Because it is politicians, not doctors and patients, who make the key decisions, the Medicare population -- unlike congressional and other federal retirees, who are covered by plans offering benefits and services for different conditions and needs -- is locked into a government-standardized benefits package. Beyond electing to participate in the voluntary SMI program with its standardized benefits, the only choice elderly Americans make in health insurance is whether they will purchase a supplemental Medi-gap policy to get services and benefits not covered by Part B. Depending on the scope of benefits and services provided in these policies, millions of elderly Americans can spend over $1,000 a year on Medi-gap insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, the standardized Medicare package does not cover routine benefits included in most health plans in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. For example, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Option plan available in the FEHBP includes preventive screening (stool tests for blood, prostate specific antigen tests); routine physical exams, including a history and risk assessment only, and a serum cholesterol test, annually at age 65 and over; smoking cessation; catastrophic protection; outpatient prescription drugs; and routine dental care. None of these benefits is available in Medicare.
<p>Q:  What happens when a new treatment is discovered or an old one becomes obsolete?
<p>
A:  Once a standard benefits package has been established, modifying and updating it becomes an administrative, bureaucratic, and political nightmare. Medicare establishes and excludes certain types of services from coverage. HCFA officials must overcome a myriad of internal bureaucratic obstacles whenever they seek to add or withdraw a benefit. Should HCFA decide to expand coverage for a promising medical breakthrough, it must request an evaluation from the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), part of HHS's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). This is a cumbersome process. Any HCFA official wanting to eliminate a benefit or medical service must be prepared to defend his proposal before Congress and special interests lobbying for the inclusion of their particular benefit or service.
<p>
Controlling Medical Technology. While Medicare benefits are established by Congress, the addition or subtraction of medical treatments or procedures rests with HCFA. The problem of adding a treatment or procedure becomes acute for Medicare patients when the medical technology in question is new.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under Medicare's complex reimbursement rules, it is not always clear that a medical procedure or device is reimbursable under HCFA guidelines. HCFA's staff can do an internal review and determine that a medical technology, particularly a conventional technology, is reimbursable. But the decision to cover it is not left to the regional office; it is referred to the headquarters in Baltimore. The technology assessment is done for HCFA by HHS's Office of Health Technology Assessment. After reviewing the information, OHTA makes its recommendations to HCFA's Office of Coverage Policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under current law, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs and medical devices for safety and effectiveness before they can be marketed in the United States. Outpatient prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, so FDA decisions in this area apply only to inpatient drugs. Medicare private-sector patients therefore are affected differently. For medical devices, there are special FDA Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for "breakthrough" or "investigational" devices, subject to patient consent and initial FDA approval. These exemptions are available for doctors and hospitals to treat patients enrolled in private health plans. Historically, hospitals have billed Medicare for new medical devices and for the use of investigational devices otherwise approved by the FDA in clinical studies. In July 1994, the HHS Office of Inspector General issued a subpoena to 130 hospitals and leading medical centers requesting "nearly a decade's worth of billing records on cardiac devices."<sup>72</sup>  HCFA's position was that billing such "investigational devices" constituted "fraud" against the Medicare program. Spokesmen for HCFA asserted that billing Medicare for investigational devices had always been prohibited and that the hospitals and medical centers should have "known better."<sup>73</sup>  HCFA now denies Medicare reimbursement to doctors and hospitals that use these investigational medical devices, even if doctors think they are warranted in treating an elderly patient's disease or medical condition. Because Medicare refuses to pay for these newer medical devices, Medicare patients, unlike patients in the private sector, experience delays in getting such treatments or access to such devices, and sometimes are denied access to them altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If Medicare does agree to pay for a medical device, the payment must be the government-determined rate, regardless of market supply and demand conditions. The law thus limits elderly patients' access to advanced medical technologies.
<p>
Q:  How have leading medical research centers and hospitals responded to HCFA rules and HHS subpoenas governing billing for new or "investigational" medical devices?
<p>
A:  Clinical trials have been shut down and Medicare patients excluded from access to these devices. According to one account, "The subpoenas created a domino effect -- hospitals closed studies, limiting access to devices by Medicare patients. Doctors were no longer able to provide what they considered the latest treatments to many older patients."<sup>74</sup>
<p>
Q:  How has the medical device industry responded to FDA and HCFA regulatory processes?
<p>
A:  According to a survey of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA), which represents more than 700 medical device companies, 50 percent have moved some trials of clinical devices to other countries. This means that patients in other countries are the first to benefit from technological innovations developed in the United States.<sup>75</sup>
<p>
Q:  Many physicians use "investigational" drugs and medical devices in difficult or life-threatening cases. Does Medicare make any exception to the ban on reimbursement for such devices?
<p>
A. No. According to Thomas A. Ault, Director of the Bureau of Policy Development at HCFA, "The Medicare manuals do not allow any exceptions to this policy."<sup>76</sup>  Dr. John Rowe of New York's Mount Sinai Hospital testified recently that even using a pacemaker with a new form of electrical contact could run afoul of the rules if the manufacturer was comparing the effectiveness of different contacts. In such a case, the hospital could be turned down for the cost of the entire treatment, not just the pacemaker.<sup>77</sup>
<p>
Q:  So Medicare does not always provide reimbursement for the latest medical technologies, procedures, and pharmaceutical breakthroughs?
<p>
A:  Right. Americans should be extremely cautious about accepting a comprehensive, standardized government benefits package for all plans, especially in an era when medical technology is improving and making rapid advances. According to a recent study of the Medicare system by former U.S. Senator David Durenberger (R-MN) and former congressional health policy analyst Susan Bartlett Foote, Medicare technology evaluation has been underfunded because of competing budgetary priorities, such as payment for a growing volume of state-of-the-art medical services. Durenberger and Foote note that such evaluation has been hampered by ineffective assessments of the cost-effectiveness of technology, due in large part to the politicization of HCFA's decision-making process, and that technology assessments often have been painfully slow. OHTA performed only 10 assessments in 1991 and 8 in 1992, and some have been buried for over three years. Furthermore, a bureaucratic approach to technology policy that affects all Americans, especially the Medicare population, raises serious health-related concerns.<sup>78</sup>

<b>MEDICARE'S EXPERIMENT WITH MANAGED CARE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, in an effort to catch up with the private sector, HCFA has tried to promote managed care plans in the form of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) as an alternative way to deliver medical services to the elderly. Within HMOs, doctors and other health care providers are paid on a "capitated basis," and their incentives are quite different from those found in the traditional fee-for-service system that characterizes Medicare. HCFA officials think the efficiencies of HMOs would allow them to lower their premiums and attract Medicare beneficiaries into their managed care networks. The Reagan and Bush Administrations encouraged enrollment in HMOs as a "private plan option" for Medicare beneficiaries because they saw managed care as a way to slow the rapid growth of Part B spending. In 1982, in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, Congress permitted Medicare to allow HMOs and Competitive Medical Plans (similar managed care-type plans which contract with physicians) to accept Medicare patients but at full financial risk to themselves. By 1989, over 1 million beneficiaries had enrolled in approximately 133 managed care plans. More recently, Congress established a Medicare Select option -- in practice, a Preferred Provider Option.
<p>
Q:  How many Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs or managed care plans compared to enrollees in private-sector insurance and the FEHBP?
<p>
A:  Only about 7 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs or managed care plans. In the private sector, 63 percent of all workers and their families are enrolled in such plans; in the FEHBP, 33 percent of all enrollees are in HMOs. Of the 1.6 million federal retirees, approximately 18 percent are enrolled in HMOs.<sup>79</sup>
<p>
Q:  What is wrong with HCFA's payment to HMOs?
<p>
A:  Under Medicare rules, the capitation rate for doctors in HMOs is 95 percent of local fee-for-service costs. Medicare officials are constantly trying to find the right price for medical services. As former HCFA Administrator Gail Wilensky says, "Inadequate payments for risk appears to produce overpayments to many HMO's, probably underpayments for some HMO's."<sup>80</sup>
<p>
Q:  If an HMO offers a premium for its package below the Medicare payment, can the Medicare beneficiary get a price rebate from the HMO?
<p>
A:  No. The elderly are not allowed to take advantage of actual or potential savings in the Medicare program.
<p>
Q:  How has the Medicare Select PPO option fared?
<p>
A:  As well as could be expected in a bureaucratic system driven by political rather than market considerations. The PPO option originally was limited to 15 states. Congress just extended Medicare Select to all 50 states for 3 years, subject to congressional review at the conclusion.
<p>
Q:  Are "point of service" managed care plans, in which Medicare patients can choose personal doctors outside their own managed care networks, allowed?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>81</sup>
<p>
Q:  May private employers contract with an HMO and enroll their retirees, who also are Medicare beneficiaries, in an HMO or Competitive Medical Plan?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>82</sup>
<p>
Q:  What if Congress just forced the elderly into managed care plans, as many private employers are doing now to workers and their families?  Wouldn't that save money?
<p>
A:  Not necessarily. It is not clear that managed care will guarantee long-term savings, either in the Medicare system or in the private health care system. "Managed care will not provide an instant magic bullet," notes Urban Institute health policy analyst Marilyn Moon. "Health maintenance organizations (HMO's) and other types of managed care have more experience dealing with younger, healthier populations that may not translate easily into treatment of the aged and disabled."<sup>83</sup>
<p>
Q:  Why have HMOs been more widespread in the FEHBP than in Medicare, and why do they seem to have reduced costs?
<p>
A:  Because of personal choice. In the FEHBP, not only is joining an HMO voluntary, but federal employees and retirees can pocket the savings from picking a private managed care plan.
<p>
Q:  Do HMOs in the FEHBP assume all financial risks for enrolling employees and retirees?
<p>
A:  Yes. All private carriers, including traditional fee-for-service plans competing in the FEHBP, assume the financial risk of enrolling federal employees and retirees. This risk is not assumed by the taxpayers.<sup>84</sup>

<b>HOW HCFA PAYS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare's most prominent regulatory feature may be its complex system of reimbursement for doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Its experiences in setting prices for these providers are object lessons both in the deficiencies of conventional third-party payment arrangements that still characterize employer-based insurance and in the failures of administered pricing and central planning as found in Medicare's reimbursement schedules. The administered prices are either too high or too low; the process for setting them inevitably is flawed or lacks sufficient data; the guidelines are confusing or insufficient; or the payment process is compromised by HCFA's managerial ineffectiveness. For example, in a May 1991 report on the pricing of medical technology, the General Accounting Office found that in some localities, Medicare was paying more than twice as much as others for magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), thereby stimulating greater use of this technology.<sup>85</sup> In November, GAO found that six suppliers of durable medical equipment realized higher profits from their Medicare business than from their non-Medicare business.<sup>86</sup> The next year, in June 1992, GAO found that "HCFA could reduce Medicare expenditures on durable medical equipment subject to unnecessary payments by developing more detailed coverage criteria that give carriers a clear, well-defined, objective basis for paying or denying claims."<sup>87</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the quality and quantity of information are insufficient, the basis for planning is flawed and payment policies will be wrong. In an examination of Medicare payments to teaching hospitals, GAO reported in 1991 that "Supplemental medicare payments to teaching hospitals are based on inaccurate and unverifiable data, and are causing Medicare to pay millions more in indirect medical education costs than it should."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Occasionally, Medicare pricing policies are bizarre. For example, in a March 1992 report examining payment practices for certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and doctors, GAO found that "Medicare pays more for anesthesia services performed by CRNA's or residents under concurrent medical direction by an anesthesiologist than for identical services personally provided by an anesthesiologist."<sup>89</sup>  Just as suppliers of durable medical equipment had been overpaid by Medicare, clinical laboratories were doing quite well under Medicare's fee schedules:  "Medicare and other retail customers are essentially subsidizing laboratory sales to discount customers. Based on the principle that Medicare should pay its own way but not subsidize services for other customer groups, we believe that Medicare's fee schedule payment rates are, on average, too high."<sup>90</sup>  Payment also can affect the kind and quality of care given to the elderly. GAO found that Medicare's reimbursement to oncologists determines whether cancer patients are treated in higher cost hospital settings or lower cost outpatient settings:  "What is clear from our results... is that HCFA's reimbursement policies for chemotherapy have unintended consequences that extend beyond whether and how much oncologists are reimbursed by Medicare. Specifically, the policies may affect where a cancer patient gets treated and, as a result, Medicare costs for that patient care."<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Hospital Payments.</b> Historically, hospital care has been the single largest item in the Medicare budget. Elderly citizens are more prone to hospitalization, and HCFA officials estimate that approximately one fourth of all Medicare beneficiaries are hospitalized once a year. Not surprisingly, Medicare payments to approximately 6,000 hospitals nationwide account for almost 40 percent of all hospital income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1983, with the support of the Reagan Administration, Congress enacted the Prospective Payment System (PPS), a new Medicare reimbursement system for hospitals. The program was phased in over a period of five years and fully implemented in 1988. HCFA, of course, administers this system of hospital payments. Under the PPS system, hospitals are paid a standardized amount for each admission. That per capita amount is adjusted by the "wage index" for the geographic area in which the hospital is located and multiplied by a weight assigned to the case according to its diagnostic related group (DRG). Under Medicare, approximately 500 DRGs determine all hospital payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The DRGs are at the heart of the PPS system, and HCFA officials often are concerned with ways to "refine" the payment formula. For example, classifications do not distinguish between differences in the severity of cases even though, on paper, patients may be classified under the same DRG for purposes of medical treatment. The levels of care are different, but reimbursement is the same. HCFA officials are aware of this deficiency and have sponsored research at Yale University on adjustments that would allow for differing levels of severity in medical condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another key element in a hospital's standardized Medicare payment is whether it is located in an urban or a rural area. Standardized amounts have been significantly higher for urban hospitals. "Sole community hospitals," designated by HCFA as the only hospitals available in given geographic (rural) areas, are paid a separate PPS rate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA planners adjust the PPS rates on the basis of the "hospital market basket," an index that measures annual changes in the "cost of inputs," including such items as the cost of labor, prescription drugs, medical supplies, and even the energy consumed by the hospital in delivering medical services. The hospital market basket is a major component of the PPS update, or rate of increase in hospital payments from year to year. In assessing what hospitals should be paid, Members of Congress are advised by a special government commission, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC), independent of HCFA. Based on its analyses, ProPAC may recommend an average update factor at some percentage, taking into account recent HCFA market basket estimates. Congress is free to accept or reject these recommendations.
<p>
Q:  What about hospitals with a "disproportionate share" of low-income clients?
<p>
A:  The PPS system allows additional payments to help cover the indirect costs of teaching and to help hospitals with a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Because urban and teaching hospitals tend to give low-income and uninsured people uncompensated care, Medicare reimburses them with additional payments. These hospitals have enjoyed higher levels of profitability under the PPS system than other types of hospitals. At the same time, federal law forbids hospitals from transferring, or "dumping," any patient who arrives in an emergency room. Moreover, under the Hill-Burton Act, they must provide free care to uninsured or low-income people to qualify for low-interest federal construction loans.
<p>
Q:  What is HCFA's experience with PPS rates?
<p>
A:  Troublesome. HCFA officials must know the right price for hospitalization services in order to set the right rates. To be at all efficient, central planning and pricing policies require a daunting level of precision in data collection and analysis. The first technical problem for HCFA planners was that they based their initial standardized payment amounts on 1981 hospital cost data and then continued to do so in subsequent years. Thus, annual payments were made on outdated assumptions, rendering them -- at least for purposes of government pricing -- economically meaningless. HCFA planners then argued that they had to "rebase" the PPS standardized amounts, taking into account more recent and more accurate data. For the special interests, rebasing was not a scientific question, but a matter of income. The American Hospital Association, for example, originally opposed rebasing but then reversed itself and supported it because it would increase Medicare payment levels.
<p>
Q:  In other words, by basing its estimates on 1981 hospital data, HCFA set PPS amounts too high?
<p>
A:  Yes. During the first two years, Medicare hospitals' profit margins were about 15 percent. This led HCFA officials to believe they had set the rates too high. In response to PPS, the average length of patient stays fell, and hospitals did what they could to get "heavier" DRG weighting for certain classes of medical services in a fashion that HCFA planners did not anticipate.
<p>
Q:  How have hospitals tried to get a heavier DRG weighting?
<p>
A:  Through a process called "up-coding."  Hospital officials try to document each case thoroughly, noting every complication in the patient's status that would require specific services. This gives the patient's DRG a heavier weight, and thus a higher Medicare payment.
<p>
Q:  How has PPS affected rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  Rural hospital administrators initially thought that PPS reimbursement was too low. In the late 1980s, HCFA officials conceded that Medicare payment levels were disadvantaged by the PPS system. But they also argue that other factors, not the PPS system, are responsible for the financial difficulties of rural hospitals. During the first four years of PPS, admissions declined significantly at rural hospitals, which have much lower occupancy rates than urban hospitals.
<p>
Q:  How has Congress responded to this problem?
<p>
A:  By further modifying and adjusting the PPS system to get the right price for rural hospitalization and by expanding the federal bureaucracy. In FY 1988 and FY 1989, Congress mandated higher annual rate increases for rural hospitals than for urban hospitals; accordingly, the methodology for calculating basic rates was revised in FY 1988, resulting in increased rates for rural hospitals. Moreover, in August 1987, HHS established an Office of Rural Health Policy to coordinate HHS activities relating to rural health policy. In 1988, Secretary Otis R. Bowen established the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health to advise him on the impact of Medicare and Medicaid policies on rural hospitals and other health care facilities.
<p>
Q:  Did these changes in PPS methodology help rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  No. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Congress authorized a special Medicare demonstration program to award small grants to rural hospitals to help them close and convert facilities and develop alternative types of medical services. In FY 1989, Congress appropriated $9 million for this program.
<p>
Q:  What else did Congress do for rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  Congress simply authorized a change in the definition of "rural" for purposes of PPS. In FY 1989, HCFA standards for designating counties as rural or urban were changed so that 57 hospitals in 38 rural counties would be paid by Medicare as if they were urban hospitals.
<p>
Q:  What has been the effect of the PPS system?
<p>
A:  HCFA officials invariably say it has been consistently effective in controlling costs. For example, between 1979 and 1983, HI benefit outlays increased by over 17 percent per year. For the first five years of PPS, HCFA reported that the growth rate for HI outlays dropped to an annual average of 6.5 percent. HCFA attributes this both to decreases in hospital admissions and the average length of hospital stays and to a shift to outpatient services covered under Part B.
<p>
Q:  In other words, the PPS system shifted costs to elderly patients -- in the form of less hospitalization -- and to the part of Medicare not covered by PPS?
<p>
A:  Yes. One of the system's first noticeable features was a more rapid turnover in hospitalization among Medicare patients. As John Merline of <I>Investor's Business Daily</I> writes, "Hospitals, according to several studies, are releasing some Medicare patients earlier and in less stable condition than they formerly would."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
Q:  So in coping with PPS standardized reimbursements, hospitals simply shift costs from one part of Medicare to the other?
<p>
A:  Yes. Under the PPS system, hospitals have every incentive to shift costs from Part A inpatient hospital services to Part B outpatient services. From 1985 through 1990, outpatient hospital services jumped 20 percent per year. Historically, the big shift in the use of outpatient services has been in diagnostic, surgical, endoscopic, and cataract procedures.
<p>
Q:  Under the Medicare DRG system, hospitals are forbidden to charge more than the Medicare-approved price, even if patients are willing to pay more. But can they charge less than the Medicare-approved price and give rebates to the elderly?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>93</sup><p>
Payments to Doctors. Since 1966, Congress has taken approximately 75 different actions to cut Medicare payments to doctors.<sup>94</sup> These legislated caps and freezes on reimbursement schedules have reduced compensation in the Medicare program to about 59 percent of private-sector rates.<sup>95</sup> Yet costs continue to grow at unsustainable rates. Rather than introduce free-market forces into the program to control costs efficiently, however, liberal Members of Congress have devised even more complex and cumbersome systems of price controls over the past decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Historically, physicians in Medicare were reimbursed according to the "usual, customary, prevailing, and reasonable" rates based on behavior in the private market.<sup>96</sup> In 1975, Congress established a Medicare Economic Index (MEI) and then required Medicare to limit its annual increases in prevailing rates to this MEI. Throughout the 1980s, Congress tried to change, modify, or cap these rate increases. This effort failed. Spending on Part B services continued to soar at about 13 percent per year.<sup>97</sup> Since there is no genuine health care market (at least as economists normally understand the term) in the private sector, Medicare since 1992 has attempted to pay physicians on the basis of a special formula called the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS):
<blockquote>
	Since January 1, 1992, payments for physicians services under Medicare have been based on a national fee schedule that is being phased in through 1996. Under the fee schedule, each service is first assigned a <I>relative value.</I> The <I>relative value</I> for a service has three components:  (1) a physician work component that reflects the time, skill, and intensity of the physician's effort in providing the service; (2) a practice expense component that includes costs such as office rent, salaries, equipment, and supplies; and (3) a malpractice component that reflects malpractice insurance premium costs. A <I>geographic adjustment</I> is made to each of the three components of the relative value. The geographically adjusted relative values are then multiplied by the conversion factor. The conversion factor is a dollar figure that converts the geographically adjusted relative value for a service into a dollar payment amount for that service.<sup>98</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most interesting feature of this entire process is the attempt by HCFA staff, using the methods of social science, to measure and weigh the "value" of labor as the key element in reimbursing an entire class of professionals, an enterprise long since abandoned even by practitioners of socialist economics.<sup>99</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other elements of the new reimbursement formula are Volume Performance Standards (VPS) and restrictions on balanced billing, or the ability of the physician to charge more than the Medicare-approved price for a medical service. Under Medicare's physician reimbursement system, HCFA projects the appropriate rate of growth for the volume of physicians services to the elderly and the disabled. If physicians as a group exceed the projected volume of medical services set by the HCFA in any given year, the aggregate reimbursement is reduced proportionately, as a percentage, two years later. HCFA officials have never been clear as to how a future reduction in fees for all physicians in the Medicare program is supposed to prevent an individual physician from increasing his volume of services in order to offset potential future losses in Medicare income. Nonetheless, this is the Volume Performance Standards' central function. Congress adopted this mechanism in 1989 to offset the likely increase in the volume of medical services encouraged by reductions or restraints in fee schedules and billing. A related measure was a limitation on balanced billing. Thanks to the RBRVS fee schedule and balanced billing restrictions, the Medicare fee schedule became nothing more than a complicated price-fixing scheme.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For over 500,000 physicians, HCFA assigns regularly updated "relative values" for approximately 7,000 medical procedures. Refining these values in the RBRVS is a tedious and never-ending task because, as with previous Medicare reimbursement schemes, the values, and thus the Medicare payments, are rarely right and often controversial. When RBRVS was implemented in 1991, physicians complained that the government's "conversion factor" (translating HCFA value scales into specific dollar amounts) was not high enough. Beyond that, the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), and even HCFA, conceded in 1991 that many of the values assigned to the thousands of medical procedures were simply wrong.<sup>100</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the RBRVS, HCFA must rely on physicians to participate in setting and adjusting medical service codes. This is a complicated process that forces physicians, operating outside of anything that resembles a market, to function as judges in their own interest and at public expense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Like all such price-control schemes, Medicare's RBRVS fee schedule encourages doctors to game the system by such means as trying to bill Medicare or patients in creative ways; upcoding, or using a medical service code that guarantees higher reimbursement when more than one medical service code applies to the treatment of a case; and "unbundling," or making charging separately for services that otherwise would be part of, and billed as, a single package of treatment for a given medical condition.<p>
Q:  The market rewards suppliers which provide high quality goods or services that consumers find beneficial. Does HCFA or Congress attempt to incorporate the quality or benefit of a medical service to elderly patients?
<p>
A:  No. Neither the quality nor the benefit of a service is a part of Medicare's RBRVS formula for setting fees for physicians. Patient demand, in an economic sense, is simply ignored. Proponents of the RBRVS say that, with more time, more research, and a better refinement of social science methodology, they hope to incorporate quality and benefit indices for purposes of calculation.<sup>101</sup> But no such indices exist today.
<p>
Q :  Does the Medicare RBRVS fee schedule make any distinctions among physicians on the basis of their professional skills in treating patients?
<p>
A:  No. Medicare reimburses doctors without regard to differences in skills or experience. Highly skilled surgeons with a great deal of experience are paid the same as relatively inexperienced surgeons of lesser reputation.
<p><b>


HOW TO EXPAND CHOICE AND STRENGTHEN MEDICARE'S FINANCIAL CONDITION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Absent any structural reform of the Medicare program, Congress will be forced to choose between two very unpleasant and unpopular alternatives:  a massive tax increase on working Americans, surpassing the Clinton tax bill of 1993, or a similarly masive reduction in benefits to the elderly. Halfway measures cannot restore solvency to Medicare's trust funds. Nor can they achieve the necessary savings needed to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit. Moreover, failure to pass structural reforms allows HCFA's bureaucracy -- with its arcane regulations burdening physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers -- to become even more entrenched.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the Medicare trustees, "it is now clear that Medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative."<sup>102</sup>
<p>

Q:  Private-sector experience often is used as a point of comparison with Medicare. How do Medicare's costs compare with the private sector's?
<p>

A:  In the private sector, large employer health premiums in 1995 dropped by 1.1 percent while overall health care prices rose 4.4 percent. Medicare, meanwhile, experienced more than 10 percent overall growth and is projected to grow at the same rate for the next five years.<sup>103</sup>
<p>
Q:  What other options do retirees have if they choose not to purchase the Medicare Part B package?
<p>
A:  They can buy a private plan. But if they do so, they lose the 75 percent subsidy for premiums available under Part B.
<p>
Q:  Are all retirees treated equally when it comes to purchasing health insurance?
<p>
A:  No. Retired Members of Congress and other federal retirees have access to the FEHBP. Unlike Medicare, this unique, consumer-driven health care system is not run on the principles of central planning and price controls. It is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. The FEHBP includes over 400 private health insurance plans nationwide, ranging from traditional indemnity insurance and fee-for-service plans, to plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations, to various managed care plans (HMOs, PPOs). Instead of attempting to constrain costs by controlling prices and specifying services to be covered, it sets very broad guidelines over how plans must be structured and marketed and specifies only a brief set of core benefits, permitting federal workers and retirees to choose the plan and benefits that are right for them. Costs are held down through the operation of consumer choice in a market of competing plans. Total costs in the FEHBP have been rising at about half the rate of costs in Medicare, and premiums recently have been flat or falling.
<p>
Q:  Since both the FEHBP and Medicare are run by the federal government, aren't they essentially similar?
<p>
A:  No. The FEHBP works on entirely different principles. For one thing, Medicare is a defined benefits program in which each enrollee has access to a standardized set of health services that are paid for, in whole or in part, by the federal government. The FEHBP, on the other hand, is a defined contribution program in which the government agrees to provide retired Congressmen, Senators, or federal employees with a financial contribution toward the purchase of health plans of their choice.
<p>
The FEHBP is open to all congressional and federal retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. Under current rules, a retiree is eligible to enroll in an FEHBP plan if he retired on an annuity with at least five years of continuous service at the time of retirement, or if he retired on a civil service disability. Retirees can assume coverage for spouses by electing survivor benefits for them, and any survivor annuitant can request FEHBP coverage for grandchildren, under certain conditions, on or after August 11, 1994.<sup>104</sup>
<p>
Q:  What features make an FEHBP-style program more desirable than Medicare for retirees?
<p>
A:  First, retirees would have a wide choice of health plans. Except for federal retirees no other group of retirees enjoys this feature. Private plans range from fee-for-service to different types of managed care plans. Plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations and associations are particularly popular; almost one third of federal workers and retirees are enrolled in such plans.
<p>
Second, retirees could choose the services they want covered. Unlike the Medicare population enrolled in a single, standardized government benefits package, federal retirees have various private options available to them. Beyond the normal range of hospitalization and physician services, they can pick from plans that cover such services as dental care, outpatient mental health benefits, routine physical examinations, durable medical equipment, hospice care, outpatient prescription drugs, mail order prescription drugs, treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse, and -- most important -- catastrophic coverage.
<p>
	Third, retirees would have a range of options as to what they will pay in premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and, in some cases, maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Under the FEHBP's financing formula, the government will contribute each year up to a maximum dollar amount. If a federal retiree chooses a very expensive benefit package that exceeds this contribution, he makes up the difference. On the other hand, if a retiree chooses a less expensive plan, he saves money on his portion of the premium.

<p>
Building a Better System
<p>
Q:  How can retirees get the same types of options Members of Congress and other federal employees enjoy upon retirement?
<p>
A:  Congress can give the elderly greater control over their Medicare dollars so they can select the plans and services that are right for them. Changing Medicare from a defined benefit program into a defined contribution program would allow the elderly to use payments to enroll in private health plans with the benefits and services they want, rather than those chosen for them by bureaucrats or politicians. On the other hand, if they wish to remain in the traditional Medicare plan, they should be free to do so.
<p>
Q:  Would a defined government contribution cover the costs of retirees' health insurance?
<p>
A:  Yes, unless the senior chose a very expensive plan. The size of the government contribution could be the combination of two amounts, reflecting the financing of the existing Part A and a reformed Part B. Medicare currently spends $4,800 per person, or $9,600 per couple.
<p>Part of the defined contribution could be an amount (adjusted by age, gender, and geography) intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the hospital and other services in today's Part A. This portion of the voucher would not be subject to a means test. Another part could be based on an amount (also adjusted by age, gender, and geography) intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of services currently included in the voluntary and subsidized Part B program. This base amount should be subject to a means test to determine the dollar amount of this portion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a scenario, the elderly finally would be able to purchase health insurance plans of their choice. HCFA would be reduced to a clearinghouse that distributes information regarding these plans to the elderly. A checklist of benefits would be provided to inform beneficiaries as to what type of plan is in their best interest. Enrollees who choose a health insurance plan which costs less than the size of their defined contribution would receive the difference in cash, tax free.<p>
Q:  What kinds of protection would Congress have to establish to make sure that the elderly aren't being conned by rogue insurance companies?
<p>
A:  Health insurance plans participating in a new consumer choice, or "Medi-Choice," system would have to meet certain basic requirements to be marketed as approved plans:
<p>
Requirement #1:  They would have to meet basic financial strength requirements to assure fiscal solvency. A similar requirement exists today in the FEHBP.
<p>
Requirement #2:  They would have to specify benefits, services, and costs in a standardized manner, enabling the elderly to choose a plan without confusion. This is done today in the FEHBP.
<p>
Requirement #3:  They would have to provide information on their benefits, premiums, and patient satisfaction to Medicare. They also would have to adjust premiums by age, geography, etc., but not by health condition.
<p>
Requirement #4:  They would have to contain a core set of benefits, including catastrophic coverage. This also is not unlike the FEHBP. This core benefit package should be leaner than the current Medicare package, enabling individuals to purchase a less expensive plan and pocket the savings. With the help of the defined government contribution, it also would enable the elderly to supplement their basic plans with various services.
<p>
Q:  What would a Medi-Choice system, broadly similar to the FEHBP, mean for the elderly population?
<p>
A:  Elderly Americans would be able to choose the type of private health insurance that meets their individual needs. With advice and counsel from private doctors and family members, they could pick either a basic benefits package or a broader package with a range of services and treatments that are readily available on the open market. Consulting with doctors rather than waiting for approval from government bureaucrats in Washington means that the elderly could enjoy the immediate advantages of state-of-the-art treatments, medical procedures and devices, and service delivery innovations.
<p>

	Financially, America's elderly would be able to pocket any savings from their personal decisions in the form of contributions to Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). While the cost of health care on average is higher for the elderly than for the working population, the level of the government contribution to their health plans also will increase accordingly, based on their age factor. With the establishment of a Medi-Choice system, the powerful market forces of consumer choice and competition should yield the free-market dynamics and positive effects the private sector now enjoys.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After thirty years of existence, Medicare is in crisis. The message -- even from Medicare's own trustees -- could not be clearer:  Without fundamental structural reform, this program will be bankrupt by the year 2002. It is mired in bureaucracy, immune to shifts and changes in the market, and subject to runaway costs that show no sign of slowing down. Furthermore, its 38 million beneficiaries soon will be joined by a huge influx of retirees from the baby boomer generation, severely straining the funds and resources of an already financially troubled system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is imperative that all retired Americans be afforded the same types of choices and opportunities now enjoyed by retired Members of Congress and all other federal retirees. Allowing private-sector providers to compete freely and fairly for the opportunity to cover the health care concerns of the nation's elderly would reduce the need for a centralized bureaucracy like HCFA. And the pending insolvency crisis could be avoided simply by converting the current defined benefits system into a defined contribution system, broadly similar to the FEHBP.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	America's taxpayers deserve a Medicare system that is financially stable. At the same time, America's elderly deserve an opportunity to choose the health coverage and range of benefits best suited to their individual needs and situations. Only serious structural reform of the Medicare system can accomplish these goals.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><ol><p><li>

HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY -- Heritage </title>

<center><h3><i>HOW SENATOR SHELBY WOULD REQUIRE PRISONERS TO WORK AND STUDY</h3></i>
<p>By Patrick F. Fagan<br>
William H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 420<br>
July 5, 1995<br></center><hr size=3 Width=30%>
<p>
    Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) has introduced a bill to reform the operation of America's
prisons. S. 930 requires inmates in federal prisons, and in the prisons of states receiving federal
monies under the 1994 crime bill for building new prisons, to work 48 hours and study 16 hours per
week. The legislation also repeals the social work requirements of last year's crime bill.
<p>
    Though many complain of overcrowding in prisons, Americans are far more concerned about
the early release of prisoners -- many inmates are released after serving only a small fraction of their
sentences. Despite the widespread feeling that a sentence imposed should be a sentence served, a
large portion of the nation's felonies are committed by those out on parole or on probation. Thus, the
overriding need is not relief from overcrowding, but more prisons to protect society from those who
harm other citizens and their property.
<p>
    Serious prison overcrowding urgently needs to be tackled. That means new facilities must be
built. But it is also important for taxpayers and lawmakers to realize that many prisons spend an
enormous amount of money on an extensive array of sports and recreational facilities for prisoners.
The use of these facilities is treated in Senator Shelby's bill as a privilege to be earned by completing
work and study, not as a right to accompany incarceration. These privileges -- some that many
taxpayers do not have for themselves -- include the use of weightlifting and bodybuilding equipment;
access to sports (basketball, football, baseball), recreation, and television; unmonitored phone calls;
instruction and training in martial arts (boxing, wrestling, judo, karate); the use of musical equipment;
in-cell cooking privileges (coffee pots and hot plates); permission to dress and groom in a manner
different from uniform prison standards; and access to equipment for publishing and broadcasting.
<p>
    Rarely are these facilities provided because the prison system wishes to do so. Judges
interpreting civil rights law impose these changes on officials through court order. John DiIulio,
professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, writes:  "What prosecutors and other
law enforcement officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in protecting
prisoners' rights. They have done so at the expense of making a mockery out of democratically
enacted laws. Some federal judges have made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing
changes in operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff assaults, a
dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for inmates, and the early release each year
of literally hundreds of thousands of violent or repeat criminals.1"
<p>
    Senator Shelby's bill would require prisoners to work and study for 64 hours per week, thus significantly
reducing the "free time" prisoners currently have to enjoy a host of amenities. The bill also requires that the food
prisoners are given not be superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to enlisted personnel in the United
States Army.
<p>
    A debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and punishment has swung back and forth in the
penology literature for over a century. The appeal of the Shelby proposal is that it has rehabilitation, education, work,
and punishment all in one package. Furthermore, the reform bill requires a prisoner's life to be similar to that of a
hardworking young taxpayer who holds a job and goes to college at night.
<p>
    The literature on the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts alone is weak at best. The literature on the
effectiveness of work and study is somewhat stronger. Some of the research difficulty comes from definitions and
understandings of rehabilitation. There are two dimensions to rehabilitation:  deep interior dispositions and developed
capacities. It is difficult even for friends to know, still less to change, the deep interior dispositions of others. It is
especially so for prison staff (even counselors and therapists) when they try to reach the prisoner. However the second
dimension of developing capacities is less dependent on changed interior dispositions. The person who works long and
hard acquires the capacity to work long and hard. The person who learns to work harder for more privileges acquires
an even greater capacity. And the person who studies develops his intellectual and operational capacities. All of these
will be of use to the prisoner when he regains his freedom.
<p>
    Sustained work for most people involves some form of suffering. At a minimum, a prisoner ought to
experience the normal suffering of the work week which the average citizen has to undergo.
<p>
    Many hardworking citizens do not have either the time or the money needed to join fitness clubs, take part in
sports, or receive training in the martial arts. They do not have easy access to many of the facilities made available to
prisoners. America's working poor have a life that is harder than that of many of federal and state prisoners. This
violates fundamental notions of justice and common sense.
<p>
    Many of the more luxurious facilities and privileges available to prisoners are beyond the reach of most low-income, law-abiding taxpayers and middle-income taxpaying parents with growing children. These privileges are in
place because of federal judges who dictate these facilities in the prisons. As DiIulio explains, the actions of these
judges undermine law enforcement. But by making work and study requirements part of federal law, the Shelby bill
makes it more difficult for judges to require prisons to provide such extensive facilities and privileges.
<p>
    The Shelby bill could be improved, and the principles of federalism better defended, if the bill addressed only
future prisons that states want to build with federal money. To require that all prisons in states  receiving
construction grants be run as Senator Shelby proposes would improve their method of operation, but
that requirement violates the central tenet of federalism -- leaving to the states what is not prohibited
by the  Constitution. With this modification, states which do not like the strings attached would not
have to take the  federal monies for future prisons and could provide unlimited television and karate
training if they wished. Those which agree with Senator Shelby's approach to running prisons could
apply for the money and build and manage their prisons along these lines. Senator Shelby expects
many states to use these federal monies and the federal requirements in the law as a way to break the
hold of micromanaging federal judges. If judges wanted to challenge this way of running prisons,
they would have to deal with Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court. They could not simply impose
court orders on prison officials.<p>

FIGHTING CRIME: ASSESSING  THE BUSH  AND  BIDEN APPROACHES </h3>

<p>
<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

 Congress is considering two major anti-crime packages.  One
package, sponsored by the Bush Administration, was introduced in
the Senate by Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican, as
S.635 and in the House as H.R.  1400 by GOP Leader Robert Michel
of Illinois.  The second package consists of two bills, S.15 and S.618,
introduced in the Senate by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat
who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
    <P>  Of the two, the Bush package is better -- mainly because it is
realistic about what the federal government can do about street crime
all across America.  The Biden package, by contrast, while containing
some promising proposals, increases federal intrusion into local law
enforcement.  All this will do is spend huge sums of money and
expand the federal bureaucracy, while actually making it more
difficult for local police and prosecutors to capture and convict
criminals.
<P>
       Until recent decades, crimes such as murder, assault and
robbery, and most of what are known as street crimes, were dealt
with by the states and localities in which they occurred, under state
and local laws.  Consistently and wisely the United States has rejected
the need for a national police force to deal with such matters. 
Instead, the federal government has focused mainly on interstate
crimes, on keeping national crime statistics and on helping local law
enforcement officials keep up with the latest crime prevention
techniques.  Not until the late 1960s did the federal government
become deeply involved in local crime issues.  Since then, billions of
federal dollars have been spent on the war on crime -- with no
noticeable success.  In fact, violent street crime in America has grown
worse, rising by 10 percent last year alone. (Washington Post, April
29, 1991, A6.)
<P>
          The Bush anti-crime package recognizes that crime is
best fought locally.  The package thus mainly offers needed
amendments to federal criminal law.  It improves, for example, the
habeas corpus procedure by curtailing the number of times that a
convicted criminal can appeal to federal courts after full and fair
state criminal proceedings have been completed.  The Bush package
also reforms the exclusionary rule, which currently excludes relevant
evidence in criminal trials.  As important, the package does not
significantly increase federal intrusion into local law enforcement
efforts or simply throw more money at the crime problem.
<P>
          The Bush package thus makes a useful contribution to
America's fight against crime.  It is also an appropriate contribution
because it is limited, implicitly recognizing that the kind of crime that
mainly affects Americans is the kind of crime that mainly has to be
fought locally. 
<P>
           Ironically, George Bush does not seem to realize just
how appropriate his crime package is.  His State of the Union speech
this January, for example, and subsequent statements by him and his
Justice Department, talk about the package as if it were a
comprehensive, major federal anti-crime effort.  It is not.  And it is
not what America needs.  The White House would serve the nation
well by bringing presidential rhetoric into line with the President's
crime proposal.  So doing, it would remind Americans that states and
localities in the past, when unhampered by federal red tape, by and
large kept America's streets safe.
<P>
          In contrast to the Bush package, the Biden anti-crime
bills would accomplish very little, and actually would create yet new
obstacles to local attempts to deal with crime.  While the Bush crime
package would cost no new money, Biden wants to spend $4 billion
extra annually.  His bills would erect new mountains of red tape by
requiring the Executive Branch to submit ten new annual reports to
Congress.  The Biden package would intrude the federal government
further into local crime prevention efforts and would make local
criminal justice systems less responsive to the needs and concerns of
their citizens.  Biden, for instance, would inject the FBI into such
family disputes as wife-beating.  And it would establish what in
essence would be a racial quota system for the death penalty.
<P>
          The Biden package thus would take America further in
the direction towards having a national police force and this then
further would blur the roles of the federal and state governments in
crime prevention.
<P>
          Americans face two distinct views on the crime
problem.  One, offered by Bush, focuses on the concept that laws
must be reformed to ensure that the guilty go to jail.  The other,
offered by Biden, holds that America must spend much more federal
money fighting crime and increase the police power of the national
government.  The Bush vision is clearly preferable.
<P>
<B> STATE VERSUS FEDERAL ROLES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE </B>
<P>
     Until the late 1960s, America's states and localities had
virtually exclusive responsibility for fighting violent street crime.  The
reasons for this are clear.  Criminals are arrested by local police. 
They are indicted under state and local laws.  They are tried in state
or county courts.  And they are sentenced to serve time in state or
county prisons. 
<P>
           The federal government traditionally has concerned
itself only with interstate crimes or crimes involving international
activities and to provide certain assistance for local law enforcement
officials.  These activities have included:
Fighting foreign drug cartels and organized crime groups like the
Mafia. 
<P>
 Compiling and disseminating research, statistics and other
information such as the number of crimes committed in each
jurisdiction in America; 
<P>
Providing information and limited training to local law enforcement
officials in advanced crime fighting techniques.
<P>
Collecting and maintaining a nationwide file of criminal records and
fingerprints. 
<P>
 Researching and developing scientific and technological advances
such as improved uses of "genetic fingerprinting" to identify suspects. 
  <P>    Not until Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Omnibus Crime and Safe
Streets Act did the federal government significantly intervene in local
crime.  This Act had broad support in Washington and among big-city
mayors and police chiefs.  After the Act was passed, the mayors,
predictably alert for revenue sources other than from their own
taxpayers, continued to pressure Congress for more anti-crime aid. 
Through subsequent amendments to the Act, Congress vastly
increased the amount of federal money devoted to local crime
problems.
<P>
          In addition to money, Congress also has approved using
federal manpower to fight local crime.  Example:  the 1988 Omnibus
Anti-Drug Act made possession of any amount of an illegal drug a
federal crime.  The result:  Thousands of street level drug-dealers
have been arrested by federal agents. 
<P>
           Despite this increased federal assistance, violent crime
rates jumped throughout the 1970s.  They did so also in the 1980s,
although at a slower rate than before.  Thus, federal intervention in
local crime has had little discernible impact aside from confusing the
issue over ultimate responsibility for attacking the problem.
<P>

<B> THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Bush Administration has drafted and supports legislation
that closes loopholes in the federal system.  It does not attempt the
kind of grand crime-fighting strategy that likely would make matters
worse.  Many of the changes will affect only federal criminal
procedures and thus will have little impact on street crime. 
<P>
           Measures in the Bush package include:

<P>Reform of Habeas Corpus.  
<P>
          The Bush bill would reform the habeas corpus system. 
Habeas corpus generally refers to the right of individuals, guaranteed
by Article I, Section 9 of the U.S.  Constitution, not to be detained
without being charged with a crime.  The Bush bill does not deal with
this constitutional aspect of the right, but instead with what experts
call the statutory right of habeas corpus, enacted in 1867 and
expanded since by federal judges. 
<P>
           The statutory habeas corpus allows state prisoners to
petition federal courts for a review of their cases after they have
exhausted state remedies.  Lawyers for death row inmates in
particular have made substantial use of this as a device to postpone
executions.  Other inmates have inundated federal courts with pleas
to overturn sentences; typically these inmates argue that, at their
trials, they lacked effective counsel or that their trial procedurally was
flawed. 
<P>
           With few exceptions, these petitions raise frivolous
issues and are dismissed in federal court -- but only after they
consume enormous amounts of court time.  Last year alone, some
11,000 habeas corpus petitions were made by state prisoners to
federal courts.  Declares former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
"I know of no other system of justice structured in a way that assures
no end to the litigation of a criminal conviction.  [This] system is
viewed with disbelief by lawyers and judges in other countries."
(Report to the Attorney General, Federal Habeas Corpus Review of
State Judgments, p.  viii, (1987).)
<P>
     The Bush package would help reduce this tidal wave of
petitions by setting, in most cases, a time limit for federal habeas
corpus application of one year after the state prisoner exhausted his
or her state remedies.  The bill, in addition, would require federal
judges whenever possible to uphold state court decisions.  This
provision also would apply to petitions involving most death penalty
cases. 

     
<P>
     

<P>Reform of the exclusionary rule.
<P>
          The "exclusionary rule" is so named by legal scholars
because it allows judges to "exclude" from the court's proceedings
relevant evidence found through what have been claimed to be illegal
searches.  Excluding such evidence often allows guilty defendants to
go free.
<P>
          The basis for the exclusionary rule is the Fourth
Amendment which states that 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The right of people to be secure in their persons,
     houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable
     searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no
     warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
     by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
     place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
     seized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          The Fourth Amendment says nothing explicitly about
excluding evidence.  But, the Supreme Court stated in its 1914 Weeks
v.  United States ruling that courts would be sanctioning violations of
the Fourth Amendment if the material gathered through illegal
searches could be admitted into evidence. (Weeks v.  United States,
232 U.S.  383 (1914).)  This ruling was extended to criminal
proceedings at the state and local level by Mapp v.  Ohio in 1961. 
Over the years, this and other court decisions have allowed many
criminals to go free merely if the police commit even a minor blunder
in collecting crucial evidence.
     <P>     The Supreme Court in 1984 rectified part of this
problem in United States v.  Leon, by creating a "good faith"
exception for searches of private buildings pursuant to a warrant.
(United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S.  897 (1984).)  This means that if a
police offficer has good reasons to believe a search warrant is valid,
evidence gathered pursuant to that warrant must be admitted in
court, even if a judge later decides that the warrant was mistakenly
issued.  The Bush  bill would extend this good faith exception to all
circumstances, such as a car search made without a warrant.  The
number of cases affected, however, will be small; some estimates are
as low as 1.5 percent.  Still it will rid the court system of a loophole
that frustrates the police and creates confusion within the criminal
justice system.  More important, prosecutors will be able to coax
defendants into more stringent plea bargains because defendants will
have less hope of excluding important evidence.
<P>
          Most street criminals, however, are prosecuted in state
courts.  That will diminish the impact of Bush's exclusionary rule
reform because it is the judges on state courts, at least as much as
federal judges, who have been reluctant to recognize a good faith
exception.  They base their reluctance not on the U.S.  Constitution
but on the various state constitutions. 

<P>Expansion of the federal death penalty.  
<P>
          The federal death penalty now can be imposed for
espionage, treason, and murder involving certain federal crimes.  The
Supreme Court has ruled however that for the death penalty to be
enforced, aggravating and mitigating factors in a crime, spelled out in
statutory laws, must be taken into account.  Aggravating factors would
include committing the offense in an especially heinous, depraved and
cruel manner.  Mitigating factors can involve good conduct in jail or
seriously diminished mental capacity. ( See generally, Skipper v. 
South Carolina, 476 U.S.  1 (1986); Lockett v.  Ohio, 438 U.S.  586
(1978);  Barclay v.  Florida, 463 U.S.  939 (1983); Zant v.  Stephens,
462 U.S.  862 (1983).) 
<P>
           The Bush bill would codify a set of mitigating and
aggravating factors, provide for a special hearing to determine
whether a sentence of death is justified, and establish an appeals
process.  This meets Supreme Court standards, and would make the
death penalty enforceable.  Bush also would make 30 currently non-
capital federal crimes subject to the death penalty.  These include
kidnapping where a death results, murder during a hostage taking and
terrorist murders of American nationals abroad.

<P>The "Brady Bill."  
<P>
          The so-called "Brady Bill" refers to H.R.7, introduced by
Representative Edward Feighan, the Ohio Democrat, and recently
passed by the House, and is named after Ronald Reagan's former
press secretary James Brady who was wounded in the 1981 attempt
on the President's life.  This bill would require a seven-day waiting
period on handgun purchases.  During this period, gun sellers would
give the prospective buyer's name to the police, who would have the
option of checking to determine, among other things, if the buyer had
a criminal record, a record of mental illness, a history of drug
addiction, or dishonorable discharge from the armed services. 
Although not originally part of his anti-crime plan, Bush has indicated
that he will sign the Brady Bill if it is included in the broader
legislation.  Despite what appears to be the Brady Bill's broad
emotional appeal to Americans, it is doubtful whether it would have
any significant impact.  Some 17 states already have similar or even
more stringent laws and these have not reduced crimes committed
with guns. 
<P>
          Other provisions of the Bush package would: 

<P>Increase the penalties for firearms violations.  
<P>
     The package would increase from five to ten years the
mandatory federal penalty for using a semi-automatic firearm during
a violent felony; provide a mandatory five-year penalty for possession
of a firearm by individuals previously convicted of a violent felony or
serious drug offense; and, prohibit gun magazines that allow firing
over 15 rounds without reloading.

      

<P>Track youth gangs and other juvenile offenders better.  
<P>
     The Bush package would require the FBI to retain fingerprints
and photographs of juveniles convicted of serious federal crimes. 
Currently it does not keep these records.  The package also would
allow juvenile offenders to be prosecuted as adults for certain crimes. 
And it would count serious drug offenses by juveniles as part of their
adult criminal record, making it easier to define them as "career
criminals" under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

<P>Clarify and expand anti-terrorism laws, including
making terrorism an offense under the Racketeer and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) which was originally intended to combat
organized crime.

<P>Make it easier to prosecute sexual assault and child
abuse cases, and stiffen penalties for repeat offenders.  
<P>
     The Bush package would broaden the Federal Rules of
Evidence to allow courts to consider prior sexual and child abuse
offenses by the defendant.  Inasmuch as states usually adopt changes
made in the Federal Rules, this change is likely to be far-reaching.

<P>Provide for drug testing in the criminal justice
system.  
<P>
     Federal convicts placed on parole, probation or post-
imprisonment supervised release would have to submit to drug tests. 
If they are found to be using illegal drugs, they will be jailed.  The
Bush package would also affect state criminal justice systems,
requiring them to institute a vaguely defined drug testing program.
<P>

<B> EVALUATING THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The most significant parts of the Bush package -- habeas
corpus and exclusionary rule reforms -- are long overdue.  Such
changes would send an important message:  Americans are fed up
with a justice system that shows too much concern for criminals and
not enough for law-abiding citizens.  This is a message that state
legislatures surely will find hard to ignore.  If similarly tough
measures are enacted by states and localities, street crime very likely
would start dropping.
<P>
          The Brady Bill, by contrast, does little but divert
attention from the most serious crime issue:  America's dysfunctional
criminal justice system.  From the founding of the U.S.  until the mid-
1960s, guns were readily available, yet murder rates remained
minuscule compared to those of today.  What changed from the mid-
1960s onward was not the availability of handguns, but the nature of
the criminal justice system.  It stopped working efficiently. 
<P>
           Most of the Bush package is sound, focusing on federal
criminal matters without further interfering with state and local crime
prevention efforts.  Bush could have made an even greater
contribution to fighting crime, however, if he had told the American
people that the best place to fight crime is at the state and local level. 
Instead, he has left the misleading impression that his crime package
will seriously attack the problem, thus giving credence to the idea that
Washington can solve the crime problem, an idea belied by the
specific provisions of Bush's own package.
<P>

<B> THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     One of Biden's bills, S.15, ostensibly seeks to combat violence
against women, while Biden's omnibus bill, S.618, covers some of the
issues in the Bush bill.  Biden would expand the number of crimes
eligible for the death penalty and increase federal penalties for gun-
related crimes.  Measures in the Biden package include: 

<P>Money for Drug Prisons. 
<P>
          Biden proposes $600 million to build, and $100 million
to operate, a new system of regional federal prisons capable of
holding 12,000 prisoners.  The regional prisons would accept from
state systems violent offenders with drug abuse histories and less than
two years left on their sentences.  At the regional facilities, the
prisoners would receive drug treatment.  States would reimburse the
federal government for 100 percent of the cost of those prisoners who
fail to complete the drug treatment program, and 75 percent for those
who do complete it. 

<P>An ROTC for Police.
<P>
          The U.S.  military offers Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) on many college campuses, paying part of the college
tuition of students who promise to devote a certain number of years
to the military after graduation.  Biden proposes $430 million
annually in federal funds to create and finance an ROTC-type
program for police officers.  The Police Corps Program, as it is to be
called, would offer scholarships to college students who agree to work
in a state or local police force for four years after graduation.  The
federal government would pay for education only.  States and
localities would guarantee police positions for graduates and pay
salaries.

<P>Boot Camps.
<P>
          The Biden package would establish 10 federal military-
style boot camp prisons, each to accommodate between 200 and 300
young first offenders and drug abusers.  The theory is that boot
camps, with their tough discipline and absence of career criminals,
could prevent young people from become repeat offenders. ( See,
Billie S.  Erwin and Lawrence A.  Bennett, "New Dimensions in
Probation:  Georgia's Intensive Probation Supervision," National
Institute of Justice, 1987.) 

<P>Violence Against Women Act.
<P>
          To reduce violence against women, despite statistics
that confirm that men are far more likely than women to be the
victims of violence, Biden has introduced The Safe Homes for
Women Act.  It states that, "Any person who travels or causes
another...  to travel across state lines or in interstate commerce with
the intent to injure an intimate partner" and who does injure that
person can be jailed for up to 20 years. ( S.  15, section 211.) 
<P>
           This bill's price tag is almost $560 million a year, spent
mainly on grants to states, Indian tribes, cities, and other localities "to
develop effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to
combat violence against women."  This includes training police and
prosecutors to identify crimes against women, such as sexual assault
and domestic violence; and developing training and expanding units
in police departments and prosecutors' offices that specifically target
violent crimes against women.  Up to $100 million each year would
be spent in areas of "high intensity crime" against women.  Another
$190 million a year would be used for general grants to the states,
and $10 million would be authorized to combat crime against women
in the Indian tribes. 
<P>
           The bill explicitly makes wife-beating a federal crime
for any person who travels across state lines and "does an act that
injures his or her spouse or intimate partner."  Biden thus implies that
the FBI should become involved in what hitherto has been a matter
for local police.  When added to laws that already involve the federal
government in local law enforcement, such as those laws aimed at
arresting street drug dealers, this continues the trend of replacing the
local cop with federal law enforcement officers. 
<P>
           Among other provisions of the Biden package:

<P>Establish new task forces and commissions and
require agencies to file ten new reports to Congress.  
<P>
          Among the new reports would be those that 1) would
measure whether banning assault weapons reduces violence and drug
trafficking; 2) would track the progress of the proposed Police Corps
along with a separate, special report which would recommend
whether to expand the program; 3) would review the efficiency of
traditional criminal justice approaches to preventing crime and
violence through findings of the Commission on Crime and Violence,
and the findings of the National Commission on Violent Crime
Against Women, which would evaluate the adequacy of current
efforts to reduce the rate of violent crimes against women; and, 4)
would identify problems of record keeping of criminal complaints
involving domestic violence. 

<P>Amend the U.S.  Sentencing Commission guidelines to
double the federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and increases
them on first-time rapists.  
<P>
<P>Provide money to reduce crime in public parks, mass
transit and national parks.  
<P>
          The bill would authorize up to $35 million for lighting
and surveillance cameras in such places as bus stops, parking lots,
subway stations and recreation areas.  Money may also be spent to
install emergency phone lines, hire additional security personnel, and
for "any other project intended to increase security and safety."  Up to
$10 million would go to states and local public bodies or agencies to
cut crime in public transportation, $15 million to the National Park
System; and $10 million to states for use in public parks.

<P>Create new rules of evidence to make it more
difficult to question in court an alleged victim about her sexual
history. 
<P>
          Under Biden's law, reputation or opinion evidence of
the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim would not be admissible
unless the defendant intends to offer evidence of specific instances of
past sexual behavior and notifies the court in writing at least 15 days
before the trial.  Then a hearing would be held in which the judge
determines whether the evidence is relevant and outweighs the
danger of unfair prejudice against the victim.  If it meets those
criteria, it may be admitted at trial.  Currently, many courts lack
procedures to prevent juries from hearing the embarrassing, yet not
necessarily relevant, disclosures of the alleged victim's sexual history.

<P>De Facto Racial Quotas for the Death Penalty.
<P>
          In what Biden calls the Racial Justice Act of 1991,
Section 2922(a), states:  "No person shall be put to death...  if that
person's death furthers a racially discriminatory pattern." ( S.  618,
Chapter 177, section 2922 (a).)  This means that if 70 percent of all
murderers are white, then 70 percent of all death penalties must be
carried out against white people.  Importantly, it also means that if 80
percent of all murder victims are black, 80 percent of all death
penalties must be carried out against people who murder blacks.  If a
contrary statistical pattern emerges, the Biden bill stipulates the
government must show through "clear and convincing evidence" that
non-racial factors "persuasively" explain the disparity.  Thus, a new
round of trials, hearings and appeals would be tacked on to already
lengthy criminal procedures and protections.  Justice no longer would
aim solely at punishing an individual criminal for his or her individual
crime.
<P>
 <B> EVALUATING THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Biden bills will cost taxpayers almost $4 billion a year. 
Yet there is little indication that this spending significantly would
reduce violent crime.  Example:  Of the $1 billion meant for state
and local law enforcement, New York City's share would probably
place no more than two additional policemen on the street per shift,
per precinct. 
<P>
           The other spending provisions also are unlikely to
reduce crime rates noticeably.  The drug prisons will hold only 12,000. 
The boot camps for young, first-time offenders will hold only a
maximum of 3,000 inmates.  The Biden package thus would do little
to ease prison overcrowding.  It is estimated, for example, that the
states need an extra 500,000 spaces for prisoners.  As bad, the Biden
package ignores a key proposal to help states with overcrowded
prisons:  H.R.  1001 sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican, would change the federal tax code to allow tax
exempt state bonds issued to finance private prisons.  Biden failed to
include a similar measure which would combat the high cost of
constructing and maintaining new facilities.
<P>
          In contrast to most of the Biden package, the proposal
for a ROTC-like program to train 20,000 police annually has merit. 
College educated police tend to set higher standards for themselves. 
No new funds, however, need to be spent on this ROTC.  The $430
million annual cost of the program should be paid with money
currently available in the Department of Education budget.
<P>
          Biden's legislation is not the major assault on America's
crime problem that he claims; it is not even a minor assault.  If his
real goal is to encourage experimentation, then he should leave this
to the states, which traditionally have been America's best
laboratories of social experiment. 
<P>
           Biden's package, moreover, errs seriously in increasing
federal involvement in the fight against violent street crime.  Fighting
crime -- like collecting garbage, fire-fighting or lighting streets -- is a
state and local responsibility.  Entangling the federal government in
the battle against street crime muddies the lines of responsibility and
creates confusion over which officials should be held accountable for
the local crime situation.  If citizens want another policeman on their
block, they should not have to call their Congressman, who might
then try to prod a lethargic federal bureaucracy. 
<P>

 <B> HOW THE STATES CAN FIGHT CRIME </B>
<P>
      Crime is the ultimate local problem.  Often attacker and
victim come from the same neighborhood, and almost always from
the same city or county.  Localities, moreover, fight crime differently. 
This leads to experiments that reveal what works and what does not.
<P>
          States should encourage such innovation by their cities
and counties.  States also can take other actions to bolster local
police effectiveness.  For one thing, states might spend more money
on prosecutors and judges if the courts are the source of delays in
criminal proceedings.  This would make real to criminals the threat of
a trial, conviction and punishment. 
<P>
           For another thing, states can add prison capacity.  If
funds are short, the states could turn to private companies to
construct and operate prisons.  In Louisiana and Kentucky, among
other states, this has cut costs.  Indeed, a National Institute of Justice
study conservatively estimated savings at between 4 percent and 15
percent in privately run prisons. ( Charles H.  Logan and Bill W. 
McGriff, "Comparing Costs of Public and Private Prisons:  A Case
Study," NIJ Reports, National Institute of Justice, U.S.  Department
of Justice, September/October 1989.)  With such savings possible,
state and local governments could afford to build more cells each
year.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The antidote to violent street crime lies in the hands of state
and local officials and the voters who elect them.  States and
localities can hire more judges, prosecutors and public defenders; can
appoint and elect judges who will enforce the law rather than bend
the state constitutions to favor criminals; and can hire private firms to
build and manage their prisons.       
<P>
          The federal government, of course, has a role in
fighting crime.  It can keep interstate criminal records such as
photographs and fingerprints, maintain nationwide crime statistics,
continue to research high technology police methods, and handle such
interstate problems as organized crime.  But, the day-to-day police
work, prosecutions and imprisonments must be left to local
authorities.  Washington-based officials know this.  They thus should
stop misleading voters by claiming that the federal government can
have a big impact on violent street crime.
<P>
          Of the two major crime packages being considered by
Congress, the Bush version is the better.  It makes reasonable
proposals to ensure that the guilty go to jail, and once in jail, restrains
convicts from jamming the federal courts with frivolous habeas corpus
petitions.  Furthermore, the Bush package does not inject the federal
government significantly into local problems.
<P>
          By contrast, the Biden package assumes that
Washington can solve America's crime problems if only the federal
government spends enough money.  It unduly would expand,
moreover, the role of federal law enforcement in local crime fighting
-- something that if done on a small scale will have little impact, and
if done on a large scale, can threaten civil liberties.  And the Biden
package actually takes a racial quota approach to death penalty
executions.
<P>
          The principal job of government is to protect the life,
liberty and property of the citizens.  Crime prevention thus is a
matter demanding the highest attention of government.  But it is at
the state and local level that the criminal justice system, from the
policeman on the street to the judges in the courtroom to the prison,
succeeds or fails in its task.  More direct federal intervention, as
mandated by the Biden package, would add more confusion and
bureaucracy, making the crime problem not better, but worse.<P>

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>

<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<title> The Case For and Against Natural Law - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture #469</b>

<h3>THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST NATURAL LAW</h3><P>
<b>By Russell Kirk </b><br>
July 15, 1993<br>

<P>

     The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly
growing vaster.  All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on
"The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the
subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of
natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and
constitutional government.
<P>
      A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in
very recent years.  It was objected to Judge Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge
Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that
he did believe in natural law.  These protestations came mostly from
the same group of senators.  Clearly a good many public men and women
nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term
natural law.
<P>
     Objectively speaking, natural law, as a term of politics and
jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of
action prescribed by an authority superior to the state.  These rules
variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law
and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment;
from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long
experience of mankind in community.
<P>
     But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. 
For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing
the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and
jurisprudence.  When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for
human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous -- as with the
unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the
ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged
most nations since the First World War.
<P>
     The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of
Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying
circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. 
As Alessandro d'EntrevSs writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact
nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics."  And, he
concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist
of his own limitations....   This point where values and norms
coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the
beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two
thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<P>
     On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive
or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws
of nature" in a scientific sense -- that is, from propositions
expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena.  Also
natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural
rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval
concepts of natural law.
<P>
     The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's De
Re Publica.  The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still
exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth
century by Froude:  "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less
imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either
succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and
disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true
principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<P>
     As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the
medieval Schoolmen and Canonists -- Thomas Aquinas especially -- the
legacy of the classical jus naturale endured with little challenge
until the seventeenth century.  In England during the sixteenth
century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity.  In the Christian world the natural law was
received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal
conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason.  But with
the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth
century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop,
conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius
and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf.  This latter secularized concept of
natural law was held by many of the philosophes of the eighteenth
century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was
vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not
extinguished.  It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his
distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. 
Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the
Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has
experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<P>
     During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were
overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by
the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal
positivism; and later -- particularly in the United States -- by legal
pragmatism.  In the United States, the older and newer schools of
natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of
the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by
positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law.  Yet
appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in
American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals,
from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<P>
     The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and
Thomistic understanding of the natural law -- to an apprehension of
Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species.  Sir Ernest
Barker put thus the idea of natural law:  "This justice is conceived
as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the
universe from the Being of God and the reason of man.  It follows that
law -- in the sense of the law of the last resort -- is somehow above
lawmaking."
<P>
     The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be
found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C.  S.  Lewis's
little book The Abolition of Man.  Therein Lewis distinguishes eight
major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together
with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of
cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries.  He
expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special
Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children
and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity;
the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity.  No code of the laws of
nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that
body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down
decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and
thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land" -- or the
Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian
Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus,
the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom.  Nevertheless, such perpetual
precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father
and mother.
<P>
     So much, succinctly, by way of definition.  Turn we now to the
difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. 
Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law
and the moral imagination.  Incidentally, I am helped here by an
unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and
praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for
"natural right."  Let me quote English directly:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The natural law cannot be understood except through the
     elements of poetry and imagination in the soul.  The poetic
     and the moral imagination are parts of human reason.  For
     the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of
     God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the
     whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the
     notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make
     children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the
     adolescence or the childhood of the race.  Poets, James
     Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives
     although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of
     political science, the assurance that Justice lives though
     states are imperfect and ephemeral.  Justice is to politics
     what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become
     almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural
law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists.  It is meant
primarily for the governance of persons -- for you and me, that we may
restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life.  Natural law
is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people:  rather, it is
an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to
us through the operation of right reason.  And the more imagination
with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence
of the natural law, and understand its necessity.  If such a one,
despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the
greater must be his suffering.  So I have discovered in the course of
a peregrine life.  And over a good many decades I have found that most
contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of
imagination.  As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Your soul deserves the place to which it came, If having
     entered Hell, you feel no flame.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Such is the case for the importance of natural law.  Permit me to
turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal
positivists -- most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans
Kelsen.  They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions;
they hold that the state is the only true source of law.  The views of
John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar:  all law is
decreed by the political sovereign, they hold.  Rather than moving
abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth
century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently
from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian
magazine Epoche some remarks of mine on natural law.  My correspondent
is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a
naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna.  In politics, I suppose
he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school.  His
communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence
and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of
natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and
deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural
law.
<P>
     "Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used
nowadays, or whether the jus naturale is an old invention," my German
correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. 
There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from
nature.  Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is
only a jus hominis and no jus naturale."
<P>
     
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     "In other words," my friend goes on, 
<P>
     all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human
     beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies
     sapiens....   The order of nature follows in many respects
     the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with
     all its plants and animals in excellent shape.  But mankind
     has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very
     different from natural rules.  Many of these man-made rules
     are quite bad, sinning against nature.... 
<P>
     
     The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus
     comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature.  I
     am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human
     beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies
     sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand
     nature -- which means also the nature of human character. 
     Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of
     men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect
     that people will work for the state rather than for
     themselves.... 
<P>
     
     I offer another example, in which American legislators have
     chosen the wrong solution.  There is a law in the United States,
     if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of
     state.  If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine
     actions, e.g.  by the CIA.  This law is unethical.  Assuming that
     no American president or the American government plans to
     eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he
     is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both,
     then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives
     of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

     We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. 
     What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a
     community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group.  I
     seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear
     distinction between what comes from nature and what comes
     from human efforts.  Human efforts are aimed very often,
     with the best intentions, in the wrong direction.  I mean
     "wrong" in this sense:  against nature, for nature cannot be
     neglected without harming the human race.... 
<P>
     Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to
     destroying a society through leniency.  We have to determine when
     our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract
     nature.  We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we
     decide to kill a dictator, for instance.  We acknowledge the
     right of every nation to use as much force as possible when
     fighting another nation to death.  The fight between nations
     follows what could be called natural right, but is better called
     the rule of nature.
<P>
     For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted,
"nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and
claw.  Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that
not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles,
are human creations merely.  And these human contrivances, he implies,
sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human
institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<P>
     Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the
jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists:  critics
of the whole concept of natural law.
<P>
     Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme
medicine of natural law:  his commendation of tyrannicide.  This is
interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<P>
     German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly
obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law, the
omniscient keeper of the peace.  No law but positive law has been
recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural
law has no place at all.
<P>
     Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and
confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by
national plebiscites.  He was the head of the German state, the source
of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience.  Yet
certain Germans -- army officers, scholars, professional people,
chiefly -- found his actions evil.  By quasi-constitutional means he
had subverted the constitution.  His popularity had become tremendous,
and his military power.  Only by death might he be removed.
<P>
     Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined
to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler.  They had been reared in
the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state.  In this
exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for
justification.  Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the
state?  In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. 
Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in
the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths.  I knew
well Dr.  Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one
of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler.  By nature
Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman.  And being law-abiding,
in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state,
perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<P>
     I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to
positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily.  My only service as a
jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago,
when for two consecutive terms I was elected -- unanimously -- justice
of the peace.  When determining a disputed boundary between two farms,
a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and
meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial
compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common
law, possibly to local custom -- and to the files of the recorder of
deeds at the county seat.  And so it is with the ordinary
administration of law at every level.  Statute, charter, and
prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law --
the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<P>
     Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator;
the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity --
to guide you and me, indeed -- there endures the natural law, which in
essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the
operation of a mundane system of justice.  Unlike my German
correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law
for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the
creation of coffee-house philosophers.  Human nature is not vulpine
nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature.  Natural law is bound up
with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of
humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<P>
     It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural
law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well
for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men"
by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of
parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. 
Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's
experience in community; natural law should have its high part in
shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law
could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions.  Yet were
natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether -- why, then, indeed,
the world would find itself governed by
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The good old rule, the good old plan, That they shall take
     who have the power,And they shall keep who can.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the
American judiciary.  Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned
the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth
century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about
natural law.  Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme
Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of
a sort.  I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the
opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional
districts within the several states must be so drawn in their
boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of
persons within the several districts -- a matter previously left to
the discretion of state legislatures.  In part, this intervention was
founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also
there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the
notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is
"natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe
and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been.  One might
cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school-desegregation cases.   
This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should
appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution.  Here we turn
to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American
political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims
of authority and the claims of freedom.
<P>
     I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes
Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist.  In March 1850, on the
floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his
famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the
Constitution."  He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the
Supreme Court.  At once a hot controversy arose.  In January 1851,
Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in
which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-
Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher
law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<P>
     there is a higher law than the Constitution.  The law of God
     is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every
     human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from
     the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience,
     for "we must obey God rather than men."  This is the great
     truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook,
     which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies,
     and on which the Church never fails to insist.... 
<P>
     But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the
     Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it
     against the Constitution, either by Mr.  Seward or the
     opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law.  Mr.  Seward had no
     right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the
     Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the
     Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by
     which he held his seat....  After having taken his oath to
     support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was
     concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for
     him an open question.  In calling God to witness his
     determination to support the Constitution, he had called God
     to witness his conviction of the compatibility of the
     Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself
     no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in
contravention of the law of God. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and
     therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the
     state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. 
     But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or
     be not repugnant to the law of God?  Here is a grave and
     perplexing question for those who have no divinely
     authorized interpreter of the divine law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had
adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> But this places the individual above the state, and is
     wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil
     government.  No civil government can exist, none is
     conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey
     its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his
     private convictions of what is the law of God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of
the divine law.  He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of
God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's
will on earth. 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Now it is clear that Mr.  Seward and his friends, the
     Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which
     they can appeal from the action of government but their
     private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say,
     their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it
     is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the
     pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all
     authoritative interpretation of the Divine law.  To appeal
     from government to private judgment is to place private
     judgment above public authority, the individual above the
     state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very
     existence of government, and therefore, since government is
     a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God
     -- that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to
     civil enactments....  No man can ever be justifiable in
     resisting the civil law under the pretence that it is
     repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private
     judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private
     interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what
     the Divine law is on the point in question, because the
     principle on which he would act in doing so would be
     repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore
     in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of
     God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Brownson's argument -- which we have not time enough to analyze
in full today -- in substance is this, in his own words:  "Mr.  Seward
and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but
misapplied it."  It was not for them to utter commands in the name of
God.  Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy.  The
arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the
worship of the state.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE> The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the
     principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations
     of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no
     independence.  The state tramples on the spiritual
     prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions
     of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the
     multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and
     progress!</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
     Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which
clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV,
Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War
which burst out ten years later.  "Now there is a right and a wrong
way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the
truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote.  "If men were
less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be
asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and
legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be
vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil
power, and falling into statolatry -- as absurd a species of idolatry
as the worship of sticks and stones."
<P>
     Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these
passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument
various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<P>
     As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the
American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points.  Large
elements of natural law entered into the common law of England -- and
therefore into the common law of the United States -- over the
centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of
jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman
jurisconsults.  No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed
of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by
magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that
any state keeps the peace through a system of courts.  It simply will
not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should
be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<P>
     Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the
persons who are lawmakers -- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics,
aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy.  The
civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law -- which
originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any
state had been established."
<P>
     It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside
the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their
private interpretations of what the law of nature declares.  To give
the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an
archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional
republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling
decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly
distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law.  Only
the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the
laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the
inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of
papal encyclicals.  Left to their several private judgments of what is
"natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and
the republic.  The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of
Roe v.  Wade -- in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously
unknown, was discovered -- in actuality amounted to a declaration of
the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<P>
     Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts
always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature,
and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right.  Courts of law must
ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise
the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<P>
     In the seventh edition of The Conservative Mind, I have written
that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a
transcendent order, or body of natural law.  Political problems, at
bottom, are religious and moral problems.  A narrow rationality, which
Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human
needs....   True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the
Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<P>
     Now Mr.  Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of
natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now
endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this.  In an essay
entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr.  Bork advises my
friend Mr.  William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this
sort.  "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily
disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to
preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such
values derive from a transcendent order."  One might as well say, I
suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the
Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not
Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<P>
     I have thought highly of Mr.  Bork -- although he seems to have
no clear understanding of natural law and its function -- but he
appears to have thought lowly of me.  Perhaps we both have been
mistaken.
<P>
     That federal judges, Mr.  Bork included, have not been learned in
the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. 
When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of
Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope
that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man.  The natural law
lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man's hand may be
raised against every other man's.<P>

     <P>
Woodrow Wilson, 1885 (As quoted in Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson:
Revolution, War, and Peace (Arlington Heights, Il: Harlan Davidson,
Inc., 1979,) p. 5.)

<P>

     Thirty years after offering this stern assessment of democracy,
President Wilson in 1915 invaded Haiti. His reason, he explained to
one White House visitor, was to "teach the South American republics to
elect good men!" (As cited in Allan R. Millett, Semper Fidelis: The
History of the United States Marine Corps (New York, NY: The Free
Press, 1991), p. 183. Millet's history of the 1915-1934 occupation is
one of the best available, and is the source for events described in
this paper, unless otherwise indicated. ) Five presidencies later,
Franklin Roosevelt in 1934 withdrew the U.S. Marines after a nearly
two-decade occupation that left Haiti no closer to democracy than when
Wilson sent them in.
<P>
     Oblivious to the central truth of Wilson's earlier statement --
that democracy "is built up by slow habit" -- President Clinton is
poised to repeat Wilson's mistake and invade Haiti to "restore
democracy." On July 25, Clinton Administration officials at the United
Nations circulated a draft resolution that would permit member states
to use "all necessary means" to reinstall deposed president Jean-
Bertrand Aristide. (Warren Strobel and Stewart Stogel, "U.S. sets the
stage for Haiti invasion," The Washington Times, July 26, 1994, p.
A1.) This is well-understood diplomatic parlance for "military force."
To emphasize the point, Clinton has dispatched a naval task force of
some dozen ships, including a 2,000-man Marine Expeditionary Unit, to
Haitian waters. Meanwhile, units of the Army's XVIIIth Airborne Corps
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, have over the past several weeks
conducted high-visibility training exercises.
<P>
     The question regarding a possible invasion is not whether U.S.
forces can defeat the 7,000-member Haitian military. That force has
very little artillery, no combat aircraft, and probably no more than
two hundred small arms rounds per man. (The Military Balance,
1993-1994 (London: International Institute for Strategic Studies,
1993), p. 187.) Few doubt the ability of the United States to occupy
Haiti in short order.
<P>
     The real question for the Clinton Administration is: Then what?
After having occupied Haiti, what will be the mission of that military
force? What can U.S. forces expect as they attend to that mission? And
what conditions must be met for its return to the United States? The
Administration's ability to answer these questions inspires little
confidence. As House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee Hamilton
(D-IN) has noted, "We are not thinking enough about what happens after
the invasion. There are concerns all around about the exit strategy."
(Tim Zimmerman, et al., "Caribbean cruise," U.S. News & World Report,
July 18, 1994, p. 37.) 
<P>

<B> NOT PANAMA, NOT GRENADA</B>
<P>
     In public statements on a possible invasion, Administration
officials have suggested that they intend to get U.S. forces in
quickly, kick out the junta, then remove U.S. combat troops and turn
the mission over to a multinational peacekeeping force. This quick
"exit strategy" would be patterned after either the invasion of
Grenada in 1983 or of Panama in 1989.
<P>
     But there are more differences than similarities between these
two countries and Haiti. Unlike Haiti, both Grenada and Panama had
functioning institutions and economies before the invasion; U.S.
forces could exit without creating a vacuum in their wake. Grenada was
part of the British Commonwealth whose titular head of state was a
Governor-General appointed by the Queen of England. Panama is the
permanent home of over 10,000 U.S. troops. It is also a hemispheric
banking capital and a de facto member of the U.S. commonwealth, where
the dollar is the legal tender. By comparison, Haiti is one of the
poorest nations in the world, with a per capita income of under $300
(before the U.S.-led embargo destroyed 95 percent of light
manufacturing jobs) and an illiteracy rate over 80 percent.
<P>
     Another difference is the threat to American lives, the proximate
cause for each of the earlier invasions. The Clinton Administration
has begun to refer to such a threat as a justification for the
military build-up around Haiti. But Americans in Haiti are safe; the
Administration has not reported a single instance of government-
induced violence toward any of the more than 3,000 Americans living in
Haiti. Indeed, a U.S. Embassy spokesman noted in a recent interview
that "as of right now, we know of no direct threats to Americans" (CNN
interview with Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy, Port-au-Prince,
broadcast July 26, 1994.)
<P>
     By contrast, in both Panama and Grenada, threats to Americans
were widespread, well-known, and directly attributable to government
actions. There were nearly one thousand U.S. medical students in
Grenada, where a shoot-on-sight curfew -- imposed after a Marxist coup
d'etat -- had been announced several days before the invasion. In
Panama, harassment of U.S. citizens by government troops had begun as
early as May 1989. This culminated in December 1989, when four off-
duty Marines were stopped at a Panamanian check-point. After an
altercation, the Panamanians opened fire on the American car, killing
one of the Marines. This was followed by the torture of an off-duty
naval officer and sexual assault of his wife by Panamanian Defense
Force soldiers. President Bush ordered the invasion the next day. In a
news conference less than a week later, he cited his reasons: "[T]he
death of the Marine; the brutalizing, really obscene torture of the
Navy lieutenant and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror
inflicted on that [officer's] wife;... the fact that our people
[weren't sure that] we could guarantee the safety of Americans there."
(David Adams, et al., "U.S. Invades Panama," Newsweek, January 1,
1990, p. 20.)
<P>

<B> HAITI: D-DAY PLUS ONE</B>
<P>
     Despite his rhetoric about safeguarding American lives, Clinton
has made no similar case for action in Haiti. A more likely model than
Grenada or Panama for a potential invasion of Haiti is the first U.S.
invasion of Haiti, executed also in the name of "democracy." Whether
American troops will remain this time for twenty years is an open
question. But the challenges facing an occupation force today would be
similar to those of eight decades ago. Before sending American troops
into Haiti to "restore democracy," President Clinton should explain to
the American people that those troops will be responsible for:
<P>
     
<B> Disarming the Haitian people</B>. 
<P>     Administration officials recently acknowledged that this would be
a high priority for occupation forces. (Daniel Williams, "If U.S.
Invades, Plans Call for Disarming Haitians," The Washington Post, July
21, 1994, p. A24.) But they give little indication how this might be
accomplished. In the 1915 invasion, the U.S. commander offered a
reward for each weapon turned in. (Brenda Gayle Plummer, Haiti and the
United States: The Psychological Moment (Athens, GA: The University of
Georgia Press, 1992), p. 93.) This did little to stop the gradual
escalation in violence that led ultimately to nearly 200 American and
probably five times as many Haitian casualties during the two-decade
occupation.
<P>
     More recently, disarming the various warring factions was a
priority for U.S. peacekeepers in Somalia after the June 1993 attack
on the U.N. operation. Despite a concentrated effort, over two-dozen
American servicemen lost their lives in armed exchanges several months
after the initiative was launched. 
<P>
<B> Protecting American citizens</B>. 
 <P>    The Administration has used this as a rationale for invading in
the first place. In a July 3 television interview, Clinton special
envoy William H. Gray III declared that "[t]he president has
responsibility to protect American lives.... [T]here is great concern
that we must be prepared to protect American citizens." (As cited in
Ann Devroy and Bradley Graham, "As Pressure Builds, U.S. Intensifies
Efforts to Recruit Peacekeepers for Haiti," The Washington Post, July
4, 1994, p. A20.) But some 3,000 Americans remain in Haiti despite the
junta's crackdown, and the Administration has not recounted one
instance of threats to Americans. Indeed, the common refrain from
American businesspersons and relief workers has been that they feel
safe -- "unless there is an invasion." (One American relief worker, a
Catholic nun who has been in Haiti for more than ten years, provided
representative testimony during a National Public Radio interview
broadcast on July 18, 1994.)
<P>
     Should there be one, the threat to Americans from Haitians
opposed to Aristide's return would be real. So while subduing whatever
armed resistance they may meet and maintaining calm in the crowded
slums of Port-au-Prince, U.S. troops would also have to contend with
organizing, protecting, and perhaps evacuating several thousand
Americans.
<P>
<B> Defeating guerrilla forces</B>. 
<P>     Initial opposition to the July 1915 invasion was light; two U.S.
sailors in the landing party were killed, probably by "friendly fire."
(Millet, op. cit., p. 185.) But this passivity was soon replaced by
the rise of well-organized guerrilla bands and their supporters
numbering in excess of 10,000. Bloody exchanges with the U.S. forces
culminated in a 1929 uprising by an armed mob in which U.S. Marines
killed or wounded dozens of Haitians. The resulting American
government investigation led eventually to the 1934 withdrawal of U.S.
forces.
<P>
     This history, together with recent experience with armed tribal
factions in Somalia, demands that the U.S. be ready for a similar
response to another invasion of Haiti. It appears that U.N. Secretary
General Bouros Boutros-Ghali has learned this lesson, even if the
Clinton Administration has not. Reluctant to see a U.N. peacekeeping
force left vulnerable after a U.S. evacuation, Boutros-Ghali recently
advised Administration officials that he would be unable to raise and
finance the 12,000- to 15,000-member multinational force the White
House has said will be necessary to pacify Haiti after an invasion.
(Ann Devroy and Bradley Graham, "U.S. Units Ready to Invade but
Clinton Is Said to Be Weeks From Decision," The Washington Post, July
17, 1994, p. A21.)
<P>
<B> Serving as Aristide's "palace guard."</B>
  <P>   Inasmuch as a U.S. invasion would be directed against the very
military and police forces responsible for civil order, their defeat
would require the occupation force to assume that responsibility. In
addition to crowd control, maintaining public order, and patrolling
Haiti's largest cities, this force would also have to provide
protection to Aristide. That could be a challenge; his divisive and
uncompromising approach to governance during his brief tenure as
Haiti's elected president led to two coup attempts (one successful)
and at least one assassination attempt against him.
<P>
     To ensure Aristide's survival, the Clinton Administration will
have to make Haiti essentially an American protectorate. This was the
objective of the 1915-1934 occupation; the September 1915 treaty
between the two countries called for, among other things, "the
creation of an American-officered national constabulary, and the use
of American engineers and public health officials to reform the public
works and sanitation systems." (Millet, op. cit., p. 185.)
<P>
     Those objectives differ little from those outlined by Senator Bob
Graham (D-FL), a leading proponent of a U.S. invasion, during recent
Senate debate: "[I]t is going to be necessary to have a very effective
political reform, starting with the separation of the police from the
military, and economic reform, starting with creating the stimulus for
the private sector to commence activities again.... " (Congressional
Record - Senate, July 14, 1994, p. S8967.) Who will do this
"separating" and "creating" after the combined effect of the U.S.
embargo and invasion have turned Haiti into a de facto U.S. colony?
<P>


<B> BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE</B>
<P>
     It is not too late for the President to step back from the threat
of using force to reinstall Aristide. Clinton has already demonstrated
a remarkable ability to reverse course on major policies; indeed, his
Haiti saber-rattling belies his October 1993 declaration: "I have no
intention of asking our young people in uniform... to go in there to
do anything other than implement a peace agreement.... " Changing his
policy now will save American lives from being squandered in pursuit
of democracy in this hemisphere's least democratic country. (For a

Foreign Policy Reversals In His Own Words," Heritage Foundation FYI
No. 19, June 20, 1994.)
<P>
     To defuse this crisis of his own making, Clinton should take two
actions immediately:
<P>
<B> Lift the economic embargo on Haiti.</B>
  <P>   Since economic sanctions were intensified on June 16, nearly
25,000 refugees have left Haiti in pursuit of a better life anywhere
else. Nearly 16,000 refugees remain in what is little more than a
concentration camp at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Meanwhile, the military leaders against whom the sanctions supposedly
are targeted appear unaffected. Representative Bill Richardson (D-NM)
recently was the guest of junta leader Raoul Cedras at a five-hour
dinner/discussion; presumably the table was full.
<P>
     Economic sanctions are a blunt and usually ineffective instrument
of foreign policy. August 2 marks the four-year anniversary of
sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait; Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein has outlasted the American leader who imposed them. The
Serbian leadership in Bosnia has just rejected the West's latest
cease-fire proposal, despite the tough sanctions imposed on their
principal supporters in neighboring Serbia. In Haiti, sanctions
imposed after the 1991 coup against Aristide have only destroyed the
subsistence economy there and created the very refugee crisis the
Administration now cites as a principal justification for ending the
stalemate by force.
<P>
     Lifting the embargo will ease the immediate crisis and allow
refugees to return to a better life in Haiti. It is a necessary first
step to a negotiated solution to this tragedy.
<P>
<B> Appoint a presidential commission to examine other options</B>. 
<P>     The Senate defeated by a party-line vote an amendment offered by
Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) to appoint a bi-partisan
congressional commission to assess "the humanitarian, political, and
diplomatic conditions in Haiti and [report] to the Congress on the
appropriate policy options available to the United States.... "
(Congressional Record - Senate, July 14, 1994, p. S8940.) This option
would have resulted in a 45-day "cooling off period" that Clinton
could have used to generate bi-partisan support for a new policy
toward Haiti.
<P>
     In appointing a commission, Clinton would be responding to
democratic forces in Haiti. The Haitian Chamber of Deputies, whose
members can claim democratic legitimacy equal to Aristide's since they
achieved office in the same election that brought Aristide to power,
has consistently proposed negotiation over confrontation. Recalling
Nelson Mandela, who "achieved a consensus that has allowed formation
of his new government," Haitian Deputy Duly Brutus counseled this
approach in a recent Washington Post editorial. (Duly Brutus,
"Alternative To Invasion," The Washington Post, July 7, 1994, p. A19.
Deputy Brutus was elected in December 1990 (when Aristide was elected)
and served as president of the Chamber of Deputies in 1991.) 
<P>
     Clinton is right to oppose a congressionally mandated commission;
the President is the constitutionally designated executor of U.S.
foreign policy. He should take the initiative away from the Congress
and appoint his own commission. In other crises, he has shown no
aversion to last-minute negotiations: he sent former President Jimmy
Carter to North Korea to make one last appeal for negotiations to end
the nuclear weapons program in that country. If Clinton is willing to
conduct negotiations with a communist dictator bent on acquiring
nuclear weapons, certainly there can be little danger in doing the
same with a petty military junta in poor Haiti.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION
</B><P>
     The history of Haiti is a sad one, made no better by a two-decade
U.S. military occupation in the name of democracy. In the seven years
prior to the 1915 U.S. invasion, seven successive presidents were
overthrown by force. This has been the norm in the nearly two
centuries since Haiti's independence. Aristide is only the latest to
receive such treatment. In response, the U.S.-led economic embargo and
threats of another invasion only have increased the misery of a
population that has been promised "democracy" in return.
<P>
     Before adding American casualties and more Haitian deaths to his
strange policy brew, Clinton must explain to the American people
exactly what a U.S. invasion would entail. If he fails to do so, he
should not be surprised when angry Americans demand an explanation why
even a single U.S. life should be lost to "restore democracy" to a
country that has never known it.

	 For most Americans, housing quality has been climbing for
decades.  This is obvious by looking at almost any measure.  From
1960 to 1987, for example, dwellings lacking complete plumbing
facilities fell from 13.2 to 2.4 percent.  Those with central air
conditioning rose from 1.9 to 35.8 percent.  More important, perhaps,
the fears that the nation would not be able to provide housing for the
huge baby boom generation were unfounded.  By now, the baby
boom population almost entirely has found and moved into their own
housing.  Not only is this good news for the baby boomers, it also
means that America need not build as much housing in the next
decade as it has in the past.  The projected growth in new households
during the 1990s will be almost one-tenth slower than during the
1980s.
<P>
	 Yet despite these cheerful indicators, there are cries on
Capitol Hill that America confronts a menacing housing crisis. 
Within the past two months, the House and the Senate have passed
housing bills which rest, to a great extent, on such an assumption. 
The House bill (H.R.  1180) would spend $28.7 billion and the Senate
Bill (S.  566) $27.9 billion for fiscal 1991.  Both far exceed the $23.7
billion requested by the Bush Administration.   
<P>
 		 Shifting the Focus. Championing the congressional
measures, predictably, are the beneficiaries of big federal housing
outlays:  builders and realtors, "professional advocates" for the
homeless, and state and local officials.  Even their arguments,
however, reveal how much the American housing situation has
improved.  No longer do they denounce, as they used to, the quality
of housing.  Instead they have shifted their focus to affordability,
charging that the private sector produces many houses and
apartments that few can afford.  They claim, incorrectly, that millions
of young adults face the prospect of never being able to buy their first
home.  As evidence, they cite the slight decline in the ratio of owner-
occupied dwellings during the first half of the Eighties (which has
since been reversed), the "high" rent burdens on low-income
households, and the prospect of federally-subsidized owners of low-
income housing projects preferring not to renew their government
contracts.<P>

		  Federal Construction No Answer. To be sure, there are
housing problems in America.  But they are not the sort addressed by
the recently-passed House and Senate bills and certainly not the sort
that can be solved by enormous new sums of federal construction
money.  This is especially true for poor renters.  What they need is
greater purchasing power for housing, jobs near where they live, and
a reduction in crime and other factors that make their neighborhoods
unlivable.  This is much more essential than constructing tens of
thousands more publicly-subsidized units that lock the less fortunate
into the same apartment indefinitely, and at high taxpayer cost.
<P>
		  For homeowners and first-time homeseekers, the
problem is not getting more government-built housing, but reducing
regulation and other barriers that discourage private investment. 
Rent control, unreasonable building codes, and exclusionary zoning
all restrict the housing choices of homebuyers. 
<P>
		   In the present housing situation, several realities
cannot be ignored:  The supply and condition of America's housing
stock is adequate; demand over the next decade for new housing will
lessen; and the current national housing market is not "tight" with
respect either to availability or cost.

<P>
AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE SUPPLY
<P>
Abundant Housing Stock
<P>
	 During the past two decades, America has created more
housing than households.  In 1987, the U.S.  had an inventory of
102.7 million dwellings, a 49.5 percent increase over the 68.7 million
in 1970. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Housing Reports,
Series H-150-87, "American Housing Survey"; biannually.  All figures
from the American Housing Survey are taken from the 1987 survey
unless otherwise noted.  Results from the 1989 survey will be
published in late 1991.)
<P>
	   In fact, over one-third of America's current standing housing
stock has been built during the past two decades (assuming new
additions since 1987), the very period when pronouncements of a
housing shortage were becoming commonplace.
<P>
		  During this same 1970-1987 period, the number of
households grew by about 26 million, and the total population by
about 39 million. ("American Housing Survey.")  For each net
additional household, America produced 1.3 dwellings, and for each
net additional person, America produced almost 0.9 dwellings -- and
these figures already allow for demolitions and other inventory losses. 
The supply of housing thus has kept pace with need.
<P>
Few Housing Deficiencies

	<P> Standards as to what constitutes "good housing" typically rise
with improving technologies and rising real incomes.  Early in this
century, for instance, a three-room cold-water flat was regarded as
adequate housing for a young middle-class family -- at least as starter
housing; it would be unacceptable today even for a few months. 
<P>
		   Write George Sternlieb and James Hughes of Rutgers
University's Center for Urban Policy Research:  "When we were rich
we threw away housing; when we were of modest circumstances we
found it charming.  The very elevation of America's housing standards
and the real estate boom that characterized the era [the Seventies]
joined together in an enormous level of demolition and nonresidential
use." (George Sternlieb and James Hughes, "Private Market Provision
of Low-Income Housing:  Historical Perspective and Future
Prospects," in Preserving Low-Income Housing Opportunities: 
Principles for a 1990s Housing Preservation Strategy, Fannie Mae
Annual Housing Conference (Washington, D.C.:  Federal National
Mortgage Association, 1990), p.  7.)  The authors point out that the
U.S.  produced housing during 1970-1987 at a rate high enough to
raze many older, rundown dwellings without diminishing the supply.

	<P>	  Good Housing Overall.  The American Housing Survey
data in Table 1 highlight the overall good condition of the U.S. 
housing stock.  Among the major categories of housing deficiencies,
only water (primarily faucet) leakage occurred to any significant
extent.  Less than 5 percent of housing units had either holes in
floors, open cracks or holes, broken plaster, or exposed wiring.  Less
than 0.1 percent had no electrical wiring.
<P>
		  Table 2 demonstrates, using traditional measures of
housing quality, how far the nation has come in eliminating
substandard housing.  These figures are for housing conditions of
below-poverty-level households only. (The Census Bureau defines
poverty level status according to a family of four's cash income.) 
Over 95 percent of all poverty-level households in 1987 had complete
bathroom facilities, complete kitchen facilities, sink, refrigerator, and
stove/oven.  Almost 50 percent had air conditioning.
<P>
New Homes and Homebuyer Expectations 
<P>
	 During 1970-1988, the median price of a new single-family
home in constant (1988) dollars rose from $71,783 to $112,500, an
increase of 56.7 percent. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Construction
Reports, Series C-25, "New One-Family Houses Sold and For Sale,"
annually.)  While a good share of this may be plain housing-cost
inflation, a large part of the cost increase pays for increased quality,
as is clear from Table 3.  Median interior square footage increased by
over 30.7 percent, and the percentage of dwellings with central air
conditioning, one or more fireplaces, and more than 2.5 bathrooms all
increased by at least 85 percent.  The boost in home prices, therefore,
largely reflects features which are increasingly viewed as minimum
amenities by American homebuyers. 
<P>
		   To assess potential homebuyers' higher expectations, a
survey last year of present homeowners by the National Association
of Home Builders asked:  "If you cannot afford to buy the type of
home you want, what would you give up to make it more affordable?"
(National Association of Home Builders, What Home Buyers Want: 
Executive Summary (Washington, D.C.:  National Association of
Home Builders, 1989).)  Some 36 percent chose a house with
unfinished rooms, and 35 percent would live farther from work or
shopping.  Only 18 percent would accept a smaller house, and only 11
percent would accept fewer amenities. 
<P>

 AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE DEMAND
<P>
Slower Population Growth
<P>
	 During America's baby boom from 1946 through 1964, the
annual birth rate averaged nearly 25 births per 1,000 population. 
From 1965-1975, the rate declined to just under 15.0, climbing only
slightly to between 15.5 and 16.0 in the 1980s. (U.S.  National Center
for Health Statistics, Vital Statistics, annually.)  The Census Bureau
projects that from 1985 to 2010, the total U.S.  population will rise
29.0 million. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population
Reports, Series P-25, No.  1018, "Projections of the Population of the
United States by Age, Sex, and Race, 1988 to 2080," Washington
D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1989.)  Those in the 35-54
age bracket -- mainly today's baby boomers -- make up over 90
percent of the increase.  These are overwhelmingly people who by the
close of the 1980s had established their own households; they are not
seeking housing for the first time.  By contrast, the number of people
aged 18-34 will decline by about 8.6 million. 
<P>
		   As a result of these population shifts, the demand for
quality housing (especially owner-occupied) will increase, but the
demand for new housing units (especially renter-occupied) will be
lower then during the 1980s.  In every five-year interval during 1985-
2010, the number of people aged 35-54 will increase.  Among persons
aged 18-34 and 55-64, the cumulative population will decrease over
the whole period.
<P>
		  Also noteworthy, during 1985-1990, the gain will be over
11 million people; during 1990-1995, it will be less than 10 million;
and during 1995-2000, barely over 8 million.  Therefore, because
population will be increasing at a steadily slower rate, future housing
demand, other things held equal, will be lower than at present.
<P>

Slower Growth in Number of Households
<P>
	 The Census Bureau projects that the number of households
will increase by 11.7 million between 1990 and 2000 (1.17 million per
year), with those aged 35-54 accounting for 11.2 million of the
increase. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports,
Series P-25, No.  986, "Projections of the Number of Households and
Families:  1986 to 2000 (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government
Printing Office, 1986).)  Households headed by persons 34 and under
will decrease by 1.0 million.  By contrast, the number of households
increased by 1.25 million per year between 1980 and 1988 (a total of
11.3 million).  Total households will grow by 6.1 million during 1990-
1995, and 5.6 million during 1995-2000.  Because of this smaller
growth in the number of households, America will need less new
housing in the 1990s than in the past two decades.  New housing will
have to focus more on single-family needs than before. 
<P>

 Household Type
<P>
	 The types of households accounting for the growth are as
important as the increase in the number of households.  Chart 1
indicates that there was a smaller ratio of households of married
couples with children in 1988 than in 1980.  In 1980, some 60.8
percent of all households consisted of married couples, of which
slightly over half had at least one child under 18.  In 1988, this figure
declined to 56.9 percent, of which slightly under half had at least one
child under 18.  Single-parent families accounted for a larger share of
all households in 1988; collectively, single-parent families with
children increased from 12.9 to 14.6 percent of the total. (.S.  Bureau
of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-20, No.  432,
"Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living Arrangements: 
March 1988," (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office,
1989).) 
<P>
		   Over the past decade, the portion of non-family
households increased, and close to one-fourth of all households now
consist of one person.  A number of factors account for this increase
in single-person households.  Because the median age of first
marriage has steadily gone up for men and women since 1970, more
single young adults have their own households before marriage.  A
more important factor is the decline in the remarriage rate by about
20 percent during the 1980s among both divorced men and women.
(The median age of first marriage was 22.5 and 20.6 for men and
women, respectively, in 1970; it rose to 25.1 and 23.3 in 1986.  Vital
Statistics.) 
<P>
		   Incorrect Interpretation.  Some critics complain that
the growth in the proportion of non-family households signals an
increase in the number of those who are among the least well-off, and
therefore an increase in those in need of government assistance.
These critics incorrectly interpret the statistics.  Non-family and other
non-traditional households have emerged partly because they can
meet their housing costs.  The median household income of single-
person households in 1987 was $12,544 while per capita household
income for married couple households (with a national median of
3.27 persons per household) was only slightly over $10,000.  Among
female-headed families with children, with 3.13 persons per
household, the per capita income was $4,926, the lowest for any
category.  Having no husband present reduces the family's median
income by over half.  And while it is true that the availability of
subsidies helps the family afford housing, it is likewise true that the
incentive of the mother to marry or remarry may be reduced in the
process. (See Charles Murray, Losing Ground:  American Social
Policy, 1950-80 (New York:  Basic Books, 1984), pp.  154-166.)
<P>
		   According to Martha Riche, editor of American
Demographics, most people will get married, but will remain so for a
shorter period of their adult lives.  This is especially true for women. 
As a result, "the very definition of a house -- a single-family dwelling
-- is going to change because at any given time a greater share of
adults with money in the bank and a desire for a house will not be in
families." (Quoted in H.  Jane Lehman, "Future Shock:  Society
Redefining the Home Buyer," Washington Post, May 12, 1990.)  If her
argument is valid, then if anything, the changing household
composition would indicate a lessened need for subsidies. 

<P>
AMERICA'S HOUSING SITUATION:  THE MARKET
<P>
Fewer Persons Per Dwelling
<P>
	 Very little housing overcrowding remains.  In 1960, the average
household size was 3.33 persons; in 1980, it fell to 2.75; and in 1988,
to 2.62. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports,
P-25, (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office)
annually.)  The current housing stock affords individual privacy for
more people than ever before.  Even among the poor, fewer than 8
percent live in dwellings where there is more than one person per
room. ("American Housing Survey," Public Use Sample.)
<P>

Increasing Vacancy Rates
<P>
	 One of the effects of the high level of construction during the
past two decades has been a substantial increase in the vacancy rate
for rental units.  This has been especially noticeable in the past few
years.  In 1983, the total rental vacancy rate stood at 5.7 percent; in
1988, it was 7.7 percent. 
<P>
		   Advocates for the homeless who press for expanded
federally-subsidized new construction ignore the fact that there are
almost 9 million vacant housing units for rent or sale year-round. 
This is about fifteen dwellings for each homeless person, based on
last year's Urban Institute estimate of close to 600,000 homeless
persons nationwide. (Martha R.  Burt and Barbara Cohen, America's
Homeless:  Numbers, Characteristics, and Programs That Serve Them
(Washington, D.C.:  Urban Institute, 1989).)  These vacant units are
not "tenements" or "slums."  They contain a median of 4.3 rooms; 95
percent have at least one complete bathroom; and close to half are
single-family homes. ("American Housing Survey.")

<P>
The Myth of Declining Owner-Occupancy
<P>
	 Possibly the most enduring illusion about housing in the 1980s
is that Americans, particularly first-time home buyers, can no longer
afford to buy a home.  Those who lobby for publicly-financed new
construction use one statistic to particularly great effect:  In 1980,
some 64.4 percent of all occupied units were owner-occupied; in 1985,
the figure fell to 63.5. ("American Housing Survey:  1985.")  From this
modest decline in homeownership, federal program advocates
conclude that young Americans no longer can afford to own their
homes and thus that America's first-time buyers need massive new
federal assistance. 
<P>
		   This shift is misleading.  For one thing, from 1985 to
1987, the decline in homeownership rate reversed, increasing to 64.0. 
For another, even had the rate not risen, the homeownership rate
depends upon demographic trends that are ignored in the critics'
analysis.  Typical of this failure is the 1988 report by the Joint Center
for Housing Studies of Harvard University. (William C.  Apgar and
H.  James Brown, The State of the Nation's Housing (Cambridge,
MA:  Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 1988).) 
It claims that if the homeownership rate since 1973 had held steady
for under age 35 households, 2 million additional households would
now be homeowners.  This proves, says the study, that
homeownership is becoming more elusive for young households.  This
study is cited extensively by the real estate lobby in pushing for
federally-subsidized new construction such as those contained in the
Senate legislation.

		  Non-Family Households Growing.  The problem with
the Harvard report is that it fails to take into account the
proportional growth of non-family households.  Irving Welfeld, policy
analyst at the U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development,
points out that the homeownership rate for both married and single
households under 35 increased during 1980-1985.  The rate for
married households increased from 74.7 percent to 78.8 percent, and
for singles households from 45.0 percent to 46.9 percent.  Welfeld
concludes, "The modest decline in the overall homeownership rate
reflects the strong shift in the 1980s toward more single-person
households with a lower propensity to own." (Irving Welfeld, Where
We Live:  The American Home and the Social, Political, and
Economic Landscape, from Slums to Suburbs (New York:  Simon &
Schuster, 1988), p.  223.)  The changing household composition rather
than prohibitive housing costs explains the apparent decline in the
homeownership rate in the 1980s.

<P>
Exaggerated Cost Burdens:  Homeowners   
<P>
	 On balance, the evidence from a number of sources indicates
that with the exception of a few metropolitan markets on the East
and West coasts, a home was one of the economic bargains of the
past decade.  The 1987 American Housing Survey reveals that the
median monthly housing cost for homes with a mortgage was $621;
the monthly cost for homes owned free and clear was $203.  The
respective inflation-adjusted figures for 1980 were $504 and $176.
("American Housing Survey.") 
<P>
		   Data from Chicago Title and Trust Company's annual
home buyer's survey reveal that the monthly mortgage payment for
home buyers increased from $599 to $1,054 during 1980-1989, (Who's
Buying Houses in America:  Chicago Title's 14th Annual Survey of
Recent Home Buyers (Chicago:  Chicago Title and Trust Company,
1990); also see 1980 edition.) but the ratio of monthly cost-to-gross
income decreased from 32.4 percent to 31.8 percent.  Even more
revealing, the portion of home buyers who were buying for the first
time increased from 32.9 percent to 40.2 percent, with one-third of
the increase occurring during 1988-1989.  The median purchase price
for first-time buyers increased from $61,450 to $105,200 (71.2
percent) over 1980-1989, but during the same period the median
income of the first-time buyer increased from $27,430 to $50,700 (84.8
percent). 
<P>
		   Declining Home Prices.  Also noteworthy are figures
from the National Association of Realtors' monthly, Home Sales
(formerly Existing Home Sales), which focuses on the cost of existing
homes rather than new construction.  The median price of an existing
single-family home in 1980 was $93,600, and in 1989 it declined to
$93,100 in constant (1989) dollars.  Many housing experts, in fact,
predict that home prices in the 1990s will rise more slowly than in the
1980s because of the plentiful supply. (Gary Blonston, "Era of Big
Profits on Sales May Be Over," Washington Post, May 12, 1990.)
<P>
		  Recent data in the Home Sales Housing Affordability
Index also contradict the notion of "unaffordable" homes.  In 1984, a
median income family had 89.1 percent of the income necessary to
qualify for a conventional 80 percent mortgage loan; in 1989, this
same family had 106.1 percent of the necessary income. (National
Association of Realtors, Home Sales, Vol.  4, No.  4 (April 1990),
p.12.)  Incomes relative to home prices therefore increased by nearly
20 percent. 
<P>
		   For first-time buyers, the Index increased from 64.9 to
74.2.  This means that the typical renter family in the 25-44 age
bracket in 1984 had 64.9 percent of the income required to qualify for
a mortgage on a typically priced starter home, assuming a 10 percent
downpayment; by 1989, this typical renter had 74.2 percent of the
requisite income.  Viewed from the standpoint of either all home
buyers or first-time buyers, a home has become less expensive over
the past decade due to increases in family income. 
<P> Exaggerated Cost Burdens:  Renters
<P>
	 Renters are less well-off financially than homeowners.  As
such, low-income renters face higher housing costs than individuals
who are able to buy a home.  Yet there is little evidence that there is
a critical shortage of low-cost rental units. 
<P>
	   	The 1987 American Housing Survey indicates that
renters had paid a median monthly gross rent of $399.  In 1980, this
median rent, when adjusted for inflation, had been $335.  The
increase was 19.1 percent in real dollars.  This, however, was largely
offset by increases in income.  According to the Census Bureau, after
adjusting for inflation, the median income for all households rose
from $25,426 to $27,139 during the 1980-1987 period, or 6.7 percent, 
excluding the rapid growth in nontaxable fringe benefits such as
medical insurance.  This offsets the 19.1 percent real increase in rents
by over a third.  The median rent-to-income ratio, meanwhile, rose
only from 27 percent to 29 percent. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census,
Current Population Reports, Series P-60, annually; "American
Housing Survey.")
<P>
		   "Unaffordable" units are generally defined as those that
generate rents (excluding utilities) exceeding 30 percent of household
income.  According to Table 4, some 50 percent of the rental stock is
readily affordable.  Housing advocates read into this that the other 50
percent is "unaffordable."  This is not true, at least with respect to the housing.  It may be true with respect to the income of the poor.  This distinction is extremely important.  It determines whether improving
the housing situation of low-income renters requires building more
housing or increasing the income that the poor can spend on housing. 

<P>
	 Underreporting Income. The professional housing lobby,
moreover, significantly underrestimates the income which poor
families have available to pay rental costs.  Housing interest groups
frequently note that according to U.S.  Census data, over half the
poor pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent.  Yet federal
data also show that the total annual expenditures on all items by low-
income households equals 320 percent of the alleged income of those
households.  Obviously, there is a problem with the statistics.  The
problem is not that poor households lack income to pay for rent,
food, and other necessities.  The problem is that the Census Bureau
dramatically underreports their income. (U.S.  Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Expenditure Survey:  Quarterly
Data, 1984-1987 (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing
Office, 1989), p.16.)
<P>		  A key factor in the Census Bureau's miscalculation of
the income of the poor and near-poor households is that the Bureau
excludes non-cash incomes.  This enormously distorts the poor's
income because 73 percent of all government assistance to the poor
now is in such noncash forms as Medicaid, food stamps, and housing
subsidies.  In 1988, federal, state, and local governments provided
over $173 billion in welfare assistance to low-income households.
(Vee Burke, Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited
Income:  Eligibility Rules, Recipient and Expenditure Data, FY
1986-88 (Washington, D.C.:  Library of Congress, Congressional
Research Service, October 24, 1989), p.6.)

<P>	 Of this total, only about $27 billion is counted as "income" by
the Census Bureau.  Cash and non-cash welfare assistance, which the
Census Bureau and housing lobbyists fail to include in calculating the
income of American families, equals about $10,000 for each poor
household in the U.S. (Robert Rector and Kate Walsh O'Beirne,
"Dispelling the Myth of Income Inequality," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  710, June 6, 1989.) 
<P>
		   Generous Subsidies. Housing aid is a significant part of
support for the poor and thus must be part of any assessment of
whether the poor can afford rents.  According to a national study by
the Urban Institute, roughly half of all poverty renter households
receive government assistance in the form of housing subsidies,
welfare payments or both. (Sandra J.  Newman and Anne B. 
Schnare, Subsidizing Shelter:  The Relationship between Welfare and
Housing Assistance (Washington, D.C.:  Urban Institute, 1989).) 
Indeed, roughly 20 percent of the 7 million low-income renter
households receive both.  In the mid-1980s, the period of the study,
these transfer payments amounted to about $20 billion annually, or
almost $6,000 per subsidized poor renter household. (Newman &
Schnare, Subsidizing Shelter, pp.  ix, 2.) 
<P>
		   Evidence from the latest study by Harvard's Joint
Center for Housing Studies reveals a similar pattern.  In 1987, some
54.4 percent of all poverty-level renters were receiving a subsidy, and
19.0 percent received both housing and income subsidies. (William C. 
Apgar, Jr., Denise DiPasquale, Jean Cummings, and Nancy McArdle,
The State of the Nation's Housing, 1990 (Cambridge, MA:  Joint
Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 1990), p.  35.) 
Subsidized low-income renters paid $188 in monthly rent in 1987
(1989 dollars); unsubsidized low-income renters paid $360. (Apgar, et
al., p.  21.)  This housing assistance is ignored by housing advocates
who press for new construction subsidies.

		<P>  Critics of Reagan Administration housing policies often
forget that during Ronald Reagan's two terms, the number of low-
income households receiving housing assistance climbed from about
3.1 million to 4.3 million. (Scott A.  Hodge, The Myth of America's
Housing Crisis, Washington, D.C.:  Heritage Foundation, 1990, p.  6.) 
 Moreover, in 1987, about 5 million households, or over 70 percent of
the poor renters, paid less than the median monthly rent of $399.  Of
this total, about 2 million paid less than $200.  This figure does not
include any of the 600,000 poverty households who paid no cash rent
at all. ("American Housing Survey.") 

	<P>	   The truth is that low-income rentals are, as a whole
and by any conventional definition, "affordable."  Plenty of rental
housing is available.  If there is shortage of anything, it is not of
rental units but of sufficient rental income to allow landlords to
realize a reasonable return on their investment and thus give them an
incentive to keep their property in good condition.  Anthony Downs
of the Brookings Institution in his 1983 book, Rental Housing in the
1980s, points out that in the inner city, rents often do not even cover
carrying costs. (Anthony Downs, Rental Housing in the 1980s
(Washington, D.C.:  Brookings Institution, 1983), p.  114.)  This is as
true today as it was then.  This problem can be addressed only by
giving the poor ways to increase their incomes -- through greater
opportunities for full-time work, through incentives to maintain
nuclear families, and through vouchers to be used as part payment of
rent. 

<P>
 Rental Market Absorption 
<P>
How soon would newly-constructed rental housing be occupied if it
were completed today?  The evidence indicates here as before that
the U.S.  needs fewer new rentals now than a decade ago.  In 1980,
some 75 percent of all new apartments (five or more units per
building) had been rented within three months of completion.  In
1988, this figure had fallen to 66 percent, a decline occurring in all
regions of the country. (U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Current Housing
Reports, Series H-130, Washington, D.C., U.S.  Government Printing
Office, annually.) 
<P>

 SOURCES OF ALLEGATIONS
<P>
	 The insistence in the face of all the evidence to the contrary
that America faces a critical housing shortage -- and thus needs
massive federal subsidies for housing construction -- comes from three
distinct special interests. 
<P>
		   1) The real estate lobby.  Realtors, builders, and
lenders benefit most from new production and below market interest
rate housing subsidy programs.  Predictably, therefore, the National
Association of Realtors in 1988 called for the annual construction of
2.1 million dwellings, and the rehabilitation of 313,000 additional
units from 1988 through 2002, at a cost of $112 billion annually in
private and public investment. (Raymond J.  Struyk and Christopher
Walker, America's Housing Needs to the 21st Century (Washington,
D.C.:  National Association of Realtors, 1988).)  This, among other
things, would build close to 500,000 more units than the average
annual production during the high construction period of 1983 to
1987.  The National Association of Home Builders in 1987 advocated
a similar high-production program. (National Association of Home
Builders, A Blueprint for National Housing Policy (Washington, D.C.: 
National Association of Home Builders, 1987).)
<P>
		  2) Federal housing program advocates. Repeatedly,
they claim that housing is prohibitively costly and that this causes
homelessness.  Typical of such lobbies is the National Coalition for
the Homeless.  A 1987 report issued by the organization, still
reflecting the way it thinks today, states, "By far the most significant
cause of widespread homelessness is the increasing scarcity of
affordable housing.  Over the past few years, large numbers of low-
rent units in both the public and private housing markets have been
eliminated.  As a result, poorer Americans are now being squeezed
out of their homes and onto the streets." (National Coalition for the
Homeless, Homelessness in the United States:  Background and
Federal Response (Washington, D.C.:  National Coalition for the
Homeless, May 1987), pp.  5-6.)  The Institute for Policy Studies
argues similarly in a 1989 monograph, "Most simply stated, today for
more and more Americans, the dream of an adequate, affordable
home is no longer attainable.  On the contrary, the dream is fading
rapidly.  In terms of choices, security, neighborhood conditions, and
especially costs, the housing available to Americans is getting worse."
(Institute for Policy Studies, Working Group on Housing, The Right
to Housing:  A Blueprint for Housing the Nation (Oakland, CA: 
Community Economics, Inc., 1989), p.  2.)  This monograph is the
basis for H.R.1122, introduced in February 1989 by Representative
Ronald Dellums, the California Democrat, that seeks eventual
nationalization of the entire housing stock. 
<P>
		   3) State and local government officials, like the State
Council of Governments, the National League of Cities, and the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors.  Scarcely a month passed during the Eighties
without some mayor or governor blaming Congress and the Reagan
Administration for creating a nationwide housing crisis.  At last
October's "Housing, Now!"  rally in Washington, D.C., for example,
Ohio Governor Richard Celeste, a Democrat, said that a 75 percent
"cutback" in HUD's budget is the reason for homelessness. (Quoted
in Chris Spolar and Al Kamen, "Thousands March on Mall in Mass
Appeal for Affordable Housing," Washington Post, October 8, 1989.) 
In reality, HUD's annual budget was not cut at all; it increased from
$14.9 billion to $20.3 billion between the years 1981 and 1989.  In a
speech last year to the National League of Cities, Phoenix's
Democratic Mayor Terry Goddard, blamed the same alleged budget
reduction for the current housing "shortage." (Quoted in Karen
Diegmueller, "Middle America:  Priced Out of House and Home,"
Washington Times, March 15, 1989.)  The National Association of
Housing and Redevelopment Officials argues that the U.S.  will need
an additional 8 million new low-income units by 2000. (Ibid.)  These
groups understandably insist that the assistance must come from
Washington, as few state and local officials want to raise taxes
themselves to pay for the housing.
<P>
		  These special interests all seek to discredit vouchers
and other consumer-oriented approaches for improving housing. 
Instead, they want to return housing policy to the days of the costly
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, project-oriented
commitments for new construction and rehabilitation.  While this has
produced good housing, it has helped only a handful of eligible low-
income beneficiaries, and at a high taxpayer cost.  The FHA
programs do nothing for the vast majority of low-income Americans. 
The government could have subsidized far more units through
vouchers -- and with much less waste and influence-peddling.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
	 By every reasonable set of indicators -- demand, supply, and
market -- America is not suffering a national housing shortage,
neither in quantity, quality, or in cost.  To be sure, serious cost
problems exist, especially on the East and West coasts.  Finding a
good single-family home at an affordable price in the Boston or Los
Angeles areas is far more difficult than finding one of equal quality
and space in the Cincinnati or Atlanta areas.  Yet problems of
affordability, in whatever region or metropolis, are more linked to
barriers to supply, like overly strict building codes and exclusionary
zoning ordinances that inhibit the housing industry and households
from adapting to the market, than to an inherent failure of the
market. 
<P>
		   The temptation for Congress to devise solutions to a
trumpeted but putative housing "crisis" eventually may help create a
real one.  Proposals in the Senate bill, for instance, would increase
the federal government's liability for property foreclosures, high as it
is already.  This may threaten stable growth not only in the housing
industry, but in the entire economy. (Ronald Utt,
"Cranston-D'Amato's S.565:  Neglecting America's Poor," Heritage
Foundation, Issue Bulletin No.  152, September 22, 1989, p.  10.) 
<P>
		   Only if housing problems are placed in historical and
economic perspectives can solutions to them be devised.  The task for
policy makers is to enact a housing agenda that eliminates the factors
that inhibit the market from providing quality affordable housing for
all Americans.
<P>
		  On the supply side, localities should discard
exclusionary zoning ordinances which prevent new housing from
being built; anachronistic building codes that inhibit the adoption of
new cost-cutting technologies; and rent control.  Even more
important, the federal government should adopt fiscal and monetary
policies designed to keep taxes and interest rates low.  In a recession,
housing is one of the industries to suffer most heavily.  If housing is
seen as an unprofitable investment, then with or without a web of
government enforcement or subsidies, potential investment will
eventually move elsewhere.   
<P>
		  On the demand side, low-income individuals should be
given government assistance that gives them the freedom to live in
housing of their own choice.  To achieve this, housing vouchers
(which help the poor) should replace housing projects (which help
wealthy builders).  Jobs within reasonable commuting distance of the
poor's housing must be made as plentiful as possible.  The Enterprise
Zone approach, for instance, has created many jobs in Maryland,
Michigan, and other states, and would be more effective if instituted
at the federal level.  Conditions in inner-city neighborhoods must be
made hospitable to residents for housing investment to be attractive. 
No neighborhood can flourish when fear of crime is paramount. 
Hunter College Professor of Urban Affairs Peter Salins, a veteran
observer of New York City housing issues, wrote in 1986, "The heart
of the contemporary housing problem is that many of the poor live in
fairly decent dwellings in rotten neighborhoods, and they have little
money left over after they pay their rent." (Peter D.  Salins, "Toward
a Permanent Housing Problem," The Public Interest, No.  85 (Fall
1986), p.  29.)  His comment is as valid today as it was then.  Housing
policies, therefore, ought to be geared toward enabling the poor to
have more money left over after paying rent, and to live in safe
neighborhoods of their choice.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>While the federal government seems paralyzed at the prospect of
trying to reform America's $800 billion dollar health care system,
several states are beginning to experiment with promising alternatives
to meet the pressing problems of rising health care costs and the
growing number of the uninsured.
<P>
     One revolutionary proposal is based on the principles of consumer
choice and market competition.  This is the Consumer Choice Health
Plan (House Bill 376), introduced in the Maryland state legislature by
Delegate Casper Taylor, a Democrat from Allegany County, and the House
Economic Matters Committee.  Taylor is Chairman of the committee.  The
Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan would dramatically change health
care insurance in the state and control costs through market forces. 
<P>
     If the legislature enacts the bill, which has the support of key
physicians and business leaders who favor a market-based approach,
Maryland would launch an imaginative demonstration project that would
require the Bush Administration to waive existing federal regulations
in the Medicaid program and in the application of the ERISA law,
(ERISA is the acronym for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974.) which, among other things, governs self-insurance by private
firms.  Waivers often are granted to states, and the Bush
Administration has declared that it favors such exemptions as a way of
fostering state-based health care reform. 
<P>
     The Taylor legislation would establish a new health care delivery
system in Maryland that would build upon current private medical
practice and private insurance, but would enhance consumer choice,
assure access, and control costs.  Among the key features of the
proposal: 
     <P>
         Every Marylander must enroll in a health plan.  
<P>
     Under the Consumer Choice Health Care Plan, all individuals and
heads of households are required to enroll themselves and their
dependents in a health care plan.  Even Maryland citizens receiving
Medicaid benefits would receive a voucher to pay for acute care.  The
only exception to this legal requirement is for individuals covered by
Medicare, the huge federal program that provides health care services
to elderly and disabled American citizens.
<P>
 <UL> All Marylanders would be assured at least a basic,
         comprehensive health benefits package.  </UL>
<P>
     Under the legislation, all qualified health care plans would have
to offer a comprehensive set of benefits that are "comparable" to
those found in typical employer-based insurance, including well-child
care and preventive medical services.
<P>
 <UL> Tax credits and vouchers would offset the cost of a 
         family's health plan.</UL>
<P>
     Every Maryland citizen would receive state tax credits or
vouchers to help buy insurance.  Families normally would receive a tax
credit, but low-income people below the tax threshold would receive
vouchers.  These credits and vouchers would be income-based on a
sliding scale.  The credits or vouchers would cover the full cost of
the standard insurance plan for low-income Marylanders with an annual
family income of $13,359 or less, declining to 50 percent of the cost
of the basic plan for households with a family income over $100,000
per annum.  Marylanders could choose to purchase supplemental
insurance, but this extra insurance would not be eligible for voucher
or tax credit assistance. 
<P>
<UL> Medicaid would be "voucherized." </UL>
<P>
     The entire acute care Medicaid program in Maryland would be
replaced with the comprehensive voucher program for low-income
Maryland citizens.  The new vouchers would pay 100 percent of the
premiums of the standard insurance plan for a family of four below the
official poverty threshold of $13,359.  In other words, current
Medicaid beneficiaries would have access to the same basic health care
plan as every other citizen in Maryland.  Under the federal waiver,
the state share of Medicaid spending, plus the current matching funds
provided by the federal government, would be used to help finance the
vouchers for low-income people.
<P>
        <UL> The tax treatment of health costs would be 
         radically reformed. </UL>
<P>
In return for tax relief in the form of tax credits or vouchers,
health insurance benefits provided by employers henceforth would be
treated as taxable compensation for the purpose of state income tax. 
Furthermore, to ensure budget neutrality for the entire program,
Maryland would institute a payroll tax, to be paid by employers, to be
set at an estimated four percent. (The payroll tax is estimated
because it is set as the amount needed to make the entire program
budget neutral.  Thus it will depend on the program's outlays.)  The
authors of the proposal also expect some savings from reduced Medicaid
costs, increased use of managed care or programs which impose some
controls on the use of medical services, and sharp reductions in the
costs of treating previously uninsured residents.  Funds from these
sources would keep the necessary payroll tax to a modest level. 
<P>
 <UL> Employers would have new responsibilities. </UL>
<P>
     While employees could choose a health plan offered by their
employer, they would not be required to do so to enjoy the tax credits
or vouchers.  Under the legislation, they are free to choose other
health care plans that meet basic state requirements.  For example,
they might choose a plan offered through an employee organization or a
trade or business association.  The employer's new role is to arrange
for the availability of group insurance plans that meet Maryland's new
specific benefit standards.  This means employees could choose any
plan they wished, or a plan brokered by their employer.  Besides
acting as a broker for employees, employers also could supplement
state tax credits with a financial contribution to improve the
employee's benefit plan.
<P>
 <UL> Insurance rules would be reformed. </UL>
<P>
     Maryland insurance carriers today normally underwrite large group
insurance on the basis of experience.  This means rates each year are
based on the previous medical costs of the group.  For small groups,
insurance usually is written on the basis of geography, industry, age,
sex, family status, and experience, including medical condition. 
Under the Taylor bill, insurers would have to institute "modified
community rating" categories, adjusted for age and sex.  Thus insurers
would be prohibited from charging different premiums, or rates, to
different groups within a given area or community, except for
variations in insurance premiums based on age and sex.  In addition,
insurers could not drop coverage for individuals or groups because
they had been costly to insure.  Further, all participating insurers
would have to meet specific financial solvency requirements and
incorporate managed care programs.  This means that insurers in
Maryland would be required to demonstrate their ability to manage both
the cost and the quality of care, and use "common" billing forms.  The
proposed use of electronic billing to process claims is designed to
reduce the cost of cumbersome health insurance paperwork.
<P>
     The debate in Maryland mirrors that now taking place in many
other states and in Congress.  There is a national consensus emerging
on what is wrong with America's health care system:  soaring costs,
gaps in coverage and the fact that over 35 million people are without
even basic insurance protection.  And like most lawmakers, Maryland's
state legislative leaders believe that only fundamental reform will
deal with the health care system's problems and so are examining the
very foundations of the system.  Supporters of the leading health care
reform proposal in the Maryland state legislature, the Consumer Choice
Health Plan, also believe that the key to radical reform is to
introduce strong consumer choice and genuine market competition by
changing an unfair and inequitable tax code that limits the access to
health care by low-income working families and that discourages
families from seeking cost-effective health plans.
<P>
     While there are some significant differences, the Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan broadly resembles the Heritage
Foundation's Consumer Choice Health Plan. (See Stuart M.  Butler,
Ph.D., "A Policy Maker's Guide to the Health Care Crisis, Part II: 
The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Talking
Points, February 12, 1992.)  Both propose universal coverage for every
family through a package of basic health care benefits.  Both would
reform existing tax support for health insurance, replacing current
tax breaks for employer-provided insurance with a comprehensive system
of tax credits or vouchers.  Both would target the greatest degree of
tax relief or public assistance to individuals and families who need
it most.  Both would stimulate intense competition within a reformed
insurance market, requiring insurance companies to seek the allegiance
of consumers rather than merely the consumers' employer.  And both
would finance universal coverage and tax relief in a "budget neutral"
fashion. 
<P>
     While Congress seems unwilling or unable to tackle America's
continuing health care crisis, reform already is underway in several
states.  A variety of approaches are being proposed or enacted,
ranging from "single payer" government insurance systems, to "play or
pay" mandates on employers, to small group insurance market reform
initiatives.  In the unique federal order that characterizes America's
political system, the states are thus fulfilling a traditional role as
laboratories of democratic government.  Maryland, in particular, has a
rich tradition of innovative social and economic policy, and is
setting the pace for health care reform based on spurring consumer
choice and competition.  Indeed, if Maryland's leading proposal is
enacted into law, it could become the model for national health care
reform. 
<P>

THE MARYLAND HEALTH REFORM DEBATE<P>
     In February of this year, the Maryland State Legislature's House
Economic Matters Committee held three days of hearings on the three
major proposals for reforming the state's health care system:  a
single-payer health insurance model, along the lines of the Canadian
system; a "play or pay" proposal, which would require Maryland
businesses either to provide their employees with a private insurance
policy or pay a tax to support a public plan for families not in an
employer-sponsored plan; and a market-based consumer choice plan,
which would give tax credits to help Marylanders buy a plan.  At the
conclusion of these hearings, the Committee voted down the "single
payer" option and "play or pay" proposal, and unanimously reported out
an amended version of H.B. 376, "The Consumer Choice Plan," for
consideration on the floor of the House of Delegates.  In commenting
on the extensive debate and deliberation in the House Economic Matters
Committee, the Baltimore Sun called the hearings an "eye opener" for
state legislators, adding that only one of the three plans being
discussed by the Committee had any chance of advancing.  Said the Sun
editors: 
<P>
 <UL> The enormous price tag of the Canadian-style "single 
     payer" plan remains its major impediment.  This proposal, 
     which would provide universal health care coverage with a 
     state board setting an annual budget for all healthcare 
     spending in Maryland, has only a few advocates.  Nor is 
     there much enthu siasm building for the "play or pay" 
     program, in which employers would provide basic health 
     insurance coverage or be taxed heavily to pay for a state-
     run insurance package.  A drawback to this approach is that 
     it wouldn't lower health care costs, only shift the payment
     burden to businesses. ("Health Care in Annapolis," editorial, 
     The Baltimore Sun, February 18, 1992.  See also, "Consumer 
     Choice Health Plans Worth Discussing," editorial, The Capital
     (Annapolis), February 4, 1992.) </UL>
<P>
     The amended version of H.B. 376 passed the Maryland House of
Delegates unanimously in March.  The bill does not call for the
immediate implementation of the Consumer Choice Health Plan.  Rather
it orders a comprehensive study by a special joint committee of state
legislators to explore the issues involved in introducing a program
based on the plan.  The Maryland State Senate has yet to act on the
measure.
<P>
     Thus while the Maryland state legislature has not completed its
work, the market-based proposal has emerged as the leading proposal. 
The reason, say House lawmakers supporting that plan, is that
Marylanders want to decide for themselves what plan will cover their
families and they are skeptical of government-run health plans. 
<P>

The Problems of the Current Maryland Health System<P>
     If Maryland mirrors the nation in debating the three major
approaches to comprehensive health care reform, the state also
wrestles with the same problems animating the health care debate
elsewhere.  While Maryland is blessed with many fine hospitals and
skilled physicians, for instance, access to these medical services is
a problem for many Maryland citizens.  And just as in other states,
there are large gaps in insurance coverage, with more than 570,000
individuals in the state lacking any health insurance coverage.  As in
other states, the uninsured are concentrated in the work force of
small firms.  Because of high costs, 43 percent of Maryland's small
businesses do not offer health insurance to their workers.  In
addition, costs are rising rapidly for businesses providing insurance
and families paying directly for their care or insurance.  Maryland
businesses generally are seeing premium increases of between 15
percent and 20 percent, and Maryland workers fear the loss of company-
based health insurance.  At the same time, the cost of uncompensated
care given by Maryland's hospitals is rising steeply, along with costs
of the Medicaid program. (See Preamble to House Bill No.  376, as
amended and passed by the Maryland House of Delegates, March 17, 1992. 
According to Nelson Sabatini, Secretary of the Maryland Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene, the Medicaid rolls in Maryland are growing
by 5,000 to 6,000 per month.  See Joyce Frieden and Eric Zicklin,
"Maryland Considers Shift on Cost Shifting," Business and Health,
March 1992, p.  76.)
<P>
     Arguably the major reason for both gaps in coverage and
skyrocketing costs is that federal and state tax laws give Americans
generous tax relief for their health insurance on one condition --
they must secure their health insurance through their work place. 
<P>
     According to Lewin/ICF, a leading economic modeling firm in
Washington, D.C., the revenue foregone by the federal government alone
through the exclusion from taxable income of employer-based health
benefits nationally was $66.6 billion in 1991. The equivalent state
tax exclusion for employer-paid insurance amounted to $8.3 billion
nationwide. 
<P>
     This tax treatment leads to several perverse effects.  Among
them: 
<P>
 1) Benefits are not "portable."
<P>
     The current federal and state tax laws favor only one type of
insurance -- employer-provided plans.  So Americans have a strong
incentive to obtain insurance through their employers.  The result of
this is that health insurance, unlike life insurance, auto insurance,
or homeowners insurance, typically is tied to a worker's job.  If a
worker changes jobs or loses his or her job, the family's health
benefits are terminated.  If the worker is not offered health benefits
from the next employer, or if severe illness strikes between jobs, the
result can be financial catastrophe for the worker and his family. 
<P>
2) Uninsurance is common among workers in small firms.
<P>
     Since many small businesses do not offer insurance, and since tax
breaks in effect are available only for employer-provided plans, many
employees of small businesses are without any insurance protection.
<P>
3) Employees do not question costs.
<P>
     Because most health care coverage is "paid for" by the employer,
workers have the tendency to treat health care coverage as the
equivalent of a "free good." (In fact, any money contributed by an
employer to an employee's health insurance really is part of the
worker's compensation, which in practice means that the worker's wages
are reduced by the employer's decision to offer health insurance.)  As
a result, insured workers have little or no incentive to question the
bills they receive from physicians or hospitals and thus little
incentive to seek the best value for money in the purchase of a health
care plan.  This lack of consumer interest in cost is a recipe for
escalating costs. (See Stuart Butler, Ph.D., "A Policy Maker's Guide
to the Health Care Crisis, Part I:  The Debate Over Reform," Heritage
Foundation Talking Points, February 12, 1992, pp.  4-7.) 
<P>

PROMOTING CONSUMER CHOICE AND MARKET FORCES<P>
     The Maryland proposal tackles these problems by changing the
system of incentives and subsidies operating today.  This change would
make it possible for Marylanders to choose from a wide range of plans
-- not just from the plans, if any, offered by employers -- and give
them a financial incentive to seek the best value for money in making
their selection.  Proponents argue that this consumer choice system
not only would make it possible for the uninsured to obtain coverage,
but would do a better job at keeping costs under control than the
existing system, with its perverse incentives, or a government-run
health care system using price and budget controls.
<P>
     This method of reforming the health care system is similar to
consumer choice proposals at the national level.  One of these has
been advanced by Heritage Foundation scholars.
<P>
     Like Maryland's H.B. 376, the Heritage Foundation Consumer Choice
Health Plan seeks to: 
<P>
          Assure access to at least a basic level of health care 
     for all Americans; 
<P>
          Create a system in which Americans keep their health 
     plan from job to job, a feature known as "portability"; 
<P>
          Introduce cost-conscious consumer choice, a feature 
     now virtually absent from the system, as the driving force 
     to keep costs in check; 
<P>
          Empower consumers with tax credits or vouchers, through 
     a change in the tax treatment of health benefits and health
     purchases, to afford care; and 
<P>
          Reform the health insurance market to make it more sensitive
     to the needs of consumers. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide,"
     Part II.  See also Stuart M.  Butler, Ph.D., and Edmund F. 
     Haislmaier (eds.), A National Health System for America
     (Washington, D.C.:  The Heritage Foundation, 1989); Stuart M. 
     Butler, "A Tax Reform Strategy to Deal with the Uninsured," The
     Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol.  265, May 15,
     1991.  Other market based proposals include:  Mark Pauley, Ph.D.,
     et al., Responsible National Health Insurance (Washington, D.C.: 
     The AEI Press, 1992); John Goodman, Ph.D., et al., An Agenda for
     Solving America's Health Care Crisis (Dallas:  The National
     Center for Policy Analysis, 1991); and Regina E.  Herzlinger,
     Ph.D., "Healthy Competition," The Atlantic Monthly, August 1991,
     pp.  68-81.) 
<P>
     The Heritage Foundation Consumer Choice Plan would phase out the
tax breaks now available to Americans for their company-based health
plan.  The total federal revenue cost of this tax exclusion alone was
$66.6 billion in 1991. (By adding revenues from state and local tax
and other changes, the total amount of revenues available for tax
credits would be nearly $88 billion in 1991 dollars.  See Butler, "A
Policy Maker's Guide," Part II, p.  16.)  This same revenue would be
used, dollar for dollar, to finance a system of tax credits for all
families to offset part of the cost of their purchase of health
insurance, or out-of-pocket medical costs, such as deductibles or
copayments or direct payments to physicians.  All families not
enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare would be required by law to purchase
at least a basic health plan. 
<P>
     If a company provided insurance with the Heritage proposal in
effect, it could do so, and keep the tax deductibility it now enjoys
as cost of doing business for the cost of that insurance.  If a
company were to discontinue its insurance plan, it also could do so,
but it would be required by law to add the monetary value of the
firm's contribution to its health insurance plan to the paycheck of
each employee in the form of wages.  If the company did not have a
plan, the employee would buy his or her own coverage.  In each case,
the employee would receive a tax credit of the value of the plan --
either the plan provided by the employer or the family's chosen
alternative plan. 
<P>
     Under such a consumer-based system, workers previously enrolled
in a company-based plan could decide instead to take the cash value of
their health benefits and buy a plan they felt was better value for
money. 

<P>
THE MARYLAND CONSUMER CHOICE HEALTH PLAN<P>
     The Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan includes many of the
same features as consumer-driven, market-oriented proposals at the
national level.  It would assure access to at least a basic health
plan for all Marylanders.  It sets down a basic package of benefits
that must be offered by insurance carriers operating in the state.  It
includes a sliding scale system of tax credits, related to household
income, to help families pay for coverage.  It requires all
individuals and heads of households to enroll in a health plan.  And
it finances the benefits out of funds generated from three sources:  a
new employer payroll tax of four percent; the elimination of the
current tax exclusion of employer-provided benefits; substantial
monies generated from reductions in the cost of uncompensated care for
the uninsured and changes in Medicaid.  The financing is arranged in
such a way that there is no net impact to the state budget. (Analysis
of Carl J.  Sardegna, Chairman and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Maryland, Inc., in a lecture at The Heritage Foundation, May 27,
1992.  According to an analysis done for Blue Cross and Blue Shield by
the Center for Health Policy Studies in Columbia, Maryland, the
revenue form lifting the income tax exclusion on health care benefits
would amount to $1 billion and the 4 percent payroll tax would yield
$2.6 billion.  Increased employer tax revenues, plus changes in
Medicaid and the elimination of uncompensated care in Maryland's
hospitals would yield slightly more than $1 billion.  The total
revenues from Maryland's tax changes and additional savings would
provide over $4.7 billion for funding tax credits and vouchers.) 
<P>
     Specifically, the proposal:

<P>
1) Requires all heads of households in the state to enroll themselves
and their families in a health insurance plan. 
<P>
     The plan would require all Marylanders, including Medicaid
beneficiaries, to enroll in a health insurance plan offering a
standard benefits package.  A basic benefits package would be
determined by the state of Maryland.
<P>
     Proponents of Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan defend this
mandate on two related grounds.  First, they say, it reinforces the
basic principle that health care primarily is a responsibility of each
head of the household, not of business or the government. 
<P>
     Second, the requirement recognizes implicitly that there is a
"social contract" between the individual and the rest of society when
it comes to health care.  Government assumes an obligation to make it
possible, through financial assistance, for each citizen to be able to
afford what society considers a level of health care that should be
available to all.  In return, the individual must assume a
corresponding obligation to devote a reasonable share of the household
income to purchase basic care and insurance, rather than being a "free
rider" on society.  Thus requiring individuals to purchase health
coverage protects other citizens from having to pick up the tab when
severe illness strikes, just like requiring drivers to purchase
automobile insurance is to protect other drivers and pedestrians. 
<P>

2)  Establishes a system of health insurance tax credits and vouchers.
<P>
     Under the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan, all citizens of
Maryland would receive tax credits or vouchers to help them purchase
insurance.  Low-income Marylanders who do not pay taxes would be
eligible for a voucher.  All other Maryland citizens filing income
taxes would be eligible for a tax credit, which they could receive by
an adjustment in their tax withholdings at the place of work.  The
amount of the credit would be based on the household's income.  In the
case of families at or below the official poverty level ($13,359 for a
family of four), the voucher would be equal to $3,400 per year for a
family of four.  This is based on an estimate of the premium cost of a
standard plan.  For those families above the poverty line, a sliding
scale credit would apply.  Specifically: 
 A tax credit equal to 90 percent of the cost of insurance (with a
maximum credit of $3,060) for families earning between $13,360 and
$26,718; 
<P>
          An 85 percent tax credit ($2,890 maximum) for families 
     with incomes between $26,719 and $49,999; 
<P>
          A 65 percent tax credit ($2,210 maximum) for families 
     with incomes between $50,000 and $99,999. 
<P>
          A 50 percent tax credit ($1,700 maximum) for families 
     with an income of $100,000 or more.  
<P>

3) Changes the health insurance market.
<P>
     The Maryland plan changes the state tax code radically to finance
access to health care for low - and middle-income Maryland workers and
their families and to introduce genuine market incentives into a
health insurance system where today they are virtually absent.  The
plan thus has profound implications for Marylanders.  If enacted, the
plan would mean:
<P>
     Tax relief for a health care plan would no longer be tied
inextricably to an employee's place of work.  This means that the tax
relief for health insurance would be neutral; that is, it would not
favor only employer-provided insurance.  Thus if a family chose a plan
sponsored by an organization other than the employer that family would
receive a tax break.  Today it does not.  Moreover, if a family is not
enrolled in an employer-based plan, the only alternative is to
purchase individual insurance with after-tax dollars, which makes the
cost prohibitive for most middle-class families.  But giving tax
relief to families to purchase health insurance, regardless of where
they work, creates a level playing field for all kinds of insurance. 
Employer-based plans in Maryland, which now enjoy exclusively
favorable tax treatment, would have to compete with alternative plans. 
Workers could, of course, take their money and credits and spend them
on company plans if they wished, or a plan made available to them by
their employer.  But they could also spend it on a plan sponsored by
their union, a trade association, an agricultural, commercial, or
fraternal society, or any other group.  Even religiously-based
organizations in Maryland could offer health insurance options to
Maryland workers and their families. 
<P>
     This change would allow the wide range of options now enjoyed
exclusively by members of Congress and federal workers, who today can
choose from among plans offered from many organizations such as
unions. (Currently more than 35 percent of all of the enrollees in the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) are enrolled in
health plans sponsored by unions or employee organizations.  See
Robert E.  Moffit, "Consumer Choice in Health:  Learning from the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder, No.  878, February 6, 1992.)
<P>
     The available credit would be refundable, making it a voucher for
low-income families.  Any individual could claim a tax credit to use
in purchasing a qualified health care plan.  But persons with no tax
liability would be eligible for a voucher, in effect a refundable tax
credit, to cover their health insurance costs.
<P>
     More tax relief would go to the needy rather than simply to high-
income individuals with more generous company-based plans.  The
current tax-free status of company-based health insurance is very
regressive.  The higher an employee's income, and the larger his or
her health insurance benefits, the bigger the tax break.  According to
Lewin/ICF calculations, the average federal tax break for American
families with household incomes above $75,000 per year is $1,427.  But
a working family earning under $10,000 gets an average of just $50 in
tax relief. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's Guide," Part II, p.  20.) 
<P>
     If the breadwinner in the family works for a small firm with no
health plan at all, which is common among lower-paid workers, then
that family typically gets no tax relief at all for medical bills or
the health insurance it buys. 
<P>
     The Consumer Choice Health Plan rectifies this stark inequity in
the tax code, at least at the state level.  Because it replaces
existing tax relief with a sliding scale tax credit that is larger for
the lower-paid and is refundable, it targets the greatest tax relief
to those who need it most.  
<P>
4)  Reforms the Insurance System and Protects Consumers.
<P>
     The Consumer Choice Health Plan establishes ground rules for
health insurance companies operating in Maryland.  All "qualified"
plans must include catastrophic coverage, must sell insurance to any
Maryland citizen, and guarantee the renewability of the policy.  Also,
plans no longer can deny coverage to an individual or a family because
of a "pre-existing" medical conditions. 
<P>
     The bill also sets up a State Health Insurance Commission to
review Maryland's health care costs and quality of qualified health
plans.  Plans meeting state requirements would be eligible to
participate in the demonstration program, receiving payment of
premiums in the form of tax credits or vouchers.  Insurers also would
be required to operate in a fiscally sound fashion and keep
administrative costs, including the costs of claims processing, under
control.  To help accomplish this, the bill requires each health
insurance carriers to use a common claim form within one year of
enactment, and to issue a standard "benefit card" to policyholders
that can be used in electronic billing.  This would cut both cost and
volume of paperwork in Maryland's health insurance system.

<P>
MAKING A GOOD PLAN EVEN BETTER
<P>
     The deliberations in Maryland have helped change the course of
the national health care debate.  When policy makers at the state or
national level consider models for health care reform, the choice no
longer is restricted to a government single-payer system or employer-
based mandatory insurance, each replete with a stiff regimen of tough
controls on prices, procedures or medical services.  The Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan now offers a third model for state
lawmakers -- a universal health plan based on consumer choice and
competition.  This approach attempts to combine the best features of
private medical practice and insurance with universal access and
direct tax assistance to individuals and families that need it the
most. 
<P>
     There are features of Maryland's existing health care delivery
system that are inconsistent with a market-based approach, such as the
state's policy of comprehensive price setting for hospitals and
mandatory benefits for insurance policies.  But the bill takes the
most important step towards a consumer-driven market by addressing the
financing of the health care market.  In this respect, the proposed
Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan is a major step toward a state
version of the consumer-driven, tax-based universal health care system
now being proposed at the national level by such organizations as The
Heritage Foundation.  Moreover, the Maryland Consumer Choice Health
Plan is a model for reform that can easily be adopted by other states.

<P>
     Some states already are considering similar plans.  In a plan
developed by John Garamendi, the Insurance Commissioner for the State
of California, for instance, all Californians would be guaranteed
comprehensive health care benefits.  Plans would be certified by the
State of California as qualified plans and all residents would have
the right to enroll in any certified plans of their choice.  They
would receive the equivalent of a voucher for the cost of a basic
managed care plan, and would pay out of pocket for the difference in
cost if they chose a more generous plan.  The Garamendi proposal
incorporates insurance reforms and finances the system with premiums
paid by both employees and employers.  While employers would be
required to pay into a central fund for financing the system, they no
longer would need to offer insurance to employees themselves.
<P>
     While the Maryland Consumer Choice Plan is a solid plan for
guaranteeing universal access to health care, there are certain
refinements that could make it even more effective, and that should be
considered by any other state contemplating a similar plan.  For
example: 
<P>

1) Expand tax relief to include the direct purchase of medical
services. 
<P>
     If tax relief were available for out-of-pocket medical expenses
for both individuals and families, not just for insurance, this would
encourage consumers to pay directly for routine medical services. 
With such tax relief available, consumers would be more likely to
forego insurance options with high "front end" coverage of routine
medical services, like teeth-cleaning and routine office visits, in
favor of insurance options with stronger "back end" coverage for more
costly services. 
<P>
     According to a recent Gallup survey conducted for the American
Medical Association (AMA), most doctors do not even discuss fees with
their patients before treating them. (Some 63 percent of the
respondents in a 1992 AMA patient poll revealed that cost of care was
not discussed before treatment, and 57 percent of the respondents said
they would prefer their doctor to discuss his fees.  The Capital
(Annapolis), May 30, 1992.  The same situation applies to hospital
charges.  A survey of hospital charges in northern Florida, for
example, showed that these costs vary widely for the same procedure. 
"Total average costs for seven of the 12 most common hospital
procedures varied from $27,851 to $58,084, a difference of 110
percent," noted the editors of The Florida Times-Union.  The
insulation of consumers to these radical variations of price aggravate
health care cost increases.  See "Value of Hospital Cost Figures
Should Be Determined by Users," editorial, The Florida Times-Union,
April 15, 1992.)  With more direct purchasing of routine medical
services, this would change for at least minor, routine services. 
With tax relief for the purchase of routine out-of-pocket medical
services, workers and their families would shop around for the best
value for their money.  There would be a greater opportunity for the
patient to act as a genuine consumer and enter into a relationship
with the doctor as an engaged patient, rather than as a merely passive
recipient of third party payment decisions.  In such a relationship,
patients would have an incentive to at least question the costs of the
services that doctors now provide and doctors will have incentives to
look at the services they provide to patients more in terms of their
direct and immediate medical benefit to a patient, unbiased by whether
or not those procedures are paid for by a third party.  This would
make for a healthier doctor-patient relationship.
<P>
     Furthermore, just as in other forms of insurance, such as
automobile coverage, higher deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance
invariably means lower premiums for health insurance.  For both of
these reasons, tax relief for the purchase of routine medical services
would help to control health care costs.
<P>

2) Base tax credits or vouchers to family health care costs compared
with income. 
<P>
     The Maryland bill is very generous.  It would give low-income
families a voucher or credit to pay for the entire value of their
health insurance.  But that discourages comparison shopping among
alternative plans for the best value.  Paying a percentage of the
cost, however, encourages families to seek good value.  In addition, a
flat credit means middle-income families with very high medical bills
could still face crippling costs.  But, it is necessary to give
generous help to lower-income families to help them obtain care, so
that price is not a barrier.
<P>
     A way to achieve each of these objectives would be to set the tax
credit or voucher at a percentage based on the amount of gross family
income consumed by health care costs.  The credit system might, for
instance, give every family a basic credit or voucher of 30 percent of
the cost of health care.  But if health care costs were to exceed,
say, 5 percent of gross family income, the credit would be raised to
50 percent.  If the high risk and cost of insuring the family, or high
and unforeseen out-of-pocket expenses, meant health costs exceeded
say, 10 percent of family income, the credit or voucher could be
increased to 75 or 80 percent of the costs.  In this way, any family
-- including middle-class families -- facing very high costs would
receive a high percentage credit.  Families with low costs compared
with their incomes would get a low credit. 
<P>

3) Require employers to make payroll deductions for employees' health
insurance. 
<P>
     Under the Consumer Choice Health Plan, Maryland employers will
serve as a clearinghouse for health insurance options.  If the plan is
enacted, employees will be able to purchase either the employer's plan
or any other qualified plan.  If an employee chooses an alternative
plan to that offered by the employer, the employee must take
responsibility for making timely payments to the insurer.
<P>
     One way to make sure workers made regular payments -- and did not
risk losing coverage -- would be to require employers to make a
payroll deduction for payment of the employees' premiums and transmit
these premiums to the health insurance carrier of the employees'
choice.  Many companies do this now, as a matter of course, for
retirement investment programs chosen by employees, such as 401(k)
plans.  This could be done for health insurance in Maryland and in
other states adopting a consumer choice health care reform program. 
<P>

4) Replace state mandated benefits provisions with annual basic
benefits setting. 
<P>
     In order to make the Maryland Consumer Choice Plan budget
neutral, the authors have proposed a 4 percent payroll tax on the
employer.  This tax will help to pay for health insurance tax credits
and vouchers at current benefit levels.  But these benefit costs are
artificially high today because state law requires insurance to
include in their plans a wide range of "mandated benefits."  Over the
past two decades, more than 800 state laws have been passed in various
states, mandating that private insurance cover specific benefits. 
Maryland ranks second, behind Connecticut and just ahead of
California, in the number of specific insurance mandates applying to
insurers in the state.  Maryland mandates 33 different medical
services, including alcoholism treatment, drug abuse treatment, in
vitro fertilization, chiropractic services, nurse midwives,
optometrists, psychologists, and even social workers.  While mandated
benefits are often politically popular, they drive up unnecessary
utilization of such services and thus the costs of private insurance. 
For example, according to 1991 report of the national Office of
Government Relations of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association,
Maryland's "... outpatient mental health care visits rose dramatically
once they were mandated, from 448,000 in 1983 to almost 800,000 in
1986, an average growth rate of 21 percent per year." ("State Health
Benefits and Provider Mandates," Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, Issue Review, July 1991.)  Donald Hillier, senior vice
president of the Maryland National Financial Corporation, notes that
Maryland's mandated benefits laws contribute an estimated 17 percent
to 27 percent of the costs of a health care plan in Maryland. (Frieden
and Zicklin, op.  cit., p.  76.)
<P>
     Before resorting to new taxes to cover the high cost of elaborate
mandated benefits for the uninsured, state lawmakers should consider
elimination of the mandated benefits, especially since the most
important objective is to provide the uninsured with a basic level of
protection, such as catastrophic protection for themselves and their
families.  A state has an interest in the benefits to be included in a
basic plan, such as hospital and surgical benefits, physician
services, and well-baby care.  But rather than the state legislature
mandating detailed levels of benefits and specific specialty services,
a better approach, which would ensure both control and flexibility,
would be to have the state negotiate a basic set of benefits each year
with insurance companies.  Maryland could reserve that function to the
proposed State Health Insurance Commission, as outlined in H.B. 376. 
This would more easily accommodate periodic changes in clinical
medical practice and assure quality control over plan offerings.  This
approach has worked well at the federal level in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), administered by the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM).  Instead of Congress legally mandating a
set of specific benefits for the federal program, OPM enters into
sensitive discussions with private insurance carriers and determines
benefit levels each year, assuming that any increase or decrease in
benefit levels has a direct bearing on the price of insurance premiums
for federal workers, retirees, and members of Congress.  A similar
approach could be pursued in Maryland.
<P>
     Without detailed state mandates, the proposed Maryland Health
Insurance Commission, or a similar body in another state, could
exercise its authority in meeting the basic needs of the uninsured,
such as major medical hospital and catastrophic coverage, and allow
consumers to pay extra for other services, such as chiropractic care
or nurse midwives, if they so desire. 
<P>
5) Intensify market competition by allowing Federal Employee Health
Benefit Plans to compete in the state on the same basis as for federal
workers. 
<P>
     The heart of the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan is the
right of an employee to choose a plan other than that provided by his
or her employer.  This is a key not only to the empowerment of
Americans to make fundamental decisions about their health, but also
to the engine of market-driven cost containment.  And consumer choice
in health care, while a novel idea for most Americans, is already a
fact for those Marylanders who are federal employees.
<P>
     A model for consumer choice already exists.  It is working and it
is working well.  It is called the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program (FEHBP). (See Moffit, op.  cit.)  Initiated in 1959, this
program is based on the twin principles of consumer choice and
competition.  Nationwide, the FEHBP covers nearly ten million
Americans and has over 400 competing plans, with about two dozen in
any particular area.  These range from traditional fee-for-service
carriers, like Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to 310 health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) like Kaiser Permanente, to employee organization
plans, like the popular Mailhandlers Plan.  The program is open to
every member of Congress, every congressional staffer, some 750,000
members of the postal service, the entire federal civil service, all
365,000 blue-collar federal employees -- indeed every federal worker
from a messenger to a Cabinet Secretary, from the White House janitor
to the President of the United States.
<P>
     Many of the desirable, small group insurance reforms embodied in
the Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan -- such as guaranteed
renewability, a prohibition on exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
and open enrollment for anyone who wants to join a plan -- already are
available to employees enrolled in the FEHBP.  The FEHBP is not
burdened by state mandated benefits laws or state premium taxes, and
the precise level of benefits each year changes only after
negotiations between the federal government and private insurance
carriers.  But the final decision over price and benefit packages is
determined by the market -- plans must satisfy the consumer if they
are to survive. 
<P>
     Unlike many private company-based plans, FEHBP also includes 1.5
million retirees, plus their spouses and survivors, who tend to use
far more services than the average American.  What is remarkable is
that even with such a large number of retirees, including retirees who
are ineligible for Medicare, this system generally has outperformed
the private sector in holding down the rate of increase of premium
costs.  During the period 1980 to 1988, for instance, FEHBP premiums
increases averaged 12 percent per year, while typical private sector
plans -- which generally do not include retirees -- ran at 14 percent. 
This year, premium increases in the FEHBP will be 8 percent, while the
estimated increase in all private plans nation wide will average 20 to
25 percent. (Michael Schachner, "Health Care Costs Will Be Boiling
Over Again in 1992," Business Insurance, December 16, 1991, cited in
Medical Benefits, Vol.  9, No.  2 (January 30, 1992), p.  1.)  The
main reason for this effective cost control in the federal system is
that employees shop for the best bargains for their money. 
<P>
     Over 30 FEHBP plans already operate in the Maryland suburbs, and
in most cities across the nation there are well over a dozen plans for
federal employees.  These plans already are certified by the federal
government.  As part of its demonstration project, Maryland could seek
a waiver or some other form of agreement with the federal government
to permit these plans to market insurance to all Maryland citizens who
wish to purchase them, not just federal workers.  Other states
interested in promoting competition in the insurance industry could do
likewise. 
<P>

What the Federal Government Should Do<P>
     The Bush Administration has declared its intention to issue
waivers, or administrative exceptions to the rules and regulations
that govern federal programs, to promote state level experimentation
in key areas of health and welfare reform.  Indeed, as part of the
President's own "Comprehensive Health Reform Program," states are
encouraged to experiment with Medicaid by designing ways to deliver
health care more efficiently.  Indeed, the Bush Administration health
care reform plan encourages vouchers for low-income citizens covered
under the Medicaid program.  When the Maryland state legislature
reconsiders health care reform, the Administration can do three things
to assure the success of Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan:
<P>
     Offer to grant waivers. 
<P>
     The Bush Administration can offer the State of Maryland a waiver
of the Medicaid rules in order to assist Maryland in turning its
current Medicaid program into a full- scale voucher program as
envisioned in Chairman Taylor's original bill.  This would eliminate
the current acute care Medicaid program and allow low-income Maryland
citizens to get basic health care like every other Maryland citizen.
<P>
     Offer to guarantee insurance competition. 
<P>
     The Administration could make arrangements with Maryland to allow
any of the plans competing in the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program in the Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland areas to
participate in any demonstration project authorized as part of
Maryland's Consumer Choice Health Plan.  This immediately would assure
Maryland citizens strong competition and a wide range of options --
particularly for those Marylanders who now are uninsured.  Moreover,
it would give all Maryland citizens the right to choose from the same
menu of good health care benefits and competitive prices that is
offered annually to Maryland's congressional delegation and to federal
workers. 
<P>
     Urge Congress to reform the federal tax code. 
<P>
     The Maryland Consumer Choice Health Plan would make much-needed
reforms in the tax code -- but only at the state level.  To make
state-sponsored consumer-choice plans more successful, Congress should
amend the tax code to introduce individual tax credits for health
insurance and the purchase of services, in place of the current tax
break for only employer-sponsored plan.  Such a proposal has been
advanced by The Heritage Foundation. (See Butler, "A Policy Maker's
Guide,"  Part II.)
<P>
     By reforming the federal tax code in this way, the Congress would
make it easier for states to experiment with health care reform.  In
any case, there can and will be no complete reform of America's health
care system, including the removal of the perverse incentives that are
now relentlessly driving up costs in the system, without a reform of
the perverse incentives in federal tax code.
<P>
     The current federal tax breaks for employer-based health
insurance are grossly inefficient, in that they favor employer-based
insurance options to the exclusion of all other types of insurance. 
They are also grossly unfair, in that the larger a family's personal
income, the larger are the available tax breaks.  The current federal
tax system discriminates in favor of highly-paid executives in large
companies with expensive, tax free health insurance packages, and
discriminates against lower-paid workers and Americans who work for
small companies with little or no health insurance benefits. 
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Maryland has a rich tradition of policy experimentation.  It was
an early model for religious toleration in colonial times, and has
since been an innovator in social and economic policy.  In 1902, for
example, Maryland was the first state to enact a workers' compensation
law.  With serious legislative deliberation on a demonstration project
of consumer choice and competition in the health care delivery system,
targeting tax relief to those who need it most and promoting
affordable care among every income category of her citizens, Maryland
once again is in the forefront of innovative social and economic
policy. 
<P>
     Other states also are exploring innovative ways to deliver health
care more efficiently and more widely.  Some, such as California, are
considering consumer-choice proposals. 
<P>
     While the focus of the debate over health care reform has been on
federal policy, the states actually have been reforming health care
within their own borders. (See Michael Tanner, "As Washington Dithers,
States Reform Health Care," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  868,
November 27, 1991.)  Major initiatives are underway in states ranging
from Florida to Minnesota.  Vermont and Maine have enacted significant
insurance market reforms.  Hawaii is already a model for employer
mandates.  And Oregon may prove to be America's first real test of
explicit government rationing of health care in the Medicaid program;
providing treatment for patients with government-approved diseases and
reimbursing doctors for government approved procedures, while
withholding care and reimbursement for unapproved diseases or
procedures. 
<P>
     The State of Maryland has an opportunity to lead the nation in a
new direction.  If Maryland's innovative reform proposal becomes law,
it will create a state health system based on consumer choice and
market competition -- applying the same economic forces to health care
that have assured Americans efficient and economical services in the
rest of the economy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with
you tonight to celebrate the &quot;forty-fourth anniversary of
my thirty-ninth birthday.&quot; Haley told me he was going to
gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret
Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone in
my life and for those very kind words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met
at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President.
From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar
views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting
by telling me, &quot;we must stand together,&quot; and that's
exactly wat we've done in the years since--as friends and as political
allies. Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century.
Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time
goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch
ally, my political soulmate, a great visionary and a dear, dear
friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us here tonight. I
would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour.
Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing
and excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on
my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something
someday!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back
memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down
on the White House, and it was just like the good old days...the
South Lawn, the Rose Garden...David Gergen. I looked over a couple
of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service--bigger
than I ever remembered it. When I looked down at the enormous
United States Post Office building I could just see the excitement
on the faces of the bureaucrats--knowing they would soon be managing
our national health care system! Up on Capital Hill, I saw that
big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively
reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, &quot;Go ahead,
make my day.&quot; You may have seen President Clinton draw his
own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that
his pen doesn't have any ink in it! Unless, of course, you're
talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty
of that!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure
to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the
Grand Old Party. Birthdays often serve as the rare moments when
we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on
the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that
have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am
filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back
with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others
of you are more recent additions to the family.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives.
For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure
there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather
what I take from the past, is inspiration for the future. And
what we accomplished during our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January
of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of
government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation
and crushing interest rates--when hope was scarce. It was a time
when coldy, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled
in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when
the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding
mistrust stood between East and West. We believed that for the
future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And
together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave
as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better
tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the
American people. We created millions of new jobs for Americans
at all income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the
shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose
in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America back--bigger
and better than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us--not just
because of our military might--but because of our ideas of liberty
and freedom. And, they knew we were willing to defend and promote
those ideas in every corner of the earth. We rebuilt a demoralized,
underfunded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most
modern and respected force in the world. And who can forget those
so-called &quot;experts&quot; who said our military build-up threatened
a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool, they asked,
would call the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. But as
events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction
that communism wa destined for the ash-heap of history. After
decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership
of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the
world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as
on of peace and global prosperity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other party
will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything
i their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression--filled
with greed and despair. Well you and I know better than that.
Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of
the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every
major election across the country last year. From New York to
Texas--from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as
a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how
unpopular liberalism really is. So now, they're trying to dress
their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching
the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of
the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny--the intellectual
theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery
counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions
and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats
may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons
of the past. I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime,
and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon.
The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over a Kuwait, or North Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what this
country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that
gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial
communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we
should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up lowering our flag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling
you something Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long
time. During our years together here, as you know, things were
always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective,
we were quickly on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate
victory or recall all the people who made it possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to
reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to
California, we've spent many oaccasions looking back at what we
did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so
hard to make those great days possible. Ad we've wondered if we
would ever get the chance to thank them. You are those people--those
great individuals who gave so much of yourselves--who sacrificed
and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did. So,
I will conclude tonight by saying that the greatest gift I could
receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and
every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful
Nancy and I are: thank you for being there--and for being here.
And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish
forever. Until we meet again, God bless you, my friends.

<p>
Francis A. Biunno, a Philadelphia trial judge, had just sentenced a murderer to death. He then turned to the courtroom, called on those present to sit down, and asked the public to reflect on the breakdown of our democratic system that had led to the killing.<p>
The murder in question was of a 21-year-old rookie police officer, Daniel Boyle, who stopped a stolen car in North Philadelphia. The driver of the stolen car, Edward Bracey, fired numerous shots through the windshield of the patrol car, hitting the young officer in the head. A police radio tape chillingly captured the fatal shots and the fallen officer's final words. A few days later Danny's father, veteran Philadelphia police detective Patrick Boyle, buried his only son.<p>
This tragedy didn't have to happen. Philadelphia police, Judge Biunno said, had previously arrested Bracey for car theft. Twice Bracey had been released without bail or supervision under terms of an order issued by a federal court. Twice Bracey had failed to show up for trialin fact, he was a fugitive from justice when he killed Officer Boyle. This killing wouldn't have taken place, Biunno suggested, if the federal court hadn't required the defendant's release.<p>
Criticism of a federal court on the part of a local trial judge is highly unusual. But Biunno's statement reflected the anger and frustration that officials in Philadelphia harbor toward a federal order that has wreaked havoc on their city's criminal-justice system. The court order to which Biunno referred places a cap on the number of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, and it sharply restricts the ability of judges to imprison defendants prior to trial.<p>
Last year, the city's judges were forced to release defendants in 15,000 cases. Thanks to the court order, the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justicedefendants who have been charged with a crime but do not even bother to show up for trial. Philadelphia police arrest the same criminals over and over again, only to see them immediately released. In the nine years since the order was approved by Judge Norma Shapiro, of the U.S. District Court, defendants released under federal court order have gone on to commit tens of thousands of crimesincluding thousands of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery.<p>
The federal court's order is technically called a "consent decree," because it was agreed to by a previous mayor of Philadelphia. But it no longer enjoys the consent of the governed. Philadelphia's elected leaders, including its present mayor, its district attorney, and most of its city council, are deeply opposed to the consent decree but powerless to overturn it. Philadelphia may be the home of the Liberty Bell, but the federal consent decree is making a mockery of the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.The Philadelphia prisons, which house defendants before trial and sentenced prisoners, have been the subject of various class-action lawsuits since 1972. Past conditions in the prisons have been unacceptable. Over the years, many experts have observed inadequate medical care that has led to the death of inmates, unsanitary food preparation, vermin infestation, and poor plumbing, ventilation, and heating.<p>
In 1986, these conditions prompted inmates at an old, decrepit facility called Holmesburg Prison to file a lawsuit against then-mayor W. Wilson Goode. The mayor decided to settle the case rather than go to trial. The resulting federal consent decree, agreed to by Goode's lawyers, did nothing to address medical care or other conditions in the city's prisons. Rather, it sought to limit the number of prisoners, and, more important, forbade pretrial detention for defendants accused of broad categories of crime. The architects of the plan apparently presumed that reducing the number of prisoners would improve the prison environment for the remaining inmates.<p>
Instead of individualized bail review, with Philadelphia judges considering a criminal defendant's dangerousness to others or his risk of flight, the consent decree requires a "charge-based" system of prison admissions. Suspects charged with so-called "non-violent" crimes, including stalking, car jacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges, are not subject to pretrial detention.<p>
In determining pretrial detention, Philadelphia judges can no longer consider a defendant's prior record, his history of failing to appear in court, his mental-health history, his ties to the community, or his drug or alcohol dependency. These factors become completely irrelevant. A major drug dealer carrying a loaded Uzi and a plane ticket out of the country cannot be detained before trial in Philadelphia.<p>
As a result of this system, Philadelphia has become an especially attractive location for drug dealing. Narcotics agents assigned to the international airport routinely apprehend (and are forced to release) drug couriers, who have been assured that carrying over $100,000 of marijuana to Philadelphia is risk free. One newly arrested drug dealer, knowing that he would be released in a matter of hours, cheerfully gave his pretrial bail interviewer a phone number where he could be reached-in Cali, Colombia. <p>
Another drug dealer, Walter Lewis, unwittingly schooled undercover narcotics officers on the benefits of dealing drugs in Philadelphia. Lewis had been awaiting trial in Philadelphia for drug dealing but had already been released because of the federal consent decree. Undercover narcotics agents from neighboring Montgomery County arranged a narcotics deal on City Line Avenue, the street dividing Montgomery County from Philadelphia. When Lewis arrived, he tried to convince the undercover officers to move the drug deal to the Philadelphia side of the street. He carefully explained that they could all be sent to jail if they stayed in Montgomery County. After the officers refused to move, Lewis mistakenly let greed guide him. He completed the deal, the officers immediately arrested him, and he went straight to jail, where he remained until trial. If the deal had occurred in Philadelphia, he would have been released in a matter of hours. <p>
The consent decree has crippled Philadelphia's already struggling criminal-justice system. Once criminals knew that they could not be detained prior to trial no matter how many times they failed to appear for court, Philadelphia began recording unprecedented fugitive rates. A study conducted by John Goldkamp and Kay Harris, nationally recognized experts on the bail process, found, for example, that 76 percent of all Philadelphia drug dealers become fugitives within 90 days of their arrest. Nationally, only 26 percent of drug dealers become fugitives within one year of their arrest. By comparison, only 3 percent of Philadelphia defendants charged with aggravated assaulta crime not subject to the release provisions of the federal consent decreefail to appear for court.<p>
The skyrocketing fugitive rate has produced a system with more defendants in fugitive status than awaiting trial. In the first six months of 1994, over 11,000 new bench warrants (the arrest document issued when a criminal defendant does not appear for a court hearing) were issued for defendants released under the federal consent decrees, representing 74 percent of all the bench warrants issued during this period. Under the consent decree, the number of fugitives in Philadelphia has nearly tripled from 18,000 to almost 50,000, equivalent to a year's worth of criminal prosecutions. And no wonder: Under the consent decree, state courts are powerless to compel a defendant's appearance in court.<p>
Unfortunately for Philadelphians, the defendants released because of the consent decree do not lay lowthey just keep on committing new crimes. In an 18-month period (1993 and the first six months of 1994), Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because of the consent decree. These defendants were charged with 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.<p>
These crimes cannot all be attributed to the federal consent decree; some defendants would have been released under normal Pennsylvania procedures. But apparently half or more of these crimes could have been prevented. Goldkamp and Harris found that pretrial detainees released under the consent decree committed crimes at more than twice the rate of defendants released under state-court bail programs. Within 90 days of release, 18 percent of federally released defendants were rearrested for new crimes, compared with an 8 percent rearrest figure for comparable state bail programs. <p>
Retailers complain of a sharp increase in shoplifting and robberies by criminals immune from incarceration. In April, Charles Pembroke was released for the fifth time in 1995 because of the Philadelphia prison cap. In the last six months, Philadelphia police have arrested Pembroke three times for retail theft, once for robbing a pharmacy with a starter pistol while threatening to kill the victims, and once for drug dealing. Pembroke has failed to appear for court seven times and, as of this writing, is a fugitive on three of his cases. Philadelphia's criminal-justice system just keeps seeing the same defendants over and over again, but can't do anything until they commit a crime so serious that the consent decree finally permits the prison to admit them.<p>
The consent decree also weakens the effectiveness of programs for criminal defendants who never would have been detained prior to trial. State judges are no longer allowed to sanction those criminal defendants who violate conditions of bail, fail to appear for trial, or commit new crimes. State-court bail programs have atrophied into virtual non-existence. Conditional-release programs providing drug treatment, aimed at lifting new offenders out of their recently acquired lives of drugs and crime, are forced to wait for offenders to become serious criminals with a long-term addiction. <p>
The case of Frederick Hightower vividly demonstrates the absurdity of the consent decree. Hightower was a trained helicopter mechanic from a solid family who became addicted to crack at age 29. He quickly turned to burglaries.<p>
Given Hightower's age, lack of prior criminal-justice contacts, and long-term ties to the community, the local court system (had it remained in charge of the pretrial detention process) probably would have released him without bail for his first two burglaries. But by the time he was arrested for his third burglary, the local judge would have suspected a drug problem, sent him to jail, and permitted his conditional release (again without posting bail) a few days later into an in-patient drug treatment program. If this had worked (admittedly an optimistic outlook) and he had remained in treatment, he would have been a prime candidate for a sentence of probation with the condition of continued drug treatment.<p>
But the federal consent decree wouldn't allow the local criminal-justice system to operate. Without the threat of pretrial incarceration, Hightower wouldn't enter a drug treatment program. Philadelphia wasn't permitted to keep Hightower in jail until he was finally arrested for his 10th burglary. Hightower now was no longer a candidate for probation. Instead he received a 10-year maximum sentence, and must serve a minimum of two and a half years before he is eligible for parole.<p>
The cost of this folly: numerous crime victims with substantial financial losses (and he surely wasn't caught every time); prison bed space occupied longer (a few years, at a cost of approximately $25,000 a year, instead of a few days); increased court costs (each one of his new cases involved police witnesses, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and court personnel), less chance of drug rehabilitation (the treatment came later in his addiction); and loss of tax revenues (Hightower was a skilled, employed taxpayer). <p>
The Philadelphia Federal Courthouse overlooks Independence Hall, the cradle of American liberty and the Constitution. How ironic, then, that the federal court's consent decree tramples on the right of Philadelphians to a democratic political system.<p>
Mayor Ed Rendell and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, both elected Democrats, won office pledging to do what they could to overturn the prison-cap and prisoner-release provisions of the consent decree. Philadelphia's top leaders, including most of the city council, are united in their view that the federal court's rules on pretrial release of defendants are a serious threat to public safety, effectively decriminalizing property crime in Philadelphia, and harming the financial viability of the city. But the federal court has rejected all challenges to the consent decree, and shows no indications of ceding oversight over the issue. Philadelphia's elected leaders are powerless to change agreements made by a prior administration, and so powerless to set their own criminal-justice priorities.<p>
Our democratic system presumes that policies made by today's elected leaders, whether by legislation, regulation, or policy statements, can be altered by their successors in office. Through periodic elections, the public can throw out arrogant public officials who try to insulate their governmental vision from change or from the will of the electorate. Philadelphians do not consent to the consent decree that is destroying their criminal justice system. It's time that Philadelphia's elected leaders be allowed to do the job for which they were elected. Isn't that what America's independence was all about?

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
      Americans overwhelmingly believe that parents know best how to
raise young children. This is confirmed in poll after poll. ("For
Better or Worse, Results from a Newsweek Gallup poll, 1989," Newsweek,
Special Issue on Children, Summer 1990, p. 18.) Experts, too, agree
that the family home is the optimum setting for early childhood
development.
<P>
      Yet the federal government ignores this definitive data. In
fact, the federal government is greatly increasing its efforts to take
very young children out of their homes and put them, for part of the
day or all day, into government-funded institutions. Washington is
even launching a campaign to persuade parents to part with their sons
and daughters at ever earlier ages. 
<P>
      These actions amount to a federal family policy that undermines
families. And this policy is becoming more expansive, aggressive, and
expensive. Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Activists are seeking to increase funding beyond the $23.5
      billion already authorized for child care and early education
      programs for 1991-1995. The total includes $4.5 billion to set
      up child care bureaucracies at the state level. 
<P>
      George Bush is asking for a nearly $700 million increase in the
      fiscal 1992 federal budget for Project Head Start, already the
      largest federally funded early childhood development program.
      The program would cost just over $2 billion.
<P>
      The Bush Administration wants to spend $60 million in fiscal
      1992 on Even Start, a Department of Education program similar to
      Head Start. The budget request is a 200 percent increase over
      fiscal 1990 and a 21 percent hike over fiscal 1991.
<P>
      A congressionally appointed, taxpayer-funded panel is
      considering ways to conduct national academic testing of 3-year-
      olds.
<P>
      A taxpayer-financed study for the Department of Education
      pleads the case for a federally directed, federally subsidized
      system of national child care standards and early childhood
      education services. The Department is listening to no opposing
      views.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Despite a glaring lack of scientific evidence that early
childhood programs help children now or in the future, as their
sponsors claim, the federal government is spending ever more
taxpayers' money on them.
<P>
      To be sure, for severely disadvantaged children, Head Start and
other programs initially improve academic performance. But studies
show that the impact does not endure for more than a year or two.
Despite this, Head Start is often touted as a "magic bullet" that
helps poor children succeed in school. Based on the available
evidence, Head Start may deserve support as a welfare program
providing nutrition and care for poor children, but not as an
educational jump start. 
<P>
      Says J. Craig Peery, professor of human development at Brigham
Young University and the author of the 1981 Project Head Start
reauthorization bill: "I think we know a lot about early childhood
education -- and it doesn't work." (Telephone interview, March 7,
1991.) 
<P>
      Potentially Harmful. Many experts feel that early education that
emphasizes performance is not only not beneficial but potentially
harmful. Says pediatrician and author Benjamin Spock: "When we
instruct children in academic subjects, or in swimming, gymnastics, or
ballet, at too early an age, we miseducate them; we put them at risk
for short-term stress and long-term personality damage for no useful
purpose. There is no evidence that such early instruction has lasting
benefits, and considerable evidence that it can do lasting harm."
(Quoted in David Elkind, Miseducation, Preschoolers at Risk (New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, 1988), p. 4.) 
<P>
      Aside from one small study that finds significant long-term
gains, even the most positive analyses of early childhood programs
acknowledge few lasting effects. Indeed, the most comprehensive Head
Start study compares school testing of Head Start children with those
not enrolled and concludes: "by the end of the second year there are
no educationally meaningful differences." (Executive Summary, The
Impact of Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, Head Start
Evaluation, Synthesis and Utilization Project, U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, June 1985, p. 6.) 
<P>
      Out-of-Home Problems. In contrast, research shows that children
in out-of-home programs for extensive periods tend to be more
aggressive, have more psychological problems, favor peer groups over
parental authority and get into more fights than home-reared children.
(Nicholas Zill, Developmental, Learning and Emotional Problems: Health
of Our Nation's Children, cited in "Family-Induced Disturbances Affect
One in Five Children," Education Daily, Vol. 23, No. 238, December 11,
1990, p. 3. Also, Deborah Vandell and Mary Corasaniti and others cited
by J. Craig Peery in "Children At Risk: The Case Against Day Care,"
The Family in America, Rockford Institute, February 1991.) Young
children are also more likely to contract serious illnesses in
institutional settings. (Reed Bell, "Health Risks From Daycare
Diseases," in Phyllis Schlafly, ed. Who Will Rock the Cradle?, Two
Conferences on Childcare (Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense
Fund, 1981), pps. 115-122.) 
<P>
      Even Yale psychologist Edward F. Zigler, widely known as the
foremost proponent of early childhood development programs, warns that
such programs may not be suitable for all children: "There is a large
body of evidence indicating that there is little if anything to be
gained by exposing middle-class children to early education." (Edward
F. Zigler, "Formal Schooling for Four-Year-Olds? No" in Sharon L.
Kagan and Edward F. Zigler, eds., Early Schooling (New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1987), p. 30.) He adds: "We must listen to those
families who neither want nor need their young children placed in
preschool .... whenever the family situation permits it, the best
place for a preschool child is often at home." (Zigler, op. cit., p.
34.)
<P>
      Warning Bells. The virtual absence of proof that programs have
long-term benefits and growing evidence that children in institutional
settings are at risk should ring warning bells in Washington. It
should make the federal government proceed with caution before funding
existing and new programs for young children -- until research proves
that such programs not only do not harm children but significantly
help them. 
<P>
      Yet this evidence routinely is ignored at the Departments of
Education and Health and Human Services, and sometimes even at the
White House. Ignored too is the fact that the most important cultural
problem facing America is dysfunctional families -- the families in
which children are most often at risk.
<P>
      What is puzzling is that some leading officials rhetorically
admit that the well-being of American families is the key to a healthy
society, even while the agencies run by these officials pay scant heed
to the rhetoric. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human
Services, earlier this month told the annual legislative conference of
the National League of Cities: "So many of our problems -- drug and
alcohol abuse, the spread of AIDS, teen pregnancy, infant mortality,
youth homicide, among others -- reflect the personal isolation,
alienation and despair that follow from the widespread erosion of
family and community." (Paul Taylor, "Family Seen as Key to Aiding
Children," The Washington Post, March 11, 1991, p A-5.) Adds
Minneapolis Mayor Donald M. Fraser: "We know we have a welfare system
that discourages marriage.... we have a [federal] public policy that
is designed to destroy families and nobody talks about it." (Ibid.)
<P>
      Sullivan, a Republican, and Fraser, a Democrat, both call for
the abolition of federal programs that weaken families. (Both men,
however, support expansion of Head Start. Sullivan calls it a "middle
ground" that shores up families without supplanting them.) This call
merits very broad support. To succeed, it requires a strategy whose
first steps include:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    Ending the funding of all early childhood education programs
      except those for the poor. 
<P>
2)    Supporting research into early education for disadvantaged
      children to determine if there is a model that works and can be
      replicated. Such efforts should target only severely
      disadvantaged children, follow methods for which there is some
      evidence of success, and use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
3)    Evaluating independently all existing federally subsidized early
      childhood education programs. Conflicts of interest should
      preclude bureaucracies that administer programs from evaluating
      their effectiveness. 
<P>
4)    Expanding the use of vouchers or tax credits to allow parents to
      choose the best education and care for their children. Parental
      involvement should be a paramount consideration in any program.
      Early childhood education may indeed be worthwhile for some
      disadvantaged children, but studies indicate parental
      involvement with children is the key developmental factor.
<P>
5)    Reducing federally imposed financial burdens on the family. In
      1948, a family of four of median income paid 2 percent of its
      income to federal taxes. This year, that family pays 24 percent
      in federal taxes in addition to state, local, and excise taxes.
      (Robert Rector, "Fourteen Myths About Families and Child Care,"
      Harvard Journal on Legislation, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Summer 1989), p.
      542.) Some ways to aid families include: increasing the personal
      exemption for dependents, increasing the earned income tax
      credit and extending it to more families, and redesigning
      welfare programs to encourage fatherhood, not father
      abandonment. Minnesota, for instance, has waived welfare rules
      that have been driving fathers out of the house.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> THE FEDERAL ROLE</B>
<P>
      Despite lack of evidence that early childhood programs
substantially benefit children, the U.S. government agencies actively
promote these programs in several ways.
<P>
* The Tax Credit for Dependent Care allows parents to deduct from
their gross income a portion of child care expenses on their federal
returns. The deductions totalled $3.895 billion in fiscal 1990 and are
projected to total $4.395 billion in fiscal 1992. (Telephone interview
with Terry Harrow, legislative branch director for Human Development
Resources, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, March 12,
1991.) The program has the merit of giving parents economic assistance
to choose the kind of child care they want, including religious-
affiliated facilities. The trouble is that the program discriminates
against parents caring for children at home. In effect, the government
says: "If you leave your child with someone other than one of the
parents (or grandparents, or aunts, or neighbors), you get a tax
break."
<P>
* Child care provisions in the 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Bill
will cost an estimated $23.6 billion over five years for several
programs. (Other provisions are: a Child Health Insurance Credit. This
$5.2-billion program assists families in buying health insurance for
children. In 1994 the maximum credit will be $483. A "Wee Tots"
Supplemental Tax Credit. This $700 million program gives families with
a child under one year a supplemental credit or allows them to choose
the Dependent Care Tax Credit. By 1994, the "Wee Tot" maximum credit
will be $403.) Among them: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    The Earned Income Tax Credit. Projected to reduce federal tax
      revenues by $12.4 billion over five years, this gives a small
      measure of tax relief (a direct refund of up to a maximum of
      $953) to poor families with children. 
<P>
2)    Child Care and Development Block Grant. Estimated to cost $4.45
      billion over five years, this gives money to states based on the
      number of low-income children in the state under age five. Some
      75 percent of the money can be used for services to children;
      the other 25 percent is targeted for quality control, early
      childhood programs, and day care for latch-key children. Because
      of fuzzy wording, the money for children's services could be
      siphoned into campaigns for a child care bureaucracy. 
<P>
3)    Title IV Family Support Ways and Means Grant. Allocating $1.5
      billion over five years, this gives money to poor working
      families for child care to keep parents off welfare rolls. 
<P>
4)    Standards and Training Ways and Means Grant. At a cost of $250
      million, this will help states improve standards for child care,
      monitor compliance, and provide training for child care
      providers.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Head Start</B>
<P>
      The largest federally funded early childhood development program
is Head Start. Begun in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson's War on
Poverty, Head Start is a comprehensive early childhood development
program providing children ages 3 to 5 from low-income families with
educational, social, medical, dental, nutritional, and mental health
services. (Head Start: A Child Development Program, pamphlet, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 1990, p. 2.) In the past
quarter-century, more than 11 million children have been Head Start
clients. Beginning with a summer-only enrollment of 561,000 and a
budget of $96.4 million (Project Head Start Statistical Fact Sheet,
January 1990, p. 2.) the program grew rapidly. By 1966 the budget was
$198.9 million, enrollment rose to 733,000, and the program expanded
to full-day. (Ibid.) In 1982, when seasonal programs were replaced by
year-round-only services, 395,800 children were enrolled in the
program, which had a budget of $911.7 million. (Ibid.) During the 1990
school year, more than 488,000 children were enrolled at a estimated
average cost of $2,767 per child (Ibid., pp. 1,2.) while the budget
grew to $1.386 billion. The program has a paid staff of 79,549, plus
615,000 volunteers. (Ibid., pp. 2,3.)    Some 54 percent of Head Start
families are headed by a single parent. Handicapped children account
for 13.5 percent of enrollees. Up to 10 percent of Head Start slots
can be filled by children not deemed at risk. 
<P>
      Head Start gives children hot meals, comprehensive health care
including dental treatment, and social activities. Parents are offered
positions on policy-making boards, workshops on child care and
nutrition, and training for Head Start jobs. (Serving the Nation's
Children and Families, Administration for Children, Youth and
Families, Department of Health and Human Services, undated, p. 11.) 
<P>
      Modest Success. Head Start's lack of quantifiable success for
long-term effects does not mean that it has not done any good; some
poor children get meals and health care that they might not otherwise
receive; the program has reduced the number of poor children
misdiagnosed as retarded, and some studies indicate improvement in
school attendance, academic performance and IQ test results for the
first year or two. There is, moreover, anecdotal evidence of
individual successes. Some of Head Start's operating premises --
parental involvement, self-help emphasis, local control -- are an
improvement over those of typically top-heavy bureaucratic welfare
agencies. 
<P>
      Good Intentions. While Head Start rightly claims modest success
in aiding some disadvantaged youngsters, the program mainly thrives on
good intentions. The most comprehensive study of Head Start was
completed in 1984. Among its most important findings: short-term gains
fade within a couple of years. (R. H. McKey, et al. , The Impact of
Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, 1985, cited in Ron
Haskins, "Beyond Metaphor, The Efficacy of Early Childhood Education,"
American Psychologist, February 1989, pp. 274-281.) Says Ron Haskins,
a developmental psychologist and welfare analyst for the House
Committee on Ways and Means: "Results from Head Start projects are
uncertain for the special education effects, and there is virtually no
evidence [that Head Start reduces] teen pregnancy, crime, welfare, or
unemployment." ( Haskins, op. cit., p.279.)   
<P>
      No major studies of Head Start have been released since 1985,
and none are underway, according to Esther Kresh, a senior researcher
at Head Start. Observes Kresh, who favors more studies into Head
Start's effectiveness: "There isn't anything going on now. The whole
body of research was in the early days." (Telephone interview, March
8, 1991.) Kresh adds that "the real study has never been done" on Head
Start. As a Head Start proponent, she believes that such a study would
reveal that the program works, although not to everyone's
satisfaction. For one thing, the program keeps changing. Says Kresh:
"It's gone from being a child-development program to a full-family
development program." (Interview, op. cit.)
<P>
      No Panacea. A Head Start advisory panel last year recommended
studies "to identify early and intermediate outcomes" and factors
outside the program that affect children's later chances for success,
such as family life and schooling. (Head Start Research and
Evaluation: A Blueprint for the Future. Recommendations of the
Advisory Panel for the Head Start Evaluation Design Project,
Department of Health and Human Services, September 1990, p. 4.) The
report affirms agency officials' belief in the success of other child
development programs, but cautions that "policymakers and the general
public should not be oversold that early education and intervention
programs such as Head Start, even when implemented in a high-quality
fashion, are some kind of panacea that succeed even in the absence of
appropriate ongoing child and family support." ( Op. cit., p. 14.) 
<P>
      Head Start lacks a serious benefit-cost analysis, which is a
method of expressing costs and benefits in dollars and comparing them.
"Unfortunately, there are few benefit-cost studies of early childhood
education," says Ways and Means Committee welfare analyst Haskins.
"....The only thorough benefit-cost studies published to date were
performed on one project -- the Perry Preschool program." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 279.) And, as Haskins emphasizes, "Perry is not Head
Start." (Telephone interview, March 19, 1991.)
<P>
      To sum: Hard evidence is lacking for claims by Head Start
proponents. As such, before Washington spends more taxpayer money on
Head Start, the program should be researched thoroughly. Without
conclusive evidence of lasting benefits, Head Start should not be
expanded, nor should similar programs such as Even Start. 
<P>
<B> Even Start</B>
<P>
      A little-known program, Even Start was begun in 1989. Now the
U.S. Department of Education is seeking $60 million in the fiscal 1992
federal budget for Even Start, almost triple its fiscal 1991 outlay.
Even Start's purpose, as stated in the Federal Register, is to assist
eligible local educational agencies in "providing family-centered
education projects to help parents become full partners in the
education of their children, to assist children in reaching their full
potential as learners, and to provide literacy training for their
parents." (Federal Register, Vol. 56, No. 23 (February 4, 1991), p.
4390.) Although Head Start also has parent education, Even Start
requires it. Even Start is home-based, and enrolls children aged 1
through 7; Head Start is for children ages 3 to 5 and is based in
classrooms.
<P>
      To enroll in Even Start, parents must reside in a poor area and
be eligible for adult education assistance programs. Even Start
requires parent involvement in all activities and stresses adult
literacy, parenting skills, and parent-child interaction. Asked to
compare Head Start and Even Start, Tisch Rennings, Even Start
education program specialist at the Department of Education, told a
Heritage Foundation researcher: "There really isn't any difference.
It's essentially funding for the [early childhood] programs from a
different source." (Telephone interview, February 26, 1991.) There are
no studies to date on Even Start. 
<P>
<B> The Early Education Lobby</B>
<P>
      Taxpayers are funding a campaign to increase federal support of
early childhood development programs. One of these efforts is
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," a pamphlet published by the Department of
Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement. It is
written by Sharon L. Kagan, associate director of the Bush Center in
Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University. She is active
in child care lobbying organizations like the Child Care Action
Network, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Association for
the Education of Young Children. 
<P>
      "Excellence in Early Childhood Education" calls for more federal
oversight, national standards, and more federal subsidies to child
care professionals. The 29-page essay, part of a four-part series of
"Public Policy Perspectives," calls for, among other things, a broad
campaign to persuade Americans that "early care and education programs
are now a permanent part of the social landscape." (Sharon Kagan,
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," Office of Educational Research and
Improvement, U.S. Department of Education, July 1990, p. 21.) By
publishing this essay, the Department of Education is lobbying for
expansion of programs for which there is little proof of
effectiveness.
<P>
      Kagan consistently argues for a larger federal role in early
childhood development. To do this, she wants "a single agency at the
Federal level." (Kagan, op. cit., p. 4.) Her essay includes no dissent
from the view that early childhood programs are effective, essential,
and should be brought under a federal umbrella. Parental rights
receive only lip service. The pamphlets, which cost $4,080 to print,
plus a $2,500 fee for Kagan, (Telephone interview March 18, 1991, with
Lewis Walker, chief of the Educational Information branch of the
Office of Educational Research and Improvement, Department of
Education.) were distributed to about 4,000 educators and policy
makers across the country. Although the pamphlet contains the caveat
that it "does not necessarily represent positions or policies of the
U.S. Department of Education, and no official endorsement should be
inferred," the Department's blessing is clearly implied. Indeed, the
Department has issued no companion publication with opposing views. 
<P>
<B> National Test For 3-Year-Olds</B>
<P>
      A federal panel is exploring ways to test children as young as
age 3 to determine "the skills and attitudes of the school-entering
population." ("Congressional Panel Examines Testing Three-Year-Olds,"
Education Daily, December 11, 1990, p. 2.) Yet kindergarten begins for
most children at age 5 or 6. Testing children at age 3 serves no
purpose other than to provide statistics that can be used to marshall
support for schooling at earlier ages.
<P>
      The Special Study Panel on Education Indicators was mandated in
the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary-Secondary School Improvement Act in
1988. Last December in a preliminary draft of a report to be released
this June, the panel recommended national testing of 3-year-olds. Says
panel chairman Alan Morgan, who is New Mexico's state school
superintendent: "We won't break the cycle of poverty unless we
intervene early." (Ibid.) He maintains that testing 3-year-olds "will
allow us to determine the sources of education inequities near their
roots, rather than after children have already spent time in
elementary school." (Ibid.)    The test, whose format is still under
study but which one panelist calls "a Pampers SAT," would be
expensive, requiring one-on-one sessions with "an adult trained in
early-childhood development." (Ibid.) 
<P>
      Such a testing program could be the first step in the formation
of compulsory schooling for very young children. 
<P>
<B> WHY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION?</B>
<P>
      "Early childhood education" generally refers to developmental
programs designed for 3- to 5-year-olds. Some experts prefer the term
"early childhood development" because they fear children might be
harmed by undue academic pressures. 
<P>
      Programs vary widely, from custodial care, which is basically
baby-sitting, to highly structured curriculums. Children spend as
little as a couple of hours a week at a care facility or as much as
ten hours a day, five days a week. 
<P>
      The problem is not the concept of preschools. Even families with
one full-time parent often enroll young children in nursery schools
two or three mornings a week for social activities and to give tired
parents a short break. 
<P>
      The problem is that federally funded programs are growing
rapidly despite scant evidence that they work. Says developmental
psychologist Peery: "Nobody is doing any critical thinking. It's a
mantra now." (Telephone interview, March 7, 1991.)
<P>
      In the mid-1970s, several model education programs were
organized into a consortium study, whose findings were released in
1982. (Irving Lazar, et al., Lasting Effects of Early Education: A
Report from the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies, Monographs of the
Society for Research in Child Development, 47, 2-3 Serial No. 195,
1982, cited in Haskins, op. cit., p. 274-282.) With the exception of a
study of the Perry Preschool Program, the analyses, taken as a whole,
reported substantial initial gains in children's cognitive
performances, followed by declines within a year or two, with
inconclusive evidence about long-term effects. Perry Preschool, which
early education proponents cite frequently as proof that such programs
work, is the only program for which studies report dramatic long-term
results. Neither the Perry Preschool study, however, nor the programs
in the consortium were representative of most preschools. Notes
welfare analyst Haskins: "These intervention programs were conducted
under ideal circumstances: Skilled researchers, capable staffs, ample
budgets... it seems unwise to claim that the benefits produced by such
exemplary programs would necessarily be produced by ordinary preschool
programs conducted in communities across the United States." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 277.) Head Start, on the other hand, he adds, "can be
offered as a close approximation of what could be expected from
universal preschool education for poor children." (Ibid.)
<P>
      In recent years, interest in early childhood education has
increased for several reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1)    America's failing educational system. Test scores are still
      falling, dropout rates are high, especially among the poor, and
      literacy skills are declining, despite the highest level of
      public spending on education in American history. Some people
      fear that America's children will grow up unable to compete in a
      global economy. 
<P>
2)    A plethora of seemingly intractable social problems,
      particularly in America's inner cities. Early intervention is
      seen as a way to equip children with skills that will allow them
      to succeed in school and later in life.
<P>
3)    The entry of many women into the workforce since the 1960s,
      which has created a demand for non-maternal child care. Just as
      it would be unreasonable to fashion a federal policy to induce
      all mothers to stay at home, it is just as unreasonable to
      induce all children into day care, even that which emphasizes
      early childhood education. As Heritage Foundation family policy
      analyst Rector writes in the Harvard Journal on Legislation: "We
      must ask whether government policy should actively discourage
      the home rearing of children." (Rector, op. cit., p. 541.)
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS</B>
<P>
      To justify the drive for more federal spending on programs,
early childhood advocates make several claims, among them:
<P>
CLAIM #1: 
<P>      Traditional child-rearing, that is, family life, is "obsolete"
or a mere idealization. "Less than 10 percent of families" now fit the
Ozzie and Harriet model, says Representative Patricia Schroeder, the
Colorado Democrat who has just assumed chairmanship of the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. (Cited in David
Blankenhorn, "Ozzie and Harriet: Have Reports of Their Death Been
Greatly Exaggerated?" Institute for American Values, Family Affairs,
Vol. 2, No. 2-3 (Summer/Fall, 1989), p. 10.) Another typical comment
is found in a report funded by a grant from the Department of
Education: "[Norman] Rockwell's Portrait of American Family Is
Changing: Only 4-7 percent of American families have an employed
father, full-time homemaker mother, and two children." (National
Commission on Working Women, cited in Resegregation of Public Schools:
The Third Generation, Network of Regional Desegregation Assistance
Centers, June 1989, p. 40. ) 
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The citations above are very misleading. For one thing, only
families with two children are counted. If a family has one child, or
three or more, it is not counted as a "traditional" family, even if
the family has an employed father and a full-time homemaker mother.
Not counted also are families in which the mother is employed part-
time, even if only during the summer, or is employed full-time for
only part of the year, or families with unemployed fathers. For
another thing, the term "families" is misused; the data really count
"households." This includes college students, empty nesters with grown
children, childless single adults, and others who are in different
categories entirely. 
<P>
      The latest data from the U.S. Labor Department and the Census
Bureau clearly show that two-thirds of the nation's young children are
being raised at home, most by full-time mothers or mothers who are
employed only part-time. (Marital and Family Characteristics of the
Labor Force from the March 1990 Current Population Survey, U.S.
Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, October 1990, p. 4.)
Many women leave the labor force after the birth of a second child.
Some resume part-time or full-time jobs outside the home when their
children are older. More than one-third of mothers with children aged
6 to 13 are outside the labor force; half of mothers with children
aged 6 to 17 either are outside the labor force or are employed part-
time. (Ibid.) Of mothers employed full-time, most juggle child care
responsibilities with their husbands, other family members, or
neighbors. (Ibid.)
<P>
CLAIM #2: 
    <P>  Government programs for young children prevent social ills and
boost academic scores in later life.
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The only longitudinal study to claim dramatic, long-term results
is of the Perry Preschool Program. Hundreds of other studies have
failed to duplicate the Perry findings. 
<P>
CLAIM #3: 
  <P>    A "crisis" in child care exists, so the federal government
should spend more on early childhood programs.
<P>
REALITY:
   <P>   Care facilities and programs for young children are expanding
rapidly. Between 1960 and 1986, the capacity of formal group care
centers in America increased from 141,000 to 2.1 million, while the
number of centers grew from 4,400 to 39,929 in the same period. Many
churches now operate full-day or part-day care centers. There even may
be an oversupply of day care. National day care chains such as Kinder-
Care Learning Centers, Inc. report average vacancy rates of 25
percent. (Rector, op. cit., p. 524.) The bulk of child care is being
done by parents, relatives, neighbors or by the more than 1.6 million
small, unlicensed day care providers. A 1988 Labor Department survey
finds "no evidence in support of the contention that there is a
general, national shortage of available care." (Child Care: A
Workforce Issue 10, Secretary's Task Force, U.S. Department of Labor,
1988, cited by Rector in ibid.)     
<P>
<B> The Perry Preschool Experiment</B>

   <P>   The most-often cited evidence that early childhood education
works are studies of the Perry Preschool Program, a project involving
123 black youths from poor families in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Begun in
1962, the study explores long-term effects of this high-quality early
childhood education program on 58 children. Another 65 children were
used as a control group; they did not attend preschool. The
researchers began tracking the 123 youngsters when they were three and
four years old.
<P>
      In 1984, when the subjects were between ages 19 and 24, studies
indicated long-term gains for the Perry pupils. According to the
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, which both designed the
preschool curriculum and conducted the study, the Perry pupils had
half the rate of teen-age pregnancy, a much lower rate of arrests and
juvenile delinquency and were half as likely to depend on welfare
assistance as the pupils in the control group. (John R.
Berrueta-Clement, et al., Changed Lives. The Effects of the Perry
Preschool Program on Youths Through Age 19 (Ypsilanti, Michigan:
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, 1984).) 
<P>
      Predicted Benefits. A Perry benefit-cost analysis reviewed such
factors as savings in public expenditures on education, welfare and
crime, and added taxes paid by later-employed Perry participants.
(W.S. Barnett, The Perry Preschool Program and its Long-Term Effects:
A Benefit-Cost Analysis, High/Scope Early Childhood Policy Papers, No.
2., Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1985. C.U. Weber, P.W. Foster and D.P.
Weikart, An Economic Analysis of the Perry Preschool Project
(Ypsilanti,Michigan:High/Scope, 1978). Both studies cited in Haskins,
op. cit., p 279.) Researchers concluded that "for each dollar invested
in the Perry Preschool Project, taxpayers receive a return of $1.46 by
the time participants are about 20 years of age. Predicted net
benefits over the lifetime of participants are even more substantial."
High/Scope researchers estimate that every dollar spent on preschool
education for children at risk saves $5.73 in projected future costs
to taxpayers.  (Ibid.)
<P>
      The Perry findings have been accepted widely as proof that
preschool programs, including Head Start, are good investments for
taxpayers and good for America's children. Calling the Perry program
"impressive," the House Ways and Means Committee's Haskins says well-
designed programs probably benefit some children, at least in the
short run. But he cautions: "It is unreasonable to expect that
extending preschool programs of the Head Start type to more low-income
children would produce benefits of the magnitude found in the Perry
project." (Haskins, op. cit., p. 280.) The problem with the Perry
study is that the Perry Preschool Program was far from typical. The
lessons learned from it thus have very limited applicability.
<P>
      Examples:

   <P>   Sample size. The Perry Preschool Program used a microscopic
segment of a narrowly defined population: poor, black children with
IQs between 61 and 81 in households in which a parent was home during
the day. (Zigler, op. cit., p. 30.)  Yale psychologist Zigler warns
that Perry "was not only unrepresentative of children in general;
there is some doubt that it was representative of even the bulk of
economically disadvantaged children.... it is even problematic as to
whether the sample was representative of low-income black children."
Other backers of early childhood education also say Perry's findings
need perspective. Notes Head Start's Kresh: "When they talk about a
difference in something happening, they're talking about 10 percent.
In a sample that small, they're talking about two or three kids."
(Telephone interview, March 8, 1991.) 
<P>
      Program Idiosyncrasies. Perry preschoolers were in a highly
controlled academic environment and were instructed by highly
professional educators. Perry pupils' parents were heavily involved,
and instructors visited pupils' homes each week. Few programs
duplicate such conditions, and even those that are similar have not
reproduced Perry's successes. 
<P>
      Conflicts of Interest. Studies of the Perry Program were
conducted by the same people who designed and administered the
project. High/Scope researchers have a professional and economic stake
in the program's success, including the marketing of early childhood
education program material. Such conflicts of interest prevent
High/Scope researchers, even with pure intentions, from being
objective observers. In High Scope Resource magazine, High/Scope
founder David Weikart tells educators: "Well folks, hold on to your
hats, because your salaries are going up!... Next year, Head Start
should receive approximately $700 to $800 million more in
appropriations .... There are signs of increasing financial support
for the early childhood field, including federal day care spending
bills that provide 'wrap-around services' for Head Start, allowing
Head Start to provide child care beyond its current program hours."
(David P. Weikart, High Scope Resource, Fall 1990, p. 22.) Weikart
calls for more lobbying: "We must be out there as advocates in the
public schools across the states when they are passing their
appropriations bills." (Ibid.)
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
      In the absence of hard scientific data, the federal government
should be very cautious before launching any programs. This is
particularly true, of course, for Washington's many-faceted campaign
to expand taxpayer-funded early childhood programs. 
<P>
      Warns psychologist Peery: "The public standard ought to be that
of prohibiting government from doing anything to children unless it
can be convincingly demonstrated that the children will benefit." 
<P>
      The answer to American cultural problems lies not in more
government programs to make up for family dysfunction but policies
that support families, particularly those with parents who care for
their own children. 
<P>
      To ensure that federal efforts help America's children:
<P>
      ** The Executive Order on the Family should be vigorously
enforced. Signed by Ronald Reagan in 1987, the order requires federal
agencies to take into account their policies' impact on family
formation, maintenance and general well-being" and to question whether
policies "strengthen or erode the stability of the family and the
marriage commitment" and "erode the authority and rights of parents in
the education, nurture and supervision of their children." This
Executive Order is widely ignored. The White House Office of Policy
Development submits an annual report on agencies' compliance with the
Executive Order on the Family and recommendations to the President. It
is time for George Bush to enforce them. 
<P>
      ** More research should be done on early education for
disadvantaged children to determine if there is a model that works and
can be replicated. Such efforts should target severely disadvantaged
children, follow methods for which there is evidence of success, and
use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
      ** Existing childhood education programs should be evaluated by
independent researchers. Bureaucracies cannot be expected to analyze
fairly the programs that they administer. Studies -- and federal
policies -- should take into account the impact of and impact on
families. 
<P>
      ** Federal policies should be based on giving parents more
choices. This could be achieved through vouchers and tax credits for
child care and education. If schools fail to teach, it is not because
they have not enrolled children soon enough.
<P>
      ** Families should be strengthened, not supplanted by social
programs. The federal tax code should not punish two-parent families
with children. The personal exemption for dependents should be
increased substantially. The $600 exemption of 1948 would be worth
more than $6,000 today. Welfare programs should be redesigned to
encourage fatherhood, not father abandonment. Taxpayers should not be
subsidizing family break-up, and government should intervene only in
cases of extreme hardship or abuse.  
<P>
      Families are America's greatest cultural resource. Federal
policies, however well-intentioned, that hinder families or supplant
parental authority lead to more social problems, not fewer. Parents
who sacrifice by cutting work hours, by temporarily leaving the work
force, by rearranging schedules or downscaling their life styles so
that one parent can care for young children at home suffer
discrimination two ways: they are taxed to subsidize services they do
not want or use, and they are taxed to support campaigns designed to
justify those services. 
<P>
      Early childhood development programs must be better scrutinized
for their effects on children and families before the federal
government spends more taxpayers' money on them. Says former Education
Secretary William J. Bennett: "Government, obviously, cannot fill a
child's emotional needs. Nor can it fill his spiritual or moral needs.
Government is not a father or a mother." (William J. Bennett,
"Children and Culture in Modern America," remarks at University of
Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, October 17, 1990.)
<P>
      Empowering Parents. Children need their parents, and parents
need more choice in how they spend their time and money. The best way
to empower children is to empower their parents -- the people who care
most and know what is best for their children.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the 1992 presidential race, the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop Thinking 
About Tomorrow" became the official anthem of the Clinton campaign. Once in office, 
the new administration lost little time infusing every facet of its domestic agenda with 
concern about the future. But its defense agenda has been curiously immune to long-term 
thinking. Rather than planning for tomorrow, the administration's defense policies reflect 
a disturbing preoccupation with the concerns of the moment.</P>
<P>	This is a dangerous flaw. The record of the 20th century suggests that the present 
period of diminished global tensions will not last, and that major new threats to national 
survival may emerge in the near future. However, the Clinton administration seems to 
assume that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history, at least as far as great-
power threats to national security were concerned. The result is a U.S. defense budget 
that exhibits high levels of consumption and very low levels of investment.</P>
<P>	Both in their rhetoric and in their resource allocations, senior Pentagon executives 
and many congressional Republicans have been preoccupied with "readiness"--the 
ability to fight effectively on short notice. Readiness is a notoriously nebulous concept, 
but in economic terms it translates into consumption: Money is spent to preserve and 
enhance current capabilities rather than prepare for the future.</P>
<P>	Like other forms of consumption, readiness tends to be bought at the expense of 
procurement of new weapons. In inflation-adjusted terms, Pentagon procurement 
accounts now stand at the lowest levels since 1950, the year the Korean War began. The 
$39 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for weapons procurement in fiscal 
1996 constitutes only 16 percent of a defense budget that itself has shrunk to a mere 15.5 
percent of overall federal expenditures. In other words, the Pentagon's planned spending 
on all types of equipment for military services in fiscal 1996 adds up to only 2.5 percent 
of the federal budget--an amount of money equal to about four months' of sales by the 
Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration contends that this low level of investment is justified 
by a diminished threat and the huge inventory of weapons accumulated during the Cold 
War. It also claims that a planned increase in procurement will lead to "recapitalization" 
of the armed forces toward the end of the 1996-2001 Future Years Defense Plan. 
However, the Pentagon's current predictions for 2001 may not be any more reliable than 
those of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is possible that spending on 
procurement will remain depressed. If that occurs--while high levels of readiness are 
sustained--the armed forces will suffer continued depletion of their weapons inventories.</P>

<H3>Lessons of the Past</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the depletion of capital stocks could coincide with the reemergence 
of threats abroad and a revolution in military technology, creating a situation not unlike 
that of the 1930s. The current debate over national-security needs presents a rather 
distressing spectacle in historical amnesia. The struggle with communism for the past two 
generations has so strongly influenced policymakers that they exhibit little apparent 
capacity for interpreting that experience in a broader context.</P>
<P>	The Cold War was the third occasion in this century when the U.S. mobilized to 
prevent anti-democratic forces from dominating Eurasia. The century began with the 
challenge posed by German imperialism, and barely a generation later the U.S. was at war 
again, this time to defeat fascism. The outcome of WWII then set the stage for the anti-
communist crusade of the post-war period. </P>
<P>	Note that the same pattern repeated itself with each new danger. Regional powers 
gradually accumulated land and resources while the United States was distracted; early 
warnings that a great-power threat was emerging were greeted with widespread 
skepticism; when the threat became urgent, U.S. leaders discovered they were woefully 
unprepared and commenced a hasty mobilization; once the threat passed, the nation 
engaged in an equally hasty demobilization. After a period of relative tranquillity, the 
cycle has repeated itself.</P>
<P>	It is remarkable that the political elite of a world power could experience three 
complete threat cycles in one century and still not grasp the basic lesson that a fourth 
such challenge is likely sometime relatively soon. As Colin Gray, a military theorist, has 
noted, "American policymaking in the national security area tends to be dominated by 
people with a poor sense of the value of history." Whatever the explanation, current U.S. 
defense policies reflect a startling lack of strategic vision.</P>
<P>	For example, the 1993 Bottom-Up Review was conceived by the Clinton 
administration as a comprehensive assessment of military resources and requirements for 
the post-Cold War period. It prudently concluded that U.S. forces should be able to 
successfully prosecute "two major regional conflicts that occur nearly simultaneously." 
And yet nowhere in the document is the historical significance of regional conflicts 
clearly spelled out--that great-power threats to U.S. security typically originate in 
regional aggression not countered in a timely manner. </P>
<P>	From this perspective, the real danger posed by Saddam Hussein in 1990-91 was 
not his violent annexation of Kuwait, for the invasion of Kuwait was no more significant 
than Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 or Germany's remilitarization of the 
Rhineland in 1936. The danger lies in the bolder designs an aggressor might pursue if he 
encounters no resistance.</P>
<P>	History thus provides a compelling reason for being ready to fight. But it also 
teaches that the emergence of aggressive great powers is characteristic of the geopolitical 
landscape, and that unless the United States continually invests in new defense 
capabilities, it may eventually be unable to avoid defeat at the hands of such a power.</P>
<P>	Viewed against this backdrop, the fundamental defect of the Clinton 
administration's defense plan is all too evident: It purchases current readiness at the price 
of future preparedness. When procurement spending is inadequate, high levels of 
readiness inevitably use up weapons for which there are no replacements. Meanwhile, a 
drop in military contracts prompts the production base of the defense industry to atrophy. 
The U.S. thus gradually loses the military and industrial capacity to respond effectively to 
aggression.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration recognizes this problem and therefore has begun to 
plan for the "recapitalization" of the armed forces--an unfortunate appropriation of a 
term usually associated with the restructuring of bankrupt organizations. But the concept 
of bankruptcy may not be entirely misplaced, because administration plans make future 
procurement increases contingent on raising the overall defense budget and realizing 
substantial savings from base closures and acquisition reform. None of these sources can 
be counted on to generate enough money for a sustained surge in investment.</P>

<H3>The "Procurement Holiday"</H3>
<P>	The Congressional Budget Office refers to the current slump in weapons 
purchases as a "procurement holiday." But like Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" 
during the darkest days of the Great Depression, this is merely a pleasant way of 
describing a system on the verge of collapse. The real buying power of the Pentagon's 
procurement budget declined 67 percent between fiscal 1985--the peak year of President 
Reagan's defense buildup--and fiscal 1995. The administration proposes a procurement 
budget of only $39 billion in 1996, which would bring the total reduction from the peak 
in fiscal 1985 to 71 percent. Backlogs in defense contracts are expected to contract 
eventually by a similar amount, forcing many defense contractors to exit the business and 
reducing competition among those who remain.</P>
<P>	No other part of the defense budget has experienced a comparable decline. The 
major categories of weapons-related expenditures correspond roughly with the key stages 
in the product life cycle: research and development, procurement, and operations and 
maintenance. The operations and maintenance budget includes most of the spending 
related to readiness, whereas R&D, together with procurement, constitutes most 
investment spending. All three accounts declined between fiscal 1990 (the year the Berlin 
Wall fell) and fiscal 1995. But procurement shrank from 28 percent of a relatively large 
budget to 17 percent of a much smaller budget. In constant 1995 dollars, procurement 
spending fell in just five years from $94 billion to $43 billion--a 54 percent cut.</P>
<P>	The impact of declining procurement expenditures on the production of major 
weapon systems has been dramatic:</P>
<UL><LI>  In fiscal 1996, the Air Force does not plan to purchase a single fighter or bomber. In 
fact, it plans to purchase no new bombers throughout the 1996-2001 Future Years 
Defense Plan, even though nearly half of its long-range bombers are more than 30 years 
old, and the sole fighter program it has in development (the F-22) has been repeatedly cut 
back and delayed.<BR>
<LI>  The Navy plans to purchase seven ships in fiscal 1996, only a third as many as it 
purchased in 1990. Over the course of the Future Years Defense Plan, it will buy just one 
submarine every other year from its last remaining sub manufacturer, and many observers 
believe the recently authorized CVN-76 will be the last large-deck carrier the service 
procures.<BR>
<LI>  The Army has stopped purchasing main battle tanks, and has no plans to resume 
purchases any time in the next 15 years. It has been unable to find sufficient funding to 
support upgrades to its existing tanks at an economic rate.</UL>
<P>	The Clinton administration argues that reduced levels of procurement are an 
appropriate response to the end of the Cold War, and that the high procurement 
expenditures of the Reagan-Bush years have made it possible to adequately equip 
shrinking military forces without buying new weapons. Senior administration officials 
point out that R&D spending for new weapons technologies has declined only 
moderately, and that when recapitalization commences early in the next century, it will 
not be necessary to replace weapons on a one-for-one basis. They also claim that by the 
time it is necessary to increase procurement, acquisition reforms will make it possible to 
acquire some military systems more quickly and less expensively from commercial 
sources. Finally, they note that a 47 percent real increase in procurement is planned 
between fiscal 1996 and 2001.</P>
<P>	If all of these assertions proved true, there would be little reason for concern. The 
U.S. would presumably be well-positioned for the challenges that might arise in the next 
century. However, the administration's positions obscure as much as they reveal, and are 
based on assumptions that may prove to be unreliable. For example, the same acquisition 
reforms that supposedly will enable the armed forces to buy advanced technologies more 
quickly and cheaply from commercial sources will also facilitate the transfer of those 
technologies to potential adversaries. As the acquisition system places increased 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies with both military and commercial applications, it is 
inevitable that foreign nations will gain greater access to advanced military capabilities. 
Acquisition reform could thus hasten the emergence of new threats.</P>
<P>	The contention that a smaller force structure can be adequately equipped from 
existing weapons inventories has some validity. For instance, the average age of ships in 
the Navy's active fleet is declining despite the low level of new procurement, because 
older ships are being retired in large numbers. However, the administration's own data 
demonstrate that many key military systems are approaching the mid-point of their 
projected lives, and will eventually require replacements. Furthermore, continuously 
depressed levels of new procurement will gradually erode the defense industry's capacity 
to produce those replacements. In the case of the submarine business, the Navy will soon 
be dependent on a single shipyard that is producing only one boat every two years. If 
even one submarine is removed from the production schedule, the supplier base will 
probably collapse.</P>
<P>	The most misleading argument the administration advances is that it is cutting 
procurement while maintaining R&D specifically in order to prepare for future threats. 
That ignores what is being developed and what is actually being procured. In December, 
the administration announced that the Army's highest-priority acquisition program, the 
Comanche helicopter, would be kept in development and not moved forward to 
production. The Comanche is the only truly stealthy aircraft likely to enter the Army 
inventory in the next 20 years, so deferring its production means soldiers will have to 
face future threats in increasingly vulnerable conventional helicopters. Thus the benefits 
of a decade of development are being lost because of a decision not to procure.</P>
<P>	Similarly, the administration is resisting congressional efforts to procure 
additional B-2 "stealth" bombers even though there is extensive evidence that the planned 
force of 20 B-2s and 200 older bombers cannot meet projected operational requirements. 
Opposing further purchases of the B-2 might make sense if a cheaper and equally 
survivable alternative were under development, but it isn't. Instead, the Air Force plans to 
rely on vulnerable B-1s and B-52s to carry out the bulk of future long-range bombing 
missions. Here again, the benefits of a $20-billion development effort are being 
squandered, with no long-term plan for recovery in sight.</P>

<H3>Bad Trade</H3>
<P>	It is obvious that such decisions are not being driven by doctrinal or operational 
considerations. They are dictated by budgetary pressures. The Clinton administration 
apparently has concluded that unless there is a significant increase in defense spending, 
readiness can only be maintained by drastically limiting investment. This is a tradeoff that 
cannot be continued indefinitely because low levels of procurement eventually translate 
into low levels of preparedness. It is a tradeoff that is not only unacceptable, but 
unnecessary. To avoid this trap, the Pentagon must get serious about privatizing military 
support functions.</P>
<P>	In recent years, many private companies have restructured their operations to 
focus on core competencies. By shedding activities that either are not central to the 
organization's mission or can be performed less expensively by others, companies are 
able to emphasize what they do well and thereby improve their efficiency. The 
Department of Defense is overdue for such a restructuring. Although the department has 
undergone considerable downsizing and there is much talk of "reinventing" what 
remains, there is little evidence of greater efficiency. The result is that even in the midst 
of a budget crisis, the Pentagon continues to waste huge amounts of money.</P>
<P>	The defense department lacks market discipline, and exhibits many of the 
managerial defects of a top-down monopoly. That is hardly surprising, because the 
department was established to exercise a monopoly in the application of military power, 
and like the rest of the federal government it is not a product of economic forces. But it 
still can benefit from those forces.</P>
<P>	After WWII, the department accumulated a vast array of support functions--such 
as supply management, equipment maintenance, dependent health care, data processing, 
accounting, and commissaries--that, while necessary to the effective exercise of military 
power, do not need to be performed by the government. One way of freeing up money for 
additional procurement is to gradually privatize those support functions that can be 
provided by private-sector sources.</P>
<P>	The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the federal government 
saves nearly $10,000 every time the functions of a worker are contracted out. On average, 
the government "outsourcing" saves 20 to 30 percent per contract. However, contracting 
out and privatization have been constrained by convention and by concern that critical 
services might not be available from private-sector providers in wartime. There is little 
empirical basis for this concern, and the cost of continuing to make policy as if it were 
valid is staggering. For example, studies of the $15-billion depot-maintenance system for 
conducting weapons repairs have found 25 to 50 percent of the system is unneeded 
capacity. Some outsourcing of depot maintenance already occurs, but complete 
privatization could probably save billions of dollars every year.</P>
<P>	There are numerous other examples of defense support activities that could be 
privatized. About 48,000 civilian and military personnel are engaged in supply and 
distribution activities. Overhead costs for goods delivered by these personnel average 70 
to 90 percent of the value of the goods themselves, a high figure by private-sector 
standards. The transportation, storage, and administrative costs associated with buying 
and distributing spare parts alone is roughly $5 billion per year, not counting the cost of 
the parts. Many private-sector companies have developed advanced inventory 
management and distribution systems that could substantially cut these costs.</P>
<P>	Financial-information systems is another area that could benefit from 
privatization. The Pentagon reported in 1994 that of 28 major audits of its operations in 
the previous year, 26 were unfavorable. During the same year, the department was unable 
to match $19 billion in disbursements to specific contractual requirements, meaning the 
money may have been paid erroneously. The level of unmatched disbursements is all the 
more striking in view of the fact that it requires more than 100 separate transactions for 
the department to issue a single check. Despite all of these steps, many of which 
presumably exist to prevent mistakes, the chief of staff of the Air Force recently said that 
"it would be nice if we knew what actual costs were, but our accounting systems often do 
not perform this simple and reasonable service."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration is striving mightily to "reinvent" the Pentagon's 
financial management systems, but "deinvention" might make more sense. The private 
sector is full of data-management and accounting firms that long ago solved the challenge 
of tracking money within large organizations. Many large firms have turned over their 
day-to-day financial-support requirements to these firms. The Pentagon should seriously 
consider doing the same thing, just as it should consider turning over the post-exchange 
and commissary functions to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>	An example of how greater reliance on the marketplace could reduce defense 
support costs is provided by the General Services Administration's 1991 decision to 
transfer time-urgent delivery functions to FedEx Corp. The General Accounting Office 
estimates that relying on private-sector sources for overnight delivery reduced the 
government's costs by 76 percent. FedEx's performance was such an improvement that 
the Air Force is increasingly relying on private-sector providers for its own deliveries of 
critical spare parts.</P>
<P>	Nobody really knows how much money the Department of Defense might save 
through the wholesale privatization of support functions. But the annual savings could 
eventually be sufficient to sustain higher levels of procurement without cutting readiness 
or force structure. In fact, privatization would have multiple benefits for the procurement 
budget: Not only would it free up funds for weapons purchases, but transferring 
weapons-support functions to the companies that make the systems could also help 
preserve critical industrial capabilities and reduce the overhead costs they charge on 
procurement contracts.</P> 
<P>	If there is a final lesson in all this, it is that there is no substitute for vision, 
whether strategic or managerial. We may not be able to know the future, but we certainly 
can have a reasonably clear idea of what the past tells us about the range of possibilities. 
In the case of defense spending, past experience warns against a prolonged drought in 
investment, particularly when high levels of readiness are gradually consuming existing 
capital equipment. In the case of defense management, past experience dictates that the 
marketplace is the most efficient provider of goods, and that continuing to perform 
support functions within the government reduces the military's capacity to accomplish its 
mission. These are easy lessons to grasp; the question is whether we will have the 
courage to act on them. Investing more in modern weapons while privatizing support 
functions would prove that, for once, we have learned from our past mistakes.</P>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We're not report takers. We're the police."<sup>2</sup>  This bold message greets visitors to the New York City Police Department's crime strategy center, where for three hours, twice a week, the city's 76 precinct commanders gather to report their challenges and successes. And during William J. Bratton's brief tenure as Commissioner of Police, the department achieved some stunning successes: since 1993, a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder.<sup>3</sup>  Bratton's winning strategy: Hammer home his aggressive, crime-fighting, morale-building message to his troops while demanding (and getting) measurable results in combating crime and disorder from his commanders in the field.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime. As a result of New York City's success, "Mayors, police chiefs, and scholars from San Diego to Singapore to Saudi Arabia come crowding into the NYPD's meeting room to learn first hand how this new technique works," says George L. Kelling, professor of criminology at Northeastern University.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, many other innovative local officials are enjoying successes similar to New York City's. "Police can reduce crime now, within constraints. They needn't wait for new cars or computers, more cops, bigger budget or more overtime," says Professor Kelling.<sup>5</sup>  More than anything else, local police need solid personnel management and a clear mission to combat crime and disorder, with serious backup from the public, the politicians, and the press. Bratton's stunning success in New York City is largely attributable to his progressive vision of what the police can do to control crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident. They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing. Among the lessons and actions taken:<ul>
<p><li>
<b>Police should target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> Successful police departments focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. They also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p><li>
<b>Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> While Americans want the best police protection, too many metropolitan areas around the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical, and character standards within the police force. Failure to maintain standards leads to a loss of lan among police officers themselves. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal, or incompetent police officers and a lowering of public confidence.
<p><li>
<b>Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies. These managerial and political decisions compromise the integrity and effectiveness of local law enforcement.
</ul><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials can learn from the experience of the growing number of cities and localities that have strengthened their police forces through their own efforts. These localities have improved personnel management, including direct accountability for police performance, while also employing the most effective strategies and the most sophisticated technical and information systems to track, prevent, and combat violent crime. Without waiting for official Washington, local officials can take decisive steps to improve their own police departments. These steps include<ul>

<p><li><b>Upgrading</b> recruitment and training standards;

<p><li><b>Aggressively recruiting</b> police officers from the ranks of the military (which would expand the number of well-qualified black and minority applicants);

<p><li><b>Improving</b> the techniques used to detect and prevent crime;

<p><li><b>Targeting</b> the small number of criminals responsible for most of the serious crime;

<p><li><b>Focusing</b> on urban "hot spots" where crime flourishes;

<p><li><b>Making</b> salaries commensurate with responsibilities and performance;

<p><li><b>Privatizing</b> and civilianizing non-police administrative functions;

<p><li><b>Promoting</b> community policing; and

<p><li><b>Demanding</b> direct accountability of police commanders in the field. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Support from the State and Courts</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Even with excellent police work, violent criminals typically serve only a portion of their sentences, often as little as one-third.<sup>6</sup>  The tireless work of police officers and detectives often seems to be in vain, as repeat violent offenders are released from prison after spending minimal time behind bars. To back up the police, legislatures and courts must act to keep violent criminals and other perpetrators of serious crimes off the streets. Among the remedial measures needed are the reform of parole and probation systems and the adoption of truth in sentencing laws to make sure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>7</sup>  Police officers have a personal interest in such policies: Between 1988 and 1992, 20 percent of all persons arrested for killing law enforcement officers were on probation or parole at the time of the offense.<sup>8</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress also can support America's local police, but not in the ways that often characterize action in Washington. In response to the continuing escalation of violent crime, the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton, enacted the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The promise: 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets.<sup>9</sup>  But thus far, the program has meant little more than 17,000 additional police on the streets. Worse, the Administration's funding allocation does not target localities hardest hit by violent crime, and many local governments are finding it difficult to bear the required financial burden of the matching formula.<sup>10</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress could be far more helpful by:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Providing more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> This would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL).

<p><li><b>Reforming criminal procedure.</b> This means such things as enacting reform of the so-called exclusionary rule, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, to allow a good faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations. Hearings on the impact of the <I>Miranda</I> rule governing the taking of statements from suspects doubtless would prove enlightening and might build support for reasonable changes. In exercising their confirmation responsibilities with regard to the appointment of federal judges, Senators also could and should block the appointment of any candidate with a record of demonstrated insensitivity to public safety. Congress recently achieved a long-overdue reform by putting a stop to the judicial imposition of prison caps on state and local prisons. These court-imposed caps have been putting violent felons back on America's streets.<sup>11</sup>  Police officers and crime victims alike have been frustrated and demoralized by such liberal judicial policies. 

<p><li><b>Improving the social environment by replacing failed federal urban policies with a new neighborhood empowerment strategy.</b> Inner-city communities can be renewed through genuine enterprise zones. Scholarships and vouchers can help poor children escape crime-ridden schools and attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that respect parental responsibility, reinforce the moral teachings of their parents, and promote civilized conduct. Federal policies can encourage effective neighborhood social service agencies, including faith-based drug treatment and counseling activities, to improve the social climate. Strong community-based organizations, working closely with the police, also can help prevent crime. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) are sponsoring comprehensive legislation, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467), to accomplish these goals.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
 
<b>BACK TO BASICS: WHY PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEED TO RETHINK THE ROLE OF THE POLICE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local police are invested with awesome public authority, yet they often lack the public respect or official understanding that their specific duties should command.<sup>13</sup>  They are expected to make instantaneous and complex decisions, to put themselves in danger, and to act calmly in the most terrifying circumstances, yet they are often underpaid and lack the status of other public officials in much less demanding occupations. Many police officers find this combination of demands and pressures demoralizing.14 <P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The inherent problem of police work is that the law often specifies what the police officer cannot do; it does not tell him what he should do.<sup>15</sup>  In virtually every public or private institution, the discretion available to a person is directly proportional to his rise in the hierarchy. Those at the top have the most discretion, while those at the bottom have the least. But discretion in the exercise of police authority increases as one goes <I>down</I> the hierarchy.<sup>16</sup>  Whether working alone or with a partner, the police officer usually is not subject to any immediate supervision, and his judgments under pressure are subjected to constant analysis and second-guessing by the public and the courts.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy has noted, the ideal police officer is in tune with the community and able to spot a likely problem before the fact, not just respond after the fact to something that already has become a local tragedy.<sup>17</sup>  Ideally, under circumstances less threatening than a life-or-death situation, a police officer functions best as a "streetcorner politician," peacefully settling disputes and using his social skills to assuage potential combatants and maintain order.<sup>18</sup>  Thus, the special challenge for local officials is to make sure that the recruit is a person of "quiet confidence" who can take control of a situation without identifying criminal resistance to established public authority as some sort of personal slight.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This constant need to exercise prudential judgment illuminates yet another paradox of police work. Police management is likely to give a cop "credit" for an arrest, and yet the resort to an arrest may very well represent a genuine failure to keep order. If a neighborhood dispute is resolved carefully, the police intervention is an unrecorded success.<sup>20</sup>  But if the officer fails to defuse the situation, and there is a crime leading to an arrest and prosecution, the cop who lets the situation deteriorate gets "credit" for the arrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For state and local officials, the heart of police reform is personnel management.<sup>21</sup>  The higher educational achievements of officers recruited during the 1940s contributed to the "professionalization" of the police from the 1950s on, and generally produced tougher standards in recruiting urban police officers. In New York City, for example, standardized tests, including IQ tests, were common during the 1950s and 1960s, and the performance of recruits in the Police Academy invariably was above the average for the population generally. As Arthur Niederhoff, a veteran officer and authority on the New York City Police Department, has reported, any recruit with an IQ below the normal range had only a small chance of being recruited either by the NYPD or by other major police departments.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1950s and 1960s, the New York City Police Department also undertook rigorous background investigations into the character, reputation, and medical and psychological histories of recruits. Approximately 50 percent of the applicants who passed the examinations eventually were eliminated.<sup>23</sup>  The rule was simple: Any doubt concerning an applicant's fitness for appointment was to be resolved in "favor of the department."<sup>24</sup>  The rules governing retention on the force were likewise rigorous: Officers were expected to refrain from any behavior (including immoral personal behavior) "that would tend to bring adverse criticism of the department."<sup>25</sup>  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the rate of acceptance in the NYPD was only 15 percent.<sup>26</sup>  In Tucson, Arizona, the acceptance rate during the same period was 6 percent; and in Los Angeles, California, the acceptance rate from 1950-1962 was only 4 percent.<sup>27</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the recent trend in many cities back to community policing, the job requirements are likely to be even stiffer. One recent study of the competencies essential in "a community policing environment" concludes that "skills in effective verbal communication, listening and demonstration of empathy or understanding in a multicultural society are extremely essential. The ability to identify problems, make commitments, understand the reality of the police impact on crime, analyze situations, demonstrate persistence, employ situational strategies, and recognize solutions to problems are also extremely essential competencies."<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In recent years, the working conditions for patrol officers have become tougher. As police departments have become more specialized and bureaucratic, officers have been moved from the street to staff jobs even as crime rates and the workload of patrol officers have increased. The result: "Odd hours, overtime, and off-duty court appearances, not to mention the most dangerous job in the organization, [have made] patrol work the least desirable policing assignment. Ironically, like the classroom teacher and the ward nurse, it is the lowest paid and least respected part of the operation."<sup>29</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials should be aware that demoralization is a serious and recurrent occupational hazard among police officers. In urban areas, the social and economic elites have largely abandoned the central cities, and inner-city communities themselves are often crime-ridden. Big-city police often feel they are fighting a losing battle against overwhelming odds. Far too many of the persons they arrest for violent crimes are out on probation, parole, or pre-trial release.

<p>
<b>Undercut by Lawyers and Judges</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Police also are frustrated with lenient judges and frequent plea bargaining arrangements. In 1993, for example, 90 percent of the 200,000 felony convictions in the United States were plea bargained.<sup>30</sup>  In one survey, 60 percent of police officers felt that criminal plea bargaining was "unfair to the arresting officer."<sup>31</sup>  Such frustration and cynicism, compounded by poor personnel management, fuel police demoralization. They also contribute to what is known as "the cop culture," the fraternal secrecy and mutual self-defense network thrown up to protect good and bad cops alike. Not surprisingly, studies also indicate that the suicide rate among police officers is more than twice that of the general population.<sup>32</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Americans strongly support putting more police on the streets.<sup>33</sup>  The popular assumption is that increasing the number of police will decrease crime rates, but the quantity of police does not make up for poor management of police or poor working conditions. In 1992, for instance, Washington, D.C.'s homicide rate was six times higher, and its overall serious crime rate two times higher, than San Diego's. Yet Washington had five times as many police officers per capita as San Diego. Moreover, in 1989, when Washington increased its overall police force by 19 percent under congressional mandate, serious violent crime actually rose by 15 percent, and homicide jumped 9 percent over a period of one year.<sup>34</sup>  Between 1952 and 1978, total police personnel in the United States rose from 254,000 to 689,000, an increase of 171 percent; between 1957 and 1978, incidents of reported crime rose from 1,422,000 to 11,141,3000, an increase of 657 percent.<sup>35</sup>  Overall, "More than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime."<sup>36</sup>  Declares Dr. Gregory Berg, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, "We know that the number of police on the street and police methods in general have little effect on crime rates."<sup>37</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, imaginative public policy is running ahead of public policy research. In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing. With the evolution of modern information systems and the application of improved strategic thinking on the part of police managers, much more fruitful research is possible.<sup>38</sup> Local officials can adopt strong empirical measures of police performance. But success rests ultimately on the intangibles: Courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community.

<p>
<b>COMPETENCE AND CONFIDENCE: KEEPING LAW AND ORDER</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Approximately 80 percent of the urban police officer's job is "restoring order."<sup>39</sup>  In practice, this means coping with such relatively minor things as drunken and disorderly conduct, loud noise in the neighborhood, fights and scuffles, or bar-room brawls. It is also the main interest of the public: "In focus groups, community meetings and surveys, citizens regularly report the biggest safety concerns to be things like panhandling, obstreperous youth taking over parks or street corners, public drinking, prostitution and other disorderly behavior. Such concerns cross class, race, and ethnic boundaries, and occur in all areas of the country."<sup>40</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In any given circumstance, restoring order involves intervening and settling a "dispute" about what is "right" or "seemly."<sup>41</sup>  Thus, the situation is governed not only by law, but by the social circumstances and prevailing "subculture" of the neighborhood or community. Indeed, custom is often more important than law in "street situations."<sup>42</sup>  While these incidents may appear to be minor, they can be dangerous, for they often involve personal "honor and dishonor."  Despite its importance to the public, police are often "defensive" in keeping order. They recognize that they are dealing, at least initially, with minor offenses or " misdemeanors" which are unlikely to result in jail or even significant fines. This means that the entire process of arrest, booking, and preliminary hearings is, in most instances, a waste of limited and valuable time; "[t]he most important consequence of this state of affairs is that with respect to routine police matters, the normal tendency of the police is to underenforce the law."<sup>43</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The best guide to making an arrest in such cases is the police officer's own experience and judgment, combined with a strong working knowledge of the law. A notorious neighborhood troublemaker, well-known to the police, for example, invariably is a good candidate for arrest and is worth the personal investment in the time and paperwork the arrest entails. Nevertheless, the police officer knows that very few of his arrests are likely to result in prosecution; for every 56 persons arrested by the police, only 1 goes to prison.<sup>44</sup>  Most of those arrested are released within 12 hours.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nowhere is deciding whether to arrest a suspect more difficult than in cases of domestic violence. In 1984, for example, a controlled experiment in Minneapolis found that male batterers arrested by the police were largely deterred by these arrests which were "more effective" than "peacekeeping strategies."<sup>46</sup>  Further analysis revealed, however, that while this strategy worked if the male batterer was employed, the arrest of batterers who were unemployed led to increased violence toward their partners.<sup>47</sup>  State and local officials must be mindful of the trade-off between arrest and police presence on the street, especially in view of the fact that "[t]he deterrent effects of an arrest and of patrol presence on the streets have never been compared."<sup>48</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effectiveness of the police in maintaining order and quelling disorder has a broad impact on the prevention or reduction of more serious crime. "For decades," however, "most big city police departments have devoted little effort to combatting disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions."<sup>49</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Disorder is highest in neighborhoods characterized not only by loss of economic vitality, but also by social instability: broken families, fatherless children, and physically and sexually abusive criminal adults, the ultimate source of crime.<sup>50</sup>  Broken windows, graffiti, drunken and disorderly conduct, prostitution, and the like all say to the small criminal population responsible for most serious urban crime that members of the community are indifferent to the conditions around them and do not care enough to call the police to stop the disorder in their midst.<sup>51</sup>  These disordered territories become "hot spots," geographical areas open to illegal business and more serious crime such as the sale of crack cocaine, which is strongly associated with rises in violent crime. Moreover, most violent crime is the deadly work of a criminal class comprised largely of males aged 15 to 24 from broken families, with low cognitive abilities (particularly low verbal skills) and a history of anti-social behavior and multiple arrests: "The 5 to 7 percent of the population falling into the category of habitual offenders is responsible for no less than half of all arrests or police contacts."  <sup>52</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This spatial concentration has profound implications for effective urban policing: "Spreading more police out across a big city and lowering response time, the research shows, will have little effect on crime -- no matter what neighborhood groups think. But more police attacking the risk factors for crime -- like guns on the street in 'hot spots' street corners -- could make a substantial difference in crime."<sup>53</sup>  This is especially true of gun crime. Of the approximately 200 million guns in the United States, one-third are handguns; and about 2 percent of these handguns are used to commit crimes.<sup>54</sup>  Therefore, "Concentration of police crime prevention in places with the highest gun crime may be the most effective way to protect everyone, not just residents of the high crime locations."<sup>55</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton made the concerted attack on neighborhood disorder a top priority, combining modern management techniques with an older tradition of policing based on a perceived relationship between neighborhood disorder and serious crime. Bratton's "Police Strategy No. 5," for example, declares that "By working systematically and assertively to reduce the level of disorder in the City, the NYPD will act to undercut the ground on which more serious crimes seem possible and even permissible"<sup>56</sup> This neighborhood-based strategy involves an all-out attack on the components of neighborhood disorder, including prostitution, liquor sales to minors, and violations of noise ordinances, as well as felonies. Violators are cited, and persistent violators are arrested; moreover, these arrests are accompanied by probing police interrogations by officers looking for leads to more serious criminal activities, especially gun-related crimes. When Commissioner Bratton headed the New York City Transit Police, his aggressive methods re-established order on New York's subway systems, long a notorious crime "hot spot;" felonies in that system declined 75 percent in four years.<sup>57</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bratton's success in New York City is mirrored to a lesser extent in other metropolitan areas in which police have combined this aggressive neighborhood-based strategy with innovative community policing techniques. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Sarasota, Florida, for example, are bringing police officers and their families back into troubled neighborhoods through low-interest home loans. Not only do the police live where they work, but the program also sends a positive message to law-abiding residents in these neighborhoods that the police are there to protect them. Chief Charles Austin of Columbia, South Carolina, says that the city's home loan program has contributed to a 16 percent decrease in crime.<sup>58</sup>  Similarly innovative community police programs can be found in cities throughout the United States, including Lowell, Massachusetts; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Indianapolis, Indiana; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California.

<b>Enforcing the Law</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
For the officer on the street, enforcing the law or stopping the commission of a serious crime is more clear-cut than settling a dispute over what constitutes "disorderly" behavior. In practice, however, it is difficult to combat serious crime either by preventing it or by arresting the perpetrator after the fact. Police responding immediately to a case make an arrest in only 2.9 percent of all calls involving serious crimes.<sup>59</sup>  Only 25 percent of all calls to the police in cases of serious crime involve actual contact between the victim and the offender; 75 percent of all serious crimes are reported after the fact.<sup>60</sup>  And, as noted previously, almost half of America's violent crime is never even reported to the police.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the initial report is taken, the task of resolving serious crimes usually is reserved to the detectives, whose work requires the ability to ask the right questions, a sound capacity for deductive reasoning, and a keen sense of human nature. In most major metropolitan departments, regardless of the social changes that have taken place over many years, detectives are viewed as the professional elite of the police force.<sup>61</sup>  On the face of it, their work is daunting. They must identify, locate, and arrest the suspect and then prepare a careful report of the criminal investigation, replete with all the pertinent facts of the case. This is the crucial body of information to be used by the prosecution both in determining the charge and ultimately in proving its case in court. The detective must prepare for his own testimony and cross examination as a key state witness at the preliminary hearing and at the trial itself, seeing the case through to its ultimate resolution.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, this job has been complicated by a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that, in effect, have federalized state criminal procedure, including the rules of evidence, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and the original intent of the Framers. For example, in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> (1961), the Court mandated the exclusion of evidence in cases involving even the most technical violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. In <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966), the Court held that a person held as a suspect in a criminal case must be informed of his right to remain silent and to have his lawyer with him during the interrogation.<sup>62</sup>  Again, the penalty for even a minor police mistake was exclusion of any statement made by the suspect. <I>Miranda</I> in particular was met with a storm of protest from local police officials, who argued that it would handcuff their investigative work. Congress responded by enacting a provision in the Crime Control Act of 1968 which allowed a judge, after looking at the totality of circumstances surrounding a confession in a federal case and finding that the confession was given to the law enforcement officers voluntarily, to admit the evidence even though not all of the procedural requirements specified in <I>Miranda</I> had been met. This provision has been all but unused by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup>63</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given this situation, the detective obviously must be sensitive to the fine points of criminal procedure, since defense attorneys may be expected to seize upon the slightest error. Rigorous selection and training of detectives therefore must be among the most important personnel management priorities in any police department. Because uniformed patrolmen constitute the pool from which future detectives will be drawn, state and local officials must pay close attention to the entrance standards for police recruiting and staffing as well.<sup>64</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most common measurement of law enforcement success is the clearance rate. Technically, a "cleared" case is one in which a person has been arrested, charged with a crime, and turned over to prosecutors. Clearance rates for violent crimes known to the police have been declining for over two decades. In 1972, the clearance rate for reported violent criminal offenses was 48.8 percent. By 1993, it was 42.5 percent.<sup>65</sup>  In some of America's largest cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, according to 1994 FBI statistics, clearance rates for violent crime run as low as 20.7 to 38 percent.<sup>66</sup>  Over the past 30 years, the clearance rate for homicide nationwide has declined by 25 percent, and the ability of police to close cases of forcible rape has declined by 20 percent.<sup>67</sup>  Clearance rates for 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available, ranged from 64 percent in murder cases to 24 percent for robberies and as low as 13 percent for burglaries and 14 percent for motor vehicle thefts.<sup>68</sup>  Thus, a great many of the most serious crimes are never solved.
<p>

<b>Police and Community</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Walking "the beat" used to be the model for urban policing. Officers got to know the residents of the community, and the residents of the community got to know them. This made it relatively easy to maintain order and enhanced the ability of the police to fight crime. Direct or anonymous tips, a well-grounded experience with local troublemakers, a keen sense of the local powers present in the neighborhood, including the very worst influences, all gave police officers quick and often easy access to solid information that could serve as the basis for further questioning and the apprehension of criminals.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four decades, two developments changed the widespread use of this traditional model. The first was internal: a change in the style and philosophy of urban policing itself. Police officials determined that officers cruising urban or suburban areas in patrol cars would be in a better position to respond to calls for help or assistance. Aside from the speed and mobility of the well-equipped patrol car itself, the practice of using police cars in regular patrols created higher visibility over a larger geographical area. This, it was thought, would better deter crime and make the police, equipped with radios and other equipment, more effective in combatting it.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second development was external: the dramatic social and cultural changes within the communities themselves. The legal revolution in civil rights and the racial conflict and social tension of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of hostility to the police that persists in certain neighborhoods to this day. While urban police in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in large cities, were overwhelmingly white and came from working-class or middle-class backgrounds, they often were policing non-white neighborhoods. This presented new challenges. "The problems created by the exercise of the necessary discretion," as Professor James Q. Wilson has written, "are least in communities that have widely shared values as to what constitutes an appropriate level of order and what kind of person or form of behavior is an empirically sound predictor of criminal intention; the problems are greatest in cities deeply divided along lines of class and race."<sup>69</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, police officers have found themselves responding in different ways to different communities. Disorder in some neighborhoods may lead to little or no intervention by the police, while similar problems in other neighborhoods may cause an entirely different response.<sup>70</sup>  The unspoken assumption is that "Various neighborhoods and subcultures have their own levels of tolerable disorder; what may appear to be weaker norms are only different norms."<sup>71</sup>  Too often, laboring under real or imagined suspicions of racial bigotry, the police have simply given up trying to quell disorder in many minority communities, thus tacitly accepting the academically fashionable premises of cultural and moral relativism and its tragic consequences.<sup>72</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem is aggravated by conflicting ideological pressures, particularly among black liberals and leftists, over the appropriate response to crime and disorder in black communities. Paul Butler, a professor of law at George Washington University and former D.C. prosecutor, argues that black jurors should acquit non-violent black criminals, including drug dealers and burglars, even if they are clearly guilty, precisely because they are black and victims of a racist social order.<sup>73</sup>  At the same time, however, in reacting against laws against disorder used by the police in the past as "tools of subjugation" to harass black males, many black citizens in the District of Columbia now find themselves vulnerable to levels of disorder that are not tolerated in middle-class white suburbs.<sup>74</sup>  Says Professor John DiIulio: "You can't have it both ways -- protesting that police are less responsive to black crime victims than white ones in one breath, charging that too many black victimizers get caught, convicted and sentenced in the next; spinning out conspiratorial theories of white acquiescence in letting drugs flow into black communities in the morning, complaining that efforts to crack down on the drug trade are motivated by racism in the afternoon."<sup>75</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Popular reactions to the Rodney King episode and the O. J. Simpson trial highlight the deep racial divisions in Americans' attitudes toward the police. Blacks are more likely than whites to complain about the behavior of police. Surveys also indicate that 49 percent of blacks, but only 22 percent of whites, believe whites get better treatment before the courts and at the hands of police.<sup>76</sup>  Moreover, while 50 percent of whites believe that the police and the courts treat blacks and whites equally, only 29 percent of blacks believe this to be true.<sup>77</sup>  The data on police brutality,<sup>78</sup> however, indicate that such incidents have not been widespread in recent years. According to Robert E. Worden, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany, "The incidence of the use of improper force is rare in the sense that aircraft fatalities are rare; it is infrequent relative to the large volume of interaction between police and citizens, just as deaths in aircraft accidents are infrequent relative to the large number of passenger miles flown."<sup>79</sup>  When these incidents do occur, they are associated with a variety of factors and, at least historically, more often than not are aggravated by class rather than racial differences.<sup>80</sup>

<b>PROTECTING MINORITY COMMUNITIES</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many black leaders, both liberal and conservative, argue that the real problem is the absence of police in neighborhoods that are perceived by the officers as "dangerous."  The predominant fear is not of the police, but that the police will abandon the community to criminal predators, some of them mercenary agents of organized crime or drug cartels. "Why doesn't America keep the peace in inner cities?"  ask Glenn C. Loury, Professor of Economics at Boston University, and Shelby Steele, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. "Suppose there were several hundred gang-related murders every year in suburban Chicago or Washington or Los Angeles. Would there be a different public response?"<sup>81</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Young black males are far more likely to be victimized by violent crime than any other segment of America's population. A solid majority of blacks in one survey (57 percent) agreed that there were places in their areas "where they were afraid to walk alone at night."<sup>82</sup>  In a 1994 survey, more than 60 percent of blacks and whites agreed that government was spending "too little" on law enforcement.<sup>83</sup>  The misgivings of Loury and Steele echo the earlier complaints of the late Dr. Martin Luther King: "Permissive crime in ghettos is the nightmare of the slum family. Permissive crime is the name for the organized crime that flourishes in the ghetto -- designed, directed and cultivated by white national crime syndicates operating numbers, narcotics, and prostitution rackets freely in the protected sanctuaries of the ghettos."<sup>84</sup>  The color and ethnic composition of the predators may have changed, but for inner-city residents, the nightmare continues.
<p>

<b>LOWERING STANDARDS: THE HIGH PRICE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Minority group spokesmen claim, often with justification, that they are "underrepresented" in the staffing of police departments. Police officers must understand the local people and their culture and mores. Neighborhood perceptions of insensitivity or a lack of diversity among police personnel can have a negative impact on police-community relations.<sup>85</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To cope with these social realities, beginning in earnest in the late 1960s, state and local officials attempted to break down long-standing barriers to the hiring of minorities in metropolitan police forces. Federal laws and regulations, particularly those issued by the Nixon Administration, reinforced these efforts. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no person may be discriminated against or deprived of an opportunity for public service on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; the processes of recruitment, selection, training, and promotion are supposed to be "color-blind" so that all persons are given an equal opportunity. As a result of this combination of changing "social norms" and "the end of overt discrimination," blacks in particular made substantial gains: "Between 1970 and 1990, for example, the number of black police rose from 23,796 to 63,855; they constituted 41 percent of new hires."<sup>86</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the effort to increase diversity accelerated, liberal politicians and judges too often departed from the sound principle that individuals should never be rewarded or penalized on the basis of race or sex. To employ more minorities and women, police agencies frequently have adopted systems of quotas and preferences at the expense of quality, causing standards to be lowered and personnel decisions no longer to be based on selecting the most highly qualified candidates, especially in large metropolitan urban areas.<sup>87</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1966, for example, using federal funds under the Manpower Development Training Act, one of many liberal job training programs enacted during the 1960s, New York City officials planned to train 1,000 black and Puerto Rican youths to become policemen through a "Cadet Program."  Whatever the intended benefits of this program, it was a blow to the cause of professionalism within the NYPD, which had sought to attract new recruits who possessed college degrees, because it concentrated on enrolling "minority group drop-outs" to staff the city's police force.<sup>88</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Quotas are both logically incompatible with personnel management based on the principle of merit selection and a departure from the liberal tradition. In the words of the late Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most prominent champions of liberal views on the U.S. Supreme Court, "Minorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, not on cultural orientation or leanings."<sup>89</sup>  The irony is that "Cities as a whole suffer from bad police diversity policies, but it is crime ridden minority communities in them that suffer the most."<sup>90</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Various metropolitan governments have deliberately lowered standards for the recruitment and hiring of police officers in recent years. During the early 1990s, for example, the rush to racial and ethnic "diversity" on the New York City police force resulted in the hiring of officers with low test scores and inadequate background investigations. City officials examining police corruption, including officers compromised by notorious drug dealers, argued that the problem was the "institutional culture" of the department. But the lowering of standards clearly contributed to the problem: "True enough, most bad cops have been white, but a disproportionate number of cops indicted in New York have been minority officers hired in recent years to make the city's force more reflective of its demographics."<sup>91</sup>  In other major cities, whether because of "rush hiring" or quotas, the consequences, both in terms of public safety and in terms of public confidence in the hiring process, have been equally alarming.
<blockquote>
	<b>Washington D.C.:</b> Between 1989 and 1990, under congressional authorization, Washington hired 1,500 police officers. As part of this effort, city officials deliberately reduced hiring standards: "Critical background checks on applicants were cut short, and investigators scrimped on visits to neighborhoods and interviews with former employers. Physical examinations were hurried, and some people who failed to meet minimum requirements were hired anyway. The psychological services unit, which had rejected one in five applicants in other years, rejected just one in 20."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
	Since 1989, 201 D.C. police officers have been arrested (some more than once) by their colleagues on charges ranging from drug dealing and shoplifting to rape and murder. Reporters from <I>The Washington Post</I> learned that the department kept a list of 185 police officers with criminal problems so severe that prosecutors could not put them on the witness stand to testify in criminal cases. And a number of the new police officers that they did put on the stand made such poor witnesses that they often injured the prosecution's case. Because of just one narcotics detective who tested positive for cocaine, the U.S. attorney was forced to seek the release of 32 prisoners convicted on the officer's testimony and the dismissal of 88 cases in which the detective was the key witness for the prosecution.<sup>93</sup>  ABC News correspondent Robert Zelnick has noted that "The police department of the nation's Capital has a notorious record of seeing felony charges dismissed because of police incompetence in filling out arrest reports and related records."<sup>94</sup>
<p>
	A D.C. Metropolitan Police training director found that many recruits had tested so low in reading comprehension tests that they needed "remedial classes."  District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry put a stop to such classes because, said the director, he "feared the classes would reflect poorly on D.C. public schools from which many of the recruits had graduated."<sup>95</sup>  As summed up by Edwin J. Delattre, Professor of Education and Philosophy at Boston University, "The part that Congress and top elected officials in the city government have played in this debacle is a disgrace."
<p>
	<b>Miami, Florida:</b> In 1980, the city of Miami quickly hired 200 new policemen, with the specification that 80 percent were to be from the city's minority communities. Throughout the orientation and background investigation process, city officials were warned of the deficiencies of this class of future Miami police officers. The results proved disastrous. By 1988, more than a third of the class hired in 1980 were fired; 75 percent of Miami police officers accused of wrongdoing turned out to be members of this class; and 10 ended up pleading guilty to crimes as serious as murder and drug trafficking. "The frenzy of indiscriminate hiring, inadequate training, and poor supervision eroded personnel standards of the Miami Police Department until even illiteracy was no disqualification."<sup>96</sup>
<p>
	<b>Chicago, Illinois:</b> After promising to base police personnel decisions on merit, Mayor Richard J. Daley, Jr., recently reversed himself and determined that the city would use race as a consideration in promoting senior members of the police department. This would allow police officials to promote black and Hispanic candidates above white candidates who scored higher. In 1994, Mayor Daley authorized merit tests for police promotions, and the taxpayers of Chicago paid $5 million to have an outside company develop and administer these tests. Of the top 114 test scores, only 5 were achieved by minority candidates. Daley's decision has angered and demoralized members of the police force. "They told us it was all about merit," remarked William Nolan, President of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police. "Now we hear it's not about merit, but about politics and race. So, the police force doesn't believe him anymore."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
	<b>Boston, Massachusetts:</b> Bypassing merit testing for appointment to the police force, the city of Boston has entered into a court-ordered consent decree mandating "diversity" in the ranks. While 42 percent of the residents of Boston are members of minority groups, the police department is 26.4 percent minority. The purpose of the new judicially imposed policy is to reduce the racial imbalance and make up for past "exclusion" by elevating minorities over white candidates taking the police examinations. In 1990, nearly 75 percent of white candidates who took the test scored 90 or above, compared to 36 percent of minorities; 11.4 percent of the white candidates scored 98, 99, or 100, compared to 2.9 percent of minorities. Liberal critics claim the police test is inherently discriminatory, and therefore a poor indicator of how a policeman will perform on the job. According to James Kelly, President of the Boston City Council, however, "There were whites who scored 100 on the tests, but they are not Boston police officers for one reason: the color of their skin. What we have now is a quota system."<sup>98</sup>

Poor personnel management has created serious problems in other major metropolitan areas as well. For example, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department has been ripped by devastating charges of police corruption, and numerous convictions, including convictions in major drug cases, have been overturned because of falsified police reports, illegal tactics, and perjury on the part of police officers.<sup>99</sup>  In New Orleans, Louisiana, 50 police officers have been arrested, indicted, or convicted on criminal charges ranging from murder to drug-trafficking since 1993.<sup>100</sup>  In Baltimore, Maryland, the failure to retain experienced detectives with top-level investigative skills is compromising the quality of police investigations and hampering the efforts of prosecutors. "In court, it is a loss of an experienced detective who can explain to a jury how you go through an investigation," observes U.S. Attorney Katherine J. Armentout. "They have credibility with a jury that is just invaluable."<sup>101</sup>

<b>THE CLINTON "COPS" PROGRAM</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the enactment of the $30 billion Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, President Clinton promised to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets to fight violent crime. Among its many provisions, the 1994 law sets aside $8.8 billion in funding for the hiring of police officers over a six-year period. Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, administered by a new office within the Department of Justice, gives funds to local jurisdictions, including smaller towns and larger urban areas, for "community policing" strategies.<sup>102</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under this, grants fund local police personnel for three years, and the federal contribution is set at 75 percent of the combined salary and benefits of each officer, up to $75,000 over a three-year period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, average starting salaries for entry level police officers today range from $18,710 to $26,560, with "average operating expenditures" for each officer ranging from $31,500 to $63,400 per annum.<sup>103</sup>  In 1995, 8,000 of the nation's approximately 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions applied for the new federal funding; 92 percent of those which applied were approved.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been some confusion over the exact number of police officers hired thus far under the Clinton plan. While the 100,000 figure is used routinely in the media, Attorney General Janet Reno recently cited a far smaller number of police on the streets as a result of the new grant program: 17,000.<sup>104</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's promise of 100,000 additional police is popular with local officials who can afford the matching contribution. But even if the promise were fulfilled, "the nation would go from having one officer on patrol at any given time for every 6,250 Americans (1.6 per 10,000) to one officer for every 5,208 Americans (1.9 per 10,000).... This 20 percent increase does not seem likely to make much difference in crime, at least under conventional theories of high visibility and rapid response time. Nor is it likely to produce the substantially higher arrest rates that some advocates argue will reduce crime."<sup>105</sup>  In addition, reported crime has been declining since 1992,<sup>106</sup> well before passage of the 1994 crime bill and well before the first cohort of newly funded officers hit the streets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The available evidence clearly indicates that the Clinton program is poorly targeted to reduce violent crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a random sample of applicants conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office, for example, 84 percent of the jurisdictions cited "property" crimes as among their "top five ranked public safety issues," followed by domestic violence (78.3 percent); alcohol-related crimes, including drunken driving (63.3 percent); drug crimes (60.9 percent); and vandalism (51.2 percent). "Violent crimes against persons" ranked only sixth (50.7 percent).<sup>107</sup>  Other "top five public safety issues" included traffic violations (3.7 percent), disorderly conduct (19.8 percent), and gangs (19.3 percent). Overall, the GAO "found no relationship between crime rates and whether an applicant jurisdiction was awarded the grant."<sup>108</sup>

Based on an extrapolation from the GAO data, the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee found that grant funding was not going to those cities and communities hardest hit by violent crime. In Oregon, for example, Portland accounts for 56 percent of all violent crimes but received less than one percent of the state's COPS funding.<sup>110</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many local jurisdictions simply cannot afford the Clinton plan, which requires them to assume a greater portion of the cost each year of the three-year grant period. According to the GAO, almost 7,000 local jurisdictions did not apply for grants, and over 600 turned down the opportunity to participate. Based on a review of jurisdictions that did not apply, the GAO found that in 62 percent of the cases, the reason was their inability to meet the program's financial requirements.<sup>111</sup>  Other reasons included local management decisions and excessive regulatory and paperwork requirements.<sup>112</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead of reinforcing merit selection, the Clinton plan encourages quotas. Upon withdrawing from participation in the COPS program, Oklahoma City Police Chief Sam Gonzales observed that the Justice Department's language on the hiring of women and minorities is "very significant" because "it states 'equal employment' of women and minorities rather than 'equal employment opportunity.'"  <sup>113</sup> The program is also inflexible: "There's nothing wrong with community policing, and many cities would be glad to spend federal dollars to implement it. But others, including some large cities, already have instituted community policing and need computers instead."<sup>114</sup>

<b>BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE LOCAL POLICE FORCE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The federal government cannot improve local police personnel management. That is a job for state and local officials and, given the demands of public safety, is one of their most important responsibilities. They must, therefore, understand the realities of police work and the kinds of standards that should be applied both in recruiting new police officers and in evaluating police performance. They cannot safely indulge racial quotas or accommodate liberal political attacks on merit principles of personnel management.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials also must pay police officers for the job they do; they cannot expect to have a first-rate police department with bargain-basement pay scales or lowered mental and physical standards. The federal government cannot make police officers effective in their communities simply by throwing more money at the problem. At the same time, however, imaginative local officials have demonstrated some dramatic successes.
<blockquote>
	<b>New York City:</b> Taking over a demoralized 38,000-member department in 1994, William J. Bratton declared an all-out war on crime and disorder to reclaim neighborhoods literally block by block. Commissioner Bratton started decentralizing authority, tracked crime trends through a computerized system, and held commanders directly accountable for decreasing crime and disorder in their precincts. He also dismissed high-level police officials who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new program.<sup>115</sup>  The result: In 1994, major felonies fell by 2 percent nationwide; in New York City, they dropped by 12 percent in 1994 and fell by another 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995.<sup>116</sup>  This dramatic reduction in major felonies over three years also included an almost 45 percent drop in the murder rate.
<p>
	<b>Houston, Texas:</b> In a remarkable experiment in community policing, Houston Police Chief Sam Nuchia started an innovative "citizens patrol program" to supplement the work of the city's police force. The result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal activities to the police, arrests have increased, and police productivity has improved.<sup>117</sup>
<p>
	<b>Oxnard, California:</b> Using a sophisticated crime analysis and advanced gang-tracking computer data base developed by a team of experts during the Reagan Administration, police have been able to issue crime alerts to residents in high-crime areas and to target juvenile offenders effectively. The result: violent crime has fallen by 38 percent to its lowest level since the 1960s.<sup>118</sup>  Similar computerized identification and tracking techniques are being used in 130 other jurisdictions.
<p>
	<b>Charleston, South Carolina:</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, widely known for innovative police management, concentrated his efforts on combatting the high level of crime and disorder in the city's public housing projects. Working directly with public housing tenants, Greenberg and his officers helped them screen prospective tenants for criminal records;, tenants engaged in illegal behavior, including drug trafficking, were evicted. The result: Charleston's public housing projects were transformed from one of the most dangerous places in Charleston to one of the "safest."<sup>119</sup>

<b>THE NEED FOR LOCAL LEADERSHIP</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the final analysis, the principal problems facing the police today are personnel management and how best to utilize the limited resources available to maintain order and enforce the law. To address these problems, state and local officials should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Get serious about personnel standards.</b> The police officer's job is unique; there is nothing comparable to it in the private sector. Many experts like former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy therefore favor a four-year college degree, or at least a higher education requirement, as an ideal standard.<sup>120</sup>  Other experts do not see a college or university degree as a necessary condition of appointment, and argue that for persons with demonstrated maturity and diverse life experiences, a high school degree or equivalent may suffice.<sup>121</sup>
<p>
No matter what educational standards they adopt, responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical requirements, measured in physical strength and stamina, are also essential. Most important, background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, their current and past associations, and their financial and marital stability, as well as any evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse.<sup>122</sup>  Periodic re-investigations of personnel, particularly those assigned to specialized tasks such as drug enforcement, also are desirable. Continuing vigilance concerning the character and integrity of the police force is the best defense against the perennial threat of corruption.

<p><li><b>Improve the image of the police.</b> The image of the police officer on the street means a lot: "Cops deserve smart looking uniforms -- and should wear them smartly -- because they represent both the city and the profession."<sup>123</sup>  A police officer's personal appearance and demeanor can help instill respect and confidence among members of the community by creating an image of competence and strength. This is what taxpayers want in their police officers, and it is what they deserve.

<P><li><b>Draw recruits from every sector of the community.</b> Because the mission of the police is of vital concern to every citizen, the police department should represent the community and reflect its demographic composition. Such broader representation is particularly important in minority neighborhoods so that officers can understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit critical information vital to effective law enforcement. Local officials have a genuine public interest in making their police officers role models and champions of the local community.
<p>
This means that they should cast a wide net and recruit aggressively from every sector of the community. But they should not be deceived by the false god of "diversity at all costs" or by the politically correct premise that simple numerical "underrepresentation" is proof of racial or ethnic discrimination. Nor should they adopt race-based deployment, with only white cops in "white communities" and only black cops in "black communities."<sup>124</sup>  And in no case should personnel management policy make a mockery of merit selection or promotion: "When individual performance is undervalued, professional standards are bound to decline."<sup>125</sup>  Finally, while officials should draw police recruits from the minority community, they should not make membership in the community a condition of appointment: "It is easier to teach police about an area and its residents than to make good police from unqualified applicants."<sup>126</sup>

<p><li><b>Draw recruits from the military.</b> The United States Army recruitment motto "Be all that you can be" applies with equal force to the police. While military and police functions are fundamentally different, and good police work is often the product of an entrepreneurial spirit, military personnel have served in a disciplined organization and are trained in many skills that are useful in police work, including the use of firearms. Veterans preference in recruitment and hiring is being used in many departments, but officials should go further and actively recruit candidates from the military, a talent pool distinguished by high standards of performance. Moreover, for officials wishing to increase the number of minorities serving on the police force, they should realize that blacks make up 11.5 percent of America's civilian population between the ages of 18 and 44 but represent almost 30 percent of the American military, including a large number of senior officers, particularly in the Army: "The military is not free of racial problems found in the civilian world, but it has been more insulated from them because it is a closed and hierarchical society where rank is more important than race or gender."<sup>127</sup>

<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> The most effective police officer is not an outsider, but an insider; and the best way to establish effective "community policing" is for local residents to know the police and the police to know the local residents. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible; the more people the police officer knows, the more effective he will be not only in maintaining order and enforcing community standards, but also in obtaining the sort of solid information that is essential in controlling crime.
<p>
A police officer must get to know the community and its residents and be ready to share information with other officers patrolling the area. If the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors. In order to integrate police officers into the community, local officials should consider low-cost housing loans or housing vouchers to enable officers to move into the neighborhoods where they are needed. "The residency requirement is not very effective right now," says Hubert Williams, President of the Police Foundation. "We simply need another approach and police homeownership in high risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<sup>128</sup>

<p><li><b>Modernize police management.</b> Too often, police management practices are outdated and do not work.<sup>129</sup>  Bureaucratic civil service rules and regulations and outdated labor/management models impede managerial flexibility and undercut accountability and performance. For example, officers appointed to the detective division should serve on a probationary basis to demonstrate their skills and commitment, just as physicians serve internships. Too often, also, there is little lateral entry into managerial ranks from outside the force. The police force is one of the few organizational cultures in which promotion is almost exclusively through the ranks. Success in the ranks, however, usually depends on responding to incidents, not on strategic planning.<sup>130</sup>  Strategic use of resources, which includes analyzing crime and devising of long-term and short-term solutions, requires an effective planning and research capability to support police management. But less than 1 percent of police budgets are dedicated to research,<sup>131</sup> and planning often is not coordinated effectively with operations leadership.
<p>
Sound personnel management is based on clarity of mission, direct accountability of line management and staff to see that goals are met, and reward for performance. While police work is hardly comparable to anything in the private sector, "Police executives must continually review private sector approaches to managing, developing and supporting people, and transport ideas into the public sector where applicable."<sup>132</sup>
<p>
Commissioner Bratton's success in New York City is partially attributable to the clarity of his goals: "`I don't want a 2 or 3 percent reduction in crime this year -- I want 15 to 25 percent.'  And he got it."<sup>133</sup>  He also devolved authority downward to police commanders in the field, holding them directly accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions and carefully measuring their success and the success of the officers working under their command: "We gave these first line managers the authority to run their precincts as miniature police departments without a lot of petty interference from headquarters. The best ones rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity."  <sup>134</sup> Commanders must know their precincts, take personal responsibility for conditions there, and respond quickly and effectively to the needs of the community: "As many private sector organizations have discovered, the further from the point of service delivery, the harder it is to make good decisions without good information."<sup>135</sup> 
<p>
<p><li><b>Use sound personnel management to combat police corruption.</b> Conventional wisdom holds that if an officer stays too long on one beat, he may become subject to corruption, particularly by organized crime syndicates. Police corruption can be met in two ways: through serious background investigations, particularly investigations into moral character, and through sound management practices that make commanders directly accountable for the integrity, as well as the performance, of their people. Everyone in the department, from the top executives down through the ranks, must accept responsibility for the integrity of the force: "Few actions erode the confidence of the public or of the police in their own department as much as the indifference of command officers to misconduct by their personnel."<sup>136</sup>  In New York City Commissioner Bratton adopted a highly public strategy of going out and personally arresting corrupt policemen, disgracing them by taking their badges from them for violating their oaths.
<p>
If commanders have to answer for a breakdown in the system's integrity, they also are more likely to ensure both the periodic background investigation of personnel assigned to sensitive details, such as narcotics or organized crime investigations where the temptations of corruption are higher, and the periodic rotation of personnel in such assignments. Police officials, in effect, should impose "term limits" on assignments to such highly sensitive investigative squads.

<p><li><b>Target hot spots.</b> Modern techniques for tracking crime give police officials an opportunity to anticipate and intervene quickly and effectively in high crime areas: "By plotting each homicide incident and using sophisticated mapping and statistical clustering procedures, the early warning system allows police to identify potential neighborhood crisis areas at high risk for suffering a spurt of gang violence. With rapid dissemination of information, police can intervene in hot spots to quell emerging trouble."<sup>137</sup>  Such intervention also can serve to disrupt the trade in illegal narcotics. "The key to making crackdowns work is to keep them short and unpredictable," advises Professor Lawrence Sherman. "Long-term police crackdowns all show a 'decay' in their deterrent effects over time. Short term crackdowns, in contrast, show a free bonus of residual deterrence after the crackdown stops, while potential offenders slowly figure out that the cops are gone."<sup>138</sup>  In Minneapolis, a controlled experiment in "hot spots" interventions in 1988 and 1989 resulted in a 50 percent decline in disorder, including neighborhood fights and other disturbances.<sup>139</sup>

<p><li><b>Target the criminal class and their guns.</b> The population engaged in the most serious crime is relatively small, composed generally of serious habitual offenders, often on probation and parole. They should be a routine target of the police. State lawmakers, for example, can enact laws which make all persons on probation and parole subject to "non-consensual" search for guns or other weapons as a condition of probation or parole.<sup>140</sup>  Stopping and frisking such persons, especially in hot spot areas, is an innovative way to combat gun violence.<sup>141</sup>  Local police officials also can create specialized units that "combine surveillance and sting strategies to catch the offender in the act of crime. The resulting evidence is stronger than arrests made after the fact, thus increasing the odds of the offender being imprisoned."<sup>142</sup>  Finally, as Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum has suggested, state officials should appoint police chiefs to parole and probation panels, giving them a direct role in the official decision to put prisoners back on the streets.

<p><li><b>Civilianize and privatize administrative and support functions.</b> Too many police officers are tied up with administrative, logistical, and other support duties. Officials should review positions held by police personnel to determine whether the job requires a sworn officer. Where possible, civilians should carry out ancillary administrative functions. Santa Clara, California, for example, established a system of community service officers -- personnel who are not armed and who can conduct traffic accident assistance and investigations, file reports, and serve in school crossing and traffic positions. Community service personnel also can serve as a good pool for recruitment into the regular police ranks.
<p>
Local officials also should consider the privatization of ancillary police services. Most police departments, for example, have a large fleet of automobiles that must be maintained; keeping police cruisers in top condition need not require police personnel, but could be contracted out to private bidders. Privatization is a healthy and growing challenge to police management generally: "Venture capitalists are now exploring the concept of policing corporations which provide policing services to contract cities."<sup>143</sup>

<p><li><b>Reduce the caseloads of detectives.</b> In many urban areas, the caseload for detectives is too high. This problem could be eased by training patrol officers to conduct the early stages of investigations, including the interrogations of witnesses and suspects at or near crime scenes. In order to gain the confidence of detectives on the force, experienced or retired detectives could be used for such training. In the investigation of certain crimes, specially trained officers easily can take over interviewing responsibilities normally reserved for detectives, especially in sensitive areas such as rape or child molestation.<sup>144</sup> 
<p>
Careful interviewing and questioning of informants, witnesses, and suspects is the key to resolving difficult cases. Officials therefore should thoroughly debrief retiring detectives before they leave the force to gather as much information as possible about their investigative techniques, experiences, and other tricks of the trade. Retiring detectives also should transmit to police intelligence units, consistent with respect for confidentiality and the sensitivity of the information, the names of good informants, contacts in the underworld, or other crucial sources of information.

<p><li><b>Improve police compensation.</b> "Bargain basement cops" invariably turn out to be expensive, especially in terms of morale and lost public confidence. Policing must be a desirable middle-class occupation. This means regularly reviewing police pay to make sure that it attracts the best candidates to the force. Officials also should consider pay for performance, at least for police managers,<sup>145</sup> as well as bonuses for officers assigned to dangerous or sensitive investigations. Monies secured from "drug busts," for example, could be used not only for drug rehabilitation and treatment, but also for bonuses for police officers temporarily assigned to narcotics investigations, undercover work, or other dangerous assignments. Nor should local officials neglect other forms of compensation: "Educational incentives, patrol bonuses, watch differentials and alternative work schedules are methods to improve the quality of service delivered and the job satisfaction of line personnel."<sup>146</sup> 

<p><li><b>Use advanced technology.</b> Modern, time-saving equipment can magnify the effectiveness of well-trained police officers. The concept of "working smarter, not harder" is particularly appropriate to police work and can free up the officer's time to maintain the neighborhood contacts vital to community policing. Lap-top computers can speed up the process of report writing and improve the legibility of field reports, making it unnecessary to write out the same information numerous times in order to complete the crime reports, arrest reports, property reports, witness lists, and other paperwork needed to record police incidents.
<p>
Some departments are using innovative electronic information systems to streamline the process of reporting and analysis. In St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, the police are experimenting with electronic docking mechanisms in patrol cars which would allow officers to use computers to receive and transmit information through the police radio system. This would allow all crime incident record keeping processes -- from the original taking of a telephone complaint, through the patrol officer's response and preliminary investigation, to the follow-up investigation by detectives -- to be automated. The resulting improvements in productivity, timeliness, and accuracy would provide multiple benefits both for the police department itself and for the citizens who rely on its services.
<p>
Other advanced electronic devices, such as cellular telephones and facsimile transmission equipment, can enhance patrol officers' ability to communicate while minimizing their time away from the neighborhoods they serve. Automated fingerprint identification systems greatly improve criminal investigations and the apprehension of suspects. Closed-circuit television has many uses, from "line ups" identification to traffic surveillance and physical location security. Advanced simulation technology and computer-generated audio-visual equipment can provide "virtual reality" in police training and increase the accuracy of officer evaluations.
<p>
Even though many municipalities may find it difficult to provide funding for the major capital expenditures necessary to obtain such equipment, they should make a special effort in this direction as a way to improve public safety. Special law enforcement bond issues, private sector contributions, or other innovative means of financing could be used. Likewise, if Congress wants to provide federal funds to local law enforcement, it would be far wiser to make those funds available for capital expenditures on technological improvements which provide long-term value<sup>147</sup> instead of simply paying part of the costs of local police operating expenses, which offer only temporary and limited benefits.
</ol><p><b>
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

State and local officials bear the primary responsibility for combatting most crime, especially street crime. Nevertheless, both Congress and the executive branch can play a supporting role. Among the 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States, the challenges to law enforcement are as different as the communities they serve. Therefore, any federal assistance should ensure maximum flexibility for state and local officials in fighting crime in their communities. Specifically, Congress should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety.</b> The United States Senate has the constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent to the appointment of federal judicial nominees. A number of liberal judges appointed to the bench have issued creative rulings to advance the rights of criminal suspects, even to the point of embarrassing the Presidents who appointed them. The Senate should scrutinize judicial candidates more carefully, rely more heavily on the formal advice and testimony of police representatives in the confirmation process, and block the appointment of nominees with records of insensitivity to public safety.

<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those which impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: "Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo."<sup>148</sup>  The Clinton Administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more federal crimes, duplicating offenses already illegal under state and local statutes. Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- a process that has been promoted by representatives of both political parties.

<p><li><b>Reform the exclusionary rule.</b> A "good faith" exception to the exclusionary rule would enable prosecutors to introduce incriminating evidence at trial which has been gathered in good faith but otherwise would be ruled inadmissible because of technical violations of procedure by police officers. A process also should be established to discipline officers who abuse proper procedure. As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of the police. This problem is aggravated by tortured interpretations of the law by liberal judges: "If an officer stops a car without adequate reason and finds the butt of a marijuana cigarette on the floor," for example, "there is little public concern when the offense goes unpunished. But if the officer finds a gun that proves the driver committed a murder, the suppression of the gun may set a killer free and outrage the public. The officer's conduct in both cases is the same, but the consequences to the public vary drastically."<sup>149</sup>  A congressionally enacted good faith exception to the exclusionary rule for federal jurisdictions also could encourage state legislatures to enact similar statutes affecting local jurisdictions.

<p><li><b>Review the impact of the Miranda ruling.</b> For three decades, police officers have been operating under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> requiring officers to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney. Statements made by suspects can be excluded as evidence if the technical rules are not followed precisely. Congress should revisit this ruling to determine its impact on the ability of prosecutors to achieve justice in criminal cases. Professor Paul G. Cassell of the University of Utah College of Law, for example, argues that <I>Miranda</I>, at least as currently enforced, is responsible for thousands of lost criminal cases.<sup>150</sup>  Congress should conduct hearings and enact remedies for any deficiencies in the application of <I>Miranda</I> rules, including an alternative to the exclusion of valid probative evidence.

<p><li><b>Make federal funding of local law enforcement user friendly.</b> Neither federal programs nor increases in federal anti-crime spending have had much impact in reducing violent crime at the local level, and early indications are that President Clinton's multibillion dollar COPS program will follow this pattern. If Congress wants to help state and local officials, it should break away from outdated and ineffective patterns of federal spending.
<p>
Under an innovative proposal by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), for example, 2 percent of the federal personal income tax taken from the residents of each state would be returned to the state to fight crime. These tax rebates would be free of the federal intrusions that accompany categorical grants and would allow state officials to use the money for their specific needs, such as police staffing and equipment, community policing, crime prevention, or prison programs. These rebates would amount to $55 billion over a five-year period, a steady stream of funding both more flexible and more generous than that contained in the Clinton Administration's crime bill.<sup>151</sup>  The tax rebate strategy also has the advantage of creating strong incentives for local officials to spend the money wisely, targeting what is necessary rather than what is merely desirable. The reason: Under the Sensenbrenner proposal, state officials also would have the option of giving money back to the taxpayers directly in the form of tax cuts. 

<p><li><b>Review D.C. police pay and personnel management practices.</b> Since Congress in the late 1980s and early 1990s contributed directly to the problems of the police in the nation's capital, it should work cooperatively with local officials to make the D.C. police force the national model it once was. This includes reviewing pay and personnel management practices, particularly the recruiting and hiring of police officers. Washington Police Chief Larry Soulsby already has embarked on a comprehensive retraining program for 2,700 officers, nearly 75 percent of the force. This retraining covers everything from ethics and criminal procedures to street tactics and the preparation of police reports, a critical subject since "Unclear or misleading statements in those documents can jeopardize prosecution of criminal cases."<sup>152</sup>

<p><li><b>Pursue an innovative empowerment strategy to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods plagued by crime and disorder.</b> Over the past 40 years, Congress has enacted numerous social programs aimed at crime "prevention," including federal programs for "at risk" and delinquent youth. The General Accounting Office recently identified 131 such overlapping federal programs for "at risk" youth alone, administered by 16 federal agencies at an annual cost of over $4 billion.<sup>153</sup>
<p>
Innovative community policing strategies should be combined with imaginative new social policies. Representatives James Talent (R-MO) and J. C. Watts (R-OK), for example, are sponsoring Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467). This comprehensive initiative would establish a new federal policy to empower parents and neighborhood organizations, such as black churches and other religious institutions, to educate children trapped in poorly performing inner-city schools, in addition to encouraging faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation and other private social service programs that work.<sup>154</sup>  Dr. Richard Freeman of Harvard University has found that black inner-city youth who have religious values are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values.<sup>155</sup>
<p>
One final recommendation applies specifically to the executive branch: 
<p><li><b>Improve the sharing of information with state and local officials.</b> In carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to combat interstate and international crime, as well as to control United States borders, federal law enforcement agencies should maximize their coordination and cooperation with state and local police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in particular can provide valuable technical assistance and training, specialized support in the fields of identification and scientific investigation, and central facilities for the collection and dissemination of statistical data, criminal intelligence, and other relevant information on a national basis.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No American family is safe from the threat of crime. In some inner-city neighborhoods, the situation is positively desperate. And with the rising tide of violent juvenile crime, millions of Americans will be locked behind their doors, imprisoned in their own homes in deteriorating neighborhoods. In far too many urban areas, law-abiding citizens cannot go to the store, take a stroll in the park, or even visit friends and relatives without fear of violent assault. These people need the best police protection they can get. It is the job of state and local officials to give it to them.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To do this, they must get serious about the mission of the police and expand their use of the kinds of personnel management principles that can attract and hold first-rate police officers. This includes setting and maintaining high standards for appointment; drawing from every sector of the community; drawing from the military, particularly to broaden minority representation; aggressively targeting both hot spots and the criminal class; anchoring police officers in the community; modernizing police management and privatizing and civilianizing support functions wherever possible; and improving police compensation.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can play a supportive role in this drama, but not a definitive one. This means repealing federal laws which impede the ability of local police to enforce the law. Specifically, Congress should reformulate the exclusionary rule to allow the inclusion of evidence gathered in good faith by police officers; review the impact of <I>Miranda</I> on police criminal investigations; stop the appointment of lenient federal judges; and change the funding formulas for federal financial assistance to the states, replacing the current grant-in-aid system with a more generous tax rebate that allows state and local officials maximum flexibility to combat violent crime.

   <p><li> Under the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act, Congress has restricted federal judicial control over state prison systems. The new law limits court-ordered relief in suits challenging prison conditions; only specific violations of an inmate's constitutional rights now qualify for relief. Furthermore, the court must consider whether its remedy would harm public safety. The new law also restricts court-ordered prison population caps by requiring a court finding that overcrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights.

In the evaluation of social programs, especially those conducted by the General Accounting Office, Congress should order the study of success, not just the many federal programs that don't work.
<p><li>    The problem is long-standing: "The police feel that they deserve respect from the public. But the upper class looks down on them; the middle class seems to ignore them, as if they were part of the urban scenery; the lower class fears them." Arthur Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield: The Police in Urban Society</I> (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Company, 1967), p. 9. The literature on the police and public policy is rich and growing. While chronologically dated, Niederhoff's work and James Q. Wilson's <I>Varieties of Police Behavior: The Management of Law and Order in Eight Communities</I> (New York, N.Y.: Atheneum Press, 1970) are foundational. See also J. S. Skolnick, <I>Justice Without Trial: Law Enforcement in a Democratic Society</I> (New York, N.Y.: John Wiley and Sons, 1966).
  <p><li>  Fully 91 percent of New York City police officers responding to a recent survey felt that the public has little understanding of police problems. Kelling, "How to Run a Police Department," p. 37.
   <p><li> "The patroleman is neither a bureaucrat nor a professional, but a member of a craft. As with most crafts, his has no body of generalized written knowledge nor a set of detailed prescriptions as to how to behave. It has in short, neither theory nor rules. Learning the craft is by apprenticeship, but on the job and not in the academy." Wilson, <I>Varieties of Police Behavior</I>, p. 283.

Culturally, these standards appear light-years away from personal behavior that would be ignored or even approved today.

   <p><li> Commenting on the professional culture of the famed New York City detective division in the 1950s and 1960s, Arthur Niederhoff, a former New York City policeman, observes that "Detectives are the upper class of police society and haughtily guard their special status and privileges. Their quarters are separate from those of the uniformed police. Within this private domain democratic camaraderie eliminates the social distance that ordinarily divides the various ranks of a bureaucratic hierarchy.... It is of special significance that this high status unit, to which every member of the lower echelon aspires, performs best when disregarding formal regulations and official procedures." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, pp. 83-85.
 <p><li>   The Supreme Court qualified its <i>Miranda </i>ruling in <I>Harris v. New York</I> (1971), ruling that if an accused person makes statements on the witness stand that differ from statements made to the police, the prosecution can introduce the earlier statements into the record for purposes of discrediting the testimony of the accused.
<p><li>    See Paul Cassell, <I>Reforming Miranda: A Proposal for Congressional Action,</I> College of Law, University of Utah, 1994.
 <p><li>   "A good detective must be suspicious; he needs the intuitive ability to sense plots and conspiracies on the basis of embryonic evidence," says Niederhoff, but the qualifications are hard to establish: "A strong minority on the [New York] police force asserts... that a detective's value and future success depends on the private sources of information at his disposal, and his willingness to do the necessary legwork. They support this opinion by citing the many brilliant detectives in police history who could never have passed an IQ test, could hardly write an intelligible report, and whose techniques of investigation violated every recommended principle of scientific detection."

  <p><li>  "Incidents that would cause commotion and consternation in quiet precincts seem so common in ghetto neighborhoods that they are often not reported. The police rationalize this avoidance of duty with theories that the victim would refuse to prosecute because violence has become the accepted way of life for his community, and that any other course would result in a great loss of time in court, which would reduce the efficiency of other police functions."

  <p><li>  "This doctrine encourages an observer from one culture to respect the integrity of another, although its standards of behavior may be different from his own. The implication is that the policeman has some justification for accepting a minority group's way of life on its own terms, and thus for acting the way he does. There is no easy answer to this paradox." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, p. 66.
  <p><li>  Professor Butler's basic argument is that since the United States is "structurally" racist, blacks are victimized by the American system, and black jurors have, therefore, no obligation to up hold its system of justice, at least as applied to blacks who commit non-violent crimes.

<p><li>     Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum, for example, argues that 21- or 22-year-old college graduates may test well and have outstanding academic records, but they frequently have little or no exposure to life outside a college setting. Having been dependent on parental authority and institutional settings throughout their late teens and early twenties, such persons would be struggling as police officers, not only in using discretion on the street, but also in trying to live on their own. Interview with Craig Fraser, November 17, 1994.
  <p><li>   For local officials, this policy recommendation may turn out to be much more than a good idea. The United States Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case (<I>Bryan County v.

<P>
Dear Ms. Persons: <br>
 
<p>As an experienced economist who is currently pursuing a master's degree in Economics at Harvard University, I am writing to request information about possible summer internship opportunities with The Heritage Foundation.  I am interested in a position that will allow me to combine the talents I have developed in both political analysis and economics.  However, as you can see from the attached <a href="file:///J|/COMMON/INTERNS/NICKG/resume.htm">resume</a>, I have extensive experience in many related fields, and I always enjoy new challenges. 
 
<p>I feel that it is important for me to maintain a practical, real-world perspective while developing my academic abilities. I am proud of the fact that I have financed my entire education through scholarships and summer jobs related to my field of study.  This work experience has enhanced my appreciation for the education I am pursuing.  I find that I learn as much from my summer jobs as I do from my academic studies.  For example, during the summer of 1995, while working for the National Center for Policy Analysis, I gained a great deal of practical experience in the field of public policy development and critique.  When I returned to school in the fall and took Advanced Policy Analysis, I found that my experience with the NCPA had thoroughly prepared me for the subject. 
 
<p>Having said all this, I realize that your first consideration in hiring an applicant must not be the potential educational experience Heritage can provide, but the skills and services the applicant has to offer.  I hope the experience and education described in my resume suggest how I might be of service to Heritage. 
 
<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how I might best assist Heritage in fulfilling its present corporate needs.  I will be available for employment from May 14 through August 31, 1996.  Please let me know what summer internship opportunities are available at Heritage for someone with my education, experience, and interests.  You can reach me at the above address or by phone at (518) 555-0000.
<P>
Thank you for your consideration.

<title>Elderly Non-Citizens on Welfare Cost Taxpayers $328 Billion -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>ELDERLY NON-CITIZENS ON WELFARE WILL COST THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER $328 BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE</i></h3>

The United States welfare system is rapidly becoming a deluxe retirement home for the elderly of other countries. This is because many individuals are now immigrating to the United States in order to obtain generous welfare that far exceeds programs available in their country of origin. Non-citizens today are among the fastest growing groups of welfare dependents.
<p>
In 1994, there were nearly 738,000 lawful non-citizen residents receiving aid from the Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) program. This was up from 127,900 in 1982 -- a 580 percent increase in just 12 years. The overwhelming majority of non-citizen SSI recipients are elderly. Most apply for welfare within five years of arriving in the United States. 
<p>
The data show that welfare is becoming a way of life for elderly immigrants. An analysis of elderly immigrants in California by Professor Norman Matloff of the University of California at Davis shows that 45 percent received cash welfare in 1990. Among Russian immigrants, the figure is 66 percent; among Chinese, 55 percent. Worse, the trend is accelerating. Recent immigrants are far more likely to become welfare dependents than those who arrived in the United States in earlier decades.<sup>1</sup>
<P>
<i>If current trends continue, the U. S. will have more than three million non-citizens on SSI within ten years. Without reform, the total cost of SSI and Medicaid benefits for elderly non-citizen immigrants will amount to over $328 billion over the next ten years. Annual SSI and Medicaid benefits for these individuals will reach over $67 billion in 2004.</i>
<p>
Even with the implausible assumption that the current rapid increase of non-citizen recipients will halt and the number of elderly immigrants receiving benefits will remain at current levels, U.S. taxpayers would still pay over $127 billion over the next ten years for SSI and Medicaid benefits for resident aliens.
<p>
Immigration should be open to individuals who wish to come to the United States to work and be self-sufficient. America has opened its doors to those who seek opportunity. But immigration should not become an avenue to welfare dependence.
<p>
Congressional testimony by Dr. Matloff demonstrates that immigrants have a high degree of awareness of welfare policies and procedures. Besides word of mouth among immigrants, sources in foreign countries as well as the United States give advice on how to obtain welfare benefits. For example, <i>Zai Meiguo Sheng Huo Xu Zhi</i> (What You Need to Know About Life in America), a publication sold in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and in Chinese bookstores in the U. S., includes a 36-page guide to SSI and other welfare benefits. The largest-circulation Chinese-language newspaper in the U. S., <i>Shijie Ribao</i> (World Journal), runs a regular "Dear Abby"-style advice column on SSI and other immigration-related matters.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
Prudent restrictions on providing welfare to recent immigrants long has been part of the American tradition. Becoming a charge was grounds for deportation in the Massachusetts Bay colony even before the American Revolution. America's first immigration law, passed by Congress in 1882, instructed immigration officials to deport any person who, in their opinion, might become a public charge. Today, the Immigration and Nationality Act declares unequivocally:  "any alien who, within five years after the date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry is deportable."  The problem is that this provision of the law is ignored.
<p>
The presence of large numbers of elderly immigrants on welfare is a violation of the spirit, and arguably the letter, of U.S. immigration law. The relatives who sponsored the entry of these individuals into the U.S. implicitly promised that the new immigrants would not become a burden to the U.S. taxpayer. But many, if not most, sponsors are enrolling their elderly immigrant relatives on welfare soon after the end of the three-year waiting period. Once on SSI, there is every indication that these immigrants will remain on welfare indefinitely. 
<p>
Although many of the elderly non-citizens on SSI come from politically oppressive nations such as Cuba or the former Soviet Union, the majority do not. The single greatest number of aliens on SSI come from Mexico. Other nations, such as the Dominican Republic, India, South Korea, and the Philippines, also contribute large numbers of recipients.
<p>
Moreover, while Americans greatly sympathize with those individuals who have suffered from political oppression and economic failure inherent to communist regimes, U.S. welfare programs are not appropriate vehicles to redress that suffering, nor should they serve as a retirement program for these individuals. Just as the United States military cannot serve as a global policeman, U.S. welfare programs cannot serve as a global retirement system. 
<p>
Most non-citizens on SSI lawfully admitted to the U. S. have relatives capable of supporting them. To have brought a relative to the U.S. in the first place, the sponsor must have demonstrated a capacity to support that relative. And most sponsors do, in fact, support their immigrant relatives for at least three years after their arrival. If SSI benefits for non-citizens were terminated, in most cases the family support which sustained the immigrant immediately after arrival in the U.S. simply would be resumed.
<p>
Just as Americans expect an absent parent to pay child support for his children, so they also must expect individuals who voluntarily bring elderly and near-elderly relatives to the U.S. to support those relatives fully. This obligation to support should be permanent and should not be limited to three or five years as under the current law. Under no circumstances should the cost of supporting elderly and near-elderly immigrants to the United States be passed to the general taxpayer.

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Next week the United States Census Bureau will release its annual report on "poverty" stating, as it 
has for many years, that there are some 31 million to 32 million poor Americans, a number greater 
than in 1965 when the War on Poverty began. Evidence mounts, however, that the Census Bureau's 
poverty report dramatically understates the living standards of low income Americans. 
<p>
Here is a sample of facts that will not be mentioned in next week's poverty report.
<p>
* 38 percent of the persons whom the Census Bureau identifies as "poor" own their own homes 
with a median value of $39,200.
<p>
* 62 percent of "poor" households own a car; 14 percent own two or more cars.
<p>
* Nearly half of all "poor" households have air-conditioning; 31 percent have microwave ovens.
<p>
* Nationwide, some 22,000 "poor" households have heated swimming pools or Jacuzzis.
<p>
"Poor" Americans today are better housed, better fed, and own more property than did the average 
U.S. citizen throughout much of the 20th Century. In 1988, the per capita expenditures of the 
lowest income fifth of the U.S. population exceeded the per capita expenditures of the median 
American household in 1955, after adjusting for inflation.<sup>1 </sup> 
<p>
<b>Better Off Than Europeans, Japanese.</b> The average "poor" American lives in a larger 
house or apartment than does the average West European (This is the average West European, not 
poor West Europeans). Poor Americans eat far more meat, are more likely to own cars and 
dishwashers, and are more likely to have basic modern amenities such as indoor toilets than is the 
general West European population.
<p>
"Poor" Americans consume three times as much meat each year and are 40 percent more likely to 
own a car than the average Japanese. And the average Japanese is 22 times more likely to live 
without an indoor flush toilet than is a poor American.
<p>
The Census Bureau counts as "poor" anyone with "cash income" less than the official poverty 
threshold, which was $12,675 for a family of four in 1989. The Census completely disregards 
assets owned by the "poor," and does not even count much of what, in fact, is income. This is clear 
from the Census's own data:  low income persons spend $1.94 for every $1.00 in "income" reported 
by the Census. If this is true, then the poor somehow are getting $0.94 in additional income above 
every $1.00 counted by the Census. Indeed, the gap between spending and the Census's count of the 
income of the "poor" has grown larger year by year till, now, the Census measurement of the 
income of poor persons no longer has any bearing on economic reality.	
<p>
<b>Ignoring Billions of Dollars.</b> A key reason that the Census undercounts the financial 
resources of the "poor" is that, remarkably, it ignores nearly all welfare spending when calculating 
the "incomes" of persons in poverty. Thus, as far as the Bureau is concerned, billions of dollars in 
in-kind benefits to poor Americans have no effect on their incomes. Out of $184 billion in welfare 
spending, the Census counts only $27 billion as income for poor persons. The bulk of the welfare 
system, including entire programs that provide non-cash aid to the poor, like food stamps, public 
housing, and Medicaid, is completely ignored in the Census Bureau's calculations of the living 
standards of the "poor."  The missing welfare spending that is excluded from the Census Bureau 
poverty reports comes to $158 billion, or over $11,120 for every "poor" U.S. household.
<p>
The Census Bureau's poverty reports should be replaced by a new survey that counts income and 
assets accurately. With accurate counting, the number of poor persons would be shown to be only a 
small fraction of the Census Bureau's current estimate of 31.8 million.
<p>
<b>Behavioral Effects of Welfare.</b> However, the fact that there are fewer Americans living 
in material poverty than the official Census poverty report indicates, does not mean that the War on 
Poverty has been a success. Welfare spending seriously diminishes work effort and earned income. 
The largest effect of increased welfare spending is not to raise income but merely to replace self-
sufficiency with dependence. Welfare also undermines family structure. In 1965 the black 
illegitimate birth rate was 28 percent; today it is 64 percent. Properly measured, the number of 
persons in material poverty has shrunk since 1965, but at the unnecessary cost of producing a 
burgeoning underclass. The current welfare system has created entire communities where work is 
rare, intact families virtually unknown, and dependence on government a way of life passed on 
from generation to generation. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE CENSUS BUREAU UNDERSTATES INCOME</b>
<p>
The most comprehensive survey of welfare spending is provided by the non-partisan Congressional 
Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. The CRS tracks state, local, and federal 
welfare spending in 75 "means-tested" programs, which are programs with benefits restricted to 
persons with low or limited income.<sup>2 </sup>  The CRS figures include programs targeted to 
low income persons such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), food stamps, and 
public housing. By contrast, the CRS does not include programs available to the general 
population, such as Social Security.
<p>
In fiscal 1988, the CRS recorded $173 billion in means-tested welfare spending at all levels of 
government.<sup>3 </sup>  There was an additional $11.2 billion in Medicare spending on poor 
persons that year which was not included in the CRS total.<sup>4 </sup>  The CRS means-tested 
figures plus Medicare benefits for poor persons yield a total welfare spending of $184.2 billion in 
1988. 
<p>
During the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Americans were inundated by media reports of draconian 
cuts in welfare spending. But, the CRS data show otherwise.<sup>5 </sup>  Today, welfare 
spending is at an all-time high. Adjusted for inflation, welfare spending at the state, local, and 
federal levels rose consistently through the 1980s. As Table 1 shows, welfare spending in constant 
1988 dollars rose from $156.6 billion in 1980 to $184.2 billion in 1988. The total comes to $5,790 
for every poor person in the U.S., or $23,160 for a family of four.
<p>
<b>The Missing Billions</b>
<p>
	The Census Bureau considers a household as "poor" if its income falls below a specified 
"poverty income threshold."  In 1988 the poverty income threshold for a family of four was 
$12,675. That year, the Census Bureau estimates there were 33.3 million people who were poor 
before receiving welfare benefits; after receiving welfare benefits the number of poor persons fell to 
31.9 million.<sup>6 </sup>  In other words, according to the Census Bureau, $184 billion in welfare 
spending reduced the number of poor persons in the U.S. by only 1.4 million, or $131,570 in 
spending for each person lifted out of poverty. How is this possible?
<p>
The answer is simple:  In counting the incomes of poor persons the Census Bureau actually 
excludes almost all welfare assistance. Some 75 percent of welfare spending in the U.S. is in the 
form of "non-cash" assistance. Yet the Census Bureau ignores all non-cash benefits in determining 
the income of poor persons. Non-cash programs such as food stamps, public housing, energy 
assistance, school lunch and breakfast programs, and the Women, Infants, and Children's (WIC) 
food program are excluded from the Census Bureau's poverty calculations entirely.
<p>
Thus, the Census Bureau counts most persons receiving non-cash welfare as poor even if the total 
value of the welfare assistance received greatly exceeds the poverty income thresholds. 	 
<p>
Example:  In 1988, many indigent elderly couples in New York state received income support from 
the Supplemental Security Income program and public housing assistance worth, on average, 
$12,290. These couples also received Medicaid benefits costing an average of $7,548. Despite the 
fact that they received welfare benefits with an average value of $19,838, compared to the official 
poverty income threshold in 1988 of $7,704 for elderly couples, the Census Bureau counted such 
elderly persons as "poor."<sup>7 </sup> 
<p>
Example: In Massachusetts in 1988 a welfare mother with three children could receive welfare 
benefits in the form of AFDC, food stamps, public housing, Medicaid, and school lunch and 
breakfast programs costing the taxpayers $18,765 per year. The poverty income threshold for such 
a family that year was $12,092. But the family would still be counted as poor by the Census 
Bureau.
<p>
<b>Contradicting Itself.</b> The misleading income figures used in the Census Bureau's annual 
poverty reports even contradict other Census data. Each year the Census Bureau undertakes a 
detailed survey of family expenditures to determine spending on rent, food, clothing, transportation, 
medical care, entertainment, and other items. While the Census Bureau poverty survey estimated 
that the average annual income of the poorest 20 percent of U.S. households in 1986 was $5,904, 
the Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey showed that these same households were spending an 
average of $11,477 that year. Thus the Census Bureau found that low income households spent 
$1.94 for every $1.00 of income reported in the Bureau's own income estimates. <sup>8 </sup> A 
small part of this discrepancy might be explained by some retired or temporarily unemployed 
individuals spending their savings. But a major part is due to excluded welfare income. 
<p>

<b>Underestimating the Welfare State</b>
<p>
Table 2 analyzes the discrepancy between CRS and Census Bureau figures on welfare spending. 
According to CRS and other government sources, welfare spending was at least $184 billion in 
1988. But the Census Bureau counted only $27 billion in welfare assistance when measuring 
household income. Part of this difference can be explained by welfare spending on persons in 
nursing homes and other institutions. These Americans are not included in the population surveyed 
by the Census in compiling its incomes and poverty data. Excluding welfare spending on persons in 
institutions, total welfare spending still equalled at least $155.6 billion, so the total funds "lost" by 
the Census Bureau poverty reports amounted to $128.7 billion in 1988.

<p>
<b>Why the "Poor" Will Always Be With Us</b>
<p>
The Census Bureau not only counts the number of poor persons in the U.S.; it also calculates the 
"poverty gap."  This is the total amount of government assistance that would be needed to raise the 
income of all poor Americans up to the poverty income threshold. In 1986, the last year for which 
data are available, the poverty gap -- before persons received any welfare benefits -- was $64.9 
billion. <sup>9 </sup> After taking welfare benefits into consideration, the Census Bureau put the 
poverty gap at $48.8 billion.<sup>10 </sup>  Thus, according to the Bureau, $126.2 billion spent on 
non-institutionalized persons in 1986 shrank the poverty gap by just $16.1 billion. Every $1.00 
reduction in poverty, in other words, required at least $7.80 in welfare spending.
<p>
Besides the exclusion of non-cash aid in measuring the impact of government assistance, two other 
factors help explain why enormous welfare spending appears to make such a small dent on poverty. 
First, up to 10 percent of all cash welfare spending is diverted to administrative costs. Second, the 
government distributes up to half of all welfare spending to persons who have low incomes but are 
not below the poverty line.
<p>
The implications of these figures are sobering. The total pre-welfare poverty gap in 1990 is 
approximately $70 billion. Given the Census Bureau's current methods of measuring income, if the 
government expanded the existing welfare system, which provides 75 percent of benefits in non-
cash assistance and targets nearly half of all aid to non-poor persons, it would require a staggering 
$546 billion in welfare spending -- or 46 percent of the total federal budget -- to eliminate "poverty" 
in the U.S. As long as the Census Bureau continues to count poverty with its current methods, the 
U.S. inevitably will have a large number of "poor" persons every year for the foreseeable future.
<p>

<b>EXAMINING "POVERTY" IN AMERICA</b>	
<p>
In addition to the serious deficiencies of the Census Bureau's measurement of income, the 
government's view of what constitutes "poverty" would be surprising to most Americans. 
Government data on the possessions of officially poor households starkly contradict the general 
public understanding of what it means to be "poor." 
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Nearly a third of all "poor" American households have microwave 
ovens.<sup>11 </sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> Sixty-two percent of "poor" households own a car, truck or van. Fourteen 
percent own two or more cars.<sup>12 </sup> 
<p>
<b>Example:</b> According to government figures, over 22,000 "poor" households have a heated 
swimming pool or a Jacuzzi.<sup>13 </sup>
<p>
Today, officially "poor" households are more likely to own common consumer durables such as 
televisions and refrigerators than the average family in the 1950s. In 1930, nearly two-thirds of U.S. 
households did not own a radio; over half had no form of refrigeration. Among the poor today, less 
than one percent lack a refrigerator.<sup>14 </sup>
<p>
Seventeen percent of U.S. households in "poverty" have automatic dishwashers, well above the rate 
for the general West European population in 1980.<sup>15 </sup>  Among America's "poor" there 
are 344 cars per 1,000 persons.<sup>16 </sup>  This is roughly the same ratio as exists for the total 
population of the United Kingdom. A poor American is 40 percent more likely to own a car than 
the average Japanese; 30 times more likely than the average Pole; and 50 times more likely than the 
average Mexican.<sup>17 </sup>

<p>
<b>Housing Conditions of the "Poor"</b>
<p>
According to the 1987 U.S. Census Housing Survey, 38 percent of poor households own their own 
homes, with a median value of $39,205.<sup>18 </sup>  Nearly 50 percent of officially poor 
households are air conditioned. <sup>19 </sup>
<p>
The homes of these households, whether owned or rented, also are on average quite spacious by 
historic or international standards. By American standards, "crowded" housing means more than 
1.5 persons occupy each room. Less than 2 percent of "poor" U.S. households were "crowded" in 
1987, according to this definition, and only 7.5 percent of poor households had more than one 
person per room.<sup>20 </sup> 
<p>
On average, officially poor U.S. households have 0.56 persons per room, which means they have 
more space than that available to the average American household in 1970, and the average West 
European household in 1980.<sup>21 </sup>  By contrast, the average Japanese lives in a home 
with 0.8 persons per room, the average Mexican lives in a house with 2.5 persons in a room, while 
the average citizen of India lives in a house with 2.8 persons per room.<sup>22 </sup> 
<p>
Nearly all officially poor U.S. households, moreover, are equipped with basic modern plumbing, 
including running hot and cold water, indoor flush toilets and indoor baths. While 30 percent of all 
Americans were without indoor toilets, in 1950, less than 2 percent of poor Americans lacked them 
by 1987.<sup>23 </sup>  As Table 7 shows, America's poor are less likely to lack indoor plumbing 
than the general population in Western Europe. The average Japanese is 22 times more likely to 
lack an indoor toilet than is an American officially classified as "poor."
<p>
The houses and apartments of America's "poor" are in far better condition than generally assumed. 
The median age of such housing units is only seven years greater than the median age for the 
overall U.S. housing stock.<sup>24 </sup>  The overwhelming majority of this housing is in sound 
condition. According to the 1987 <i>American Housing Survey</i> of the U.S. Census, only 2.4 
percent of housing units owned or rented by households deemed "poor" had significant structural 
defects such as crumbling foundations or missing roof material.<sup>25 </sup>  Some 9 percent of 
poor households reported being uncomfortably cold at least once during the previous winter due to 
inadequate insulation, inadequate heating capacity, or equipment failure.<sup>26 </sup>  This was 
roughly double the rate for the general population.
<p>


<b>Food Consumption Of Low Income Americans</b>
<p>
On a per capita basis, low income households in 1988 spent 80 cents on food for every $1.00 spent 
by the median American household.<sup>27 </sup> And out of every food dollar spent by low 
income persons, 32 cents was spent in restaurants.<sup>28 </sup> 
<p>
Surveys conducted by the Department of Agriculture show relatively little difference in overall 
food consumption between high and low income households. Though the food purchased by low 
income households normally is of lower quality and less expensive than that consumed by the 
upper middle class, there is little evidence of material shortages. For instance, the average low 
income person eats 95 percent as much meat as the average person in the upper middle class. 
Measured in pounds of food consumed per week, low income persons actually consume 114 
percent as much poultry, 109 percent as much fish and 92 percent of the fresh vegetables consumed 
by the upper middle class.
<p>
Table 9, derived from studies conducted by the Nutrition Information Service of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, shows the average nutritional status of persons from three income 
groups:
<p><ol>

<li>Low income persons, from the least affluent 20 percent of the population.
<li>Persons receiving food stamps, and those whose income is low enough to be eligible for food 
stamps but who did not actually receive them.
<li>Upper middle class persons from the most affluent half of the population.
</ol><p>
The table compares average food consumption in each of the three income groups to USDA 
recommended nutritional standards. For all three groups food consumption exceeds the standards in 
almost every nutritional category. Differences between the upper middle class and poor in almost 
all cases are quite modest. 
<p>
<b>Food Consumption of Poor Children.</b> Many advocates have expressed concern about 
malnutrition caused by poverty among young children. In 1985 the Department of Agriculture 
conducted a thorough study of the food consumption and nutritional status of pre-school children. 
This study showed very little difference in the nutritional content of food consumed by low income 
as compared to affluent Americans. Children from families with incomes below 75 percent of the 
poverty level consumed 54.4 grams of protein per day compared to 53.6 grams for children in 
families with incomes above 300 percent of poverty (roughly $33,000 for a family of four in 
1985).<sup>29 </sup>  Black pre-school children consumed 56.9 grams of protein per day compared 
to 52.4 grams for white children.<sup>30 </sup>  Surprisingly, protein and calorie consumption was 
slightly higher among children in the central cities than in the suburbs.<sup>31 </sup>
<p>

Average consumption of nutrients was very high for pre-school children of all income classes. 
Protein consumption among children living in families with incomes below 75 percent of the 
poverty level equalled 211 percent of recommended USDA standards.<sup>32 </sup>  
Consumption of essential vitamins and minerals among both high income and poor children 
generally exceeded USDA standards, often by as much as 50 to 100 percent. Shortfalls were found 
in the average consumption of iron and zinc, but these were unrelated to income class or 
race.<sup>33 </sup>
<p>
<b>International Comparisons.</b> Rich and poor Americans typically eat rich diets in 
comparison to the rest of the world. The item most associated with an expensive diet is the level of 
meat consumption; as income increases, the level of meat consumption increases sharply. Table 10 
compares the level of meat consumption of persons living in the 20 percent of American 
households with the lowest incomes, with the average citizen in various other countries. There is 
very little difference in meat consumption between high and low income Americans, but the 
differences between poor Americans and the average population in the rest of the world are 
dramatic. Low income Americans eat 75 percent more meat than the average Briton and 61 percent 
more than the average Italian. In a nation allegedly afflicted with a "hunger crisis," low income 
Americans eat twice as much meat as the average Portuguese, and two and a half times as much 
meat as the average Mexican, and nearly four times as much meat as the average Brazilian.
<p>
<b>Poverty and Malnutrition.</b> Malnutrition and hunger caused by poverty are virtually non-
existent in the U.S. Protein and overall caloric intake are the most expensive factors of any diet. 
Nevertheless, in its extensive surveys the U.S. government has found no evidence of significant 
caloric or protein deficiencies among the poor.<sup>34 </sup>  Indeed, being overweight is the 
number one dietary problem of both rich and poor Americans.<sup>35 </sup>
<p>
Poor persons have lower levels of serum cholesterol than non-poor persons of the same age, sex, 
and race.<sup>36 </sup>  Moderate deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B6 
and zinc occur in part of the U.S. population but are unrelated to income class.<sup>37 </sup>  
Moderate calcium and iron deficiencies do occur more frequently among poor women than non-
poor women. But such deficiencies normally are the result of the type of food consumed rather than 
the amount of money spent on food; simply raising the income of poor women would have little 
bearing on the problem. A more efficient response would be to distribute inexpensive vitamin and 
mineral supplements to adult female recipients of food stamps and WIC assistance.
<p>

<b>CREATING A NEW POVERTY REPORT</b>
<p>
	The Census Bureau's annual estimate of poverty does not provide useful information about 
the standard of living of low income Americans or the impact of antipoverty programs. The current 
poverty report should be abolished and replaced with a new report based on the following 
methodology: 
<p><ol>
<li>The economic well-being of American households would be measured using a detailed survey 
of household expenditures, not the deficient "income" survey currently used.

<li>For those households receiving government non-cash assistance, such as energy assistance or 
public housing, the Census Bureau would determine the full cost of the subsidy provided. Special 
care would need to be taken to ensure that the number of Americans receiving such programs was 
properly counted. The value of medical benefits would be determined by what is generally termed 
the "insurance value":  the average cost of the benefits received by individuals of a similar age and 
gender.

<li>The survey would determine home ownership, housing quality, and other household assets. If 
assets exceeded a certain level -- say $15,000 -- the household would not be defined as poor. 

<li>Any household where expenditures plus the cost of additional government benefits did not 
exceed the current poverty income threshold, and which did not have assets above the fixed asset 
limit, would be counted as poor.<sup>38 </sup>
</ol>
<b>More Accurate Picture.</b> Such a survey could be conducted readily by expanding the 
existing Consumer Expenditure Survey undertaken by the Census Bureau each year.<sup>39 </sup> 
 The new survey would provide a far more accurate picture of the economic conditions of poor 
households than the current Census poverty reports. It would also give far more useful information 
about the specific financial needs of poor families, such as whether they lack sufficient funds for 
medical care, food, or housing. Such a reformed survey still would show that there are poor 
households in America. But by including all cash and in-kind income, and making proper 
allowances for assets, the number would be a small fraction of the 31.9 million poor persons 
estimated by the Census in recent years.
<p>

<b>WAS THE WAR ON POVERTY A SUCCESS?</b>
<p>
About half of today's official "poor" actually are elderly Americans with assets, working families 
who have suffered a temporary job loss or a divorce, or self-employed persons hiding income from 
the government. Few of these households are poor by any normal standard, especially when assets 
and non-cash benefits are counted. 
<p>
The other half of the officially poor population consists of what might be called the traditional poor: 
 welfare families and individuals and family heads with chronic underemployment. The material 
living conditions of this group are far better than the Census Bureau poverty reports suggest. Many 
have income and benefits putting them well above the poverty thresholds. However, it would be a 
mistake to conclude from this that the War on Poverty has been a success. On the contrary, these 
households, intended to be the primary beneficiaries of the welfare state, have turned out to be its 
victims.
<p>
The explosion of welfare spending in the last 25 years may, possibly, have raised the material living 
standards of some less affluent Americans, but it has done so at an enormous cost in terms of 
destroyed families, an eroded work ethic, and possibly irreparable damage to the social and moral 
fabric of low income communities.
<p>
<b>Welfare Dependence.</b> The strongest effect of welfare is to diminish work effort, reducing 
earned income and thus making families more dependent on welfare. In the mid-1970s the U.S. 
Department of Health Education and Welfare undertook the most extensive and thorough 
controlled experiment on the behavioral consequences of welfare ever attempted in the United 
States:  the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, known as "SIME/DIME," involving 
nearly 5,000 families over seven years. The SIME/DIME experiment showed that every $1.00 of 
welfare given to low income persons reduced labor and earnings by 80 cents.<sup>40 </sup>  In 
other words, while welfare is very ineffective in raising the incomes of the poor, it is very effective 
in replacing work with dependence. Recent national data show that among the poorest 20 percent of 
U.S. households there is only one full-time worker for every seven full-time workers in the most 
affluent 20 percent of households.<sup>41 </sup>
<p>
Tragically, the system designed to alleviate poverty in large part has been responsible for 
destroying the work ethic in low-income neighborhoods. There has been an enormous growth in the 
number of non-working poor families since the advent of the "War on Poverty."  In the 1950s, 
nearly one-third of poor families as defined by the Census Bureau were headed by adults who 
worked full-time throughout the year. In those days the problem was low earnings. In 1988, only 
16.4 percent of poor families had full-time working heads of households.<sup>42 </sup>  Today, the 
problem is that adults do not work.
<p>
<b>Destroying Families.</b> A second major consequence of welfare is the destruction of 
families. The black illegitimate birth rate was 25 percent in 1963 when the War on Poverty began. 
Today it is 64 percent. If current trends continue it will reach 75 percent within ten years. Recent 
research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that 
an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate 
birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent.<sup>43 </sup>  According to the Census Bureau, a 
single parent family is six times more likely than an intact married couple family to be officially 
poor.<sup>44 </sup>  To a considerable extent, the welfare state is generating poverty in the United 
States.
<p>
The impact of welfare dependency also seems to spread from one generation to the next. Children 
born into welfare normally remain in the system for many years. Of the 3.8 million families 
currently on AFDC, well over half will remain on welfare for over ten years; many for fifteen or 
more years.<sup>45 </sup>  Research shows that, holding demographic and income variables 
constant, being raised in a welfare family has serious negative effects on the behavior of young 
adults and their life prospects, as indicated by factors such as high school graduation, employment, 
criminal activity, and drug use.<sup>46 </sup>   And June O'Neill, Director of the Center for the 
Study of Business and Government at Baruch College, City University New York, has found that 
after adjusting for racial and socio-economic differences, young women from AFDC families are 
three times more likely to receive AFDC themselves, as mothers.<sup>47 </sup>
<p>

<b>Material Poverty Versus Behavioral Poverty</b>
<p>
In the late 1920s the median household income in the U.S. was around $1,600. After adjusting 
family incomes for inflation, over half of the families in this period would be considered "poor" 
using current official standards.<sup>48 </sup>  Indeed, nearly all adult Americans living today had 
a parent or grandparent who was "poor" according to the Census Bureau definition adjusted for 
inflation. Yet despite their low material standard of living, most of these individuals from earlier 
generations were not "poor" in a meaningful sense. Their behavior and values were middle class. 
<p>
But many of today's poor, while having a material standard of living above average Americans in 
an earlier period, are in another more important sense, very poor. They are trapped in "behavioral 
poverty":  a vicious cycle of illegitimacy, destroyed families, absent work ethic, crime, drug 
addiction, and welfare dependency. Senator Daniel Moynihan, the New York Democrat, has stated 
that "in many if not most of our major cities we are facing something like social 
regression."<sup>49 </sup>  The welfare state, while transferring enormous financial resources to 
these lower income Americans, adds to this "behavioral poverty," rather than relieving it. And the 
Census poverty reports, by exaggerating poverty in the U.S. and thereby stimulating even greater 
welfare spending, in a real sense has added to the misery of these households. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
It seems incredible to most Americans that so much can be spent combatting poverty and yet 
millions of households remain poor. They are right to be incredulous. The fact is that the annual 
Census Bureau poverty reports vastly overstate the number of American poor because in 
determining who is "poor" they ignore assets and dramatically undercount the incomes of low 
income households. 
<p>
An accurate examination of the expenditures, food consumption, housing, and assets of so-called 
poor families shows that there are far fewer persons in poverty than the Census Bureau indicates.
<p>
The principal reason the Census Bureau undercounts the incomes of the poor is that it deliberately 
ignores the effects of nearly the entire welfare system. Programs such as food stamps, public 
housing and Medicaid simply are excluded from the Census Bureau poverty estimates. The total 
welfare spending ignored in this way amounts each year to about $128.7 billion. 
<p>
<b>New Underclass.</b> Yet it would be a mistake to conclude that systematic errors by the 
Census Bureau mask success in the War on Poverty. Vast welfare spending designed to eliminate 
material poverty has in turn generated a new underclass, destroying the work ethic, family structure, 
and the social fabric of large segments of the U.S. population. Most material poverty has been 
replaced by a far deeper and more serious "behavioral poverty." 
<p>
<b>Census "Openness."</b> For most of this century the Soviet government conducted a 
"disinformation" campaign using government statistics to show that the living standards of Soviet 
citizens were far higher than they actually were. For thirty years the U.S. Census Bureau has, in 
effect, been conducting a disinformation campaign suggesting that the living standards of America's 
"poor" are far lower than, in reality, they are. It is time for "glasnost" at the Census Bureau.

PRIVATIZATION SAVES MONEY, REASON STUDY SHOWS  
<P>
     Business managers know that contracting out for certain goods and
services can save money and improve the quality of the final product. 
Unfortunately, most school administrators and local politicians have
yet to learn this lesson.  A recent guide published by the California-
based Reason Foundation, "Making Schools Work:  Contracting Options
for Better Management," finds that many schools pay as much as five
times what private companies pay for the same work in the same area. 
The foundation points out that school administrators can use
innovative management strategies, like contracting out, to stretch
available resources much further.
<P>
     Designed for public school administrators and managers, the guide
describes a wide variety of money-savving contracting options that
could improve both the educational quality and the physical plant of
public schools.  It will help officials decide when, what, and how to
contract with private organizations for services.  It also gives "how
to" guidelines for successful contracting. 
<P>
     According to Reason, most public school privatization occurs in
such areas as transportation, janitorial services, and food services. 
This is especially true for smaller school districts, where the cost
to taxpayers of keeping services "in house" -- which includes the
overhead costs of equipment, salaries, and insurance -- can be
disproportionately expensive.  Companies specializing in a specific
service generally operate on a larger scale and so can spread out
overhead costs, leading to lower prices.  Private contracting also
tends to eliminate the sloppiness and carelessness that often are
found in services operated by the public school system:  a private
company's contract can be terminated for poor performance.
<P>
     There are plenty of examples of successes in the Reason guide. 
In Piscataway, New Jersey, for example, School Superintendent Philip
Geiger privatized bus services in 1991 and cafeteria services in 1992. 
Within one year the transportation costs dropped from $4 million to
$2.5 million, while an estimated $500,000 was saved on food services
in one year.  With that $2 million in savings, says Geiger, "We were
able to redirect funds from noninstructional to instructional uses and
save tax dollars."  With such services delegated to private firms,
school administrators can focus more on what matters most:  educating
children.
<P>
     Privatization can also yield benefits for remedial education,
special education, driver's education, and foreign language
instruction.  Far fewer students enroll in these courses than in basic
courses such as Math and English, and hiring private companies to run
these classes can significantly reduce overall costs.  For example,
Berlitz International, the world-famous firm which offers foreign
language instruction to business executives and tourists, now serves
public schools.  High Tech High School, a magnet school in Hudson
County, New Jersey, contracts with Berlitz to teach Japanese and
Spanish.  Says Principal Karol Brantato, "It's economically feasible
for us....  [W]hat would we have done with a [full-time] Japanese
teacher on staff the rest of the time?  We're very happy with Berlitz,
and I think contracting out is a real viable option for small
programs."
<P>
     Because the needs and abilities of children are unique, some
children require additional assistance.  In Baltimore, Maryland, the
public school system signed a contract in 1993 with Sylvan Learning
Systems for remedial instruction to disadvantaged students in five
public schools.  If a student fails to improve his academic
performance, the company will offer an extra six weeks of remedial
education to the student at no charge to the schools. 
<P>
     One of the most innovative privatizing efforts is contracting out
the supervision of an entire school to a private company, a measure
used in some localities to halt the declining quality of public
education.  The leader in this field has been the Milwaukee-based
Education Alternatives, Inc.  (see BEI 8, 11, 18, 19, 21, 34).  In
June 1991, the firm signed a five-year contract with the Dade County,
Florida school district to operate one of their public schools.  The
company now also runs nine schools in Baltimore, where they in turn
have sub-contracted out to Johnson Controls World Services for
janitorial services.  Budgeted at the average per-pupil cost of the
school district , the company expects to cut administrative costs by
25 percent, redirect those funds into the classroom, and still make a
5 percent profit.  Preliminary results are promising.
<P>
     With growing budget demands,  school administrators are
desperately trying to find ways to cut costs yet still assure quality
education.  Contracting out services often costs less than providing
the service "in house."  It assures direct accountability, and would
be continued only if the school district found the relationship
successful.  Privatization, therefore, could prove to be a vital step
on the road to educational reform.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR NOMINATES BUSINESSMAN AS SUPERINTENDENT 
     <P>
     Governor Pete Wilson of California recently nominated corporate
turnaround specialist Sanford C.  Sigoloff for the post of
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the highest education position
in the state.  If confirmed, Sigoloff will take over from acting
Superintendent of Public Instruction William Dawson.
<P>
     Wilson hopes Sigoloff, Chairman and CEO of Sigoloff and
Associates, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm specializing in the
restructuring and rehabilitation of troubled companies, will apply the
same principles to education he has used in making corporate
California more competitive.  As Wilson says, "Now he [Sigoloff] has a
new customer -- the school children of California -- and these same
principles that helped make corporate America more competitive can be
put to work making our schools more competitive."
<P>
     Sigoloff, who is also an adjunct professor at the John E. 
Anderson Graduate School of Management at the University of
California-Los Angeles, will help school districts around the state
get the most out of taxpayers' dollars.  Declares Wilson, "We can't
afford to waste a single dollar on overhead or administration when we
need every dollar we have in the classroom helping our kids."
<P>
BIGGER DOES NOT EQUAL BETTER 
<P>
     The Chicago-based Heartland Institute warns that students
actually learn less when states, as opposed to local governments, pick
up a larger share of funding for public schools.
<P>
     Their report, "Losing Local Control of Education:  Cost and
Quality Implications," analyzed data for 37 states and the District of
Columbia, evaluating the relationship between student achievement and
school district size, school size, and state share of school funding. 
After controlling for per-pupil expenditures and the socio-economic
status of students, author Herbert J.  Walberg, who is Research
Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, finds
that as school governance and funding become more centralized, student
achievement falls.  "The increasing bureaucracy and declining local
accountability that accompany 'remote' spending," writes Walberg,
"have a demonstrably negative effect on student achievement."
<P>
     Walberg shows that centralized funding, school district
consolidation, and a trend toward larger schools has reduced the
influence of parents, educators, and local school boards in
determining school policy.  It has, however, increased the influence
of special interest groups such as the National Education Association. 
The results of centralized governance and funding are all too clear: 
"School spending and school-related tax rates are more likely to
increase and to increase without accountability and improvement in
student learning.  States with such centralized systems are driven by
special interests rather than the public good, which in this case is
effective learning."

RJR NABISCO FOUNDATION BACKS RADICAL REFORM 
<P>
     The Next Century Schools Program, funded by the RJR Nabisco
Foundation, is attempting to stimulate education reform in America. 
After committing nearly $30 million to 42 schools with ideas for
school reform, the RJR Nabisco Foundation recently brought 75
principals, teachers, administrators, and others from across the
United States together for a three-day conference entitled the "China
Breakers Conference."
<P>
     The meeting, part of the Next Century Schools program, recognized
individuals committed to breaking the mold of schooling by channeling
their ideas and energies into the educational mainstream.  The
consensus:  Americans must break some china to enjoy the benefits of
schools that meet the needs of the changing society.  Said former
Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, and now IBM CEO, Louis Gerstner: 
"The majority of our public schools are low-tech institutions in a
high-tech world -- bureaucratic dinosaurs lagging behind every
comparable system worldwide."
<P>
     The participants agreed radical reform must take place if America
is going to be competitive in the world economy during the next
century.  Among the recommendations of the conference:  entitle
parents, students, and teachers to greater choice among and within
schools, decentralize school administration, abolish certification,
and establish high, uniform, and demanding standards for students and
teachers.
<P>
     Conferees agreed that real school choice was the most important
ingredient in school reform.  Notes From the Front Lines, the
published highlights of the conference, concludes:  "School choice... 
was the natural, inevitable consequence of the new concept the
participants were struggling to create, a paradigm emphasizing
community, 'smallness' as an educational value and new learning
experiences created by cottage industries.  Greater choice can
stimulate the energy and creativity of parents, students and teachers
that are smothered in today's bureaucratic schools." 
<P>
     Another forthcoming development of the Next Century Schools
project is the forthcoming book, Reinventing Education.  Authored by
IBM chief Gerstner, New American Schools Development Corporation
treasurer Roger Semerad, education analyst Denis Doyle, and William
Johnston, it will emphasize the need for radical reform of America's
education system.  The book warns that "schools cannot be regulated
back into good health," and that only a business (or market-based)
perspective of reforming American public schools will work. 
<P>
     Reinventing Education gives many examples of innovative ideas
used by schools in the Next Century Schools project.  The Downtown
School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for instance, is an example
of what a school can accomplish when unencumbered by existing notions
of schools.  The Downtown School is located in a former public market,
near a corporate complex.  The children of nearby workers are given
enrollment priority.  These workers must agree to help out at the
school at least one hour per week as a condition of enrolling their
children.  As an increasing number of parents work outside the home,
the close ties between schools and workplace become more important.
<P>
     The Next Century Schools project is at the forefront of reforming
the American education system.  Only by breaking through the current
mindset that accepts the status quo will American business make a real
difference in education.

BUSINESSMAN GIVES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO POOR CHILDREN 
<P>
     Patrick F.  Taylor, owner of Taylor Energy Company of New
Orleans, is among the growing band of business leaders who are giving
educational opportunities to low-income youngsters.
<P>
     Taylor's commitment to the education of poor youngsters began in
1988 after he addressed 180 twice-failed, minority, single-parent
seventh- and eighth-grade students at Livingston Middle School in East
New Orleans.  At the time, many of these students planned to drop out
of school after the eighth grade.  But by serving as a role model and
encouraging these children, Taylor has helped many of them enter
college.
<P>
     One of Taylor's major efforts, Project New Orleans, gives $1,000
in personal expense money per year to each student in Orleans Parish
who qualifies for a Pell Grant and is enrolled in a Louisiana college. 
The program, which has been in effect since 1990, helps students with
necessary funds for transportation, books, clothing, lab fees, and
other classroom materials or incidental expenses.
<P>
     According to Taylor, Project New Orleans is aimed at inner-city
children because of their high dropout rates, ranging from 45 percent
to 60 percent, and because, he says, many have no hope of a future
"beyond crime, poverty or welfare."  The extra help is critical: 
"While a waiver of tuition and fees would assist them in college, many
do not have additional finances to buy books, pay for transportation
or other incidentals necessary during their college career."  Taylor
has thus far convinced eighteen New Orleans companies to invest over
$2 million in this program.
<P>

MICHIGAN ENACTS CHARTER SCHOOL LEGISLATION 
<P>
     Governor John Engler and the Michigan legislature recently took a
step toward reforming Michigan's troubled education system.  Following
the landmark legislative decision last year to eliminate all state
property taxes earmarked for schools (see BEI #33), Engler and his
allies in the state legislature worked successfully to pass some of
his educational reform agenda.  The centerpiece is charter school
legislation, which enables existing public schools, community
colleges, and universities to set up schools.  Michigan is the eighth
state to establish charter schools.  The others are California,
Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, New Mexico, Massachusetts, and
Wisconsin. 
<P>
     Under the legislation, no limitation is set on who may propose to
create an "academy," or charter school, but only existing public
schools, community colleges, or public universities are authorized to
organize and operate one or more public academies.   To ensure
accountability, charter schools must take the MEAP (Michigan Education
Assessment Program) test or any national assessment test.  The
Governor's allies won a major battle against Outcome-Based Education
proponents by inserting a provision that the MEAP test could not test
for values.  In addition, there is no teacher tenure in an "academy"
school, and in a related bill, the legislature made it easier for
qualified people without a teaching degree to become certified through
an accelerated program.
<P>
     Citizen groups in Michigan are also trying to eliminate the
state's constitutional ban against private school choice.  Clearly,
Michigan's education reform has just begun.

     <P>

     
ALL ADULTS LACK BASIC WORK SKILLS 
<P>
     A recent study by the Department of Education presents a bleak
picture of the nation's literacy.  According to the four-year study,
nearly half of America's 191 million adult citizens cannot write a
coherent letter about a billing error or calculate the length of a bus
trip from a bus schedule.
<P>
     Like other studies on literacy, the new government report says
that about 10 percent of all adult Americans admit they have
difficulty reading and writing.  But this study gives a more detailed
picture of America's literacy problem than previous reports have done,
since it takes into account how well people understand English.  The
study also includes questions requiring competence in addition and
subtraction.
<P>
     The price of illiteracy is borne chiefly by businesses and their
employees.  Business leaders estimate a $25 billion to $30 billion
loss per year in productivity because of errors attributable to poor
literacy.  Needless to say, the business community was not surprised
about the results of the recent study.  Said Brenda Bell, vice
president of marketing for the National Alliance of Business, "We have
estimated that only about 25 percent of the adult population is highly
literate."
<P>
     A growing number of companies are trying to address illiteracy
through worker training programs.  Many form partnerships with local
community colleges, where professors come to offices and factories to
help workers learn basic skills.
<P>
     But while businesses are pouring billions of dollars into
workforce training and education programs, they still have very little
to show for their efforts.  Madeleine M.  Kunin, Deputy Secretary of
Education, worries that "We simply are not keeping pace with the kinds
of skills required in today's economy."  More and more business
leaders are concluding that trying to solve the literacy problem at
the workplace is starting too late, and that the education system
needs genuine systemic change.

<P>
SPEAKER'S CORNER 
 <P>
Despite rhetoric to the contrary, a lack of money has not been
responsible for the decline in educational achievement for the last
ten years.  Consider the facts:  
<P>
      
Total spending by all levels of government on education in 1993 was
$493.3 billion.  
<P>
Total spending on education, after adjusting for inflation, has risen
over 50 percent since 1983.  
<P>
      
The proportion of the United States' gross domestic product spent on
education rose from 6.7 percent in 1983 to 7.9 percent in 1993.

<title> Corruption in Russia: No Democracy Without Morality -- Heritage </title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

Committee Brief No. 13, June 21, 1995

<center><h2>

CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA: 

NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT MORALITY</h2><br>



<h3>By Barbara von der Heydt1</h3>
</center><p>
Corruption threatens to strangle the new democracy of the former Soviet Union in its infancy. <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> have been replaced by <i>naglost</i> (brazen insolence) and <i>perestrelka</i> (shootouts). Whether order based on both freedom and responsibility can emerge from the rubble of collapsed communism is an open question. There is no rule of law, no clear definition of property rights, no genuine democracy or market economy for most of the newly freed peoples. 

<p>

Criminal elements have joined forces with the corrupt bureaucrats of the old guard to form networks of collusion. The old <i>nomenklatura</i> still have a chokehold on the country; they may have new business cards, but they are still in power.2  Corruption extends from the police through the courts, into the highest levels of the present government, confirms Alexander Gurov, director of a security research institute at the Ministry of Security, formerly the KGB. "Before, the criminals tried to influence officials with bribes," says Gurov. "Today they already have their own lobby in the government and the parliament -- not to mention the police and the prosecutor's office."3
<p>
Duma experts have issued a report estimating that 25 to 30 percent of the members who will be elected to the parliament in the coming December elections will represent influence of the criminal structures, either openly or covertly, and will be a significant force capable of influencing policy decisions to benefit the mafia.4  No real economic or political force is capable of implementing an anti-corruption campaign, because it is increasingly difficult either to do business without encountering illegal or corrupt practices or to get elected without the money they produce.

<p>

What Russians call the <i>mafiya</i> is a generic term encompassing organized crime, although it is not one organization under a "godfather."  Those operating in the shadow economy are outside the boundaries of legality, but there are varying shades of gray. Not all of those outside the law are involved in extracting or paying protection money. 

<p>



<b>A Moral Vacuum</b>

<p>

The explosion of criminality, corruption, and mafia activity is evidence of a moral crisis of major dimensions. When communism collapsed, it left behind the legacy of a moral vacuum, claim many Russians. What fills this vacuum will determine the future of Russia. Even though half the Russian populace lives in poverty today, the moral needs are even more acute than the economic ones. As economist and former St. Petersburg legislator Mikhail Dmitriev observed, "The economic problems are not a crisis. Give us ten years and we'll be a normal country. But the moral crisis is far more serious."5
<p>
The Communist Party and its ideology of Marxism-Leninism were the source of collective moral authority. Now that the ideology has been rejected, its subjects are cut free of any moral mooring. Russians characterize the result as total disorientation. Alexander Zaichenko, former economic advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev, describes the lingering socialist malaise as "collective responsibility and individual irresponsibility."6  Under the communist regime, "There was a strict but hypocritical code of behavior," claims Evgueni Volk of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow office. "Everyone knew what he was eligible to steal."7  Now there is "freedom with neither responsibility nor morality," says Alexander Mitroshenkov, editor of Poesk.8 
<p>
The result is visible in Russia's prisons, where detainees wait for a trial in cells so overcrowded that they can sleep, sit, or stand only in shifts. The Deputy Director of the Russian Federal Prison System, Valery Orlov, reflects on the explosion of criminality:  "In a law-abiding person, there is something holy left. If it is absent, he turns to robbery, crime, violence, and murder, mainly for material gain. Such a person doesn't feel responsible for his own actions."9

<p>
<b>Communism's Poisonous Legacy</b><p>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn claims that the communist system was deforming, destroying the personality to make it governable. The legacy of communism is the poison left in its former subjects. Vaclav Havel, in his New Year's address in 1990, made the diagnosis:  "We have become morally ill because we have become accustomed to saying one thing and thinking another."  The children of communism learned to speak one way among family and closest friends, and another way outside the inner circle. The result is "moral schizophrenia." 

<p>

In the introduction to <i>Remaking Russia</i>, an intriguing collection of contemporary thought from Russia's leading publicists and scholars, Richard Pipes writes, "[I]t can be argued that Russia's gravest problems are not economic.... Communism's most ruinous legacy lies in the moral and psychological sphere:  economic failures appear as a consequence rather than cause of Russia's current predicament."10 
<p>
Mikhail Dmitriev diagnoses the traits in his own nation:  "The legacy of totalitarianism in human character is a combination of personal irresponsibility and aggression. Everything was decided from above, and there was no risk-taking. Now the people are not capable of combining risk-taking and responsibility." 

<p>

Russian writer Fazil Iskander claims, "The transition from a rather enduring totalitarian regime to democracy has brought unimaginable psychological difficulties along with it. Under a totalitarian regime, it was as if you were forced to live in the same room with a violently insane man.... Many people in Russia have been gripped by anguish, rage, and an all-encompassing suspiciousness."11 
<p>
People who had reason not to trust under the old regime find it hard to do so today. Those who were absolved of responsibility before often find it a burden now. People denied the opportunity to make decisions earlier are paralyzed now when they must decide; socialism bred passivity and penalized personal initiative. People who have never lived in an open society have little practice in resolving conflicts peacefully. The ideology which preached hatred and class struggle sowed seeds of strife, suspicion, and confrontation. If there are no moral boundaries from within, and no external limits, all things are permitted. Those who lived in what Solzhenitsyn called the "culture of the lie" find it hard to live transparent lives in harmony with truth.12   
<p>
Among the most alarming symptoms of sickness are those in young people. Young Russians were asked last year what professions they would like to pursue. A majority answered they would prefer racketeering and prostitution because they could "earn hard currency, travel and meet people."  In a poll of Russian children this spring, they were asked what would prevent them from stealing. Of 100, 99 answered they would be afraid of getting caught. One said he would not steal because it is wrong.

<p>



<b>Democracy Is Not Enough</b>

<p>

	In the absence of internal law of the human heart, no laws of a state can create good citizens or a good society. As Edmund Burke observed, those who are not governed from within must be governed from without. In the absence of moral renewal in Russia, the institutions of democracy and a market economy cannot take root and flourish. Corruption will choke them. Democratic institutions are value neutral and no guarantee of wise or moral policy. They must be filled by the character of a nation. Sociologist Mikhail Tarusin makes the crucial point: 

<blockquote>

	Democracy is only an outward form, which can be used for good or evil. Hitler came to power democratically, and so could Zhirinovsky. .. .. .. If we don't have the moral tradition, we have no future.13 
</blockquote>
No sustained period in the history of Russia has permitted ownership of private property and fostered the responsibility to manage it or one's life autonomously. Neither a reliable framework of laws nor the moral foundations of a market economy and democracy are evident in Russian culture today, although brief flowerings are to be found in the country's history.
<p>
In <i>Remaking Russia</i>, Vyacheslav Ivanov asserts, "What is lacking above all is the legal, ethical, and psychological basis necessary to establish new market relations. Without fundamental change, the feeling of instability, giving rise to fraud and frustration, will persist."14  As the chaos increases, so do the calls for a "strongman" to impose order.

<p>
<b>Deadly Consequences of Corruption </b>
<p>
Evidence of corruption and collaboration with organized crime abounds. According to a report prepared for Boris Yeltsin by the Analytical Center for Social and Economic Policies, three quarters of Russia's private enterprises pay 10 percent to 20 percent of what they earn to criminal organizations.15  Some 40,000 state and privately run companies, including most of the country's banks, are controlled by 150 criminal syndicates.16  Altogether there are as many as 3,000 to 5,000 gangs.17  Known generically as the <i>mafiya</i>, these interlocking bands of organized crime exercise control over their own specific regions of a given city, a region of the country, and a segment of the economy. Some specialize in forging documents, others in drug and weapons trafficking, illegal monetary transactions, auto theft, prostitution, smuggling of raw materials and military hardware, extortion, bribery, and executions.18
<p>
Paying protection money to them has become a normal cost of doing business for many. Those who refuse to pay may discover an auto bomb, an arsonist, a kidnapper, or an assassin's bullet waiting for them. 
<p>
Politicians vowing to crack down on crime have become its victims. Three members of the Russian Duma have been shot in gangland-style executions. The leader of the Christian-Liberal Party of Crimea was executed in June 1994, as was his successor two months later. The Chairman of the National-Democratic Party of Georgia was gunned down in December 1994.19   
<p>
Those who have uncovered corruption and brought it to light publicly have done so at their peril. Vladislav Listyev, Russia's popular TV journalist, who had recently been appointed executive director of Russian Public Television, was gunned down March 2 this year. Listyev had begun revising policies on advertising revenues to break the "circle of corruption."20  No traces of the hitmen have been found. As one Muscovite observed wryly, "Who wants to investigate Listyev's death?  He will be next."
<p>
When the 27-year-old journalist Dimitri Kholodov pursued the whiff of corruption, he discovered evidence of illegal arms sales by the Red Army forces withdrawing from Germany. His investigation led him to the top:  Matvei Burlakov, former commander in chief of the forces in Germany, to the military intelligence, and to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. On October 17, 1994, the journalist was murdered with a booby-trapped briefcase he had been told contained incriminating evidence. The killers have not been found. The Moskovsky Komsomolyets has charged Grachev and other top military officers with complicity in Kholodov's assassination.

<p>

Corruption among the police is rampant. When a new Russian car was stolen this May in Moscow several days after a Duma advisor purchased it, he reported it to the local police. They advocated getting in touch with the criminal elements in his region, suggesting that he could get the car back by paying half its original purchase price. The police offered to help him contact the mafia. This kind of maneuver has become standard procedure, confirm other Russians.21  Rings of auto thieves in Europe smuggle cars from Germany to Poland, or into the Czech Republic -- so many that insurance companies have placed agents on site to purchase cars back from the mob. 

<p>



<b>Violent and Economic Crime Rising</b>

<p>

The Russian Ministry of the Interior reports that in 1994 violent crime increased, as did economic crime. Police recorded 5,000 murders in Moscow alone in 1993; there were 10 percent more in 1994. Kidnappings increased threefold last year, with 272 cases in Moscow alone. Smuggling rose dramatically, 13 times the amount discovered in 1993. Illegal currency transactions were up 60 percent. Three times as many investors were deceived in 1994, losing $4 billion worth of investments.22  More than 14,000 persons were reported missing last year, feared to have been killed by gangs who duped them into signing over rights to their privatized apartments in return for lifetime support. These victims, many of them elderly women, simply disappeared.23  Some 16,600 cases of criminal activity by government officials were reported for 1994, about a third of them involving bribery. However, these statistics on crime most certainly represent only a fraction of the reality. 

<p>

The report by the Russian Ministry of the Interior also documents threatened acts of sabotage for ransom in 1994. A criminal band demanded $1 million not to poison the city water system of the town of Vladimir. In Maikop, bandits demanded $100,000 not to blow up a hospital. In both cases, the criminals were arrested and the act thwarted, but the potential for such future threats is obvious and chilling. 

<p>

Former KGB agents are now employed in industrial intelligence, peddling their information to the highest bidder. Military weapons are routinely stolen and sold to gangsters:  nearly 6,500 cases of such theft were reported in 1993, including machine guns, hand grenades, and explosives.24  More menacing yet are the attempts of organized crime to steal nuclear material for sale on the international black market. Mikhail Yegorov, head of the organized crime department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, acknowledges 47 investigations into attempts to steal radioactive materials in Russia.25  However, German intelligence sources estimate the number of sales of nuclear material from former Warsaw Pact countries and the former Soviet Union at "between 300 and 350."26
<p>
Natural resources such as timber, oil, and precious metals have been hemorrhaging over the borders of Russia. The Russian Interior Ministry claims smuggling of oil and other resources jumped 50 percent from 1992 to 1993.27  Copper, nickel, and cobalt are bought up at subsidized local prices and spirited over the borders for lucrative sales abroad. Although Estonia produces no metal, enough passed through it in 1993 to make the tiny country one of the world's largest metal exporters.28

<p>
<b>The Geese That Lay Golden Eggs</b>
<p>
It is no accident that laws limiting such activities have not been passed in Russia. There is a substantial segment of the existing power structure which benefits from these transactions. The first people to profit from "privatization" were party functionaries who seized profitable capacities for themselves, rechristening them with new names to sound like Western firms. The Russian newspaper Golos claims 80 percent of the joint ventures involve former KGB officers. Organized crime has linked arms with the old guard and new legislators to protect these geese which lay golden eggs. 

<p>

Those under mafia protection can circumvent the prohibitive taxes, which can take 80 percent of income all told. At those rates, a mafia contract for 10 percent to 20 percent looks like a godsend. Confiscatory tax rates are one of the strongest incentives toward collusion with the mafia. With total tax levels between 55 percent and 80 percent of net income, and theoretically up to 120 percent of profits, no one in their right mind pays all the taxes that are due. Because the mafia net extends into the offices that review tax collection, and into the banks which extend credit, the squeeze to collaborate is inexorable.

<p>

The problems facing Russia are acute, if not overwhelming. In order to encourage stable reform in Russia, it is necessary to identify short-, medium-, and long-term strategy to combat criminality and encourage the growth of a healthy society. No amount of aid will be sufficient to solve Russia's problems. The fundamental problems must be addressed from within. Rather than trying for a "quick fix," the U.S. should acknowledge that major change in the former Soviet Union may be measurable in generations rather than years.

<p>

There are three levels where action is needed:  immediate measures Russians can take, measures the U.S. can take, and U.S.-Russian cooperative efforts.

<p>



<b>What Russians Can Do Now</b>

<p><ul>

<li>Reform tax laws to non-confiscatory levels. As long as total tax rates hover between 55 percent and 80 percent, the incentive to collaborate with the mafia to avoid them will remain exceedingly attractive. 



<li>Define property rights and enforce them. Ownership of the land on which buildings stand is still enshrouded in legal fog in Russia, permitting authorities to act arbitrarily in collusion with criminal elements. 



<li>Pass new legislation on banking and securities. The laws of three years ago are long outdated in light of the rapidly changing economic situation. Until the law is up to date, unscrupulous operators will continue to dupe investors. 



<li>Penalize fraud and aggression. Only a fraction of the criminals are apprehended, and fewer yet actually tried and sentenced. If there are no consequences for crime, it will continue to increase. 



<li>Require public disclosure of public servants' income. At present, bureaucrats on the take can easily collect illegal income and bribes with no fear of revealing sources. 



<li>Protect witnesses. At present, there is no provision to encourage truthfulness among those who know of corruption but have good reason to remain silent. 



<li>Increase cooperation across international borders in apprehending criminals, weapons, nuclear material, and drugs. Sophisticated criminals benefit from the snafus between international law enforcement agencies.

</ul>

<p>



<b>What the U.S. Can Do Now</b>

<p>

U.S. efforts to help Russia at the government level have not been effective. Representatives Richard Gephardt (D-MO) and Robert Michel (R-IL) delivered tough criticism last year, complaining "there remains a yawning gap between America's good intentions and the actual performance of our assistance programs."29  Delays, personnel problems, and bickering have thwarted assistance. Exacerbating the problem is AID's inexperience in this region of the world and its slow learning curve. AID's experience in Africa is not transferable; nor are most of its usual contractors appropriate.30 
<p>
Delivering the goods in Russia is no easy task. Much humanitarian aid and funding for training programs have disappeared into black holes of corruption. The old structures which ruled Russia before are virtually all still in place. They were corrupt before and still are. Few Westerners have taken the time and effort to dig down into a given institution to discover an honest person at the middle level who can be trusted. Large grants to public institutions are almost certain to end up in the Swiss bank accounts of the top administrators and not in the hands of those intended to benefit. Conversely, hefty consulting fees to Westerners have enriched them, but seldom helped the Russians in need.

<p><ul>

<li>The entire strategy of assistance must be revamped, based on personal accountability and cultural prudence. Much of what has been done through foreign aid should be privatized. There are organizations in the private sector which have years of experience in Russia; they should be called on in contracting assistance for the Newly Independent States.31  A partnership between the public and private sectors is needed, with the emphasis on mobilizing the private sector both in the U.S. and in the NIS.

<li>Train Russian police, lawyers, and judges in the moral foundations of a rule of law. Nowhere in their educational system was there such training available, and there is an acute shortage of qualified personnel. Western legal foundations have the resources to train promising Russians and to assist in drafting new law needed now. More student scholarships are needed, as are programs to retrain professionals. Reaching out through legal foundations in Russia like that of Duma advisor Anatoly Pchelintsev is a place to start.32 

<li>Train Russian entrepreneurs in the moral foundations of a market economy. As long as business ethics is an oxymoron, the economy will remain a jungle. Economist Alexander Zaichenko trains businessmen in the principles of organization, but also exhorts them to deal honestly. Zaichenko is building groups for "Fair and Ethical Business" to help them help each other preserve integrity. His protegees have succeeded in setting up new businesses and creating jobs.33  The Canadian government has lauded his group as the most effective of ten they have funded. His organization needs computers and Western investors looking for reliable Russian partners.

<li>Target loans to Russian businessmen of integrity with accountability. The approach of Enterprise Development International in granting microloans to budding businesses puts the incentives in the right place. The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) is advancing private enterprise and market institutions which support democratic development. Encouraging self-sufficient small businesses will create jobs and opportunities in a country struggling to make the transition from a planned economy.



<li>Create "Spheres of Integrity" in the economy. This intriguing concept was developed by Czechs to break the stronghold of corruption there. Business associates make a covenant with each other to honor contracts and deal honestly, even if it is not possible in the rest of the outside world.34  Where there is light, the darkness recedes.
</ul><p>
The same principle applies to focusing aid to a limited number of geographic regions where the U.S. can make a difference. A country stretching over ten time zones is too big to help with diffuse efforts. Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladivostok, and the Ural mountains region are good candidates for focused efforts.

<p>

German assistance to the former Soviet Union has taken this approach. Undersecretary of the Interior Horst Waffenschmidt has concentrated aid on six regions, building up an infrastructure with honest partners to create "<i>Insel der Hoffnung</i>," or "Islands of Hope."

<p><ul>

<li>Help television transmit the values underpinning democracy. Russian bureaucrats are dragging their feet to privatize their media. Former dissident Mikhail Kazachkov has founded "Freedom Channel-Persona" for broadcasting in Russia. Endorsed by Yelena Bonner, this team produces award-winning programming to lay the foundations of a free society. Highly motivated, professional, and effective, this group focuses on principles like respect for the individual in developing a pluralistic civil society. They need broadcast equipment and program funding to establish a Russian version of C-SPAN. They have applied for AID assistance, but in vain. 



<li>Use the Russian media to tell the story of freedom. Russian newspapers are willing to run articles on the foundations of democracy and the market economy, and on morality. German businessman Waldemar Murjahn has placed articles on the Christian roots of morality in such newspapers as <i>Argumenti i Fakti, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Literaturnaya Gazeta</i>, and <i>Poesk</i>. The combined press runs total one billion, and the costs were modest.



<li>Keep the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on the air. Anybody who thought the job was over when communism collapsed is wrong. Restructuring the post-communist order is at least as tough as opposing communism, and there is no blueprint. An entire culture is seeking reorientation. What passes for democracy today is a far cry from the real thing. 

</ul><p>

More ominously, criminal elements are brazenly executing those who uncover corruption. The slayings of journalists Dimitri Kholodov and Vladislav Listyev illustrate the deadly consequences of telling the truth. An international source of reporting is needed to offset Russian media likely to be increasingly intimated by organized crime or political extremists.

<p>

<b>Note for U.S. budget cutters</b>:  No new funds needed. See the proposals of Ariel Cohen of The Heritage Foundation on reprogramming $225 million by abolishing the Commodities Import Program and scrapping the Russian Officer Resettlement Program.35  AID obligated $2.5 billion but expended only $1.2 billion for combined FYs 1992-95.36  It is just as well:  most of this could be done far better in the private sector anyway. 

<p>
<b>In for the Long Haul</b>
<P>
There is no way that Russia can become a true democracy with a flourishing market economy overnight. Overcoming 70 years of communism is difficult enough, but the problem is deeper yet. Nowhere in the entire history of Russia was there a sustained period of personal freedom linked to economic and political sovereignty for the individual. The transitions of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary to democratic capitalism may not be smooth, but they are taking place because these countries are returning to a form they once knew. The roots were in the culture, even if they had been buried for a time. That is not the case with Russia. It may well take many years before the Russian culture can unlearn the traits inculcated under communism and the czars and become a culture which restrains itself by choice rather than by force.

<p>

Investing in human resources through scholarships and training programs, enabling help for self-help, and strengthening the private sector and civil society there are likely to yield long-term benefits. Only if Russians are equipped to master their own problems can they revitalize their society from within to make Russia a country which is free, democratic, and stable.

<p>

The U.S. has a great deal to offer toward this end. However, Western efforts to help Russia and the former Soviet republics have been thwarted for a variety of reasons. There is an increasingly allergic reaction of Russians to the arrogant and often ignorant Westerners who have descended on their country. Cultural sensitivity is needed, as is patience. Russia does not want to be a Western knock-off, as a growing number of Russians are quick to point out.

<p>

There are many Russians who have identified the problems of their country and who are eminently qualified to address the needs for both political reform and moral renewal. They stand in the strategic realms of academia, in the media, and in grass-roots movements. America can help best not by trying to make Russia a copy of itself, but by nurturing indigenous Russian efforts. In the words of Vitaly Zhurkin, Director of the Institute of Europe in the Russian Academy of Sciences, "These are Russian problems, and we need Russian solutions."37 
<p>
There are areas where Russians have asked for Western help, or have acknowledged a special role the West can play.
<p><ul>
<li>Foster the growth of Russian civil society. It was the cells of civil society that contributed to unraveling communism throughout the entire East bloc, and it is precisely here that the culture can be reknit. Clusters of grass-roots organizations of lawyers, farmers, teachers, writers, businessmen, and doctors are proliferating, but they have little or no knowledge of each other. Newsletters and data-base exchanges would permit them to help one another. They need computers and fax machines from the West, as well as organizational know-how. 

<p>

The private sectors of America and Europe are needed to help, through thousands of partnerships. The Center for Civil Society is tackling this task honorably, but much potential in America is still untapped.38 

<p>

Until there is growth of a genuine civil society to create culture separate from the state, the threat of a totalitarian throwback will loom large. It is in our own interest to insure that this not happen.

<p>

<li>Create a Resource Bank for Western groups aiding the NIS. There is a wealth of private sector initiatives in the West which are active, motivated, and largely unaware of one another. For understandable logistical reasons, few have an overview of the vast array of needs and possibilities in the East. There is a crying need for an "honest broker" to simply connect the existing resources from those who want to help with receivers. This is a task for the private sector in the U.S.

<p>

Resource materials on the private sector helping from the West exist. A <i>Compendium</i> of nearly 700 U.S. nonprofit activities in Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States has been published by the Citizens Democracy Corps. There is also an excellent catalogue of <i>East-West Christian Organizations</i>, listing nearly 700 church and para-church organizations providing assistance.39

<p>

<li>Build bridges between academics, cultural, religious, and economic and political leaders. Networking in the Western sense is non-existent. But until cultural and political reformers make a common cause, they cannot succeed. They do not know or trust one another, and will remain ineffective until they converge. This is one place where the U.S. can render a service by helping to knit up the fabric of a fragmented society, both in the public and private sectors.



<li>Support Russians revamping their school curriculum and retraining teachers. Dr. Aleksandr Abramov, President of the Moscow Institute for Development of Educational Systems, heads an effort with a team of 200 Russian intellectuals who have developed new textbooks of non-revisionist history, literature, and books which include moral teachings. They also offer training seminars for educators, many of whom are genuinely seeking a new orientation. Further manuscripts are ready, but the titles cannot be printed without financial sponsorship. Some of Abramov's books adopted into the Russian curriculum have press runs of a million. The potential to reach the coming generation is staggering.40  Abramov has applied for an AID grant but has received nothing. 

<li>Give intellectual ammunition. The way to moral renewal in Russia is through its own writers, claim many Russians. A rich literature articulates morality and virtue, stemming from such writers as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, and Pushkin. A <i>Book of Virtues</i>, organized along the lines of Bill Bennett's book,41 could compile the Russian vision of such virtues as self-discipline, compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance, honesty, loyalty, and faith. How can young Russians better learn virtue than from the best of their own cultural roots?42

<li>Equip teachers now required to teach "ethics and morality" in Russian schools, replacing "scientific atheism" in the curriculum. Most teachers have neither new textbooks nor anything in their own education to prepare them for this task. 

</ul><P>

It is possible to reach them:  Waldemar Murjahn from Germany has single-handedly sponsored a series of articles on morality for the past two years in the Russian publication <i>Uchitilskaya Gazeta</i>, which is sent to all teachers in the former Soviet Union. The publication is willing to accept other material, not only on morality, but on the foundations of a democracy and market economy.43   

<p>

The impact of such efforts should not be underestimated. As Vyacheslav Ivanov writes, 

<blockquote>

	The present-day revival of freedom in the arts may have most significant social results. The cultural and educational consequences of the recent economic reforms may become even more important than all other aspects of the changes.44

</blockquote>

<P>

<b>Mobilize the Private Sector</b>

<p>

The most active segment of the private sector stepping in to fill the gaps left by the collapsed state has been the religious community. Forbidden from charitable works under the communists, parishioners of various denominations are now tending the children of Chernobyl, prisoners, the aged, the homeless, and the handicapped. There are significant ways the U.S. can help by enabling Russians to care for their own. In a cash-strapped country where people used to look to the government for their security, such people are providing help no one else can.

<p>

There is religious freedom now, but there are winds blowing which would limit that of the denominations which are not Russian Orthodox. Some elements of the Orthodox Church are extremely hostile to Protestantism and Judaism and have made a common cause with nationalist extremists. However, there is spiritual hunger in Russia, and there are increasing numbers of highly motivated believers eager to put their faith into practice. Here are concrete needs America's believers can help meet by helping Russians to help themselves.

<p><ul>

<li>Support efforts in the private sector to retrain prisoners. Former prisoners of conscience are actively reaching detainees to help them begin a new life. Yakov Dukhonchenko in Ukraine, and Ivan Fedotov and Alexander Ogorodnikov in Russia are successfully turning lives around.45  Supplying them with the equipment to run a bakery, or seeds to plant farms, enables prisoners to be honestly self-sufficient when they are released.  

<p>

"Faith, Love and Hope" is an initiative run by Natalia Vyssotskaya which teaches women prisoners in Russia skills which will serve them once they are released. It has received the approval of the Patriarch of Moscow.46 

<p>

<li>Support efforts to scoop the youth off the streets. One of the most effective ways to fight juvenile crime is preventive care. Church-related groups are taking teenagers in off the street and teaching them job skills other than racketeering and prostitution, the favored choices of many young Russians. Providing sewing machines, tools, and job training is an investment in a productive future. Linking American youth to these fledgling help organizations could provide motivation for both.



<li>Keep the door open for churches. An enormous amount of humanitarian assistance and aid for training has poured in from Western churches and para-church organizations. Unfortunately, as the door opened for such groups, every variety of exotic sect and cult descended on Russia as well. Add to that the Russian Orthodox Church's hostility to other denominations, and it becomes clear why there are Russians in power trying to slam the door to the West.

</ul><p>

Twice legislation limiting access to Russia by other denominations has been presented to Yeltsin, and twice he has refused to sign it into law. A new amendment was also rejected by Yeltsin on May 22 this year.47  Although it was intended to block totalitarian sects like Japan's Aum Shinrikyo while preserving room for responsible groups, Yeltsin surprised its proponents by rejecting the amendment as too restrictive.48

<p>

Mikhail Gorbachev realized nearly ten years ago that for <i>perestroika</i> to be effective, the religious segment of Russia needed to be mobilized. Gorbachev reasoned that the country needs workers who do not drink on the job and do not steal, as a matter of principle.49  The same is true today. Now that the state has collapsed, charitable work caring for the homeless, the aged, and penniless pensioners is sorely needed. People of faith in Russia are stepping in to fill the gaping holes. Believers abroad can, and do, help them. 

<p>

However, elements of both the government and the Russian Orthodox Church oppose the influence of the foreign religious community. The days of the open door may be numbered. 

<p>



<b>Obedience to the Unenforceable</b>

<p>

This is a realm beyond that of policy. It is one in which it is only possible to answer for one's own conscience. Duma member and former dissident Valerie Borschov has observed:  "The main problem is society's passage from communism to democracy without passing through a stage of personal renewal   .... Society cannot be renewed, but individual persons can."50 

<p>

The founders of America structured its government on the premise that man is endowed with abilities and responsibilities and a moral obligation to his Creator. They also understood man's propensity for evil, and therefore created a system of laws and institutions of government designed to limit the amount of damage we could inflict on one another. The Founding Fathers knew very well that order in a free society depends on the character of its citizenry. Adam Smith knew that a market without benevolence and a moral foundation would yield immoral business. The American experiment, which fused the concept of limited government with a market economy, flourished as long as the morality of the country did so. It can function only as long as its citizens are governed by what Midge Decter astutely terms "obedience to the unenforceable." 

<p>

A sense of personal, transcendent morality was all but eradicated in the communist countries. But arguably it has deteriorated in the West as well. As products of a secularized culture, whose roots in the Judaeo-Christian heritage have been largely forgotten and wrenched from the public domain, we have little to offer. How can we communicate what we no longer hold ourselves? 

<p>

The experiment of communism attempted to eradicate God. Its ideology was not agnostic, but aggressively atheistic:  Jews, Christians, and Moslems were all anathema. Communists silenced, imprisoned, and executed untold numbers of men and women of faith. There may be more modern martyrs than in any previous century. 

<p>

The virtues of personal restraint and homage to the transcendent, which are embodied in the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, and the Torah, are remarkably consistent. Judaism and Christianity are unanimous in condemning murder, stealing, and lying while acknowledging our need for family, forgiveness, and a right relation to our Creator. The harmony of the world's great religious teachings on these basic precepts reveals an immutable Natural Law each faith has discovered.51 

<p>

These eternal precepts were replaced by the secularized religion of Marxism-Leninism. We are in the process of trading them for secular humanism and materialism. As Russian sociologist Mikhail Tarusin puts it, "A non-believer is unpredictable, can do anything. A believer has in his soul a system of restraints. When the Russian people realize this, maybe there will be hope for change."

<p>

The same is true for Americans. Any culture which no longer acknowledges eternal truths unravels morally. We see the results not only in the former communist countries, but in our own. If we attempt to raise the banner of virtue and honor, it is for ourselves as well. 

<p>

Russian poet and novelist Fazil Iskander describes his despair, but also his hope for Russia. The truth of his words transcends our borders. 

<blockquote>

	 The great bluff of communism is being replaced by the provincial bluff of nationalism.... In our confused, dark time, who will restore our appetite for creation?  Darkness can be opposed only by light and clarity. We need a natural authority with a clearly expressed will to good, with a clearly creative program, with clear laws that defend the work of those who create. But while bickering continues in the structures of power, while the representatives of national authority hang on one another like exhausted boxers, we cannot expect any creative energy. Hatred reigns. When the earth becomes parched for lack of love, it is irrigated with blood.... It is high time for us to resign ourselves to changing our slovenly universality to an honest particularity. Thus we will be closer to eternity.52

</blockquote>

<h3>WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY BILL</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A conference committee soon will consider health care reform legislation passed by both the House and the Senate. In the House of Representatives, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03103:">Health Care Coverage and Affordability Act</a> of 1996 (H.R. 3103), sponsored by the House congressional leadership, passed on March 28 by a vote of 267 to 151. In the Senate, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.01028:">Health Insurance Reform Act</a> of 1996 (S. 1028), sponsored by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), passed on April 23 by a vote of 100 to 0.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The huge margins of support for these bills reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage. Despite the voting margins, however, many Members are concerned about the impact of specific provisions which, though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences. As written, for example, this legislation most likely would increase the cost of health insurance by billions of dollars while decreasing both the affordability and accessibility of such coverage.

Congress has an opportunity to help millions of Americans gain access to affordable health insurance coverage, but it also has an obligation to do it right. As Members of the House and Senate meet in conference committee to resolve differences between the two bills, they therefore should consider key changes that would improve the health care system for all working families:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Keep medical savings accounts (MSAs) in the legislation.</b> MSAs are a big step toward tax equity for small businessmen and their employees, and for individuals and families without employer-based health insurance. The new tax benefits of MSAs would increase the affordability of health insurance, particularly for middle-class employers and employees.
<p>
<li><b> Increase and broaden tax relief for working families.</b> Without tax equity for individuals and families in the purchase of health insurance, regardless of their status of employment, the reforms so widely promoted by supporters of this legislation would do little either to slow the growth in the ranks of the uninsured or to reverse the rate of uninsurance.
<p>
<li><b> Sunset federal regulation of the individual insurance market.</b> Health insurance is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. These bills would impose an unprecedented level of federal regulation in an area of jurisdiction traditionally reserved to the states, increasing health care costs for working families. Congress should sunset these provisions.
<p>
<li><b> Preempt all state mandated benefits as a condition of federal regulation of group insurance in the states.</b> State health insurance markets are a confusing tangle of rules, regulations, mandates, and price controls, all of which interfere with freedom of contract and drive up costs for workers and their families. If Congress is going to preempt state insurance regulation, it should at least begin to level the playing field for companies and insurers by preempting state mandated benefits.
<p>
<li><b> Dump the costly mental health benefit mandate.</b> The Senate voted overwhelmingly to impose a parity requirement on health insurance, specifying that private insurance companies must provide the same benefits for mental illness as for physical illness. This would be the first time the federal government has imposed a benefit mandate on private health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office says this provision would result in substantial cost increases for workers and their families, as well as reductions in income, in affordable health insurance coverage for families, and even in federal revenues. It should be dropped.
<p>
<li><b> Dump Clintonesque fines and penalties on doctors and allow private contracting in Medicare.</b> Both bills federalize criminal law governing health insurance fraud and abuse, with significant portions copied word for word from the Clinton health plan. Curiously, the applicability of certain sanctions does not extend to Congress's own plan: the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Members should go back to the drawing board and try again. They should reduce Medicare's paperwork requirements and allow doctors and patients to contract privately for medical services without being subjected to threats from federal bureaucrats.
<P>
<li><b> Allow a rollover of funds in flexible spending plans.</b> Millions of working families already have tax-free flexible spending plans to offset routine health care costs, but they must use the money in any given year or lose it. Congress should allow them to roll over unused funds into the next year.
<p>
<li><b> Tell workers and their families the truth about health care costs.</b> Too many Americans do not know how much their employer pays on their behalf for health insurance. Worse, far too many see company-based health insurance as a "free" fringe benefit that comes with the job. It is not. Households pay almost all the costs of health benefits in lower wages and other reductions in compensation. Congress should require full financial disclosure.
</ul>
<p>
<b>WHAT THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, Congress is anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that begins to address the problem. One of the goals of the current debate is "portability," so that families do not lose their health insurance coverage if they lose or change jobs. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, approximately 25 million Americans could take advantage of the portability provisions in the House and Senate bills.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Congress is addressing the serious and persistent problems that beset the employer-based health insurance market, it also should avoid policy decisions that could destabilize the already distorted health insurance market. The disappointing experience of states that have attempted complex insurance market reform shows that legislative mandates can drive up costs for working families and drive individuals out of the market, creating new problems that lead to even more aggressive government intervention.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Insurance Reform.</b> Provisions in the current health care reform legislation designed to reform the health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Guaranteed Issue.</b> With few exceptions, both bills would require insurers to offer group health insurance policies to eligible employers in the jurisdictions where they sell policies.<sup>3</sup>  Under both bills, health insurers would be required to offer individual coverage to a person who 1) has had group coverage for at least 18 months; 2) is not eligible for coverage under any other group plan and 3) has exhausted his or her COBRA coverage, which currently allows most people to keep their employer group health insurance for 18 months after they leave a job; and 4) has never been denied coverage for fraud or nonpayment of premiums.
<p>
<li><b>Limitations on Pre-Existing Condition Exclusions.</b> Both bills would restrict the ability of insurers to deny coverage to workers with pre-existing conditions if they have had continuous coverage.
<p>
<li><b>Guaranteed Renewal of Policies.</b> Both bills would require health insurers to renew all group health plans, provided the insured individuals have paid their premiums and have not violated the insurance contract. Both bills also would allow individuals who leave a group plan to renew their policies on an individual basis.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Premium Discounts.</b> The Senate bill would allow an employee health benefit plan or a health insurance company to offer premium discounts or modify copayments or deductibles in return for patient enrollment in health promotion and disease prevention programs. This would make coverage more affordable for individuals and families who pursue healthy lifestyles.<sup>5</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Tax Relief.</b> Both the House and Senate bills contain limited tax benefits. The House bill would allow favored tax treatment for medical savings accounts. The Senate bill includes no such provision.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both bills also would help the self-employed purchase health insurance. The House bill would raise the tax deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed from 30 percent to 50 percent by the year 2003. The Senate bill would raise it from 30 percent to 80 percent by 2006. About 17 million self-employed workers and their families could benefit from this provision.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Waste, Fraud, and Abuse.</b>
 Many doctors will be surprised to learn that the House and Senate are considering enacting penalties curiously reminiscent of the sanctions proposed in the failed Clinton health plan. In fact, significant portions of the legislative language are strikingly similar to -- and some were copied word for word from -- language found in the Clinton bill.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both bills contain a confusing plethora of new fines, penalties, and jail terms for doctors, in addition to broadened investigative powers for federal agents. These provisions are designed to stop the leakage of the estimated 10 percent of Medicare dollars that is lost each year to "waste, fraud and abuse," and to stop overcharges in private plans. While fighting Medicare fraud is a public necessity,<sup>9</sup> Congress also must recognize that doctors, hospitals, and patients today labor under more than 22,000 pages of Medicare rules, regulations, and guidelines<sup>10</sup> (including a cumbersome, counterproductive, and often silly system of price controls). Busy physicians, pressed for time and handling an ever larger caseload of elderly patients, can be fined $2,000 for a simple error in filing a claim or coding a treatment or medical procedure.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the current regime for coding of medical diagnosis and treatment, over 7,000 codes identify the specific medical services, treatments, or procedures deemed "appropriate" under conditions specified by officials of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the federal agency that runs Medicare. Even worse, Congress in recent years has deliberately increased the administrative burdens and pressures on physicians. Since 1989, Congress has ordered that all physicians, whether "participating" or not, must submit all claims for all Medicare beneficiaries and absorb the additional administrative costs of doing so. Doctors and patients who wish to contract privately to escape these intrusions are threatened with sanctions by HCFA.<sup>11</sup>  Congress thus far has done nothing substantial to reverse either HCFA's bureaucratic excesses or the mounting paperwork burdens on doctors and patients under Medicare.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medicare's very structure, which allows contractors to process claims and reimburse doctors and other providers with large amounts of other people's money, is an open invitation to fraud, waste, and corruption. With this legislation, however, Congress is attempting to correct the system's inherent flaws without changing the structural dynamics that help to generate them. The best way to combat Medicare fraud is to reform the system as outlined in studies by the Heritage Foundation: to bypass contractors and providers altogether<sup>13</sup> and give each beneficiary a defined contribution. With appropriate consumer protections, this would allow seniors to select their own plans and doctors and pocket any savings from these personal choices. Moreover, direct patient payment and private contracting between doctors and patients through medical savings accounts, which enable patients to avoid the entire claims process for small bills, would add immeasurably to the honesty and integrity of health care transactions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is an urgent need to root out fraud and abuse in Medicare, but the sweeping language of both the House and Senate bills goes well beyond this one program. For example:
<P><ul>
<li><b>New Federal Crimes.</b> Title II, Subtitle E, Section 241 of H.R. 3103 would create a new category of crime, "Federal Health Care Offenses," to include such offenses as embezzlement or criminal conspiracy related to a "health care benefit program."  The House language describes a "health care benefit program" as "any public <I>or private</I> plan or contract, affecting commerce, under which any medical benefit, item or service is provided to any individual, and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit, item or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li><b>New Federal Penalties.</b> Under Section 242 of the House bill, doctors or other providers could be sent to jail for 10 years if they misapply any assets used in health care, and could be sentenced to life in prison if their wrongdoing results in a death. They also would go to jail for five years if they obstruct a health care investigation. Under the federal criminal code, persons can be liable for criminal prosecution if they "knowingly and willfully" do something illegal, including such crimes as threats against the President of the United States, false claims for federal pensions, or destruction of an energy facility.<sup>15</sup>  But under the House fraud and abuse language, doctors and other providers are not held to this standard. Officials of the American Medical Association and 37 other professional medical societies have been compelled to observe that "Vague and unfocused language could easily discourage appropriate behavior. Legitimate disagreements regarding medical judgment and treatment decisions should not be cause for imposing legal penalties."<sup>16</sup>  Under Section 244, fines and jail terms would apply universally, not just to doctors: "Whoever, in any matter involving a health care benefit program" made false statements "knowingly" in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits could be fined or imprisoned for up to five years.
<p>
<li><b>New Federal Programs.</b> Both bills would create new federal programs to combat health care fraud and abuse through the coordinated efforts of the Attorney General, the Justice Department, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Section 201 of the House bill and Section 501 of the Senate bill would create a new "Fraud and Abuse Control Program" which would coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement; conduct investigations, inspections, audits, and evaluations; and undertake enormous data collection on the financing and delivery of health care services in both the public and private sectors. Both bills would require the Attorney General and Secretary of HHS to issue guidelines to carry out this new program; these guidelines, however, would not be subject to the public notice and comment, public hearing, and record-keeping provisions that generally govern the issuance of federal rules under the administrative procedures statute in Title 5 of the U.S. Code.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li><b>New Federal Funding.</b> Section 201 of the House bill and Section 501 of the Senate bill would establish a new "Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account" in the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. This account would receive monies from fines, civil monetary penalties, or property forfeitures and would provide, over a period of seven years, $820 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General and another $330 million to the Department of Justice for additional prosecutors. If convicted of fraud, doctors and other providers would be required to pay stiff civil penalties, forfeit property, and pay for the investigations against them. Section 202 of the House bill and Section 502 of the Senate bill also would authorize a new "Medicare Integrity Program."  Under this program, the federal government would enter into agreements with private contractors to police Medicare and review the practices of doctors, hospitals, and other providers in combating Medicare fraud and abuse, with contractors subject to limited liability for "actions taken to carry out a contract" under the program.
<P>
<li><b>No Fraud and Abuse Sanctions for Congress's Own Plan.</b> Under both bills, Congress would apply federal "kickback" sanctions not only to doctors and providers in Medicare, but also to all "federal health care programs."  Both bills define the applicability of new federal sanctions, but both also make a notable exception for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which covers Members of Congress, congressional staff, and other federal workers and retirees. Section 204(a)(7) of the House bill specifies that "For the purpose of this section, the term federal health care program means (1) any plan or program that provides health benefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded directly, in whole or in part, by the United states Government (other than the health insurance program under Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code), or (2) any state health care program, as defined in Section 1128(b)."<sup>18</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Bigger Fines on Doctors.</b> Fines for incorrect filing of claims or miscoding in Medicare currently are $2,000 per instance or error. Under Title II, Subtitle D, Section 231 of H.R. 3103 and Section 531 of S. 1028, doctors could be fined up to $10,000 for each time they deliver medically improper or unnecessary health care services. In the House bill, this dramatic increase in federal fines for incorrect coding or delivery of medically unnecessary services is accompanied by a clarification of the level of knowledge required for imposition of higher fines. Under Section 232, a doctor "should know" that he is submitting an incorrect or medically unnecessary claim if he acts in "deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information" or in "reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information."  Remarkably, "no proof of specific intent to defraud is required."<sup>19</sup>  Sponsors of the House bill, and staff representing them, claim these new anti-fraud provisions would improve the legal situation for doctors.<sup>20</sup>  Meanwhile, physicians are forced to contend with often aggravating bureaucratic determinations of what constitutes medical necessity. In Medicare, as a practical matter, it is officials of the Health Care Financing Administration -- not patients and doctors -- who define what is "medically necessary," regardless of what a doctor or specialist, or even a professional medical society, may regard as necessary or appropriate.
<p>
<lI><b>Jail Time for Medicaid and Fines for Home Health Care Fraud.</b> Title II, Subtitle B, Section 217 of H.R. 3103 creates a new federal crime for citizens who "knowingly and willfully" dispose of assets to qualify for Medicaid. Offenders could be fined $25,000, jailed for five years, or both. Under Section 233, doctors also could be fined $5,000 or more for certifying that a patient who does not meet all the legal or regulatory requirements is eligible for home health services.
<p>
<li><b>New Federal Standards.</b> Section 252 of the House bill would establish new standards for "administrative simplification" for public and private insurance and a massive data collection program. These standards would govern data, medical, and diagnostic codes, as well as codes for "any information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium" that is "created or received by doctors or other health care providers" or a "health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university or clearinghouse."  Health information "relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health condition of an individual, or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual."<sup>21</sup>  The Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to adopt "standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information" used, gathered, or transmitted in various health care transactions. Finally, a "General Penalty for Failure to Comply With Requirements and Standards" would give the Secretary of HHS the authority to "impose on any person who violates a provision of this part a penalty of not more than $100for each such violation, except that the total amount imposed on the person for all violations of an identical requirement or prohibition during a calendar year may not exceed $25,000."<sup>22</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Calling in the FBI.</b> The Federal Bureau of Investigation would be tasked with inspections, investigations, and prosecutions regarding health care matters and would receive $47 million in additional funding next year, and more in each succeeding year, for this purpose. This would supplement HHS's Medicare anti-fraud efforts, to be supported by more than $430 million in 1997, with increases each year thereafter.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Miscellaneous provisions.</b> In the House-Senate conference, Members will make decisions on a variety of miscellaneous provisions covering such areas as medical malpractice reform, tax deductions for long-term care, administrative simplification of claims processing, and expansion of employer-based coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA).
<p>

<b>ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED HOUSE AND SENATE REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stated goal of many liberals in Congress is to create a government-run or government-managed national health care system. Knowing that it is politically difficult to sell such a policy, however, they favor making discrete regulatory adjustments in the current system so that large, more heavily regulated employer-based networks can evolve more easily into something that looks like the Canadian health care system. It is critical that conservatives who favor creating a new system based on consumer choice and competition have a clear idea of what they are doing and why they are doing it in any legislation designed to advance "incremental" reform. If they do not, they very easily could make the current system worse.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Need for a New Tax Policy.</b> While the bills' tax changes are welcome, they do not go far enough -- although, to its credit, the Senate does formally acknowledge the problem in its version.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best market reform Congress can devise is only as good as a person's ability to buy a policy. Without equity in the tax treatment of health insurance, the bills' insurance provisions alone, including the mandate for guaranteed issue of health insurance, are not likely to slow the growth in the numbers of uninsured. Moreover, the bills do little to provide meaningful tax relief for the millions of Americans who lack job-based coverage and who are not self-employed. Congress should recognize the current bills' inherent limitations and plan to broaden health care tax credits for individuals and families without employer-sponsored health insurance in the next phase of health care reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Neither bill adequately addresses the fundamental problems in the health insurance market. In large measure, these problems derive not from a lack of sound rules and regulations on the setting or purchasing of health insurance benefits, but from distortions in the market created by the federal tax treatment of health insurance. By eliminating or reducing tax-generated market distortions, Congress could promote equity among Americans purchasing health insurance, improve the efficiency of state health insurance markets, make health insurance more affordable, and improve access to quality health care for working families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Portability Problem.</b> Federal tax policy excludes employer-provided benefits (unlike other compensation) from the taxable income of workers. Portability is logically inseparable from this tax discrimination. When a worker leaves a company that provides health insurance, he cannot take his policy with him because the employer, not the employee, owns it. True market portability, unlike legislated portability, comes from the worker's being able to own his health insurance policy -- just as he typically owns his life, auto, or homeowner's insurance -- so that he does not lose his and his family's health insurance if he loses his job. The only way to solve this problem is by changing the federal tax code to remove the disincentive against families' buying and owning the policies that best suit their own wants and medical needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Equity Problem.</b> Virtually every analysis of the current tax treatment of health insurance in the United States shows that the tax exclusion is profoundly regressive and inequitable.<sup>25</sup>  The biggest breaks go to individuals and families who need them the least: well-paid, high-income families in large corporate health plans. Low-income workers in small or medium-size businesses, or those who purchase health insurance on their own, get relatively little help in terms of tax support. This is bad health policy, bizarre social policy, and terrible tax policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Without significant tax reform, federal insurance reforms could aggravate adverse selection and the segmentation of health risks in the individual health insurance market. Healthy individuals, lacking the same tax incentives available to healthy individuals within employer-based systems, will be more likely to decline insurance, while those who are sick will be more likely to purchase individual coverage.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For individuals and families having to pay the full range of federal and state taxes, and with only limited tax relief to offset the cost for the self-employed, the price of a health insurance policy that resembles a typical corporate employee health policy could still be more than 50 percent higher for a similar range of benefits.<sup>26</sup>  Congress recently restored the limited tax deduction for the self-employed, increasing it to 30 percent. But even with this modest improvement, enacted last year, the disincentive remains. This disparity in price and tax treatment can be relieved only by making tax relief far more generous for consumers in the individual market, thereby giving young, healthy individuals and families an incentive to buy such policies. Otherwise, only those who intend to use their health insurance most aggressively to get a greater return on benefits than the cost of the policy are likely to take advantage of the portability provisions in H.R. 3103 and S. 1028.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Problem of Choice.</b> Today's federal tax policy undermines individual choice for those with job-based insurance because employers, not employees, make decisions about what kind of plan they have and what kinds of premiums, or prices, they pay for medical and insurance services. In other words, the customer (the employer) is distinct from the consumer (the employee) who uses these services. This anomaly, which exists almost nowhere else in the American economy, profoundly undermines the efficiency of market forces in the health sector and explains the often bitter antagonism between labor and management over the provision of company-based health insurance. It leads many companies to try to contain costs by forcing employees into less expensive managed care plans in which employees often lose their choice of a doctor or specialist or find themselves and their families subject to various insurance restrictions. Moreover, to the extent that managed care plans are less expensive than traditional fee-for-service plans, the companies, not the workers and their families, often pocket the savings from this transition. Congress would be well advised to be guided by one important principle: There is no normal market without consumer choice. And there can be no consumer choice unless providers are permitted to compete for consumer dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Inadequacy of Health Insurance Reforms.</b> Legislative attempts to reform health insurance, at both the federal and state levels, are largely attempts to compensate for distortions of the health insurance market caused by tax policy. By focusing its efforts on legislating rules for health insurance in the individual and group markets without at the same time facing the consequences of the federal tax treatment of health insurance, Congress is addressing the symptoms, not the causes, of the problem in both markets.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>State Experience.</b> Congress is on the threshold of imposing unprecedented levels of federal regulation on state insurance markets. Members should realize that, at the state level, the results of similar reform have been mixed at best. In some states, they have been disastrous, and ambitious measures overhauling state health insurance markets, as in Minnesota and Washington State, have been scaled back.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

State health care reform efforts are inherently limited. States can change insurance regulations, the rules governing health benefits, and the licensing of doctors and hospitals and other medical providers. They can impose various counterproductive rate regulations. But because they cannot change the federal tax treatment of health insurance -- the very thing that drives and shapes the insurance market -- they cannot alter the basic dynamics of the health care system. Only Congress can do that.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Guaranteed Issue.</b> Insurance reforms of the sort found in the House and Senate bills are popular, but there are legitimate concerns among economists about group-to-individual market portability provisions in both bills. The concern is that the individual market will become the insurance pool of last resort for the sickest and most unhealthy citizens. A disproportionate number of sicker enrollees would drive up health insurance costs, making it more difficult for both insurers and enrollees to market or buy affordable policies. The best remedy is more generous tax relief for individuals and families so that greater numbers of younger and healthier people can enter the individual market. Without significant reform of the tax treatment of health insurance, guaranteed issue could be troublesome in the individual health insurance market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a guaranteed issue requirement, an increase in the cost of individual health insurance is likely. But estimates of the impact vary. The American Academy of Actuaries, which represents the actuarial profession in matters of public policy, says that costs in the individual market would rise only a modest 2 to 5 percent.<sup>28</sup>  Likewise, Rand Corporation analysts estimate that premiums under the Senate bill would rise anywhere between 1 and 5.7 percent.<sup>29</sup>  Health insurers are far less optimistic. For example, the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) projects that guaranteed issue would result in premium increases ranging over time from 10 and 30 percent in the individual market.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For many, including supporters of H.R. 3103 and S. 1028, the problem of rising premiums is a real one; for others, however, it merely presents an opportunity to impose a federal regulatory agenda on the health care system that was thwarted by opponents of the Clinton health plan and its various congressional incarnations. Notes David S. Broder, veteran political columnist for <I>The Washington Post</I>: "Although the Clinton Administration supports the [Senate's] Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill, some of its health care experts privately agree that the measure as it stands would create 'significant instability' in the insurance market -- and a need for new regulation."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Unintended Consequences.</b> One disturbing feature of this year's health insurance debate is that the primary Senate sponsors see the legislation as a stepping-stone to actions that many Americans would find unacceptable.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Commenting on this likelihood, Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) revealed that some Senators were seriously considering price controls on health insurance premiums to deal with the anticipated problem:<sup>32</sup>  "That's why we gave the states so much flexibility.... A number of us thought that capping premiums would be a good idea, but we chose not to do it and instead let the states decide how to handle the problem."<sup>33</sup>  But if premiums rise and states resort to Clinton-style caps, the inescapable result will be huge market distortions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals in Congress and elsewhere, who have a clear vision of their goal of a government-run and government-managed health care system, would seize on any regulatory problem created by this legislation as an excuse to extend federal regulation. Nick Littlefield, an aide to Senator Edward Kennedy, who is a long-time supporter of national health insurance and cosponsor of the Senate bill, says: "It may be that the ultimate effect of our bill is to lead the government to take further steps to increase coverage and control costs of health care. My boss still wants universal coverage with cost containment, so from his point of view, the foot in the door is a good thing."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Fines and Penalties.</b> Congress should refrain from imposing extensive federal standardization of private insurance markets, replete with ambitious and intrusive data collection, fines, or penalties. H.R. 3103 and S. 1028 would create a new series of federal crimes, imposing fines and penalties on doctors and other providers that resemble the most oppressive features of the discredited Clinton plan. Not surprisingly, these provisions were enacted with little fanfare -- and with little apparent appreciation of their content, particularly in the more conservative House of Representatives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Federal fines and penalties are an understandable response to fraud, particularly in the Medicare program. Extensive policing is endemic to bureaucratic systems of health care delivery. A system of central planning and price controls requires tighter and tighter rules to stop the gaming that the system itself encourages, with regulators trying to close an ever-growing number of escape hatches for providers. The way to stop this escalating spiral is not by further federalizing and criminalizing health care, but by giving individual consumers more direct control over decisions about their health coverage. The free market is the best anti-fraud measure ever devised.

<p>
<b>WHAT CONGRESS SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should not enact health insurance reforms without simultaneously enacting significant reforms in the tax treatment of health insurance, because such reforms can be successful only if coupled with significant changes in the federal tax code. Changes in the federal tax code will subject insurance companies and those providing medical services to the discipline of consumer choice and competition, and thus make both health insurance and health care services more affordable for working families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given the strengths and weakness that exist in both H.R. 3103 and S. 1028 as currently written, Congress should retain key features of both bills and substantially modify or eliminate others. Specifically:
<p><ol>
<li> <b>Give all American families the right to have medical savings accounts.</b> MSAs are a major contribution to health care reform; they empower patients and allow both doctors and patients to avoid the burdensome bureaucracy of highly regulated third-party payment systems for routine medical services. MSAs would help people regain control over their own choices, provide greater insight into the full cost of medical bills, and give people incentives to act on their own to restrain costs. Best of all, individuals and families would be able to keep the savings from making prudent health care choices. Estimates of the number of persons who would choose an MSA vary. According to estimates of the Joint Tax Committee, middle-class families most likely would choose this option. Of the projected number of taxpayers who would participate in an MSA option, 51.5 percent would be making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year; and almost 78 percent of the total of those participating in such an option would be making $75,000 per year or less.<sup>35</sup> 
<p>
Medical savings accounts would engender intense competition among providers and health plans, and thus introduce unprecedented levels of economic efficiency into the American health care system. But the principal reason Congress should adopt MSAs is that they restore to individuals and families a measure of personal freedom, the highest value in the American political tradition.
<p>
Under the House bill, if an individual received health insurance through an employer, the employer could contribute up to $2,000 a year ($4,000 a year for a family) to the employee's medical savings account. An individual whose employer did not provide insurance, who was uninsured, or who was self-employed could contribute to his own MSA and deduct the amount deposited (up to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family). Money spent for medical expenses is considered pre-tax; otherwise, it is subject to income tax plus a 10 percent surcharge, just as withdrawals from an individual retirement account (IRA) are penalized. Money left in the account can be carried over from year to year with tax-free buildup of reserves.<sup>36</sup>
<p>
MSAs have been endorsed by many health care economists as a way to reduce administrative costs. Doctors see them as a way to protect the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Among prominent Members of Congress, Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-SD) and five colleagues signed a September 8, 1992, letter<sup>37</sup> nicely outlining the case for MSAs:
<p>
Unlike many standard third party health coverage plans, Medical Care Savings Accounts would give consumers an incentive to monitor spending carefully because to do otherwise would be wasting their "own" money. That is, money that they would otherwise be able to save in their account for future needs.
<p>
Once a Medical Care Savings Account is established for an employee, it is fully portable. Money in the account can be used to continue insurance while an employee is between jobs or on strike. Recent studies show that at least 30 percent of the uninsured are uninsured for four months or less.
<P>
Today, even commonly required small dollar deductibles (typically $250 to $500) create a hardship for the financially stressed individual or family seeking regular, preventive care services. With Medical Care Savings Accounts, however, that same individual or family would have this critical money in their account to pay for the needed services.
<P>
Likewise, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) included an MSA option in his own comprehensive health care reform legislation in 1994, noting during a broadcast interview on the subject of health care reform legislation that "This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked on for three or four years. It's very popular. A lot of people like this option and I think it will be in the final bill. I think it's a great option."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
In forging the final health care reform legislation, Congress should retain the House guarantee that MSAs would be available to everyone. It is a step toward tax equity and a major component of middle-class tax relief.
<p>
<li><b> Be even more generous to working families by further liberalizing tax breaks for health insurance.</b> As noted, the tax benefits from purchasing health insurance are far from the same for all Americans:
<p><ul>
<li>The self-employed can deduct only 30 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums.
<p>
<li>Those who are not self-employed and do not have employment-based health insurance can deduct the cost of health insurance only when their insurance and medical bills exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income.
<p>
<li>The federal tax code allows only those with job-based health insurance to receive all of their health insurance tax free.
</ul><p>
Both the House and Senate bills take a first step toward recognizing this inequity, but Congress must go further if portability for the individual insurance market is to work.
<P>
The ideal policy, outlined in detail by analysts at The Heritage Foundation, would be a national and comprehensive system of tax credits, as well as vouchers for low-income persons, available to all American families and individuals, regardless of their place of work or even their status of employment.<sup>39</sup>  Far short of this would be tax equity -- 100 percent deductibility for health insurance -- for all Americans, regardless of their status of employment. At a minimum, Congress should focus first on assuring greater equity in tax benefits to help more working families buy health insurance to protect themselves against the financial devastation of serious illness.
<p>
<li><b> Sunset federal regulations in the individual market.</b> Both bills would impose new federal regulations (including guaranteed issue and renewability requirements) on the individual health insurance market, making these rules a normal part of doing business. Over time, as employers, employees, and insurance companies became accustomed to them, these new rules would become part of the culture of the industry. If Congress does approve such a measure, it also should specify a date certain -- say, after seven years -- for the return of health insurance regulation to the states. Such a sunset provision would accord well with the principles of federalism.
<p>
<li><b>Use tax policy to create a level playing field for health insurance plans.</b> The various health insurance market reforms in both bills, particularly the guaranteed issue requirement, concern health insurers, who feel that forcing them to offer policies to individuals who move from the group market to the individual market would destabilize the market for individual health insurance. They believe that this "group-to-individual mandate" would cause premiums to rise for everyone, prompting the healthiest and the less wealthy to drop coverage. Critics point to the experience of several states that have tried similar legislation.<sup>40</sup>  In Washington, for example, the cost of some insurance policies increased by 34 percent, and some insurers are pulling out of the market altogether.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
Any negative impact caused by a guaranteed issue requirement, including rising premiums, should be softened by strengthening consumer choice and competition in the individual market. This can be done by creating a level playing field between consumers in the individual market and those enrolled in employer-based health insurance. Specifically, Congress can give younger, healthier individuals an incentive to purchase such a policy by giving them the same tax breaks now reserved for workers who have employer-based insurance. Failure to establish tax equity in this manner, on the other hand, could lead to higher premiums and even, as Senator Kennedy's aide indicated, to a Clinton-style regulatory solution.
<p>
<li><b> Preempt all state mandated benefits in the reform of the small group insurance market.</b> With few exceptions, health insurance is subject to a myriad of state rules and regulations. Among the most costly are state mandated benefits, invariably a product of successful lobbying in the state legislature by special-interest groups and medical practitioners seeking coverage for particular medical conditions or specialties. There are more than 1,000 of these mandated benefits at the state level, forcing insurance carriers to cover everything from alcoholism treatment and hair transplants to psychological services and in vitro fertilization. Moreover, the states impose special taxes on health insurance premiums. This combination of mandatory coverage and premium taxes drives up the cost of health insurance for workers and their families, especially those employed in small businesses. A 1988 study of the economic impact of mandates suggested that approximately 44 percent of firms without health insurance did not offer it because of the higher costs imposed by state mandated benefits. As observed by Professor Michael A. Morrisey of the University of Alabama, this "suggests substantial price sensitivity on the part of these workers and their employers."<sup>42</sup>
<p>
Large companies that self-insure can escape the burden of complying with state mandated benefits through the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Under ERISA, such companies are exempt from state mandated benefit laws and state regulation, and required to comply only with federal law. They also can avoid paying state premium taxes on their health insurance -- yet another powerful incentive to self-insure. Congress, of course, has exempted its own health plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) from state premium taxes.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
Small businesses that do not self-insure are not so fortunate. They must comply with all state regulations, including mandatory benefit coverage requirements and extra tax burdens, making it doubly difficult for them to afford health insurance for their workers. Moreover, small employers lack the economies of scale and the power to bargain with health insurance companies, and thus cannot control the cost of policies as effectively as large companies. In effect, the state insurance market is operating under two sets of rules, with an uneven playing field between large and small businesses. For small businesses and their employees, this is a serious problem. Both House and Senate reformers would remedy this problem by creating pooling arrangements for small employers and thus imposing federal regulation, supposedly less onerous than state regulation in governing these relationships. In setting up these pooling arrangements, the House bill is superior to the Senate bill.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
Under both bills, the new business pooling arrangements would be exempt from state insurance rating laws and benefit mandates, but not from state premium taxes.<sup>45</sup>  While this federal exemption from state insurance rating laws is designed to rectify the imbalance between large and small businesses in the small group health insurance market, it does not eliminate the uneven playing field. Under the House bill, for example, small employers would be able to join multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs), such as those sponsored by trade or industry associations, or Voluntary Health Insurance Associations (VHIAs). Moreover, church and religious institutions also would be able to sponsor health insurance plans. Heritage Foundation scholars have long favored the dramatic expansion of group insurance options outside of the place of work, including plans offered by trade and professional associations, union and employee organizations, and even church and religious institutions. Such a broadening of health insurance options expands both consumer choice and real market competition.
<p>
Under the House bill, these associations would be exempt both from state laws that prohibit experience rating and from state mandated benefit laws. Because of the inequities of the current regulatory structure, they would enjoy an artificially competitive advantage over commercial insurance companies, which still are burdened by state regulation, state mandated benefits, and state premium taxes. In other words, by favoring one group of insurers over another, Congress would distort the state insurance markets even further with new legal and regulatory changes.
<P>
The health insurance market already is a regulatory mess, with some insurers throttled by state regulations and others operating under less onerous ERISA rules. Congress should not add another layer of regulation without forcing a net deregulation of the already overregulated health insurance market. The answer to competitive imbalance among insurers is not to maintain or increase regulation, but to extend deregulation. Therefore, congressional preemption of all state mandated benefits should be the condition for any new federal regulatory role. The only benefit condition imposed should be a requirement that insurers offer catastrophic coverage to protect workers and their families from the financial devastation of serious illness. Beyond that, insurers should be able to offer a variety of benefit packages, including those with high deductible plans. Since this is a federal preemption of state authority, albeit designed to broaden the access to health insurance, it should not be permanent. Congress, after a period of a few years, should sunset this preemption.
<P>
Such a measure would go a long way toward leveling the playing field among insurers, substantially reducing the costs of health insurance in the several states and making health insurance more affordable for workers and their families. If Congress does not preempt costly state mandated benefits, however, it will merely perpetuate the current unevenness in the nation's health insurance markets, aggravating the current distortions in these markets and adding to the cost of health insurance for American workers and their families.
<p>
<li><b> Drop the costly mental health mandate.</b> Broad and painful experience with the several states has shown that imposing mandates for specific health services has expensive secondary effects, including driving up the cost of health insurance and making it less available to individuals and families, particularly in small businesses. Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN) added an eleventh-hour provision to the Senate bill that would require insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses.
<p>
This has profound significance: It is nothing less than an attempt by members of the U.S. Senate to impose a mandated benefit on private health insurance. People should be able to get medical care and insurance coverage for all illnesses, mental or physical. But whether to cover treatment for mental illness is an insurance contract issue, not an area for congressional intervention. Individuals and families (with tax relief to help offset the cost) should be able to purchase comprehensive catastrophic health insurance that covers all major illnesses, including mental illness, without imposing high costs on the private health insurance plans of other workers and their families.
<p>
Mandating this benefit for private insurance would impose huge new costs on America's working families. According to the Washington-based Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, the Senate amendment would raise company-based insurance premium costs by 8 to 11 percent.<sup>46</sup>  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent because of this provision alone, while managed care plans would see an extra increase of 4 percent.<sup>47</sup>  Recognizing that workers and their families, rather than employers, invariably bear the real cost of any mandated benefits, the CBO says that many employers would respond simply by dropping benefits -- or even health insurance altogether -- for employees and their families.<sup>48</sup>  For employers who retained the congressionally mandated package, the higher costs would simply be passed back to employees in lower wages. This reduction in family income also would mean a reduction in federal tax revenues of approximately $9.3 billion between 1997 and 2002.<sup>49</sup>
<p>
This federal mandate would affect the costs of some federal programs. The CBO notes that the language of the Senate amendment also would apply to the hundreds of private plans currently competing in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the consumer-driven system that covers Members of Congress, federal workers and retirees, and their families. The CBO projects that the Senate mandate would impose $432 million in additional costs on the FEHBP between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005.<sup>50</sup>  And this probably is a conservative estimate.
<p>
The CBO notes that it is not at all clear whether the Senate mandate would apply to Medicare or Medicaid. If it did, Medicare outlays could increase by almost $80 billion between 1997 and 2002, and Medicaid costs could rise by another $35 billion during the same period.<sup>51</sup>  Most of these extra costs also would be borne by working families.
<p>
As long as employers, rather than employees, own private health insurance policies and are on the receiving end of such government mandates, the political dynamics of the system will foster the imposition of these mandates and their increased costs. The only brake on these dynamics is employee ownership of health insurance policies, in which the high costs of these mandates are direct, rather than indirect, and transparent to workers and their families.
<p>
<li><b> Drop the Clinton-style fines and penalties on doctors.</b> Medicare fraud is obviously a disgrace. The bills' rewards to patients for reporting it should be retained. But new fines and threats of fines for filing incorrect claims or performing medically unnecessary procedures, especially when added to the mountain of regulatory paperwork that already burdens physicians, would be even more confusing for doctors and patients who still have trouble keeping track of HCFA's rules. Faced with stiffer fines, and with no standard of willful intent required as a basis for determination of physician liability, doctors would have to spend even more time trying to keep abreast of the latest federal decisions on what constitutes correct coding or medically necessary or appropriate treatment. Other medical providers, as well as nurses and health plans, would be forced to focus even more closely on whether they are filing claims correctly or complying properly with statutory provisions, waiting all the while for the next avalanche of regulations, interpretations, and guidelines born of changes in federal law. Health care costs for workers and their families inevitably would rise as doctors, hospitals, and medical facilities were forced to devote even more resources to defensive and necessary paperwork, or to produce information to justify themselves to government bureaucrats.
<p>
Congress should establish clearly both the nature and extent of the fraud problem in the private sector before legislating in this area<sup>52</sup> and usurping yet another responsibility of state law enforcement. If they do so, they can fashion effective legislation that has the benefit of full-scale full hearings and deliberation, especially with respect to the character and extent of fraud in private sector plans.
<P>
With respect to Medicare, Congress should address the fraud issue in conjunction with the administrative burden on both doctors and patients in the program. First, lawmakers should stop the practice of imposing civil monetary penalties on Medicare physicians who do not know that their coding of treatments or use of certain procedures is prohibited. As officials of both the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have observed:

<P><blockquote>
Coding health care services for purposes of Medicare billing often is subjective, and more than one code may be appropriate. Variations in coding generally do not constitute fraud, yet under provisions in the House and Senate bills, innocent coding decisions could trigger civil monetary penalties. Likewise, a determination of whether services are "medically necessary" is by nature a subjective judgment, and should not be challenged as fraud (unless there is a specific intent to defraud the system).<sup>53</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
Second, lawmakers should reaffirm the intent of Congress that Medicare beneficiaries have the right to enter into private contracts with their physicians if they choose to do so and can pay their physicians out of pocket for the services they want without submitting claims for these services to Medicare.<sup>54</sup>  Under a private contracting arrangement, no Medicare reimbursement claims would be filed because no such claims would be sought by either doctor or patient. This exercise in personal freedom would impose no cost on the taxpayers.
<p>
In any case, after resolving the specific issues raised by these bills, Congress should undertake an aggressive review of the entire regulatory system governing Medicare, including the application of the DRG system for hospitals and the RBRVS for physician reimbursement, especially the transactional costs to doctors and hospitals of complying with Medicare's regulatory regime and its indirect costs to the private sector.
<p>
It is ironic that at the very time Congress is concerned about the shortage of doctors serving the elderly, and about trying to rein in federal regulation and devolve more power to the states, it is thinking of adding to the confusion and paperwork already imposed on doctors and patients by the Health Care Financing Administration. Even worse, it is thinking of broadening the federal power to go after doctors, hospitals, and health plans in the private sector -- power eerily similar to that exercised by the Internal Revenue Service.
<p>
<li><b> Allow rollover of existing flexible spending accounts.</b> Current law allows millions of American workers and their families to deposit money tax free in a spending account to help pay for routine medical services. Under these Section 125 flexible spending plans, however, employees who put tax-protected money into these accounts must use it before the end of the year or lose it. Allowing workers to roll over any unspent money from one year to the next would provide an incentive for more cost-consciousness, would enable them to build up accounts to protect themselves and their families against unexpected medical bills, and would help fund their health insurance premiums in the event they lose or change jobs.
<p>
<li><b> Forget the COBRA extension.</b> Section 121 of the Senate bill would expand coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA). Under COBRA today, workers in a firm with over 20 employees can remain insured between jobs by continuing their enrollment in the company health plan and paying the full premium for up to 18 months after leaving the company. In the event of a worker's death or divorce, company-based coverage can remain in effect for up to 36 months for his spouse and children.
<P>
The Senate wants to extend COBRA coverage an additional 11 months for individuals with disabled family members or individuals who have become disabled under their initial COBRA extension period. While COBRA is a popular law, Congress should realize that any extension increases the cost of health insurance to employers, and that this increased cost is passed on to workers and their families. While healthy ex-employees may decline COBRA coverage, forgoing full payment for the company's benefit package, unhealthy or disabled ex-workers are likely to sign up for the extension. But while the ex-employees pay the premiums, the higher claims costs are passed back to the firm and its pool workers and their dependents. Direct tax relief to families with higher health care costs is a much better solution to the problem than imposition of yet another mandate on small business.
<p>
<li><b>Tell workers and their families the truth about who pays for health care.</b> A major obstacle to serious health care reform is that too many Americans still think their employer is paying for their health care. Under an employer-based system, the employer transmits the payment for health benefits to the insurance company, and receives a tax benefit for doing so, but 100 percent of the cost is borne by households. Health benefits, like wages, are part of total compensation, and any increase in health benefits is largely offset by a decrease in wages and other compensation. As C. Eugene Steuerle and Gordon Mermin of the Urban Institute note, "Even to this day... few employees get regular statements with their paychecks on how much health insurance is costing them. They then have little understanding of how to bargain with employers to receive higher wages in lieu of a still more generous health care plan."<sup>55</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can close this knowledge gap by requiring, as a condition of tax deductibility, that every employer include a periodic statement on the employee's pay stub specifying the amount the employer has paid in health benefits and the corresponding amount by which the worker's wages and other compensation have been reduced.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In disposing of the many different provisions of the Senate and House bills, Congress will make major decisions that affect the lives of millions of Americans. It is a profound mistake to view incremental health care reform legislation as a series of statutory technical adjustments in health insurance rules, upon which all are vaguely agreed, and which have only neutral philosophical significance. That is not, and indeed cannot, be true. Every specific incremental reform of the complex American health care system can take Congress and the American people either closer to a genuine system of consumer choice and competition, one in which patients are free to make the key decisions that affect their lives, or closer to a more highly regulated system in which the key decisions are made by corporate or government bureaucrats.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Health insurance reform is not tantamount to reform of the health care system. Health insurance reform can make life better for millions of workers and their families, but it also has an enormous capacity to make matters significantly worse, especially in terms of high prices for insurance, greater restriction of the kinds of care and services workers and their families can get, and even reduced access to affordable health insurance coverage for America's workers and their families.

<li>    State risk pools for the unhealthy or uninsured often are promoted as an alternative to a guaranteed issue rule for health insurance. But this popular alternative is burdened with practical and political infirmities: "A risk pool poses risk for abuse. One is that government may not sufficiently subsidize the pool and set premium caps on the insurance obtained by pool members, thus drying up the market for them. Conversely, there is a risk that the pool could be a step toward a government system. By expanding the entry criteria, and increasing the subsidy, the risk pool can be used increasingly to socialize the cost of insurance -- and is likely then to be followed by the regulation that a government system necessarily entails."

This is similar to the health insurance premium discount contained in the Consumer Choice Health Security Act of 1993 (S. 1743 and H.R. 3698), based on the Heritage Foundation plan and sponsored by Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and 24 Senate colleagues.

<li>    Nonetheless, the original committee sponsors of the Senate measure indicate general support for the concept: "It is the sense of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate that the establishment of medical savings accounts, including those defined in section 1301(b)(6)(B) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 e(b)(6)(B), should be encouraged as part of any health insurance reform legislation passed by the Senate through the use of tax incentives relating to contributions to, the income growth of, and the qualified use of, such accounts."

<li>    A cursory review of the provisions shows this to be the case. For example, Section 201 of H.R. 3103, which establishes a new and comprehensive federal "Fraud and Abuse Control Program," is virtually identical to Section 5401 of the Clinton plan as delivered to Congress on October 27, 1993; the language in Title II establishing the "Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account" is remarkably similar to Section 5402 of the Clinton plan; the paragraph in Section 201(b) governing fines recovered in cases involving federal health care fraud is virtually identical to Section 5402(a)(1) of the Clinton plan; Section 242, which deals with health care fraud, mirrors Section 5431 of the Clinton plan, with slight changes; Section 243, which deals with theft and embezzlement, mirrors Section 5437 of the Clinton plan; Section 244, which deals with false statements, mirrors Section 5433 of the Clinton plan; and Section 249, which deals with forfeitures for "federal health care offenses," mirrors Section 5432 of the Clinton plan.

<H2>Statement on the Occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the
Announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, March 23rd, 1993. Washington, D.C. <HR>

<P>
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today
on this tenth anniversary of my announcement of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Above all I want to thank all of you for the
hard work and perseverance you have shown through the years in
supporting and shaping this very important program. It is as true
today as it was ten years ago that this effort holds the promise
of changing the course of human history, by freeing the world
from the ominous threat of ballistic missile attack. Given the
choice, shouldn't we seek to save lives rather than avenge them?
I think we should. And indeed, now we can.
<P>
Ten years ago when I asked the scientific community to give us
the means of defending against the threat of ballistic missiles,
I said there would be risks, and that results would take time.
Well, I'm proud to say that these scientists and engineers boldly
embraced this challenge, and in only a few short years broke new
technological ground in developing innovative systems capable
of providing effective and affordable defenses against missile
attacks anywhere in the world. It is a tremendous achievement,
worthy of the great scientific accomplishments of this century.
<P>
As you know, however, critics of SDI from the very beginning have
been all too eager to denounce the program (and if it weren't
for George Lucas, maybe we would have been off to a better start).
But over the years, these critics have been disproved time and
time again. Today we know that we can defend ourselves, that the
threats have not disappeared -- many new threats, in fact, are
rapidly emerging -- and that Russia and our European allies have
expressed their desire to cooperate with us in developing a global
system of missile defenses.
<P>
This should be good news. Unfortunately, there is a stubborn contingent
of policy-makers who insist on abiding by the obsolete ABM Treaty
and support only extremely limited missile defenses, or even none
at all. Yet I believe their efforts will not stop the progress
we have made and the progress we have yet to make. The wisdom
of the program we launched a decade ago will prevail, and America
will not remain forever defenseless against ballistic missile
attack.
<P>
Now more than ever it is vital that the United States not back
down from its efforts to develop and deploy strategic defenses.
It is technologically feasible, strategically necessary and morally
imperative. For if our nation and our precious freedoms are worth
defending with the threat of annihilation, we are surely worth
defending by defensive means that ensure our survival.
<P>
Thank you again. God bless you, and may God bless America.

CLINTON'S ABM TREATY MUDDLE -- Heritage </title>
<center><h3><i>CLINTON'S ABM TREATY MUDDLE</h3></i>
<p>

By Kim R. Holmes<br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies1<br>and Baker Spring Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Committee Brief No. 16<br>
July 7, 1995<br>
</center><hr size=3 width = 30%><p>

    The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic missile defense. Whether to proceed more
quickly or more slowly to deploy missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is determined by how
the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions underlying the treaty, forged during the Cold War, are very
much alive in the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administration's approach not only to missile defense policy,
but also to arms control and even U.S. policy toward Russia. In short, the Clinton Administration's policy toward the
ABM Treaty has larger significance than the treaty itself. Maintaining the treaty, in fact, is a major force driving overall
U.S. strategic policy.
<p>
    The ABM Treaty is indeed important to the Clinton Administration, but its approach has been inconsistent and
confusing. These inconsistencies raise questions about the ultimate purpose of the Administration's strategic policy.
Why does the Administration believe that America should be vulnerable to ballistic missile attack, even though
countering nuclear proliferation is a top Administration policy?  Why does this Administration want to defend U.S.
allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and territory vulnerable to nuclear attack?  And why is the
Administration expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit theater missile defenses, even though this was never
intended by the original architects of the Treaty or called for in its text?
<p>
    These questions show that the Clinton Administration's approach to the ABM Treaty is filled with
contradictions. A coherent strategic policy cannot be developed until these contradictions and inconsistencies are
resolved. These inconsistencies are: 
<P><ul><li>The Administration has declared the ABM Treaty to be "a cornerstone of strategic stability," while disowning the
mutual assured destruction (MAD) doctrine that serves as the underlying premise of the ABM Treaty.
<p>

<li>The Clinton Administration declared the central importance of the ABM Treaty to U.S. strategic policy in a
May 10 joint declaration issued during the President's meeting in Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin:  "The
United States and Russia are each committed to the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability."  Yet Secretary
of Defense William Perry during a September 20, 1994, speech before the Henry L. Stimson Center declared:  "We
now have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but
rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety."
</ul><p>
For many years, the basic assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet Union (and
later Russia) and the United States to destroy each other was the central factor in maintaining strategic stability. The
ABM Treaty was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued. It was believed that this mutual vulnerability also
was the key to maintaining and even enhancing arms control, which was the most important policy priority for
defenders of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While this assumption was questionable, it was at least backed by a clear and consistent policy. But if MAD
is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine, then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of
strategic stability. Either President Clinton is wrong in the May 10 joint declaration or Secretary Perry is wrong in his
September 20 statement that MAD is no longer U.S. policy. Both cannot be right.
<p>
    Some will argue that MAD and the ABM Treaty were never meant to constitute a nuclear strategy. Rather,
they argue, MAD and the ABM Treaty were only tools for achieving limitations on offensive arms. The goal
supposedly was arms control, not mutual vulnerability. The intention supposedly was strategic stability, not to enshrine
MAD as America's main strategic doctrine.
<p>
    This line of argument suggests that we should ignore the effects of the policy and focus only on the declared
intention:  arms control. But while the intention was supposed to be strategic stability, the effect was necessarily
strategic vulnerability. In fact, vulnerability was considered to be the key to stability. This is the central premise of the
ABM Treaty. Call it MAD or merely offensive deterrence, this strategy absolutely required mutual vulnerability as a
fundamental strategic premise. It cannot logically be argued otherwise. It is myopic to claim that the effect -- mutual
vulnerability -- has nothing whatsoever to do with the intention -- maintaining a strategic balance of offensive forces.
The former is a direct consequence of the latter.
<p>
     Moreover, if the purpose of MAD and the ABM Treaty was merely to limit offensive nuclear arms during the
Cold War, then they were colossal failures. The Soviets increased the number of deliverable strategic nuclear warheads
in their arsenal from just over 2,000 in 1972, the year the ABM Treaty was ratified, to over 12,000 by 1990. 
<p>
     But that is not all. A strong U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive reductions than
the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be. During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions occurred only after
the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic Defense Initiative would proceed. The Intermediate-range
Nuclear Force agreement, the START I Treaty, and the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty were reached during a
time when the U.S. was committed to moving forward on strategic defenses. It is ironic that no major arms control
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton Administration, which has scaled back America's missile
defense programs.2 It is, in fact, no accident; the Russians are quicker to reach arms control agreements
with the U.S. when they face a determined U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak
one.
<p>
    President Clinton has stated that it is not his intention to apply ABM Treaty-related restrictions to theater
missile defense systems, but his actions indicate otherwise. 
<p>
     The ABM Treaty was never intended to impose any restrictions on theater missile defense systems. In a
January 26, 1995, letter to congressional leaders, President Clinton stated that he understood this and was not seeking
a policy of "expanding the ABM Treaty's limitations."  The Moscow joint declaration, however, either states explicitly
or implies that the U.S. is prepared to impose a whole host of restrictions on U.S. theater missile defense systems.
Specifically, the joint declaration states explicitly that the U.S. will accept limits not only on the number of theater
missile defense systems it may deploy, but also on where they may be deployed. Further, since the Administration
seems to assume that negotiations that are the subject of the joint declaration are about interpreting, not amending, the
ABM Treaty, its policy presumes that these limitations are required by the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    We have been a students of the ABM Treaty for a number of years now, and we cannot find any provisions
that impose limits on the number and location of theater missile defense system deployments. The Clinton
Administration, ignoring its own assertions to the contrary, is in fact seeking to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    Some in the Clinton Administration have argued that there is no need to be concerned about the Moscow joint
declaration because it is not binding and therefore does not represent a legal expansion of the ABM Treaty.
Technically, this is true. Nevertheless, the joint declaration presumably reflects the true intentions and policy
preferences of the Clinton Administration. In fact, it establishes the goal for the Administration in these negotiations.
Surely the Clinton Administration would not want to argue that its intentions are meaningless or that they are not to be
taken seriously. On the contrary, these intentions represent the desired outcome of policy. In this respect, they should
be taken seriously, especially by the Senate, which has a constitutional interest in substantive changes to treaties. The
Moscow joint declaration represents a declaration of policy that the Clinton Administration intends to expand the scope
of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While the Clinton Administration is seeking to expand both the scope and the membership of the ABM Treaty,
which would require legally binding protocols, it appears to oppose taking the required procedural steps.
<p>
    Expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty and establishing new ABM Treaty partners to replace the Soviet
Union are not mere interpretations of ABM Treaty requirements, as argued by the Clinton Administration. They are
substantive changes in the treaty. They require formal protocols, similar to the 1974 protocol to the ABM Treaty
reducing the number of allowed ABM sites from two to one and the 1992 Lisbon Protocol to the START Treaty that
established successors to the Soviet Union. The Administration, however, has studiously avoided making any
commitments about the legal form of any ABM Treaty agreements. Indeed, it behaves as if the discussions are only
about interpreting the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While it has received less attention in the press than the question of restrictions on theater defenses, this
procedural issue is particularly important with regard to the question of successorship. The Clinton Administration
states that the ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of strategic stability but cannot say which countries, other than the United
States, are parties to the treaty. As such, the ABM Treaty is now a unilateral obligation that imposes restrictions only
on the United States. This is both unjust and contrary to customary international practice. A treaty is similar to a
contract. The parties must be clearly identified and legally bound. No country can be bound by treaty obligations
unilaterally. The ABM Treaty will remain in legal limbo unless and until a legally binding protocol identifying the
successors to the Soviet Union under the treaty is ratified. The Clinton Administration, while stating it wants to
preserve the ABM Treaty, has made no commitment to taking the legally required steps to preserve it.
<p>
    Some in the Clinton Administration argue that this concern about successorship is a whole lot about nothing,
or as Standing Consultative Commission representative Stanley Riveles recently said, "a political argument posing as
a legal one.3"  Riveles and others maintain that since other treaties, like the INF agreement, lack
protocols and yet remain in force, there is no need to negotiate and ratify protocols for the ABM
Treaty.
<p>
    This argument is not convincing. The successorship of the INF Treaty has not been resolved and that treaty,
too, remains in legal limbo. Pointing to the legal problems of the INF Treaty hardly strengthens the case against
ignoring the successorship issue in the ABM Treaty. Both the INF Treaty and the ABM Treaty need successorship
protocols. 
<p>
     Moreover, the ABM Treaty presents far more successorship problems than does the INF Treaty. The Clinton
Administration apparently is offering successorship of the ABM Treaty to all countries of the former Soviet Union.
That is, the Administration desires to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty by naming at least several of the former
republics of the Soviet Union as the legal successors to the Soviet Union. However, doing this creates a thorny legal
problem:  it changes the substance of the Treaty in a way that requires the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. If all
15 former Soviet republics were designated as legal successors to the Soviet Union, it would imply that as many as 15
ABM sites (one for each designated successor republic) could be legally permitted, whereas formerly only two (and
later one) were allowed in all the Soviet Union. Moreover, multilateralizing the ABM Treaty would substantively
change the procedures of the Standing Consultative Commission. The procedures established for resolving issues
between two partners would have to give way to voting procedures to accommodate as many as 16 partners.
<p>
    Another approach -- of designating Russia instead of several republics as successors to the Soviet Union --
presents a host of other problems. The ABM Treaty says that certain radars must be located on the periphery of
national territory. It also requires designating test facilities. Since the borders of Russia are different from the borders
of the Soviet Union, the location of radar facilities must change. Further, the Sary Shagan test facility designated by the
Soviet Union is located outside of Russia.
<p>
    Whatever the approach, the Senate must and probably will demand that the successorship issue be resolved
through a protocol that would require its advice and consent. In fact, the Senate is already moving in this direction. On
May 2, 1995, 50 members of the Senate sent a letter to President Clinton stating that any agreement to "increase the
number of signatories" to the ABM Treaty should be subject to advice and consent under the law. The law in question: 
Section 232 of last year's Defense Authorization Bill, which says, "The United States shall not be bound by any
international agreement entered into by the President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the
agreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution.4"
<p>
    The Clinton Administration states that its counterproliferation policy includes robust missile defenses, but it
is seeking to use the ABM Treaty to make such defenses less capable than the technology otherwise would allow.
<p>
    The Administration's Bottom-Up Review states that the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and other weapons
of mass destruction, particularly those resulting from proliferation, is a new danger U.S. security policy must address.
The recognition of this danger caused the late Les Aspin to announce the creation of the Counterproliferation Initiative
on December 7, 1993. In his speech before the National Academy of Sciences that day, he stated:  "the one [danger]
that most urgently and directly threatens Americans at home and American interests abroad is the new nuclear danger." 
The description of the Counterproliferation Initiative in this year's annual report from the Secretary of Defense states
that missile defense is one of seven areas for technological and programmatic emphasis that have the most potential for
making contributions to U.S. nonproliferation and counterproliferation capabilities.
<p>
    The Administration's counterproliferation policy would make sense if it were not for its policy toward the
ABM Treaty. If the new nuclear danger is among the most important security threats facing this country, then why
would the Administration point to the ABM Treaty, which ensures that the U.S. remains vulnerable to nuclear missile
attacks, as a cornerstone of strategic stability?  It is interesting to note that the section of the report of the Secretary of
Defense that explains the Counterproliferation Initiative mentions a number of arms control agreements that serve the
cause of nonproliferation. The ABM Treaty is not among them.
<p>
    If the proliferation threat poses a danger to Americans at home, as Les Aspin stated, why adopt a policy that
all but eliminates the national missile defense program?  If robust missile defenses are among the most important
capabilities to obtain in order to address the new nuclear danger, then why adopt policies, including those regarding the
ABM Treaty, that ensure such defenses will be less capable than the technology otherwise would allow? 
<p>
     This last point is the one we find most disturbing. As this Administration pays homage to the ABM Treaty,
it is asking the American taxpayer to shell out billions of dollars to deploy theater missile defense systems that will not
be as capable as they could be. Radar capabilities will be limited; interceptor velocities will be limited; external sensor
data will not be used. In short, missile defense systems will be "dumbed down" to fit what the Administration imagines
are requirements of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    President Clinton states that he wants to work with Congress on resolving ABM Treaty-related problems,
while taking actions that either ignore or circumvent Congress.
<p>
    In his January 26 letter to congressional leaders, President Clinton stated:  "I look forward to working closely
with Congress as we pursue our common objectives in this [missile defense/ABM Treaty] area."  But his actions since
then do not reflect a cooperative attitude. Two examples demonstrate why.
<p>
    First, on May 2, 50 members of the United States Senate wrote President Clinton regarding the then-upcoming
Moscow summit. The Senators stated:  "We are writing in advance of your summit meeting in Moscow to reiterate our
strenuous objections to any action which would politically strengthen the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty....
" Despite this warning, the first substantive declaration in the May 10 joint statement released at the summit was:  "The
United States and Russia are each committed to the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability."  In this case, the
evidence is clear:  President Clinton ignored the expressed wishes of 50 United States Senators.
<p>
    Section 232 of last year's Defense Authorization Bill requires the President to submit ABM Treaty-related
agreements to the Senate for advice and consent. This is the law of the land. President Clinton signed the bill with this
provision in it. As far as we know, President Clinton has yet to make a commitment to submit such agreements to the
Senate for its consideration. While he may yet do so, President Clinton thus far has appeared prepared to circumvent
the Senate on this issue. This is not cooperation.
<p>
<b>OVERCOMING THE CONFUSION</b>
<p>
    To overcome the inconsistencies and confusion in the Clinton Administration's policy toward the ABM Treaty
requires starting over. Above all, it requires jettisoning the fundamental contradiction of insisting that the strategic
vulnerability of U.S. territory is the keystone of strategic security. It means that, particularly in the multipolar threat
environment that will emerge in the near future, maintaining strategic stability through offense deterrence and arms
control alone will be too risky. In short, as countries like North Korea and Iran acquire a long-range nuclear ballistic
missile capability, there will be less safety and more risk in trying to deter rogue states with the threat of nuclear
retaliation. To overcome the contradictions and inconsistencies in U.S. policy, the following steps should be taken:
<p>
<ul><li>Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack
that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces deployed overseas,
and their vital interests will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world.
<p>
    Secretary Perry is right and President Clinton is wrong. The U.S. needs to move beyond
MAD. It must be replaced with a policy that:  1) seeks to prevent potentially hostile forces from
obtaining missiles and weapons of mass destruction; 2) deters such forces from using such weapons
if they obtain them; 3) provides a capability for defending against attacks with such weapons; and 4)
provides a capability to destroy the means of attack with offensive weapons in a timely (preemptive)
fashion. This policy, whether it is called mutual assured safety or something else, should serve as the
cornerstone of strategic stability in the future. As the U.S. moves toward this policy, the ABM Treaty
will not just become irrelevant; it will be antithetical to the new policy. This is because the purpose
of the ABM Treaty is to enshrine American vulnerability to attack.
<p>
    Some will argue that moving beyond the ABM Treaty will undermine both deterrence and the
policy behind maintaining a capable offensive nuclear force. This need not be the case. First, a policy
of deterrence need not be the exclusive province of the offensive nuclear arsenal. Defenses can make
their own unique contributions to deterrence. An obvious example of this is that effective defenses
will cause an enemy to think long and hard about launching an attack, lest it become an exercise in
self-disarmament. Second, offensive forces and defensive forces can complement each other in
fulfilling certain military requirements. An obvious example of this is in the area of targeting
requirements. Offensive forces are best suited to destroying fixed command and control centers used
to launch attacks. Defensive forces are best suited to destroying missiles deployed on mobile
platforms or bombers.5
<p>
<li>Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one.
<p>
    Since the day it came to office, the Clinton Administration has been wrestling with the
problem of distinguishing between defenses against strategic missiles and defenses against theater
missiles. The direct cause of this problem is the failure of the ABM Treaty to provide a clear
definition of the difference between the two. But the Administration needs to recognize that any
definition that distinguishes between the two will be arbitrary and, more important, not reflective of
strategic and technological realities. The entire problem arises solely because the ABM Treaty implies
there is a difference. The fact is that the U.S. faces a global threat from missile attack and it needs a
global defense. At the technological level, a system like the Brilliant Eyes sensor satellite, for
example, will support interceptors capable of destroying missiles of all ranges.
<p>
<li>Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation
policy.
<p>
    The Counterproliferation Initiative undertaken by the Department of Defense already
recognizes this fact. This recognition needs to be elevated to the presidential level so that it is
reflected in arms control policy as well as defense policy. No arms control agreement, including the
ABM Treaty, should be used as an excuse for making the missile defenses the American taxpayer is
paying billions of dollars to develop and deploy less capable than the technology allows.
<p>
<li>Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    Instead of attempting to resuscitate the ABM Treaty, the Clinton Administration should be
exploring the options with Russia and others for transcending the treaty. Preferably, this will be
achieved through a cooperative approach. The window for such an approach with Russia appeared in
1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed the creation of a Global Protection System.
Unfortunately, the Bush Administration never really took advantage of this opportunity. The idea
should be explored again. In any case, the U.S. should be clear to Russia and its allies that it will
move forward with the development and deployment of the most effective global missile defense
capability possible. No offers of cooperation, which the U.S. should be willing to make, should be
allowed to be used as a veto over progress in U.S. missile defense programs.
<p>
<li>Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM
Treaty.
<p>
    Genuine cooperation with Congress requires the Clinton Administration to move forward on
missile defense programs on the basis of what the best technology will allow. Further, it means
seeking a solution to the ABM Treaty problem that transcends the requirements of the ABM Treaty
itself. Finally, it means acknowledging the Senate's constitutional role in treaty-making. This last
requirement should start with an unequivocal commitment on the part of the Clinton Administration
to submit future agreements regarding the ABM Treaty, including one on successorship, to the Senate
for advice and consent.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
    The many inconsistencies in the Clinton Administration's approach to the ABM Treaty are
caused by a fundamental contradiction:  It wants to keep the ABM Treaty without facing up to the
consequences of doing so. It wants to claim that a new era of "mutual assured safety" has arrived, but
it wants to hold on to the ABM Treaty that enshrines the old doctrine of MAD. It wants in practice
to broaden the scope of the ABM Treaty to cover theater missile defenses, but it does not want to
admit it in principle. It wants to pretend that no successorship problem exists with the ABM Treaty,
even though a similar problem with START was not only recognized, but resolved through a protocol
that was subject to Senate advice and consent. It claims that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
missiles is a top security threat to the United States, yet it eschews the most obvious countermeasure
to this threat -- a national missile defense system. And it professes that it wants to work with the
Congress as it negotiates with the Russians on the ABM Treaty, yet it expressly ignored -- and in fact
contradicted -- the wishes of 50 Senators in issuing the Moscow joint declaration.
<p>
    The case is clear:  This Administration wants to hold on to the old strategic worldview of
MAD, but it does not want to admit it. It wants to claim that it is striking out in new directions, while
in reality it is stuck in the past. And it wants to talk up the dangers of the nuclear threat when it suits
its arms control agenda, but play it down when missile defenses are proposed as the solution. The
weaving and bobbing of Clinton officials on the ABM Treaty are mere excuses to hold on to the
ABM Treaty, no matter what the objection, because it wants more arms control with the Russians.
That is the essence of President Clinton's strategic policy. That is, sadly, America's biggest strategic
problem.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
     As Congress reconsiders recent crime legislation, lawmakers have an
opportunity to correct deficiencies in the law that encourage federal judges
to cut short the sentences of criminals -- often violent criminals -- and
release them back into the community.
<P>
     Tucked away in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 is Section 3626, a little-noticed provision that deals with the
role of the federal courts in prison and jail litigation: "A Federal court shall
not hold prison or jail crowding unconstitutional" unless an "individual
plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding" inflicts "cruel and unusual
punishment" (Eighth Amendment violations) on him. Relief in such cases
"shall extend no farther than necessary to remove the conditions that" afflict
the particular inmate plaintiff. A "Federal court shall not place a ceiling on
the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility" as
a remedy for Eighth Amendment violations unless "crowding is inflicting
cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners."
Unfortunately, this provision has not had the intended effect.
<P>
     Both in letter and in spirit, the crowding provision of the 1994 crime
bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Congress, drew favorable on-the-
record remarks from President Clinton and state and local officials of both
parties, and won great praise from law enforcement organizations. Moreover,
the provision reflected strong public support. In every relevant public
opinion survey on crime conducted since 1980, the need to keep judges
from interfering unduly with the detection, arrest, prosecution, and
incarceration of predatory street criminals has been supported by wide
majorities of citizens of every demographic description in every region of
the country.
<P>
     As a rule, federal judges are enormously respectful of both the public
safety and the federalism concerns at stake in prison and jail litigation. But
the first major test case of Section 3626 makes it clear that this provision,
as drafted in the 1994 crime bill, will succeed neither in keeping
irresponsible federal judges from releasing violent criminals nor in
preventing them from gutting highly effective truth-in-sentencing laws and
related public safety measures.
<P>
     Prosecutors already are pointing to the need for fresh legislation. In
December 1994, the National District Attorneys Association, a nonpartisan
body representing concerned prosecutors throughout America, approved a
resolution calling on federal lawmakers to adopt more detailed legislation
to deal with the reality that "federal court orders in prison litigation often
have severe adverse effects on public safety, law enforcement and local
criminal justice systems." What these prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in
protecting prisoners' rights. They have done so at a huge human and
financial cost to law-abiding Americans and at the expense of making a
mockery out of democratically enacted laws. Some federal judges have
made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing changes in
operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff
assaults, a dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for
inmates, and the early release each year of literally hundreds of thousands
of violent or repeat criminals.
<P>
     Congress needs to strengthen Section 3626 to address this continuing
problem.
<P>
<b>THE FAILING CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</b><P>
     In 1970, not a single prison system was operating under the
sweeping court orders common today. By 1990, some 508 municipalities
and over 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial confinement
orders or consent decrees. Indeed, led by the federal bench, judges over the
last quarter-century have undone almost every major governmental anti-
crime initiative. 
<P>
     For example, in the 1970s, when state legislatures attempted to cut
funds for ineffective "rehabilitation" programs, judges declared that prisoners
have a legally enforceable right to some such services. In the June 1993
edition of Justice Quarterly, Professor Charles H. Logan of the University
of Connecticut and Dr. Gerald G. Gaes of the Federal Bureau of Prisons
offered an exhaustive analysis of the literature on such programs. They
found no evidence either that these programs rehabilitate prisoners or that
they come any closer to doing so today than they did twenty years ago.
    <P> Largely because of the courts, today about half of every tax dollar
spent on prisons goes not to the basics of security but to amenities and
services for prisoners. Prisons have about twice as many staff per inmate
today as they did in 1958. Yet most of the staffing increases have been to
administer the services and programs that judges have declared essential to
prisoners' rights -- recreation, education, and medical services.
<P>
     Likewise, in the 1980s, as many states passed mandatory-minimum
sentencing laws, the judges checkmated the public and its elected
representatives by imposing prison and jail caps. In the September 1994
edition of The Prison Journal, Dr. Gaes reviews the empirical literature on
prison crowding and reaches the same conclusions as numerous other
scholars: despite the conventional wisdom about the harmful effects of
crowding, the data simply do not support the belief that inmates suffer
greater levels of violence, illness, or other problems when prisons are
crowded. In many places, prison managers have run very crowded prisons
without any increases in critical incidents or other problems.
<P>
     Just the same, judges have continued to treat crowding as an
automatic threat to the well-being of prisoners and have enforced orders
resulting in the early release of dangerous criminals. In part because of these
judicial interventions, mandatory-minimum sentencing laws have been
largely ineffective: the median time that state prisoners spend in
confinement is only about 35 percent to 40 percent of their maximum
sentences.
<P>
     Many states are now tightening or abolishing parole and instituting
truth-in-sentencing laws that require offenders to serve at least 85 percent
of their sentenced time behind bars before release. Some are also instituting
measures that would result in life without parole for thrice-convicted violent
offenders. But unless the Congress acts decisively to curb federal judges,
they and their brethren on state and local benches -- not the legislatures --
will continue to be the chief doormen of America's revolving-door justice
system.
<P>
<b>REVOLVING-DOOR JUSTICE</b><P>
     According to studies by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
in America today there are over 5 million persons under correctional
supervision -- behind bars, on probation, or on parole. But about 72 percent
of them are not incarcerated. Between 1980 and 1993, the nation's prison
population increased by 184 percent, and in 1994 there were over one
million convicted criminals in state and federal prisons. But over the same
period the nation's parole population increased by 204 percent. In 1994 over
3.5 million persons were on probation or parole.
<P>
     The vast majority of prisoners are violent or repeat offenders. The
latest BJS data show that 49 percent of state inmates are in prison for a
violent crime, 62 percent have been convicted of one or more violent crimes
in the past, and 94 percent have been convicted of a violent crime or been
sentenced in the past to probation or incarceration. Thus, barely 6 percent
of state prisoners are nonviolent offenders with no prior sentence to either
probation or incarceration.
<P>
     While official statistics show clearly that virtually all prisoners are
violent or repeat criminals, for at least two reasons the actual amount and
severity of crimes committed by prisoners when they are free are still many
times greater than these statistics reveal.
<P>
     The first reason is plea bargaining. Numerous studies show that over
90 percent of all adjudicated felony defendants do not go to trial, because
the offender pleads guilty to a lesser charge. Countless crimes are swept
under the criminal-records rug by plea bargaining.
<P>
     The second reason is that most prisoners commit many times more
non-drug felony crimes than the ones for which they are arrested, convicted,
and imprisoned. In two studies conducted in the early 1990s and published
in The Brookings Review, Harvard University economist Anne Morrison
Piehl and this author found that the median number of crimes, excluding all
drug crimes, committed by prisoners the year before they were imprisoned
was twelve.
<P>
     Not surprisingly, therefore, letting violent and repeat criminals out
of prison or jail and putting them on probation, parole, or pretrial release
results in countless murders, rapes, assaults, weapons offenses, robberies,
and burglaries each year. BJS data for the nation show that within three
years of sentencing, nearly half of all probationers and parolees are
convicted of a new crime or abscond. Among probationers with new felony
arrests, 54 percent are arrested once, 24 percent are arrested twice, and 22
percent are arrested three times or more. Nearly one-third of parolees who
were in prison for a violent crime, and nearly one-fifth who were in prison
for a property crime, are rearrested within three years for a violent crime.
Indeed, about 35 percent of all persons arrested for a violent crime are on
probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest.
<P>
     The closer one looks, the clearer it becomes that a huge fraction of
America's crime problem results from lax probation, parole, and pretrial
release policies. For example, the August 1994 report of the Virginia
Governor's Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Policy reveals
that in Virginia 68 percent of all murders, 76 percent of all aggravated
assaults, and 81 percent of all robberies are the work of repeat offenders.
Between 1986 and 1993 alone, the people of Virginia would have been
spared over 1,000 violent crimes, including 73 murders, if non-drug felons
out on parole had remained in prison.
<P>
     Likewise, a 1993 Florida Department of Corrections study reported
that between January 1, 1987, and October 10, 1991, some 127,486
prisoners were released early from Florida prisons. Within a few years of
their early release, they committed over 15,000 violent and property crimes,
including 346 murders and 185 sex offenses. Most of these crimes would
have been averted had the convicted criminals spent even 85 percent of their
sentenced time in prison. But as BJS data show, nationally, about half of all
parolees serve 14 months or less in prison before they are released and
spend well under half of their sentenced time in confinement.
<P>
<b>THE PHILADELPHIA STORY</b><P>
     The public safety toll of court-ordered revolving-door justice and the
difficulty of getting irresponsible federal judges to respect the Constitution
and yield to these concerns is a grave problem. This is epitomized by the
recent history of the prison cap imposed on Philadelphia by U.S. District
Court Judge Norma L. Shapiro. 
<P>
     Typical of the judicial modus operandi in such cases, Judge Shapiro
cajoled the city into signing two consent decrees, one in 1986 and one in
1991, which gave her virtually unfettered control over the system and its
finances. This relieved her of the necessity of ever having to issue a finding
that any particular inmate in the system was suffering from any specific
violation of his constitutional rights. Philadelphia's Mayor, Edward Rendell,
who is a former district attorney, has been battling for years to get Judge
Shapiro to relinquish her control. So far, she has resisted successfully.
<P>

     The main consequence of Judge Shapiro's intervention has
effectively been to decriminalize drug and property crime in Philadelphia.
Data compiled by the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and by two
independent researchers show that some 67 percent of all defendants
released because of the prison cap simply fail to appear in court. In just one
recent 18-month period in Philadelphia, 9,732 arrestees out on the streets
because of the prison cap were rearrested on new charges, including 79
murders, 90 rapes, 701 burglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,215 drug
offenses, and 2,748 thefts. Among those murdered by offenders released
because of the court's prison cap was Danny Boyle, a 30-year-old rookie
Philadelphia police officer.
<P>
     The prison cap has played havoc with the city's downtown
redevelopment efforts and forced local businesses to spend even more than
they have been spending on security. It also has turned Philadelphia into a
major drug smuggling port. One reason for this is that under the terms of
Judge Shapiro's orders, a drug criminal who possesses less than 50 grams
of heroin (street value $33,000), 50 grams of cocaine (street value $5,000),
or 50 pounds of marijuana (street value $225,000) goes free. Some 76
percent of drug defendants do not even bother to appear in court.
<P>
     In a statement issued on October 31, 1994, Judge Shapiro did what
some federal judges all around the country have been doing in such cases
for the last three decades: She rejected the public safety concerns of law-
abiding citizens. She dismissed empirical evidence on the effects of
crowding. And she ignored the relevant language of Section 3626 of the
1994 crime bill, which clearly mandates that consent decrees in such cases
be reopened forthwith.
<P>
<b>THE TEXAS CASE</b><P>
     The adverse public safety impact of rulings like Judge Shapiro's are
bad enough. But one also must be mindful of how unbridled federal court
intervention affects prison safety and prison budgets. A good illustration on
both counts is the Texas case of Ruiz v. Estelle. The case began in 1972 and
is still not completely resolved today. It was led throughout by Federal
Judge William Wayne Justice of the Eastern District Court.
<P>
     In a 248-page opinion issued in 1980, Judge Justice required scores
of changes in the Texas prison system. Among them: <ul>
<P><li>
 An end to the use of "building tenders" (inmates who served as prison
guards and often brutalized fellow prisoners); 
<P><li>
A complete revision in the inmate disciplinary process; 
<P><li>
A division of the prison population into management units of not more than
500 cells each; 
<P><li>
The delivery of state-of-the-art medical services to prisoners; 
<P><li>
A reduction in the number of prisoners in maximum-security blocks; 
<P><li>
The provision of a spacious single cell for each prisoner. 
<P></ul><p>
     Some of these orders were constitutionally required and highly
desirable (for example, the end of the corrupt building tender system). But
most of the orders had not a single constitutional, scientific, or moral
anchor. Nor did they acknowledge the fact that Texas prison officials had
already developed some outstanding programs for prisoners, including the
only fully accredited prison education system in the nation. Instead, the
micromanagement simply reflected Judge Justice's ideology and that of his
team of court monitors.
<P>
     In 1982 the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth District tried
to talk sense to Judge Justice, admonishing him that "the district court's
decree administers a massive dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a
lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice" to remedy conditions inside
Texas prisons. The Court of Appeals instructed him to "respect the right of
the state to administer its own affairs so long as it does not violate the
Constitution." Meanwhile, Texas prison officials continued to plead with
him to recognize that certain of his sweeping administrative requirements
would spawn short-term inmate violence and, in the decades to come, would
bankrupt the system if not the State of Texas itself.
<P>
     But Judge Justice turned a deaf ear to all such pleas. As a result, in
the mid-1980s Texas prisons experienced wholly unprecedented bouts of
murderous inmate-on-inmate violence. Between 1973 and 1980 there was a
total of 19 homicides in Texas prisons, and inmate-on-staff assaults were
exceedingly rare. But in 1983 and 1984, as the court's orders went into
effect, scores of prisoners were murdered, thousands were severely
assaulted, and rates of inmate-on-staff violence skyrocketed.
<P>
     So did costs. Prison operating expenses in Texas grew from $91
million in 1980 to $1.84 billion in 1994, a tenfold increase in real terms,
while the state's prison population barely doubled. In 1994 the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts issued a report which documented the fiscal
and administrative impact of the court's order on Texas prisons. The irony
of this report was that, after years of being battered by Judge Justice for
ostensibly failing to comply with his orders, Texas prison officials now were
being criticized for "overcompliance" with them. But the full and final
measure of responsibility for the human and financial toll of the court's
sweeping intervention must lie with the court itself.
<P>

<b>RESTRAINING JUDICIAL PANIC: THE JOB FOR CONGRESS</b><P>
     The history of judicial intervention into prisons and jails teaches that
it is not enough to raise public awareness or pass new laws. For
representative democracy to work on crime policy, and for Americans of
every race, creed, and color to be protected against the ravages of street
crime, more fundamental changes are needed.
<P>
     Whatever Congress does in revisiting the rest of the federal crime
bill of 1994, one of the most crucial steps must be to prohibit federal judges
from becoming de facto legislators and corrections czars. Section 3626 of
the 1994 federal crime bill was a step in the right direction, but only a tiny
step. The Congress should revisit this issue at once and take pains to ensure
that federal judges abide by federal laws governing the limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of confinement and related cases.
<P>
     The United States Constitution states in Article III, Section 2 that
"the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and
Fact, with such exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress
shall make" (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has declared over and
over again that federal courts must restrain themselves with respect to
conditions of confinement cases. To cite just a few key decisions, in Bell v.
Wolfish (1979), the Court declared that double-celling did not violate due
process. In Rhodes v. Chapman (1981), the Court held that double celling
was not cruel and unusual punishment. In Wilson v. Seiter (1991), the Court
ruled that constitutional violations had to be based on specific conditions
rather than "totality." And in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail (1992),
the Court endorsed flexible standards for modifying consent decrees in light
of changed circumstances.
<P>
     But within weeks of the passage of Section 3626 of the 1994 crime
bill, the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union
issued a memo, dated September 15, 1994, on how to "confront" the
provision. The memo mocked Congress for "taking a stand in favor of God,
motherhood, and locking up criminals" -- three values which, apparently, the
ACLU does not hold so dear. 
<P>
     Irresponsible federal judges, along with prisoners' rights lawyers and
anti-incarceration lobbyists, need to be reminded of the clear language of the
nation's governing political document with regard to the power of Congress
to set the appellate jurisdiction of the federal judiciary. Most Americans
want prisoners to have basic amenities (decent food, adequate medical care)
and services (educational opportunities, drug treatment). But they do not
want prisons to be virtual resorts, and they most certainly do not want
another generation's worth of violent and repeat criminals returned to the
streets because of some judge's political ideology, rejection of statistical
evidence, jurisprudential ignorance, or stubborn delusions about the
consequences of "crowding."
<P>
     To prevent judges from acting in this way, Congress needs to pass
legislation that unambiguously defines and further limits appropriate
remedies in prison and jail conditions cases. For unless and until the courts
are curbed, no mere changes in the law -- truth-in-sentencing reforms, three-
strikes mandates, new death penalty provisions -- will survive the judicial
gantlet that has effectively stymied every major democratically enacted anti-
crime measure of the last quarter-century.
<P>
     What if Congress acts to strengthen Section 3626 of the federal
crime bill but the lower federal courts do not abide by the additional
restrictions on prison remedies set by Congress? If that happens, then the
Congress, in the name of the people, should move at once to exercise its full
powers under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. The most
authoritative interpretation of that power is the plainest one. The late
Edward S. Corwin is widely considered this country's premier scholar of the
U.S. Constitution. As he wrote, "[T]he lower Federal courts derive all their
jurisdiction immediately from acts of Congress.... Also, all writs by which
jurisdiction is asserted or exercised are authorized by Congress.... The chief
external restraint upon judicial review arises from Congress's unlimited
control over the Court's appellate jurisdiction, as well as of the total
jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts."
<P>
     Congress should no longer abdicate its responsibility for the human
and financial harm done by activist federal judges. The place to begin is by
curbing federal judges who substitute the ACLU's prisoners' rights
manifesto for the Bill of Rights and impose prison caps and other orders
which permit violent and repeat criminals to rule the streets.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government can and should take appropriate 
action to protect public health. One way Congress can do this is by introducing AIDS 
testing for newborns, making the results known to mothers and their doctors. A House-
Senate conference on the Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) 
presents Members of Congress with an opportunity to introduce this change and so 
protect at-risk children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Testing mothers and their babies for AIDS and 
communicating the results to the mother and her attending physician is not routine. It is a 
major deviation from standard medical practice in the case of many other contagious 
diseases which may threaten the life or health of the newborn. Today, for example, most 
states require that newborn babies be tested for a variety of diseases, including syphilis, 
and that the results be communicated to the mother and her attending physician. The 
Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act, which is now in a House/Senate conference, could 
save the lives of hundreds of babies each year by requiring an AIDS test. It could also 
save the country hundreds of millions of dollars needed to treat children with AIDS 
whose condition could have been detected at birth and treated more effectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two sharply different policies are before the conference 
committee on the Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act. The first, supported by Senator 
Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), continues current policy by encouraging voluntary testing and 
mandating the counseling of all pregnant women in states designated as having the 
highest incidence of the HIV virus. The second, supported by Representatives Gary 
Ackerman (D-NY) and Tom Coburn (R-OK), requires that newborns whose mothers' 
AIDS status is unknown be tested as a condition for receiving funds under the Act. Thus, 
every child would have to be tested for HIV if the mother had not been tested, and the 
state would communicate the results to the mother and attending physician. The 
Ackerman-Coburn provision is not an unfunded mandate, however, since the money for 
testing would be included in the appropriated federal funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the Senate version values the "privacy" of the 
mother, the House version wisely values the lives of the babies while upholding 
confidentiality -- which already is standard medical practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Ackerman-Coburn policy would result in saved 
lives and reduced costs. Medical researchers say that AZT treatment of a mother with 
AIDS during pregnancy and labor, and of the baby for a period after birth, reduces the 
incidence of AIDS in these babies by about 65 percent. Today, about 25 percent of babies 
born to such mothers eventually succumb to full-blown HIV infection and die in their 
early years. With AZT treatment, this death rate is reduced to about 8 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such a policy saves many lives while also cutting the 
cost of treatment. Treating HIV-infected (and dying) babies costs about $240 million 
annually. Treating at-risk babies in the womb and immediately after birth with AZT 
would cost about $12 million, leaving more money for research, better public health, and 
other essential purposes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today's voluntary testing policy simply means that some 
mothers, however unwittingly, may be endangering their babies' lives. Many babies 
infected with the HIV virus, for example, go home with their mothers not knowing they 
are infected. Worse, uninfected babies born to mothers ignorant of their own infection can 
contract the disease from their mothers' milk. Furthermore, immunizing a baby with the 
AIDS virus against various diseases in the standard fashion can weaken rather than 
strengthen the child's health. Any such child who gets an infection as a byproduct of the 
immunization is at much greater risk of a serious breakdown in health than is a normal 
baby. For all of these children, the knowledge that they are HIV positive would alter the 
course of medical treatment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because of the continuing social stigma attached to 
AIDS, many policymakers oppose mandatory reporting of the infection to public health 
authorities, as well as any requirement that either the carrier of the disease or others who 
may have been infected by the carrier be identified. But this ignores the public health 
aspects of this contagious disease. Moreover, whatever case might be made for 
maintaining today's policy for adults, it does not exist for newborns. According to the 
only survey of pregnant mothers on this subject, conducted by New York City's Bellevue 
Hospital, no mother reported that she would avoid prenatal care if there was mandatory 
testing. The frustration for doctors is that 25 percent of mothers at risk for AIDS do not 
avail themselves of voluntary testing. Since 1988, in New York State alone, an estimated 
12,000 babies have not been treated properly because of a lack of mandatory testing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Approximately 7,000 mothers who are HIV positive, and 
will eventually succumb to AIDS, give birth each year. Of these births, approximately 
1,800 babies (25 percent) will be born with HIV antibodies present in their system. A 
further 14 percent of those born uninfected to these mothers will become HIV positive 
from their mothers' milk. Over 50 percent of the babies with HIV antibodies (around 900 
annually) are not known by their physician or mother to be infected at birth. Of these, 
about 25 percent (approximately 200) die annually. With proper medical treatment, this 
number can be reduced to about 8 percent, or around 70 deaths per year. Under current 
policy, however, the number of undiagnosed, untreated, needlessly dying babies will 
continue to grow as AIDS continues to spread.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many public officials and health professionals want a 
change in policy. For example, the Centers for Disease Control's own subcommittee on 
infant testing (a subcommittee of the review committee on prenatal testing and 
counseling guidelines), recommended the approach taken by Representatives Ackerman 
and Coburn. New York Governor George Pataki calls the Senate version "unfortunate" 
and strongly supports the Ackerman-Coburn policy. New York has the largest number of 
AIDS-infected babies in the country. And Dr. James Coplan, a member of the 
Department of Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the State University of New 
York Health Sciences Center at Syracuse, says that "As AIDS spreads to [suburban 
populations] HIV infections in pregnant women or newborn infants is likely to become 
progressively harder to detect, unless universal screening is adopted."<sup>1 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Ryan White Care Reauthorization Act presents 
Members of Congress with a clear choice. They can support a new policy grounded in 
standard medical practice and save hundreds of babies' lives. Or they can continue a 
policy that leads to unnecessary deaths of newborn babies exposed to AIDS.

<h3> CHOICE IN EDUCATION: PART II - 
LEGAL PERILS AND LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES </h3>

Backgrounder No. 809<br>
February 18, 1991<br>

<P> 


   Americans increasingly are turning to reforms based on
parental choice of schools as the best solution to America's education
crisis. (The choice options available and efforts across the nation to
promote education choice are discussed in Choice in Education:  Part
I -- How Choice Works, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  760,
March 21, 1990.  (Also available in Spanish as "Manual Sobre la
Libertad de Elegir Escuela, Parte I:  Como Funciona la Opci>n",
Translation No.  37, October 10, 1990.) Since Part I was released,
significant developments include the nation's first private school
"voucher" law in Wisconsin and an Oregon initiative that would have
provided state income tax credits for students who opt out of public
schools.) 
<P>	In New York City's East Harlem, for example, granting
parents a choice of public schools has boosted that district's student
achievement from last to sixteenth among the city's 32 school districts. 
Wisconsin last year enacted legislation allowing 1,000 low-income
Milwaukee youngsters to use state education funds for tuition in
private schools.  The tiny New Hampshire town of Epsom took a
giant step for choice by adopting the nation's first property tax
abatement to encourage parents to pursue education alternatives
outside public schools.  And in Chicago, 27 low-income parents and
children filed a lawsuit demanding the opportunity to opt out of
abysmal public schools.
<P>
		While political support has been growing for
educational choice, a number of legal questions concerning choice
remain as serious impediments.  Most recently, a Wisconsin court of
appeals struck down that state's choice program on a procedural
technicality, although the program is continuing pending appeal to the
Wisconsin Supreme Court.
<P>
		Two clear lessons emerge from the litigation against
choice programs: <P>
 1) That any ambitious education choice program that includes
private schools will be challenged vigorously in the courts by the
public school administrators and teacher organizations who feel most
threatened by competition from the private sector; and
<P>
2) That choice programs that are carefully crafted and aggressively
defended stand a good chance of surviving such legal challenges.
   Advocates of choice in education thus should recognize that a
sound legal framework and strategy are essential to success.  In
designing education choice programs, therefore, policy makers should
study the record of federal and state court challenges to choice and
ensure their proposals satisfy several essential criteria.  Among them:
The program should not discriminate in favor of religiously affiliated
schools;
<P>
The program should place the decision of where funds are used in the
hands of individual students and parents; and
<P>
The program should not create a permanent and pervasive state
influence in religiously affiliated schools.
Litigation may be a major weapon in the anti-choice arsenal, but it
can be neutralized by a thorough understanding of the law by
advocates of choice.  Indeed, the legal weapon even can be used to
choice's advantage.

<P>
THE POTENTIAL LEGAL HURDLES FACING CHOICE PLANS 
<P>
   The principal potential legal obstacles to education choice are
federal anti-discrimination requirements and the "establishment"
clause of the First Amendment.  In addition, state constitutions and
statutes may present problems that prompt legal challenges to choice
programs.
<P>
		These potential obstacles do not mean, of course, that
education choice proposals are unlawful.  On the contrary, most
choice programs, regardless of how broad they are, can pass legal
muster if they are carefully crafted.  What choice proponents need to
do to achieve success is to give very thorough consideration to legal
ramifications in designing their programs.  This requires no sacrifice
of basic policy objectives.  Since choice necessarily expands
educational opportunities and parental control, which are values
deeply embedded in America's constitutional tradition, any legal
challenge will at worst present no more than a conflict between
competing constitutional values, from which a well-designed choice
program should emerge intact.

<P>
1) Discrimination
<P>
   Critics of education choice often contend that it will promote
segregation.  This claim draws upon the history of schemes in the
1960s that were devised to evade the requirement to desegregate
public schools.  Such schemes led the Supreme Court to rule in 1968
that "freedom of choice" plans could present constitutional difficulties
if they were designed to perpetuate discrimination. (Green v.  County
School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S.  430 (1968).)
<P>		Today's choice proposals, of course, have no such
discriminatory intent.  Their objective is not to avoid integration, but
to expand educational opportunities.  Indeed, one argument raised by
opponents of the Oregon ballot initiative that was defeated at the
polls last November and would have allowed both public and private
school choice was that it would have allowed black youngsters to
attend white schools in the suburbs.  Choice programs, in fact, are
likely to be of most benefit to economically disadvantaged youngsters
in the inner city, who are predominantly from minority ethnic groups. 
Private schools in the inner city, moreover, are often more racially
diverse than public schools. (See, e.g., Clint Bolick, Changing Course: 
Civil Rights at the Crossroads (New Brunswick, N.J.:  Transaction
Books, 1988), p.  108.)
<P>
		Nonetheless, choice programs must comport with the
applicable state and federal nondiscrimination requirements.  Federal
law, for instance, prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or
handicap in any programs or activities receiving federal assistance.  In
the 1984 Grove City  case, the Supreme Court ruled that even federal
scholarship aid funnelled directly to students exposes private schools
to regulatory coverage. (Grove City College v.  Bell, 465 U.S.  555
(1984).)  Under such circumstances, federal law now provides that the
entire educational institution -- and not just the portion of the
program receiving federal aid -- is subject to federal regulation.
<P>
		The precise scope of federal nondiscrimination
regulations has never been fully defined, however, in the context of
federal or state funding of non-public education through tuition
reimbursement (vouchers) or tax credits.  The threshold requirement
that triggers these regulations is that the schools are "recipients" of
federal funding, a rather vague term that usually is broadly construed. 
In practice, the likelihood of federal regulatory coverage depends on
whether federal funds are included in the choice program.  It might
also depend on whether the program involves direct payments to the
schools, or vouchers (which normally would trigger regulation), or
indirect aid in the form of reduced tax liability to parents (which may
not). 
<P>
		 A recent opinion letter by the U.  S.  Department of
Education, (Letter to Governor Tommy G.  Thompson from Assistant
Secretaries of Education Robert R.  Davila and Michael Williams
(undated).) confirms that to the extent private schools in choice
programs are deemed recipients of federal funds, some regulations
would apply. (The regulations in some instances apply special,
less-onerous provisions to private schools.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R.  104.39
(rules for private school regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of
handicap).)  These regulations consist typically of general
nondiscrimination requirements, which most private schools easily
satisfy.  The letter concludes, however, that more onerous statutes
would not apply to choice programs, such as the Education of the
Handicapped Act (EHA), (20 U.S.C.  1400, et seq.) a federal grant
program that obligates states to provide extensive special services and
programs to severely handicapped children.
<P>
		States may also have nondiscriminatory requirements
that apply to recipients of public funds.  Any program that provides
for direct payment of state funds to private schools would likely
trigger such requirements.
<P>
		The Lessons. Because of the uncertainty concerning the
applicability of federal anti-discrimination requirements, lawmakers
would be wise to make sure that the statutory language creating a
choice program involving the payment of public funds to private
schools should be accompanied by a general requirement of
nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or handicap.  Although
the precise parameters of such obligations will have to await future
court decisions, the inclusion of a general non-discrimination mandate
will increase the odds of a successful defense of choice plans.
<P>
2) Desegregation
<P>
   A related issue is desegregation.  By allowing parents to
choose the best schools for their children regardless of racial
composition, the effect of education choice on efforts to attain racial
balance is uncertain.  This leads some critics to argue that choice is
discriminatory. 
<P>
		 The opposite is true.  Choice can provide the financial
means to afford equal educational opportunities to all of America's
children. (See, e.g., Bolick, Changing Course, p.  104-112.)  In
particular, choice plans targeted to inner-city low-income youngsters
can provide educational benefits that decades of forced busing have
failed to produce.
<P>
	    The issue of desegregation may arise in many statewide
choice plans since a number of ongoing court orders involving
desegregation remain in effect.  But the Supreme Court's decision last
month in the Oklahoma City busing case suggests that school districts
have wide latitude to adopt programs that are in the educational
interest of their school children, even if it means less racial balance.
(Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools vs.  Dowell,
No.  89-1080 (Jan 15, 1991).)  Meanwhile, in jurisdictions in which no
desegregation orders are in effect, plaintiffs challenging a choice law
must prove it was adopted with discriminatory intent.  This is a very
difficult standard to meet. (Washington v.  Davis, 426 U.S.  229
(1976).  This standard does not apply if the state itself is obligated
under a desegregation order.)
<P>
		The Lessons.  To reduce the probability of challenge,
choice plans should be designed to ensure that they provide equal
opportunity.  A requirement of nondiscrimination should accompany
programs in which direct payments are made to private schools.  In
tuition tax credit programs, provisions should be included to allow
low-income families to participate.  Though such provisions are not
legally mandatory, they will help defuse arguments that the program
is designed to benefit only those who can already afford private
schools.
<P>
		Most choice programs will help most significantly those
who now lack choice -- mainly low-income families whose children
attend the worst schools.  Against this real-world backdrop, claims of
discrimination mounted by the public education establishment and its
allies are likely to ring hollow in courtrooms.

<P>
3) The Religion Conundrum 
<P>
   When an education choice program extends to religiously
affiliated schools, opponents will raise objections ostensibly based on
the "establishment" clause of the First Amendment.  Most well-crafted
education choice programs, however, should survive this legal thicket. 
But the journey through the thicket can be challenging.
<P>
		Although the First Amendment's language is simple --
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"
-- its application is extremely complex.  A common sense
interpretation of the clause would not suggest any difficulty.  Aid to
parents who wish to send their children to religiously affiliated
schools does not "establish" religion.  Yet this is not the way in which
the clause is applied by courts.
<P>
		The U.S.  Supreme Court's decisions regarding the
clause are confusing and contradictory since the Court for years has
been divided bitterly over establishment clause issues.  In 1989, for
instance, the Court decided that a religious creche inside a county
courthouse violates the clause while a Chanukah menorah displayed
with a Christmas tree outside a government office building does not;
this decision, moreover, elicited five different opinions from the nine
justices. (County of Allegheny v.  ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,
109 S.Ct.  3086 (1989).)  Prospects for successful defense of education
choice programs before the Supreme Court have increased with the
resignation of Justice William Brennan, who was the Court's strongest
critic of the use of public funds in religiously affiliated schools. 
Although the outcome of any particular case is by no means certain,
the Court's new composition and its relevant precedents suggest that
bona fide education choice programs will withstand constitutional
scrutiny even if they involve sectarian schools.
<P>
		The Supreme Court has constructed three tests for
"establishment clause" cases, under which the challenged legislation
must satisfy each.  The legislation:<P>
1) Must serve a secular legislative purpose;
<P>
2) In its "primary effect" must neither advance nor inhibit religion;
and
<P>
3) Must not foster an "excessive entanglement" between government
and religion. (Lemon v.  Kurtzman, 403 U.S.  602, 612-613 (1971).)
   The first part of this test is easily satisfied in education cases
by the state's interest in a well-educated citizenry. (See, e.g., Mueller
v.  Allen, 463 U.S.  388, 395 (1983).)  The second and third tests,
however, often collide in what Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist describes as a "'Catch-22' of [the Court's] own creation,... 
whereby aid [to sectarian schools] must be supervised to ensure no
entanglement but the supervision itself is held to be an
entanglement," a result "far afield from the concerns which prompted
adoption of the First Amendment." (Aguilar v.  Felton, 473 U.S.  402,
420-421 (1985)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).)
<P>
		Cases involving aid to religiously affiliated schools or to
parents who patronize them have run an erratic course.  The Court,
for example, upheld a program that reimbursed parents for school
transportation expenses, including those incurred in connection with
sectarian schools, (Everson v.  Board of Education, 330 U.S.  1
(1947).) but it struck down policies reimbursing nonpublic schools for
the costs of teacher salaries, textbooks, instructional materials, and
teacher-prepared examinations. (Lemon v.  Kurtzman, op.  cit.; Levitt
v.  Committee for Public Education, 413 U.S.  472 (1973).)  Similarly,
it invalidated a direct loan of instructional materials to nonpublic
schools, while upholding textbook loans to individual students. (Meek
v.  Pittenger, 421 U.S.  349 (1975); Wolman v.  Walter, 433 U.S.  229
(1977).)
<P>
  	  The dividing lines in the Supreme Court are best seen
in three cases.  In the first of these, the 1983 Mueller v.  Allen
decision, the Court upheld by a five to four vote a Minnesota tax
deduction program that provides state income tax benefits for various
educational expenses incurred in public or private schools, including
tuition in religiously affiliated schools.  The majority found it relevant
that the credit was only one facet of the state's overall program to
achieve an equitable distribution of the tax burden; that the credit
was available to defray expenses in all schools, public or private; and
that the only contact the state had with religious schools was to
ensure that textbooks for which credits were claimed did not advance
religious doctrine.  The Court emphasized that the program did not
impermissibly advance religion because "aid to parochial schools is
available only as a result of decisions by individual parents." (Mueller
v.  Allen, op.  cit., p.  399.)
<P>
		The second decision was handed down two years later,
in Aguilar v.  Felton.  The Court struck down on a five to four vote
the use by New York City of federal remedial education funds to pay
public school employees to teach educationally deprived low-income
students on-site in the parochial schools the children attended.  The
Court held the First Amendment was violated since public aid was
funneled into a "pervasively sectarian environment," which required a
"permanent and pervasive state influence" to protect against the use
of public funds for religious indoctrination.
<P>
		The third significant decision was the 1986 Witters v. 
Department of Services for the Blind, (474 U.S.  481 (1986).) in
which the Court ruled unanimously that public funds for the
vocational training of the blind could be used at a Bible college for
ministry training.  The Court found several aspects of the program
relevant to its holding.  The use of funds depended on the decisions
of individual students.  The funds were available for public or private
schools.  The program created no financial incentive to attend
parochial schools.  And there was no evidence that a substantial
portion of the funds would flow to religious education.  The decision
in Witters suggests that in future the Court will not subject voucher-
type arrangements (as in Witters) to more stringent scrutiny than tax
deductions (as in Mueller) as long as the use of funds depends on the
independent decisions of parents or students.
<P>
		A separate opinion in Witters by former Justice Lewis
Powell, which may now represent the majority opinion of the Court,
declared that "state programs that are wholly neutral in offering
educational assistance to a class defined without reference to religion
do not violate the second part of the Lemon v.  Kurtzman test."
(Ibid., p.  490-491 (Powell, J., concurring).)  If this standard were
adopted in a majority opinion of the Court, it would sustain all bona
fide education choice programs that do not discriminate in favor of
religiously affiliated schools and which do not create excessive
entanglement between the state and such schools.  In this area as
well, state constitutions may contain provisions that extend beyond
the restrictions of the First Amendment, and choice proposals should
take these into account.
<P>
		The Lessons.  The Supreme Court's record on choice
cases suggests three principles to guide policy makers in crafting
education choice programs:<P>
1) The program should not discriminate in favor of religiously
affiliated schools;
<P>
2) The program should place the decision of where the funds are
used in the hands of individual students and parents; and
<P>
3) The program should not create a permanent and pervasive state
influence in religiously affiliated schools.<P>
   If an education choice program satisfies each of these three
criteria, it likely will survive a challenge under the U.S.  Constitution. 
In this area as well, state constitutions may contain provisions that
extend beyond the restrictions of the First Amendment, and choice
proposals should take these into account. 
<P>
		 While there can be no guarantees with respect to these
legal issues -- except that any meaningful education choice program
will have to endure a lengthy legal battle -- the odds appear to favor
a triumph for well-crafted, well-defended programs designed to
expand choice in education.
<P>
CONCLUSION:  PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS
<P>
   The prognosis for choice in education is good precisely
because the monopoly public school system is so bad.  Americans
increasingly recognize that it is impossible to progress and prosper as
a nation as long as children are consigned to a defective public school
monopoly.  This understanding is gaining adherents where it counts
the most:  in the statehouses, in the business community, and
especially among parents. (See John E.  Chubb and Terry M.  Moe,
Politics, Markets and America's Schools (Washington, D.C.:  The
Brookings Institution, 1990).)
<P>
		Support is growing, particularly among low-income
people of all races, for whom alternatives to public schools could be
the difference between a life of poverty or a chance for success.  As a
result, parental choice is a key facet in the movement toward
"empowerment" -- policies designed to remove arbitrary barriers to
opportunity and thereby to provide low-income Americans greater
control over their own destinies.
<P>
		The anti-choice forces are determined and powerful. 
They resist choice at every possible opportunity:  in the policy arena,
in the legislature, at the ballot box, and in the courtroom.  But as the
benefits of choice grow more apparent and the need grows more
urgent, the anti-choice forces will encounter far more battles than
ever before.
<P>
		In the fight for parental choice, litigation is both an
obstacle and a potential weapon.  Those who support expanded
educational opportunities through choice should not shy from
courtroom battle, but instead should approach the task intelligently
and with commitment.  The results will be worth the effort.
Appendix Current  and  Recent  Cases  Involving  School  Choice

<P>

1) The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
<P>
   Proponents of education choice can draw some important
lessons from the litigation surrounding this program, which was
enacted by the Wisconsin legislature in spring 1990. (The author
represents low-income parents and private schools who are
participating in the program in defending the program against legal
challenge.)
<P>
		The program provides approximately $2,500 to private,
nonsectarian schools, to reimburse tuition costs for up to 1,000 low-
income children in Milwaukee.  Participating schools must comply
with health and safety codes and nondiscrimination requirements, and
must satisfy at least one of four performance standards (such as
parental participation and student achievement).  The schools may
accept up to 49 percent of their students from those participating in
the choice program, who are admitted on a random basis.  The
schools must provide certain financial and performance data.  The
program is the first choice program in the nation to pay full costs of
education in private schools.
<P>
		The public education establishment opened a two-front
attack against the choice program.  The teachers' unions, joined by
the Milwaukee chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, (The black community in
Milwaukee, including all state legislators, the community newspapers,
and the overwhelming majority of citizens, strongly supports the
choice program.  See, for example, Mikel Holt, "Civil Rights Center
Enters Parental Choice Suit," Milwaukee Community Journal June 6,
1990, p.1.) filed a lawsuit challenging the program as unconstitutional
under Wisconsin law. (The Wisconsin chapter of the National
Education Association claims the program is unconstitutional since it
is insufficiently regulated, it does not obligate the private schools to
the requirements applicable to public schools, and it was passed as
part of the budget bill.  No federal constitutional claims were raised
since the program does not include religiously affiliated schools.) 
Meanwhile, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Herbert
Grover attempted to impose a wide array of regulations on the
private schools, including special education requirements of the
Education for the Handicapped Act, all federal constitutional rights
of students, and all standards applicable to public schools (such as
teacher certification and special programs).  Such bureaucratic
mandates could have bankrupted the private schools, and at the very
least would have transformed them into institutions differing only in
name from public schools.
<P>
		To salvage the choice program, the parents and schools
moved to intervene as defendants in the teachers' union lawsuit, and
filed their own lawsuit challenging the superintendent's regulations. 
One complication for the parents was that the state attorney general
was hampered in his ability to defend the statute, both because he
also had to defend the superintendent's regulations and because the
superintendent publicly (and in court) opposed the choice plan. 
<P>
		 Eventually, the lawsuits were consolidated, and the
state circuit court in Madison ruled in favor of the parents on all
issues.  In November, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled the
program unconstitutional on a procedural technicality:  the law was
enacted as part of a budget bill rather than a free-standing bill.  The
case is on appeal to the State Supreme Court.  Meantime, the choice
program is operational, providing high-quality educational
opportunities to several hundred economically disadvantaged children.
<P>
The Wisconsin experience makes clear that the battle
for choice programs will not be easy.  The education establishment
will devote enormous resources to challenge choice programs in
court, often on technicalities.  But the fight also suggests that parents
are in the best position to resist such efforts as full participants in the
courtroom.

<P>
2) Kansas City
<P>
   Creative advocates may find that education choice is not so
much a legal problem as a legal solution.  In a variety of contexts --
from desegregation to unequal educational funding to unsafe schools
to infringement of religious liberty -- allowing students to opt out of
public schools and take their share of educational tax dollars with
them can provide a workable remedy for a wide range of legal
problems facing the public schools.
<P>
		One such effort is taking place in Kansas City, where a
federal court over the past several years has invoked a variety of
costly and coercive measures in an unsuccessful effort to achieve
racial balance among students.  A group of students responded by
filing a suit in 1989 demanding the opportunity to use their tax dollars
in well-integrated private schools. (See Patricia King, "When
Desegregation Backfires," Newsweek, July 31, 1989, p.  56.)  If the
case succeeds, it could provide the first voucher remedy in a school
desegregation context -- and thereby help students attain the equal
educational opportunities that decades of failed busing have not
achieved.

<P>
3) Chicago
<P>
   In Illinois, 27 low-income parents and children, along with the
education reform coalition TEACH America (a division of the City
Club of Chicago), filed papers in Cook County Circuit Court last
December demanding the right to use their share of state education
tax dollars in private schools. (See Amy Stuart Wells, "Chicago
Parent's Suit Adds New Twists to Voucher Issue," New York Times,
December 19, 1990.)
<P>
		The voucher proponents are attempting to join a suit
filed the previous month by 47 Illinois school districts, who are
challenging the state's system of education financing and seeking
massive tax increases.  This lawsuit is the latest in a long line of "tax
equity" lawsuits that have led to increased funding but few
educational benefits.  Recent tax equity lawsuits were successful in
New Jersey, Texas, and Kentucky. ("Rich Schools, Poor Schools,"
Washington Post, October 14, 1898, p.  A22.)
<P>
		Both the school districts and the parents argue that the
state is failing to ensure an "efficient" and "high-quality" system of
education as guaranteed by the Illinois Constitution.  But the
remedies sought -- more funding versus parental choice -- pit against
one another two dramatically different visions for the future of
education.

<P>
4) Tennessee
<P>
   Another potentially fruitful prospect for voucher remedies is in
the area of religious liberty.  In Mozert v.  Hawkins County Public
Schools, (647 F.  Supp.  1194 (E.D.  Tenn.  1986) and slip opinion
(E.D.  Tenn.  Dec.  18, 1986), reversed, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 
1987), cert.  denied, 108 U.S.  1029 (1988).) a group of parents in
Tennessee challenged the selection of textbooks by the county school
board as an infringement of their religious beliefs.  But rather than
seeking to ban or replace the books, the parents sought to opt out of
the public schools and to take their tax dollars with them.  In a
landmark ruling, the trial court agreed.  Although the court of
appeals overturned the ruling on other grounds, vouchers may provide
a workable remedy in similar cases.
<P>

5) Possible Future Suits
<P>
	  Lawsuits involving issues of choice are likely to proliferate. 
The recently passed tax abatement ordinance in Epsom, New
Hampshire, is subject to likely legal challenge. (See, e.g., Fox
Butterfield, "Tax Rebate in New Hampshire Town Poses Test For
School Choice Issue," New York Times, January,  1991, p.  B6.) 
Meanwhile, choice advocates are likely to find more opportunities to
seek voucher remedies in litigation.  Far from judicial "activism," as
some conservative attorneys wrongly suppose, vouchers are nothing
more than money damages for failure to provide a service -- the most
commonplace judicial remedy.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Congress is on the brink of enacting the most sweeping reform of the Medicare program since the program's inception. If enacted, the reform will take the first giant step toward a system that offers real choices to the elderly and, by slowing the rapid growth in costs, helps ensure that today's working Americans will have a health care program available to them when they retire.
<p>
The next action Congress must take to achieve this goal is to reconcile House and Senate versions of Medicare reform legislation. Certain key provisions in the bills passed by each chamber must be in the final conference package, and Members must focus on these. They must also bear in mind that failure to enact Medicare reforms will cause the whole tax and budget package to unravel. 
<p>
House and Senate Members realize that failure to reform Medicare necessarily means the current program cannot be sustained financially, meaning huge future tax increases on America's working families1 or deep cuts in future Medicare benefits for the elderly. Even the proposed reforms are only a stop-gap measure to ward off fiscal disaster when the "Baby Boom" generation qualifies for Medicare. The Democratic alternative would keep the hospital trust fund solvent until about 2006, just before the Baby Boomers begin to join the program. Even the Republican plan assures solvency of the Medicare hospitalization trust fund only until the year 2010. Failure to enact serious reforms now will just make that future task even more daunting.
<p>
Medicare is plagued by structural problems and exploding costs, according to the program's own Board of Trustees.2  There is a surprising consensus on how to deal with those structural problems.3<p>The legislation being considered by the House and Senate indicates that Congress is prepared to begin making those fundamental changes. The differing House and Senate Medicare proposals have been folded into their respective balanced budget reconciliation bills, H.R. 2491 and S. 1357. The key structural change in the House version is to create a new MedicarePlus Program, patterned after the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has served Members of Congress and other federal employees and retirees for over 30 years. Under this arrangement, seniors could opt to use the value of their Medicare benefits as a payment toward a private health plan within a competitive market. Within this framework, seniors could pick plans offered in various ways, including plans offered through elderly organizations and physician- or hospital-organized plans (which would mean real competition to managed care plans). These plans also could include high-deductible insurance combined with Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). The Senate's Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act proposal also offers seniors an alternative to traditional Medicare by creating a Medicare Choice Program that is also patterned after the FEHBP.4  The FEHBP, which provides a wide-ranging list of competing health plans with varying benefit levels and prices, has held down premiums through the free-market forces of consumer choice and competition.5<p>While the legislation in both chambers makes significant improvements in the Medicare program, certain provisions, if not modified, could lead to unintended harmful consequences for the health care market and the elderly. Even more important, certain provisions are entirely counterproductive and contradict the leadership's stated goal of creating a consumer-driven market in Medicare.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>
<p>
<li> The government would standardize benefits packages in private Medicare plans;
<p>
<li> Price controls would be maintained in the traditional Medicare program according to the House bill;
<p>
<li> There would be premium caps on private-sector health plans in the House bill;
<p>
<li> Medical Savings Accounts have been removed as an option in the Senate Medicare Choice plan under the so-called Byrd Rule;
<p>
<li> The bills still do not allow private contracting arrangements between provider and patient;
<p>
<li> The House bill fails to permit union-sponsored plans as an option; and
<p>
<li> The bills do not create a balanced playing field in the clinical laboratory industry; they fail to link direct billing to the fail-safe budget mechanism.
<p></ul>
If lawmakers do not come to terms with these and other issues, the legislation will not fully deal with the structural problems of today's Medicare program.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS DO </b>
<p>
<b>1. Both bills establish consumer choice of health plans.</b>
<p>
Both bills seek to redress the absence of a health care market by expanding the choice of plans and benefits available to the elderly and disabled, using the value of their Medicare benefits as a contribution to the cost of their chosen plan. The elderly would be able to choose the package of benefits, beyond the current Medicare package, that they felt best met their needs. Enrollees would be able to choose traditional Medicare with certain changes (the non-MedicarePlus option) or a private plan as defined in the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice Programs. The proposals thus expand the opportunities for individual choice of plans. To protect seniors from fraudulent sellers and ensure that confused seniors receive information with which to make a wise choice, the bills require private plans to meet certain minimum consumer protection requirements in order to qualify as MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice organizations.
<p>
The House Bill<br>
A MedicarePlus product could be a physician-sponsored organization, a high-deductible policy combined with a Medical Savings Account, a private fee-for-service plan, a Taft-Hartley plan, or a plan offered through a church or other association. During an annual enrollment period, seniors would be able to enroll in a MedicarePlus health plan in their geographic area by filing a form indicating their preference. To ensure that seniors are making an informed choice, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to provide information to future and current Medicare beneficiaries as to the coverage options available. 
<p>
Notably absent from the eligible organizations in MedicarePlus are health plans sponsored by unions. While the original bill included unions as eligible sponsors of MedicarePlus plans, the substitute offered by Representatives William Archer (R-TX) and Thomas Bliley (R-VA) in their respective committees eliminated such opportunities.
<p>
The Senate Bill<br>
In contrast, the Senate provision allows for union sponsorship of Medicare Choice plans and thus would provide even more choices to the elderly. The Senate bill allows unions to sponsor health plans for its members and their spouses. While this is an improvement over the House version, union plans should be allowed to market their health plans to seniors who are not affiliated with the unions, but who register as associate members. This would place unions on a par with other associations under the legislation. In the FEHBP, individuals who are not affiliated with one of the federal employees' unions can join as an associate member for a nominal membership fee and avail themselves and their spouses of the program's health coverage. By not allowing the unions to sell MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans to the general senior population, the House and Senate plans restrict the market and the range of choices that could be available. One of the unintended effects of the bill as currently written would be to encourage many Americans to become full members of a union to gain access to union health coverage during retirement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should expand the options available to senior citizens to include union-sponsored plans. Any restriction on the supply of providers is a restriction on the free market and incompatible with personal consumer choice. 
<p>
<b>2. Both bills provide peace of mind to seniors by eliminating concerns about     pre-existing medical conditions.</b>
<p>
One of the conditions a plan or entity must satisfy to be certified as a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice organization is to accept any individual electing to enroll regardless of health status.6  This protection is needed for current and future Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from a pre-existing condition. Individuals who incur a serious illness after enrolling in a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan could not be excluded from coverage in the future. Both bills guarantee the issuance and renewal of MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice policies to all future and current beneficiaries. Certain exceptions apply for Taft-Hartley organizations in which eligibility to enroll is restricted to members through an employment relationship, or to the spouses of such members.
<p>
<b>3. Both bills impose a government-standardized benefits package. </b>
<p>
MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice must guarantee that any package of health benefits it sells includes, at a minimum, the benefits and services currently available under traditional Medicare Parts A and B. While this is viewed by many in Congress and elsewhere as a guarantee that beneficiaries will not be "shortchanged" should they opt into the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice programs, it undermines the principle of consumer choice. One of the many problems with a comprehensive minimum package is that the package is a political product, not a response to consumer demand. For example, the current Medicare program does not cover outpatient prescription drugs or long-term care, even though these are crucial to a growing number of elderly people. Yet, on the other hand, it includes:
<p><ul>
<li> Major hospital inpatient services,
<p>
<li> Surgical-medical benefits,
<p>
<li> Mental care,
<p>
<li> Outpatient care, and
<p>
<li> Limited home health and hospice care.
</ul><p>
Needless to say, federal workers and retirees have access to plans including drug benefits, long-term care coverage, and other benefits not available under Medicare. This happens because there is a consumer demand for these benefits, not because politicians support them. In the FEHBP, there is no comprehensive standardization of benefits. 
<p>
A related problem is that specifying a minimum package of benefits undermines the cost control objective of the reform proposal. If a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan were to offer such additional benefits, they could not be substituted for other benefits to keep the price down. Thus, beneficiaries normally would face higher premiums to get the benefits they really want. Furthermore, with the adoption of a standardized benefits package, Congress invites provider group pressures in future benefit setting. It can be expected that special interests will lobby Congress continually for additional mandated benefits and services, just as they do at the state level, where mandated benefits laws have driven up health care costs, and as they have throughout the history of Medicare. Members should recall their unpleasant experience with such lobbying practices the last time Congress reformed Medicare, during the adoption and later repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988.7  As additional benefits and services were added to the original catastrophic package, the associated costs increased and required greater payments from beneficiaries. This is an inherently bad idea. <p><b>What Congress Should Do: </b><p>Instead of adopting a rigid framework, Congress should adopt the model of the FEHBP in which federal employees and retirees have access to a wide spectrum of benefits from health plans that are required only to offer catastrophic protection and meet certain solvency requirements and consumer protection standards.8  Seniors would be given real choices in deciding which optional benefits were necessary or desirable. Like federal employees, the plans would have to protect seniors against the cost of catastrophic accidents or illnesses, but otherwise could offer a range of benefits.<p><b>4. Both bills establish a defined contribution for Medicare beneficiaries. </b>
<p>
One of the key elements of reform, widely agreed upon by proponents of change in Medicare, is the defined contribution model. Regardless of the personal choice of a plan or option, Medicare benefits would be defined as a dollar amount, as opposed to today's open-ended entitlement to specified services. Both bills take the appropriate steps in determining how much of the federal budget will be allocated to the Medicare and MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice programs.
<p>
Under both bills the federal government would make monthly premium payments to the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan chosen by the beneficiary. The payments reflect a refinement of the current Medicare risk contract, which reimburses HMOs that provide Medicare services for a single monthly capitated rate per beneficiary.9  As opposed to the current government-regulated "fee for service" reimbursement system, which provides an open-ended subsidy, MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice would provide a defined contribution toward the purchase of a private plan in the beneficiary's geographic area. The contributions would vary among beneficiaries, depending on their age, gender, geographic area, welfare status, and other factors, to reflect the relative actuarial value of the benefits. To ensure stability in payments to MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans, the federal government's contribution levels would be adjusted to recognize legitimate variations in costs of doing business in different geographic locations. In general, contribution levels in rural and low service utilization markets would increase at a faster rate than those in high service utilization areas. The federal government's contribution level would be kept within the budget targets as outlined in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995.
<p>
To realize budget neutrality, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to compute per capita growth rates for a year so that the weighted average per capita growth rate for all areas in the country is equal to the national average per capita growth rate:
<p>
<b>1996</b><br>
House10 -- 5.3% 
<p>
Senate11 -- 8.7%
<p>
<b>1997</b><br>

House -- 3.8%
<p>
Senate -- 6.8%
<p>
<b>1998</b><br>		

House  -- 4.6%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.3%
<p>
<b>1999</b><br>		

House -- 4.3%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.3%
<p>
<b>2000</b>		
<br>
House -- 3.8%
<p>
Senate --  6.8%
<p>
<b>2001</b><br>	

House -- 5.5%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.9%
<p>
<b>2002</b><br>

House -- 5.6%
<p>
Senate -- 7.0%
<p>
Note:  The Senate bill includes no details on subsequent years. In the House bill, growth in each subsequent year is 5.0%
<p>
In both bills, the amount of assistance and rate of growth assigned to the defined contribution is a matter of explicit decision by political leaders. Beneficiaries who choose to be covered under MedicarePlus will know the amount of their benefit, and the federal government will know the amount of its obligation. Regardless of the type of health plan a beneficiary chooses under MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice, the government's contribution remains fixed.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The defined contribution as drafted presents a step in the right direction of reducing the exploding rate of growth in Medicare but it does not go far enough and is not balanced. The bills apply the defined contribution requirement only to MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans, unintentionally placing private-sector plans at a disadvantage when attempting to compete against traditional Medicare.
<p>
Maintaining an open-ended subsidy to all enrollees choosing traditional Medicare (unlimited 80 percent copayments after reaching a $100 per year deductible for Part B) and retaining a heavily subsidized Part B premium (68.5 percent from the government) effectively precludes a level playing field between MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans and the existing Medicare program. While private-sector providers are required to design their various health plans in accordance with the size of the defined contribution, traditional Medicare is under no such constraint. Thus, the current draft would lead to a distortion of both choice and market by favoring traditional Medicare over the private sector in this regard. 
<P>
The defined contribution should be applied universally so that a truly level playing field exists between traditional Medicare and MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice. Unfortunately, the fail-safe budget mechanism (price controls) created in the House version will force health care providers to be even more cost-conscious in providing services, which could lead eventually to rationing or a decline in participation by physicians in traditional Medicare. While the Senate attempted to create a similar mechanism -- budget expenditure limit tool (BELT) -- in its reform, it was stricken during floor debate as being extraneous under the Byrd Rule.
<p>
<b>5. Both bills continue to rely on price controls for traditional Medicare. </b>
<p>
Aside from the issue of fair competition between the federal government and the private sector, the lack of substantive changes in traditional Medicare means it is unlikely that the reforms as a whole will reach the targets required to help achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. In that event, the House legislation would require Congress to trigger a last-resort fail-safe budget mechanism. (Depending on parliamentary procedures in the Senate, the equivalent procedure in the Senate version is called a budget expenditure limitation tool, or BELT.) This would automatically decrease the payments for items and services in the following sectors of traditional Medicare:12
<p><ul>
<li> Inpatient hospital services;
<p>
<li> Home health services;
<p>
<li> Extended care services;
<p>
<li> Hospice care;
<p>
<li> Physicians' services and other services of other health care professionals;
<p>
<li> Outpatient hospital services and ambulatory facility services;
<p>
<li> Durable medical equipment and supplies, including prosthetic devices and orthotics;
<p>
<li> Diagnostic tests; and
<p>
<li> Other items and services.
</ul><P>
Should Congress implement the fail-safe mechanism as a last resort, providers of health care to Medicare beneficiaries would see a reduction in the scheduled reimbursement rate for services -- in reality a tightening of existing price controls. But price controls in the past have failed to hold down Medicare costs, just as they have failed in other countries, leading to distortions, a decline in quality and availability of services, and widespread evasion.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Rather than require tighter price controls in a futile attempt to hold down costs, Congress should develop a market-based look-back mechanism, perhaps modeled after the reimbursement schedules developed by International Paper Company for its employee health insurance plan. These specify payment rates based on average market prices in different geographic areas, and then readjust the reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers in those areas based on market performance.13  Even more important, International Paper's fixed reimbursement rate does not require the patient to pay a certain percentage of a physician's fee; instead, it allows the physician and patient to agree on a price, with the patient in effect receiving a voucher toward that fee (which may cover the full amount). Using this system, the company cut its costs 14.5 percent between 1991 and 1992. This equated to an average out-of-pocket savings of 5.7 percent per employee. International Paper, using the scheduled benefits plan, did not have increased medical costs in 1994 or 1995.14
<P>
<b>6. Both bills raise Part B premiums in proportion to benefit costs.</b>
<p>
The Medicare supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known as Part B, is voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying a monthly premium -- $46.10 per month as of January 1, 1995. This amount is equivalent to just 29 percent of the actual average cost of Part B coverage. The remaining 71 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the general revenue fund. When Congress created Medicare, the cost of Part B was divided evenly between the beneficiary and taxpayers. The original intent was to create a subsidy for the nation's elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is being provided today.
<p>
Since the early 1980s, however, Congress has taken the politically safe path of setting premiums at a level which covers only 25 percent of program costs. This modest amount covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100 per year. 
<p>
Due to government miscalculations with respect to the cost of Part B, the 1995 premium paid by current beneficiaries is approximately 31.5 percent of program costs. Rather than allow it to fall back to 25 percent, which would mean actually cutting premiums, both bills would set the Part B premium permanently at 31.5 percent of costs beginning in 1996. But even this means a huge subsidy to seniors, regardless of income. And since this subsidy would continue in the traditional Part B program, private insurance alternatives in MedicarePlus would not be as attractive, even though their actual costs might be lower.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Taxpayers should not be subsidizing 68.5 percent of Part B. To reduce that subsidy, Congress should consider one of two options:
<P>
	1) Raise the beneficiary premium to 50 percent of program costs, effective January 1, 1996.
<p><blockquote>
	Such a change could yield net savings of up to $205.3 billion over the next seven years. Raising this premium immediately to its original proportion of 50 percent is not a tax increase, because Part B is entirely voluntary and subsidized by the general taxpayer, not paid for out of payroll taxes. Reducing this taxpayer-provided subsidy to the level specified in the original contract between the federal government and the American taxpayers will effectively reduce future Medicare outlays.
</blockquote><p>
	2) Increase the beneficiary premium in increments of 5 percent each year until it reaches 50 percent of program costs and then freeze it at that level.
<p><blockquote>
	This more politically palatable option will not yield the same savings to taxpayers as the first option would in the first seven years. However, it will reduce outlays by $162.1 billion over this period. Each year thereafter, Medicare will realize significant savings while still providing a generous subsidy to enrollees. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>7. Both bills reduce the subsidy based on income.</b>
<p>
	Under current law, all beneficiaries who choose to enroll in Medicare Part B, regardless of income, pay the same premium and receive the same subsidy from the taxpayers. The House bill reduces the subsidy to individuals with incomes over $75,000 and couples with incomes over $125,000 per year, effective January 1, 1996. The federal subsidy would be eliminated gradually for individuals with incomes of $100,000 and couples with incomes of $175,000 per year, also effective January 1, 1996. While policy analysts disagree on the level of income at which the Part B subsidy should be phased out, most agree that the bill takes a positive step in the right direction in this regard.
<p>
The Senate bill adopts a similar approach by reducing the subsidy for single individuals with incomes over $50,000 and couples with incomes over $75,000. The federal subsidy would be phased down and eventually eliminated for singles whose incomes are $100,000 and couples with incomes above $150,000, effective January 1, 1996. 
<p>
Again, it must be emphasized that reducing taxpayer-subsidized services in a program that is entirely voluntary is not a tax increase. Medicare Part B costs are projected to increase at roughly 12 percent annually.15  Because Part B is subsidized so heavily by the general Treasury, all taxpayers end up paying for the ever-increasing federal share of this program. It is ironic that, in an age when the working poor cannot afford to purchase even a minimum package of health benefits, they are forced to subsidize individuals who enjoy significantly higher savings and assets.
<p>
<b>The Senate's Deductible Option.</b> While the House made improvements in Part B, it did not change the Part B deductible. The Part B deductible was set up to serve two purposes:  (1) to discourage unnecessary utilization of medical services and (2) to reduce the volume of small size claims, thereby producing not only savings in claim dollars, but also substantial savings in claim administration. It has to be set at an appropriate level to achieve these two purposes, but Congress has allowed it to fall sharply in real terms. From 1967 (the first full year of Part B experience) to 1996, typical service charges per enrollee will have increased more than 2,300 percent, while the deductible will have increased only 100 percent. For the deductible to keep up with per enrollee charges, it would have to be $1,203 in 1996.16
<p>
The Senate bill would automatically raise the Part B deductible to $150, effective January 1, 1996, and increase it in increments of $10 each January 1 thereafter, through 2002.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The conference should adopt the Senate policy on the Part B deductible.
<p>
Of the two options to adjust the premium according to income, the lower Senate threshold is preferable. An alternative would be to combine the lower threshold with a new provision to allow the premiums for lower-income elderly to fall to 25 percent of costs or less. This would mean a larger subsidy for poorer Americans, but no subsidy for more affluent seniors.
<p>
<b>8. Both bills establish a new Medicare trust fund for Medicare savings. </b>
<p>
Liberals in Congress have charged that the Republican Medicare reform proposals are nothing more than devastating cuts to fund tax cuts for the rich. While the fact remains that most of the tax relief provided in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 goes to working families with children,17 House and Senate Republicans have included provisions in their respective Medicare reform proposals to ensure that there will be "[a] lock box mechanism that places all savings from Part B into a Medicare Preservation Trust Fund and prohibits any transfers to pay for future tax cuts."18
<p>
Savings from changes in Part B premiums thus will be used only to strengthen Medicare's financial status.19  Under both the House and Senate versions, the Secretary of the Treasury, who serves as managing Trustee of the Medicare Trust Funds, is directed to estimate the savings to the federal government resulting from changes in the Part B premium on a yearly basis. The savings yielded from this reform will then be transferred from the general revenue fund of the U.S. Treasury to the Federal Hospital Insurance (Part A) Trust Fund in the form of public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Money from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund may be used only for Medicare expenditures.20 
<P>

<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE MEDICARE REFORM</b>
<p>
While the House and Senate bills significantly improve the existing Medicare program, there are several provisions which occur only in one of the bills. Other provisions should be strengthened, and still others should be changed or deleted.
<p>
<b>1. The Senate should consider carefully the House medical liability reform provisions.</b> Under current law, there are no uniform federal standards governing health care liability law. Unfortunately, the states generally have not introduced the reforms needed to curb unnecessary lawsuits and unreasonable damage awards. Thus, physicians often perform medically unnecessary and sometimes costly procedures to shield themselves from potential liability. The added costs of these procedures are paid for by the Medicare program and the private sector, as well as through higher premiums. The House bill would institute a number of crucial reforms in medical malpractice and health care liability law. The bill would apply certain limits on suits involving physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and other providers. Specifically, the bill would:
<p><ul>
<li> Allow malpractice awards exceeding $50,000 to be paid in periodic increments;
<p>
<li> Limit noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases to $250,000;
<p>
<li> Make each defendant liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss and punitive damages allocated in direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of responsibility; and
<p>
<li> Grant punitive damages only if the plaintiff establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the harm suffered was the result of conduct manifesting conscious, flagrant indifference to the health of the claimant or to the health of persons who might be harmed by the health care products. Punitive damages awarded would be determined by the court but could not exceed $250,000 or three times the amount of economic damages, whichever was greater.
</ul><P>
The Senate version does not contain malpractice provisions. 
<p>
While there are federalism concerns involved in any national legislation to reform malpractice, there is an urgent need to deal with the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration programs, and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state law, have contributed to the federal government's growing expenditures. 
<p>
The case can be made for the federal government, under the Commerce Clause, preempting state liability law in those areas of the health care system where there is substantial interstate business such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Even here, Congress should move cautiously. There is a far weaker case, however, for preempting state liability law affecting economic activity entirely within a state (such as most physical or hospital services). So the conferees should resist incorporating federal preemption in these areas of the health care system, and instead urge the states to reform their own laws.
<p>
<b>2. Both the Senate and the House need to allow direct billing for clinical laboratory services.</b> Medicare Part B covers diagnostic clinical laboratory services performed in independent clinical laboratories, hospital-based laboratories, and physician office laboratories. Under current law, the provider of the clinical laboratory test must bill Medicare, not the beneficiary. In turn, Medicare reimburses the provider for services on the basis of "area wide fee schedules" which are updated periodically to account for inflation.21  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) included provisions that would slow the rate of growth in Medicare expenditures by eliminating the inflation update for 1994 and 1995, in addition to a "phased down" reduction in the national ceiling on payment amounts for clinical laboratory services.22  OBRA 1993 set the national ceiling at 80 percent of the median of all fee schedules for the test, and 76 percent of the national median in 1996 and each year thereafter. Despite such measures, Medicare has achieved insignificant savings from the initial fee schedule rates originally established in 1986.
<p>
Medicare payment policy has rewarded inefficiency within the clinical laboratory industry. What is needed is a market-driven solution that will stimulate greater competition and substantially reduce the cost of laboratory services to all payers, public and private. The House and Senate bills both would reduce the Medicare fee schedule to 65 percent of the median, effective January 1, 1997. Reducing the national cap for each laboratory service to 65 percent of the national median fee during the base year for that service, and eliminating the CPI update factor through 2002, would effectively eliminate the cost shift to Medicare and force the clinical laboratory industry to compete on real costs. The savings to Medicare would be immediate, measurable, and significant. 
<p>
The House bill does contain one advantage over the Senate proposal with regard to laboratory fees. This deals with the issue of direct billing. In general, clinical laboratories market their services to physicians, offering the physician a wholesale price for testing. The physician then can pass on the price of the test to the patient. Combining direct billing with the right of a patient to select a laboratory would remove the physician as the determinant of which laboratory to use. The House legislation would require the clinical laboratory to bill the patient or the health plan designated by the patient.23 
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<P>
The conference should include the House policy. Adopting this policy would help reduce Medicare spending by creating greater competition and consumer choice.
<p>
One technical and procedural problem remains, however:  The current legislative language in the House bill contains technical problems that have prevented the Congressional Budget Office from "scoring" savings attributable to direct billing. Direct billing language appears to be used only as part of a separate fail-safe mechanism should Medicare not achieve its budgetary goals. The House bill can be corrected by linking the savings from direct billing to the overall fee schedule and CPI freeze contained in both the House and Senate versions. Applying the direct billing requirement to all services, both Medicare and non-Medicare, will end physicians' markups on tests they do not perform and lead to lower overall utilization and costs.
<p>
<b>3. Clarify the status and payment of skilled nursing facilities.</b> The Medicare SNF benefit covers post-hospital skilled nursing care in facilities certified to participate in the program. Currently, Medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities on a per day basis for reasonable costs, subject to per diem cost limits. These limits are applied to per day routine service costs, which include nursing, room and board, administrative, and overhead expenses. Separate per diem limits are established for freestanding and hospital-based SNFs by urban or rural area. Freestanding skilled nursing facilities are set at 112 percent of the average per diem labor-related and non-labor-related costs. Hospital-based SNF limits are set at the limit for freestanding SNFs, plus 50 percent of the difference between the freestanding SNF limits and 112 percent of the average per diem routine service costs of hospital-based SNFs. 
<p>
Hospital-based and freestanding SNFs treat patients of similar acuity with almost identical outcomes. There is no difference in care. This finding is reported in a September 26, 1995, study by Abt Associates, Inc., using 1994-1995 data on over 20,000 rehabilitation patients.24  This report concludes that the current reimbursement differential between freestanding and hospital SNFs is a waste of Medicare funds. The current reimbursement system contains an incentive for hospital-based SNFs to admit a patient for full Medicare reimbursement and then transfer that same patient down to the SNF unit and receive full cost reimbursement for SNF care at a higher level than a freestanding SNF. Millions of Medicare patients require hospitalization each year for their particular ailments. However, it has become apparent that certain patients can be transferred to an SNF for subacute care with no detriment to the patient or sacrifice in quality of care.
<p>
Based on analysis of the cost of treating over 22,000 Medicare patients across the country representing across-the-board ailments (for example, stroke, orthopedic, heart failure, cancer, simple pneumonia), the Abt report concludes that the current Medicare program "could have saved an average of $455 for each day that subacute care at freestanding SNFs was substituted for hospital-based care. For Medicare to fully realize these savings, however, Medicare would need to first rebase the current hospital DRG payment system, dividing the DRG payment... between hospitals and SNFs based on the cost of providing care. In addition, Medicare would also need to eliminate the requirement that patients stay three or more days in a hospital before becoming eligible for Medicare coverage in a SNF."25 
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should eliminate the routine cost limits (RCL) differential between freestanding and hospital-based skilled nursing facilities.
<p>
Congress should examine the cost-effectiveness that SNFs are able to provide and bring into play true competition among providers in this field of care by placing all SNFs under the same routine cost limit reimbursement formula. Based upon Congressional Budget Office projections for SNF spending over the next seven years, Medicare would save approximately $4.1 billion during this period if the routine cost limitation for all SNFs was set at 112 percent of the mean.
<p>
<b>4. Eliminate House-passed premium caps.</b> While MedicarePlus permits market forces to compete against one another, thereby promoting greater value and efficiency, the modified Chairman's Mark in both the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Commerce Committee contains a provision that exacerbates the imbalance between MedicarePlus and traditional Medicare.
<p>
A new paragraph entitled "Relation of Premiums and Cost Sharing to Benefits" was added under Sec. 15002, MedicarePlus Program, as Sec. 1852(d)(5). The amendment would provide that in no case may the portion of a MedicarePlus organization's premium rate and the actuarial value of its deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments attributable to the minimum benefits exceed the actuarial value of the coinsurance and deductible applicable in the non-MedicarePlus option. Though price controls have been a failure within the current Medicare program, the House bill now proposes premium price controls for all private-sector plans. This provision would undercut the ability of private plans to compete with traditional Medicare. The danger is that few private plans will opt to participate in the new program if there are premium price controls. This could lead to a possible oligopoly in areas where well-financed insurance companies with high enrollment can take the financial risks inherent in a distorted health market. What is likely if the controls are included in the final legislation, particularly in underserved rural areas, is that virtually no private plans will be offered. Moreover, since MedicarePlus plans are required to offer the current Medicare Parts A and B package as a minimum benefits package, the ability to provide additional benefits within the limits on the rate of increase in capitation payments is hampered. The opportunity to provide greater value, choices, and efficiency would be severely reduced, since MedicarePlus plans opting to participate could be expected to offer limited options and seek out lower-cost providers.
<p>
Even if one accepts the notion that price controls are not harmful, they are not necessary in the bill because seniors are under no obligation to choose private plans. If a plan raises its prices, it must persuade customers that the extra cost is justified by extra value.
<p>
Under the House provision, it is the elderly and disabled who will be adversely affected, since lower-cost providers are not necessarily the more efficient or better quality providers. Plans will be effectively barred from offering superior services at a reasonable additional cost.
<p>
Thus, while the House bill is an attempt to provide the elderly with more choices and options in health plans through the private sector on the one hand, it simultaneously restricts private plans' ability to provide such services by imposing strict pricing caps and regulatory benefits requirements. By not allowing participating MedicarePlus plans to charge market-based premiums, it will severely limit beneficiaries' options in private health plans and prevent them from taking advantage of the wide range of health care delivery services available in a free and open private market.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The Senate bill wisely refrains from creating further distortions in the health market by allowing Medicare Choice plans to determine their premium prices and letting patients, not government, decide whether the higher-priced plans are good value. For Members of Congress serious about promoting rather than restraining market forces, the Senate policy is superior. 
<p>
<b>5. Both bills should allow patients to contract privately with doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers.</b> Noticeably absent from the House and Senate bills is an explicit provision to guarantee the right of every Medicare beneficiary to purchase health care services on a private basis. Under such an arrangement, also referred to as private contract, a Medicare beneficiary could receive a specified medical service for an agreed upon fee -- or in some cases, for no fee at all, since Medicare regulators at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have threatened to impose $2,000 fines on providers who fail to charge any patient the Medicare Part B $100 deductible.26  In private contracting arrangements, no Medicare reimbursement claims would be filed because no Medicare reimbursement claims would be sought by either provider or patient. This would occur at no cost to insurance companies or federal taxpayers.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should permit direct, private contracting among Medicare patients. While the House bill (like an earlier version of the Senate bill) allows for privately contracted services to enrollees in the Medical Savings Account option, Congress should allow all beneficiaries, regardless of the option they choose (traditional Medicare or MedicarePlus), to contract privately for health services. Many elderly and disabled persons, for varying reasons, have expressed to their physicians a desire to keep Medicare completely out of the picture. Sec. 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act requires health care providers to "[c]omplete and submit a claim for such service on a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to the carrier on behalf of a beneficiary."27  However, the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for implementing and enforcing this statute, has been inconsistent in this matter. In <i>Stewart v. Sullivan</i>, 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal judge Nicholas Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and Human Services had not articulated a clear policy against private contracting. Given the discrepancy between statutory law and existing case law, physicians are still uncertain as to which law prevails and fearful of possible reprisals from HCFA through the threat of sanctions. 
<P>
Congress should end this confusion by supporting the principle of private contract. Any reform legislation should ensure that beneficiaries are not forced or required to receive their health care solely through Medicare and not prohibited from paying a provider on any basis as agreed to between the individual and the provider.
<p>
<b>6. Make sure that the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration remains subject to Senate Confirmation.</b> The House bill contains a surprising provision that would eliminate the requirement that the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, who is responsible for managing the huge Medicare Trust Funds, be subject to confirmation by the United States Senate.28
<p>
The Administrator of HCFA is an extremely important and senior official. The Administrator, among other things, is a member of the Medicare Board of Trustees with responsibility for administering an insurance system that covers close to 38 million Americans, and should be held to a higher level of accountability than a mere political appointee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The attachment of the Administrator's signature to the Hospital Insurance and Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund Reports signifies an extraordinary degree of public accountability.
<p>
The Administrator of HCFA also is charged with overseeing both the Medicare and Medicaid programs and heads an agency that will have over 4,000 full-time employees and a budget of almost $250 billion this year. An official with these heavy responsibilities should be held accountable to the public through Senate confirmation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should retain Senate confirmation of the Administrator of HCFA and not allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint any individual to this powerful and influential position. 
<p>

<b>MAJOR PROBLEMS REMAINING IN MEDICARE REFORM </b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>
During the floor debate on the Senate bill, the provision that created Medical Savings Accounts within Medicare was eliminated. A point of order against the provision was upheld on the grounds that it was extraneous and a violation of Sec. 313(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the so-called Byrd Rule. The main explanation for the point of order was the alleged potential of MSAs to increase the deficit by $3.5 billion over the next seven years.
<p>
The House bill authorizes a beneficiary who chooses MedicarePlus to purchase a high-deductible insurance plan with an MSA. For individuals who choose the MSA option, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would make a defined contribution to the MedicarePlus MSA chosen by the beneficiary. Only contributions by the Secretary of HHS could be made to a MedicarePlus MSA, and such contributions would not be taxable income. The high-deductible policy would provide reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries only after annual expenses equal to a deductible not to exceed $10,000. Interest earned on amounts held in the MedicarePlus MSA also would not be subject to income tax.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Conferees should redraft the MSA provision so that it does not conflict with the Byrd Rule. Medicare MSAs give the elderly who choose them complete control over most health care decisions and the flexibility to choose their own providers. Furthermore, they provide the security of catastrophic coverage, an element that is noticeably absent from the current Medicare program. Once an individual has reached his or her deductible level, the private plan, not the federal taxpayer, will cover all additional medical expenses.
<p>
<b>The Need for Baby Boomer Guarantees</b>
<p>
Baby Boomers must be assured that their payroll tax contribution will not be forfeited if Medicare ever defaults. The House and Senate Medicare reform legislation only partly addresses the troubled status of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. As Chart 1 indicates, the HI Trust Fund begins to pay out more money than it brings in (a negative cash flow) in 1996. Absent corrective legislative action, the Medicare Trustees say that assets will be depleted within the next 6 to 11 years.29 
<p>
In highlighting the critical need for the House and Senate to take corrective action, the Medicare Trustees state:  "The fact that exhaustion would occur under a broad range of future economic conditions, and is expected to occur in the relatively near future, indicates the urgency of addressing the HI trust fund's financial imbalance."30
<p>
The Medicare provisions of the reconciliation bill would address this near-term financial problem, extending the solvency of the HI trust fund through 2010. The White House proposal, like plans advanced by congressional Democrats, would not even keep the hospital program solvent beyond 2006. In other words, neither the reconciliation proposal nor the other proposals would guarantee members of the Baby Boomer generation (Americans born between 1945 and 1957) the current Medicare system when they are eligible to retire, starting in the years 2010 through 2022. 
<p>
The House bill does include a provision which creates a Commission on the Effect of the Baby Boom Generation on the Medicare Program. This commission is charged with reporting to Congress no later than May 1, 1997, its findings and recommendations on how to preserve Medicare in a financially solvent manner until 2030. The report is to include detailed recommendations for appropriate legislative initiatives specifying how this objective is to be accomplished.31
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate a provision in Medicare reform legislation to guarantee Americans born after 1945 that their contributions toward the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be paid back to them upon retirement if benefits are no longer available to them under Medicare. 
<p>
As mentioned earlier, both the House and Senate reform proposals create a "lock box" trust fund which requires that Medicare savings be applied to the HI program. Since there is no certainty as to the longevity of this trust fund, Congress should make a commitment to the Baby Boomer generation that their mandatory contributions to the HI program will be paid back in kind. This can be accomplished through a provision that allows for a future tax reduction for individuals born between 1945 and 1962. If future income tax payments are pro-rated to reflect an individual's investment in the HI trust fund over the course of his working years, these working Americans will not be penalized should the commission fail to develop a concrete proposal ensuring the financial integrity of the HI trust fund.
<p>
<b>The Need for Provider-Sponsored Networks</b>
<p>
In trying to transform the current Medicare program into an open competitive system, both the House and Senate reform measures include provisions which create provider service networks/provider-sponsored networks (PSNs) in the MedicarePlus or Medicare Choice plans. In other words, both bills would enable doctors and hospitals in local areas to market health plans, giving the elderly yet another range of options from which to can choose.
<p>
Doctors and hospitals in local areas often may be better able than insurance companies to meet these needs, especially in many rural areas where managed care entities have found it difficult to create a network. By allowing doctors to form their own network, Congress would be giving the elderly a chance to buy health insurance coverage sponsored by a trusted physician in the community.
<p>
As passed by the House, PSNs would be regulated at the federal level. The Senate bill places regulation of PSNs at the state level while at the same time demonstrating an awareness of the current problem of overregulation of insurance at the state level, including mandated benefits and other restrictions incompatible with market-based reform. Under the Senate bill, therefore, a state has 90 days from the date of application from doctors and hospitals to issue a license. In the event the state fails to issue a license, the legislation creates an alternate avenue for certification via the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This provision ensures that states are the regulators of first resort. Absent a fair and impartial judgment by a state regulator, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to grant temporary relief to provider-sponsored networks by issuing a federal license for no longer than 36 months. The PSN is still under an obligation to obtain state certification. 
<p>
Over time, as PSNs become established, price and quality sensitive consumers will be able to make wise and informed decisions, comparing PSNs to all other options in the Medicares new consumer choice program. Moreover, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, recognizes that the federal licensure process should be applied only as a temporary measure to reflect necessary transition to a new competitive system. Thus, this alternative federal licensing program would expire on December 31, 2000.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
As a matter of public policy, the Senate position on allowing PSNs is superior to the policy in the House bill. On the other hand, Congress should adopt the House anti-trust policy that allows for creation of such provider-sponsored networks.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
This Congress deserves enormous credit for its courage in tackling the tough and politically sensitive Medicare program. Typically, as with all those who try to deal with programs serving the elderly, Members seeking to save the Medicare program are being accused of wrecking it.
<p>
Medicare is in financial crisis. While liberals in Congress insist that the program remain unchanged -- with its cumbersome bureaucracy, heavy regulation, price controls, and runaway costs -- others should not hesitate to seize this historic opportunity to reform the program and give America's elderly more control over the ownership and selection of health care benefits. The House and Senate bills have many deficiencies. But by introducing consumer choice and competition, this Congress can take a giant step toward assuring that Medicare will still be available, at reasonable cost, to future generations.

F.Y.I No. 92<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Office of Management and Budget last week announced that the FY 1996 deficit is forecast to be $145.6 billion, or one-half of the FY 1992 level of $290.4 billion.<sup>1</sup>  Although the Clinton Administration claims credit for this significant deficit reduction, in fact it has had very little to do with it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before President Clinton took office, three factors already were beginning to bring down the deficit:
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>1) Reductions in defense spending. </b> A significant part of the decrease in the deficit is the result of much lower defense spending.  Defense spending in FY 1996 will be $266.3 billion, which is $36.3 billion less than in FY 1992.  In real, inflation-adjusted terms, defense spending is the lowest since the Carter years, and as a percentage of GDP it is lower than before World War II.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified to Congress about the dangerous neglect of military procurement, which is now at the lowest level since the Korean War.  Since FY 1992, military procurement has been reduced by 44 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>2) The reform of deposit insurance.</b>  The most deceptive part of the "deficit reduction" between FY 1992 and FY 1996 is simply the way in which the budget accounts for federal deposit insurance for banks and thrift institutions.  During the Bush Administration, the S&L bailout made the budget deficit much greater, requiring $57.9 billion in FY 1990 and $66.2 billion in FY 1991.  But in FY 1993, before Clinton's economic policies were enacted, the federal government actually began to make a profit of $28 billion from selling assets.  In FY 1996, the deposit insurance funds will bring in $13.5 billion to make the deficit appear even smaller.  The Clinton Administration has enjoyed a large windfall.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Defense spending cuts and the distorting effects of deposit insurance account for 36 percent of the change in the deficit between FY 1992 and FY 1996.  While the Administration claims credit for deficit reduction, its domestic spending has surged 23 percent since FY 1992, from $857.1 billion in FY 1992 to $1,058.4 billion in FY 1996.  Domestic spending now is equal to 14.5 percent of GDP, the highest proportion since the 1980 and 1982 recessions, which pushed up the ratio because the economy slumped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>3) Economic growth and tax revenues.</b>  As the economy grew out of the 1990-1991 recession, federal tax revenues began to increase significantly.  Indeed, one of the largest contributing factors in the huge deficits during the Bush years was the drop in revenue growth during the recession.  Historically, tax revenues have grown at about 7.9 percent per year, but during 1990-1992, government revenues grew at half that rate.  When the economy recovered from the Bush recession in FY 1993, revenue growth rebounded strongly to 9 percent, and FY 1994 saw a 7.8 percent growth.  Government revenues have grown from $1,090.5 billion to $1,426.8 billion, or 31 percent, since FY 1992.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This significant growth in taxes, combined with the cut in defense spending and the shift of deposit insurance from a net cost to a profit center in the budget, accounts for all of Clinton's deficit reduction.  Not a dime of this deficit reduction is from controlling spending.  The "era of big government" is not over; it is just hiding behind the business cycle and post-Cold War defense policy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Just as incoming Presidents are unfairly blamed for economic slowdowns, they also receive unwarranted credit for economic growth even when it is more sluggish than it should be.  A look at what has happened to federal tax revenues collected since the first Clinton budget suggests that the deficit should have been falling faster.  The Clinton Administration's 1993 tax increase has been followed by a significant slowdown in the rate of growth in tax revenues.  In FY 1996, federal revenue is projected to be only $71.6 billion greater than it was in FY 1995, while in FY 1995 it was $97.5 billion higher than FY 1994, and in FY 1994 it was $104.2 billion greater than in FY 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, tax revenues from the Clinton 1993 tax hike increased from $26.4 billion to $51.5 billion between FY 1994 and FY 1996.<sup>2</sup>  But the total increase in tax revenues from all sources decreased from $104.2 billion to $71.6 billion.  Most of the drop in the deficit from new revenues occurred before the new 1993 tax increases could be collected. The tax data suggest that Clinton's economic policies actually may have sapped the economic recovery and produced a deficit larger than it otherwise could have been.

CBO's September 1993 estimate of new tax revenues from Clinton's economic program might have been too large, but such an error would hardly be to the credit of the political leadership that pushed through the largest tax increase in history on a strictly party-line vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage Foundation will soon release a report analyzing the impact of the Clinton Administration's tax and spending policies from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) on the nation's economic performance.  Using one of the nation's leading models of the U.S. economy, this study will examine how the economy would be performing today had the Clinton Administration and Congress not raised taxes as the U.S. was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.  This analysis will show that President Clinton's 1993 economic plan actually has deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential.

<title>Behind the Census Bureau's Good News on Poverty -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>Behind the Census Bureau's Good News on Poverty</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick F. Fagan</a><br>
William H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #431<br>
October 12, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

Americans no doubt were relieved to hear last week that, according to the federal government's official poverty estimates, the number of people in poverty went down in 1994. But if the number is to go down further in this and future years, Congress and the American people need to look behind the Census Bureau data to understand what really has been happening and what lessons must be learned.
<p>
Broadly, it turns out that the best remedy for poverty is a strong and growing economy, not government "anti-poverty" programs. The lowest rate of poverty in recent years occurred at the end of the Reagan era. The "kinder, gentler" approach of the Bush-Clinton era has not yet managed to get the rate back down to that level. It also turns out that poverty is closely related to family structure: Children in poverty (the largest poverty group) actually means children in broken families. In particular, black poverty is associated with weaker families, while married black America is doing very well, showing the fastest gains among all groups.
<p>
Thus, the data show that the best social policy is economic policy that spurs job creation and income growth. If America is to continue reducing the poverty rate, Congress must concentrate on expanding the economy and jobs while reducing the illegitimacy rate. And if it combines this approach with consolidating welfare assistance to the states into block grants, there will be an increase in resources available to those who are still poor.
<p>
Specifically, the Census Bureau data show that:
<p>
<b>1) Jobs reduce poverty.</b><p>
During the Reagan era, an unprecedented period of economic growth led to the lowest poverty rate in recent history--despite criticism at the time that welfare programs were being cut. Even this year's good news for families--a drop to 11.6 percent of Americans in poverty--is still above Reagan's legacy of 10.3 percent.
<p>
One reason for this is that during the Reagan expansion of 1982-1989, jobs grew at an average rate of 2.25 million new jobs per year. During the business expansion of 1991 to 1994, however, the average rate has been only 1.9 million new jobs per year.
<p>

<b>2) Children in poverty means children in broken families.</b><p>
Of all children under 18, some 21.8 percent are in poverty. The recent Census Bureau report highlights the fact that children are the largest group in poverty, accounting for 40 percent of the total. Digging deeper into the numbers, one finds there are sharp differences in rates among children in different household situations. The vast majority of these children are children in broken families. Some 52.9 percent of all children in female-headed families are in poverty. By contrast, the rate among children in intact married families is just 10.8 percent.
<p>
Married family life is the best protection against poverty for children. Single parenthood--the "feminization" of poverty--results from the father and his paycheck being absent.
<p>

<b>3) Married black Americans have made the most sizable gains.</b><p>
Married couples and children in married families tend to benefit most from economic recoveries. In the latest Census release, this is most clearly shown in the numbers for black Americans.
<p>
In terms of income and poverty, there are two black Americas, and they are very different. Black married families are the biggest winners in the decline in the poverty rate. For married black Americans with children under 18, the poverty rate dropped from 13.9 percent to 11.4 percent between 1993 and 1994, from 298,000 to 245,000 families (an 18 percent drop in the total number of married families in poverty). But for black American female-headed families, the total number in poverty declined from 1,780,000 families to 1,591,000 families, and the poverty rate fell from 57.7 percent to 53.9 percent (a 10.6 percent drop in the number of female-headed families in poverty).
<p>
<b>4) Poverty affects "single-parent America," not "black America."</b>
<p>
Significantly, the number of poor female-headed families with children in the black community has increased from 949,000 in 1975 to 1,591,000 in 1994, while during this same period the number of married black families with children has decreased from 349,000 to 245,000.  The poverty rate among married black families with children (11.4 percent) is steadily converging with and now close to the poverty rate for similar white families (8.3 percent).  It is not that "black America" is in poverty and "white America" is not.  It is that "single-parent America" is in poverty and the black community contains more than its share of such households.
<p>
Three major policy implications are evident in these numbers:
<p>
1) The best possible anti-poverty policy is an expanding economy with increased job creation. Policies which favor the formation of businesses and investment, such as tax reduction and deregulation, however much they seem to favor the business owner, actually do more than anything else to cut poverty.
<p>
2) Intact married families are the best places for children, not only socially and developmentally, but also economically. Social policies which favor married life will cut poverty. Social policies which do nothing to discourage the formation of single-parent families--and worse still, which reward out-of-wedlock births--increase the number of poor and place more children in poverty.
<p>
3) Under the new welfare proposal being pushed in Congress, converting from an entitlement program to block grants will help those who remain in poverty. Even in good economic times, the welfare pie will continue to grow as a block grant, but the number of people in poverty actually will shrink, increasing the average per person. Using the discretionary powers left to them under current block grant proposals, the states can use this extra money in more creative ways to cut poverty.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts
in a terrible accident on the ground. But, we've never lost an
astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And
perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the
shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers,
but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,
Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the
full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking
about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave,
and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says,
'Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.' They had a hunger
to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to
serve, and they did. They served all of us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle
us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program
has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space,
and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still
pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who
were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know
it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and
we'll continue to follow them...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great
explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian
later said, 'He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in
it.' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication
was, like Drake's, complete.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner
in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor
the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for
the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of
earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

<center><h2>Keep The Arms Embargo On Cuba</h2><br>

<h3><a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">By Kim R. Holmes</a></h3>
<P>
Vice President and Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies,<br>

The Heritage Foundation

</center><P>
<b>A Special Report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</b>
<P>




 Since the U.S. imposed a trade embargo on Cuba 32 years ago,
much has changed in the world of communism.  Fidel Castro's patron,
the Soviet Union, has collapsed.  Communist China is embracing
capitalism.  And Marxist-Leninism is a creed that survives only
in a few dreary outposts like North Korea and Cuba.   
<P>
 Because communism is on the run, some people believe that the
embargo on Cuba should be lifted.   Since the world has changed
so much, they ask, why bother worrying about this last redoubt
of communism in the Caribbean?  Critics of the embargo argue that
Fidel Castro no longer threatens the security and vital national
interests of the United States.  They also insist that the  trade
embargo is a Cold War anachronism that serves only to perpetuate
Castro's stranglehold on the Cuban people.  They maintain that
the  embargo has never worked because Castro remains in power,
and that the best way to encourage economic and democratic reforms
in  Cuba is to end the embargo and trade with Castro.  
<P>
 These  arguments are dangerously misguided.  To be sure, the
world has changed-- but this should not mean that Cuba should
be treated any differently.  In fact, it should not be treated
differently at all.  The point is that while the world has changed,
Cuba has not -- at least not enough to justify lifting the embargo.
  
<P>
 The U.S. imposed the embargo on Cuba because Castro was a communist
dictator who repressed his people, stole the property of foreigners
and threatened U.S. security and interests.   The embargo should
be lifted when Cuba becomes a free-market democracy committed
to the rule of law and peaceful relations with the U.S. and its
neighbors.  So far these conditions have not been met.   Fidel
Castro remains a repressive dictator who still threatens U.S.
 security and interests.  Moreover, ending the trade embargo now
would not promote economic and democratic reforms in Cuba.  
<P>
 Castro has no intention of allowing a free market economy in
Cuba, and he will never permit free democratic elections in Cuba
as long as he remains in power.  Castro does not believe in free
markets and democratic government.  Castro wants to supplant the
subsidies of his former Soviet patrons with new financing provided
by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and other
multilateral institutions.  Castro wants the world's democratic
governments, taxpayers in free societies and private investors
to provide his communist dictatorship the financial means to prolong
the captivity of the Cuban people indefinitely.
<P>
 Lifting the embargo would not hasten the end of Castro's regime,
but prolong it.  It would not ease the remaining threats to U.S.
security but perpetuate them.  And it would not create a free-market
democracy in Cuba, but rather give a new lease on life to an authoritarian
socialism that would not only continue to impoverish the Cuban
people, but set a bad example for other emerging free-market democracies
in Latin America.
<P>
<B>CUBA AND U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY</B>
<P>
 While it is true that Castro no longer has the ability to export
violent communist revolution on a large scale throughout the Western
Hemisphere and Africa, he has not renounced the use of violence
to overthrow democratically-elected governments.  America's leaders
would do well to remember that one of the constant and enduring
characteristics of Fidel Castro's career has been his lifelong
hatred of the United States and everything it stands for in the
world.
<P>
 Some of ways in which Castro threatens U.S. national security
include the following:
<P>
 <B>* Castro continues to allow the operation by Russian intelligence
officials of an electronic listening post at Lourdes.</B>  The
Russians argue that the post is needed to monitor U.S. compliance
with its missile treaty obligations, yet American compliance is
not an issue between the U.S. and Russia.  In fact, Lourdes is
an intelligence gathering facility at the service of Russian spies.
<P>
 *<B> Russian nuclear missiles may not be targeted at America
from Cuban soil, but Castro is determined to complete -- with
Russian help -- construction of a $2 billion nuclear reactor only
240 miles South of Miami.</B>  This tropical white elephant could
easily become America's Chernobyl in the Caribbean.  According
to a 1992 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, there
is evidence of shoddy construction at the facility, including
bad welding, and the nuclear technology being used in the plant
is dangerously outdated.  A nuclear accident at the Juragua reactor
in Cuba could conceivably endanger millions of American lives
in the southeastern United States.
<P>
 *<B> If Castro is permitted to recapitalize his communist regime
with billions of dollars in Western aid, he could easily threaten
economic and democratic reforms throughout Latin America</B>.
 The region has achieved extraordinary progress in the past decade
toward economic and political reforms.  Prospects for sustained
economic development and democratic stability have never been
greater in Latin America and the Caribbean.  However, despite
the explosive growth in trade throughout the region, popular support
for  free-market policies is still shallow, and the political
institutions of Latin America's emerging democracies are fragile.
 In the wake of the Mexican crisis, Catholic Bishops and left-wing
political organizations throughout Latin America have redoubled
their calls for the restoration of statist policies to replace
free market policies with socialist policies.  In this uncertain
regional environment, allowing Castro back into the community
of civilized nations in the Western Hemisphere would be analogous
to inviting a fox into a chicken coop.  Without any doubt, Castro
would continue to press his personal war against the United States,
seeking at every turn to undermine vital U.S. interests in institutions
such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization
of American States.
<P>
 Because of Castro's hostility to the U.S., it would be foolish
to think that his favor could be bought with aid, investments
or other American help.    No one should expect that lifting the
embargo would produce a friendly or cooperative Fidel Castro.
  The Cuban dictator will take the money Americans and others
give him, but no one should expect him to embrace democracy, free
markets and the American way of life.   Even with the embargo
lifted, Castro's regime would likely remain very unfriendly to
the U.S. and its interests.   The benefits of taming Castro with
aid and investments, which would be few in any event, would be
far outweighed by the long-range trouble caused by the willful
perpetuation of an anti-American authoritarian regime in Cuba
more or less indefinitely.  The longer Castro's regime survives,
the more opportunities there will be for him to host and support
any guerrilla or subversive movement that may arise in Latin America
in the future.   
<P>
 
<P>
 * <B>Castro has not renounced his long-established policy of
promoting the spread of Marxist-socialist revolution throughout
the developing world</B>.  Although he no longer has the capability
to export troops and weaponry to conflicts in Africa and Latin
America, he still provides political support for extreme leftist
organizations bent on the violent overthrow of democratic regimes
in their countries.   
<P>
<B>&quot;NO&quot; TO LIFTING THE TRADE EMBARGO</B>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade embargo insist that it has never worked
in 32 years.  They argue that Castro has not been forced from
power, and that the United States is the only country in the world
that still refuses to trade with Castro. Critics of the trade
embargo also contend that it punishes the Cuban people unjustly,
and deprives U.S. companies of the opportunity to invest billions
of dollars in Cuba at a time when the entire world is beating
a path to Castro's door.
<P>
 
<P>
  However, these arguments are not convincing.  Consider the following
points:
<P>
 <B>*  In fact, the trade embargo has been effective.  </B>Arguing
otherwise ignores history.<B>  </B> Castro was able to resist
the trade embargo only because he was receiving over $5 billion
a year in subsidies from the Soviet Union.  This money allowed
Castro to finance the build-up of one of the world's most repressive
and murderous communist regimes, while disguising the utter collapse
of the Cuban economy caused by his failed Marxist revolution.
 Since the loss of this Soviet patronage in 1991, the economic
and human devastation Castro produced in Cuba has become increasingly
clear in Cuba and throughout the world.  The effectiveness of
the U.S. trade embargo can be measured by the increasing desperation
of Castro to force the American government to end the embargo.
 Another way of measuring the embargo's effectiveness is the growing
intensity with which Castro's security forces have been repressing
dissidents in Cuba. 
<P>
 The embargo is having an effect.  It is unrealistic to have expected
the embargo to bring down the Castro regime so long as the Soviet
Union existed.  It is realistic now to expect a possible collapse
of Castro's regime now that the Soviet Union has disappeared.
 To lift the embargo now, when its pressure is most felt, would
be a tactical mistake and a strategic blunder.
<P>
 <B>*  Cuba is not China</B>.   Some proponents of lifting the
embargo on Cuba argue that if a strategy of open engagement is
good enough for communist China, it should be good enough for
Cuba as well.  While it is true that expanding U.S. trade with
China in the past twenty years has contributed to the development
of a vigorous free market in China's coastal regions, and that
China's opening markets have become the seedbeds of its democratization,
the same cannot be said for Castro's Cuba.  China's free-market
reforms have been supported for a long time by the government
of China.  Private investment in China has been fueled to a great
extent by Chinese expatriates from all over the Pacific region,
including those from Hong Kong and Taiwan.  China's free markets
are being created by hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens
who are so numerous that it is beyond the capacity of the Chinese
government to control all of their activities.  It also should
be remembered that China has been opening up its markets since
the mid-1970s.  
<P>
 None of these conditions exist in Cuba.   The level of openness
in the Chinese economy is decades ahead of that in Cuba, which
remains a highly repressed economy.  
<P>
For example, property rights do not exist in Cuba.  The current
Cuban Constitution bans the ownership of private property, prohibits
free enterprise in Cuba, and does not allow the hiring of Cuban
workers by Cuban employers -- unless the employer happens to be
the Cuban state.  
<P>
 Moreover, unlike China, there are no expatriate Cubans willing
to invest any of their hard-earned savings in Cuba as long as
Fidel Castro stays in power.  The  reason for this is that Cuba's
expatriate community in the United States and in other countries
understand that Fidel Castro cannot be trusted, and that any foreign
investment in Cuba as long as Castro controls the island will
merely be used to strengthen his communist regime, and prolong
his tyrannical repression of the Cuban people.  
<P>
 <B>*  Castro is not committed to market reforms.</B>  This is
evident in the way the regime treats private property, foreign
investors, and its own workers. For example, all Cuban properties
and plants offered to foreign investors by Castro's regime were
previously confiscated without compensation from their legal owners,
whose numbers included both Cuban citizens and foreign investors.
 Castro is doing business with stolen property, and eventually
foreign investors who forget the rule of law in their quest for
profit will have to answer for their actions before a court of
law in a free Cuban nation.  
<P>
 Second, Cuba has only 11 million inhabitants with a current per
capita income of less than $10 a month in real prices.  They have
little hard cash with which to buy U.S. goods and services, and
the island's technologically obsolescent manufacturing facilities,
unlike those in China, produce little that U.S. consumers would
find appealing. 
<P>
 Third, foreign investors who do engage in business with Castro
do so only with Cuban &quot;investors&quot; approved by Castro's
communist regime.  Moreover,  Cuban workers employed by these
enterprises do not receive an income that reflects the full value
of their work in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies.  Instead,
their salaries are collected in hard currency by the state, and
paid out in Cuban pesos at the official rate of exchange of one
peso per dollar. Thus, these foreign investors are not only dealing
with stolen property, but are also exploiting Cuban workers for
the benefit of Castro's communist regime.
<P>
 Fourth, Castro has said repeatedly that he has no intentions
of allowing a free-market economy to flourish in Cuba.  He talks
instead of a &quot;socialist market economy&quot; in which the
state would remain the sole &quot;owner&quot; of all property
and economic activity in Cuba.  Castro's reluctant experimentation
with free food markets in recent months has been intended to ease
popular frustrations by making more food available to Cuban consumers--
food that Castro's collectivized, command-economy policies have
been incapable of producing for decades without billions of dollars
in Soviet subsidies.  In fact, Castro's control of the Cuban economy
is so great that, in recent months, the Cuban peso is believed
to have strengthened because the government has been engaging
in black market commerce to push down prices and build up the
peso.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
 The trade embargo against Cuba is the most effective weapon in
America's foreign policy arsenal for dealing with Fidel Castro.
 It matters not if other countries think the embargo should be
lifted and Castro re-admitted to the community of civilized nations.
 The U.S. has long conditioned the embargo's removal on Castro's
compliance with the following basic demands: (1) free and democratic
elections must be held in Cuba; (2) a free-market economy must
be allowed to develop, and the property and assets stolen from
their rightful owners must be returned to these owners, or else
compensation must be paid at fair market value; (3) all political
repression of dissidents must cease immediately, and all political
prisoners must be freed from jail; and (4) Castro must renounce
his stated goal of promoting global violent revolution, and step
down from power, allowing the Cuban people to exercise their legitimate
human rights to become a free people in a democratic society.
<P>
 These are noble and principled demands.  They are the philosophical
platform on which the trade embargo against Cuba has stood for
over three decades.  The world has changed in those three decades,
but today these principles have greater moral authority than ever
before.  America's leaders should not allow themselves to be fooled
by Castro's propaganda. The Cuban dictator may indeed be a toothless
tiger without his Soviet patrons, but he has not changed his stripes
at all.   America's leaders would do well to remember that old
and tiring tigers can be unpredictably dangerous.  Now is not
the time to ease up on Castro and snatch defeat from the jaws
of victory.  Instead, Congress and the Clinton Administration
would be wise to increase the pressure against Castro, and hasten
the day when Cuba at long last will be a free nation.

<p>
Every day, hundreds of travelers and visitors to New York City arrive at 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Station, after a disorienting bus trip from Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. Most of the passengers stepping out onto the sidewalk have a single goal: to find a taxicab. Meanwhile, beside each idling bus awaits another group, equally intent on their own mission: to steal from the disembarking travelers.<p>
These are Grand Central's "bag hustlers," the muggers, swindlers, and con men drawn to the area by the steady stream of bus passengers, as well as by the half-million or so commuters who pass through Grand Central each day. To these men, a confused tourist is like a limping gazelle: slow, defenseless, and tasty.<p>
Early one afternoon, a middle-aged visitor from Austria arrives at 42nd Street. Bags in hand, he scans the street for a cab. Before his eyes can even adjust to the light, he is approached by a bag hustler. The hustler, a stocky man in his late 30s, is confident, aggressive, and talks quickly. He offers to carry the man's bags and find a cab. His $20 fee, he explains, will cover the cost of the ride to the man's hotel. The man assents, unaware that the hustler has no intention of paying for the cab with the $20. Instead, he plans to take the moneyand perhaps the man's entire walletand run into the crowd.<p>
As the two walk together to the curb, a third man appears, dressed in what looks like a policeman's uniform. "Excuse me," he says to the tourist, pointing to the hustler, "do you know this man?" The tourist, looking confused, shrugs. "Then why is he carrying your bags? He's a thief." Soon, other tourists are looking on, and the policeman repeats his charge to the crowd. "This man is a thief," he says in a loud voice, "stay away from him." The hustler drops the bags, and the cop escorts the now thoroughly confused but grateful tourist to a legitimate taxi stand down the block. In less than a minute, and with little fuss, the policeman has saved the tourist from one of New York's oldest scams.<p>
Except the man in uniform is not a policeman. He is a private security guard, hired by local property owners, and possessing no legal powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen. He is a member of a security detail employed by an organization called the Grand Central Partnership. In less than 10 years, this man and several dozen of his colleagues have helped transform the area around the train station from a chaotic maze of threatening streets into one of the safest sections of Manhattan. They have done it without wholesale arrestsand without the use of public money.<p>
Traditionally, security guards have been employed almost exclusively by businesses: either companies whose assets are so valuable that they require extra protection, such as banks and jewelry stores, or those whose size or physical structure renders police patrols ineffective against crime, like hospitals and railroads. But the role of private security is expanding. Increasingly, civilian guards are providing protection in places where only sworn police officers have walked beats: in public parks, central cities, and residential neighborhoods. And increasingly, the salaries of these guards are being paid not by businesses to protect goods, but by citizens hoping to protect their families and neighborhoods.<p>
The history of private security may be nearly as old as crime itself. The earliest security guards may have been the temple priests in the ziggurat at Ur, enlisted by wary Sumerian moneychangers in the third millennium B.C. to protect their lucrative banking operations. In the United States, where businesses have always assumed a large degree of responsibility for protecting themselves, private security guards predate police departments by more than 200 years. Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant and barrelmaker-turned-detective, started the country's first guard-for-hire service in 1860. His first job: dispatching uniformed civilians to protect meat-packing plants in Chicago. Pinkerton's company, which by the 1990s had revenues of more than $600 million, now shares the market with about 57,000 other private security firms in the United States.<p>
Private security is among the fastest-growing industries in the country. During the 1980s, security companies expanded at twice the rate of public law enforcement, and received 70 percent more funds. There are now two security guards employed in the United States for every federal, state, and local police officer. Civilian guards protect everything from nuclear-power plants to theme parks to government buildings, and their role in public life is growing larger. <p>
Private security companies can never take the place of police officers, and most do not want to. Security guards lack the moral authority that only government can give law enforcement. They also are hobbled by law. Civilian guards have only limited powers of arrest. In most states, citizens may make arrests only when a crime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And in some states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspect over to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest. <p>
For these reasons, security guards cannot routinely respond to violent crime. They cannot interrogate suspects or solve murders or negotiate the release of hostages. But they can augment police efforts, helping to maintain order in places where police forces are absent or spread thinly. And they can encourage citizens to follow community standards in a way police officers often cannot.<p>
Security guards can perform these tasks more cheaply than most police departments. Unlike police officers, guards spend nearly all of their time on the job. Since they seldom make arrests, they have little paperwork, and rarely have to testify in court. They are free to walk their beats, andof great importance to employersthey accrue little overtime.<p>
Perhaps most important, security guards are flexible. Because they are not required to respond to calls for emergency service, they can go wherever they are needed to deter crimeand stay there. A business owner who fears robberies cannot force a police officer to stand outside the door of his business. But hired security guards can do just that. Private security gives citizens more control over their own safety. Used intelligently, security guards can be as efficient as any police department at keeping public order.<p><center><b>Law and Disorder</center></b>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, the streets of midtown Manhattan seemed to be sliding into chaos. Aggressive beggars clogged filthy sidewalks. Crimes of all kinds were on the rise. Local business owners became increasingly frustrated with the city's apparent inability to clean up the area. Some companies left Manhattan for good. A cluster of midtown property owners decided to stay, and to restore their neighborhood without the help of City Hall.<p>
In 1985, a group of planners led by real-estate developer Peter Malkin formed a "business-improvement district," a primitive form of quasi-government charged with keeping streets safe and clean. The group carved out a 50-square-block area surrounding Grand Central Station and on the cusp of Times Square. They called it the Grand Central Partnership. The owners of the 220 commercial properties within the district got to vote on the plan, and a majority agreed to join. Soon after, the New York City Council approved the plan. Although the area was not physically vastabout 80 acres of streetsit was in the center of one of the densest commercial districts in the country. Once its boundaries were set, the Grand Central Partnership contained more than 6,000 businesses, comprising a total of some 51 million square feet of commercial space, about the same as in all of downtown Los Angeles.<p>
To raise money for improvements, the property owners began taxing themselves, first at the rate of a little more than 11 cents per square foot of space, later at about 12.5 cents. For small businesses, the levy worked out to a couple of hundred dollars in extra taxes per year. For large properties, such as the PanAm building, the tax could add up to $300,000 annually. Collecting the revenue was easy. A state law passed in 1981 allowed the city of New York to gather the money along with municipal property taxes each year. The city then sent the money back to the partnership. The city threatened property owners who refused to pay with foreclosure. <p>
By 1994, the Grand Central Partnership was raising $6.3 million a year in property taxes. Most of the money went to visible projects. The partnership hired more than 30 street sweepers and trash collectors to pick up after the thousands of litterers who walk through midtown each day. It purchased new garbage cans, street lights and flower boxes, and built new sidewalks and gleaming granite curbs.<p>
To help foreign tourists find their way, the partnership hired multilingual guides and placed them outside of the train station. To make catching a cab easier, it built two taxi stands and stationed a guard in each to direct traffic. To make the neighborhood more inviting to pedestrians, the partnership spent $3 million to install 136 high-power halogen floodlights, which illuminate the Grand Central terminal at night. When more money was needed for capital improvements, the group issued $35 million in bonds, the interest on which was paid for by the property tax.<p>
<b><center>Vacating the Vagrants</b></center>
<p>
Completed in 1913, Grand Central Station was crumbling by the 1980s, and had become a magnet for every kind of social affliction. City police seemed unable or unwilling to restore order. In 1987, the New York Times described the area outside the train station as "chaotic and forbidding, often filthy and sometimes dangerous." Much of the chaos and filth, as well as much of the danger, could be traced to the nearly 500 vagrants living in the building. <p>
Since it had no jurisdiction within the train station, the partnership could not make the vagrants leave the terminal. Instead, it decided to lure them away. For years, hundreds of homeless men and women had gathered on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central to receive food handed out by volunteers. Starting in 1989, the partnership opened a "drop-in center" for the homeless in an old Catholic boys' school a couple of blocks away. Soon, the center was serving meals to hundreds of the same people who had once queued up outside Grand Central.<p>
Inside the old school, the homeless could sit down to eat. And unlike the street in front of the station, the drop-in center was safe, protected by a metal detector and security guards. As additional enticements, the center offered hot showers and job-training classes. Employees of the partnership began to help vagrants living in the train station find more permanent housing, relocating scores of them to shelter at YMCAs and even in city housing. Before long, Grand Central was nearly free of vagrants.<p><b><center>The Shock Troops</b></center><p>
As the partnership's social-service arm enjoyed success with the area's homeless population, its security division worked to assemble a guard force. By the winter of 1988, the security force was ready. Using $1.4 million of its annual revenues, the partnership put 18 uniformed security guards on the street around Grand Central each day, working overlapping shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week.<p>
Gerard Panza is a retired detective who runs the day-to-day operations of the partnership's security force. From his office in a building next to the train station, he plots the movement of crime through the district. On one wall hangs a map of midtown, with colored push pins marking the locations of recent crimes. Though the map is riddled with holes, few pins remain, testament to the success of the partnership's strategy for fighting crime. <p>
At times security guards have tackled serious, violent crime. Guards have disarmed a gunman and also foiled an armed robbery. But as Panza explains, the partnership's most important task is keeping the streets orderly. Security guards, he says, have set out to shove even the pettiest of criminals out of the partnership's domain. No public violation of law or exhibition of disorder is too small to merit the attention of security guards. As a result, Panza says, the incidence of crime of all kinds has fallen. <p>
The New York City Police Department agrees. According to the department's statisticians, within two years after the guards arrived, reports of crime within the Grand Central Partnership had dropped by 20 percent. The decline was even more precipitous in the area immediately surrounding the rail terminal. On the western part of Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Station, a street long famous for muggers and drug dealers, reported crimes dropped 83 percent (from 2,140 in 1988 to 367 in 1990). After three years, reports of crime in the district had dropped 36 percent, an achievement the city's assistant chief of police called "phenomenal." By the spring of 1994, more than five years after security patrol started, reported crime in the Grand Central Partnership had decreased by nearly 53 percent.<p><b><center>A Few Good Men</b></center><p>
The group's directors understood that the guards they hired would do much to shape the partnership's public image. It was a challenging task, because the public perception of private security has never been good. A 1971 Rand report described the "average security guard" as an "underscreened, undertrained, undersupervised, and underpaid" ne'er-do-well with "little education beyond the ninth grade." To this unflattering portrait, the Rand scholars might have added "uncontrollably aggressive" and "psychologically unstable." It is widely believed in the private-security industry that the mentally unbalanced are drawn to guard work. A number of recent, highly publicized incidents in which current and former security guards have committed crimes or gone unaccountably berserk have only seemed to confirm the stereotype. <p>
In order to screen out maladjusted candidates, the Grand Central Partnership advertises the jobs in relatively upscale publications like the New York Times and takes referrals from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Although no federal laws regulate the hiring practices of private security companies, most states require guards to be at least 18 years old, and to be reasonably upstanding, sober citizens with no recent felony charges. In addition to these requirements, the partnership hires only applicants with a high-school diploma, and gives preference to those with military service. Each recruit is required to take a psychological exam and a drug test. Once they meet these standards, rookie guards are trained for seven days, mostly in the specifics of New York law.<p>
There are no explicit physical requirements for the job, but Richard P. Dillon, who runs the security operation for the partnership, says he likes to hire guards who are "as smart and as big and fast as we can get." In at least one category, it is clear he has succeeded. The partnership's guardsmost of whom are mentend to be physically imposing. Some are huge. The guards do not carry weapons, so physical size can be an important source of authority during an altercation.<p>
Successful applicants are paid well by industry standards. Salaries start at $10 an hour, rising to about $13 with seniority and good service. Benefits include health and life insurance, and two weeks' paid vacation. Once on the force, discipline is strict. Absenteeism and lateness are not tolerated, nor is sloppy dress, smoking in public, or even minor violations of the organization's many rules. Guards must use good manners, including courtesy titles, in their dealings with the public. Their uniforms, which bear a distinct and intentional resemblance to those of the city's police department, are crisp and clean. Under them, guards wear bullet-proof vests. <p><center><b>Tight Supervision</center></b>
<p>
Though they have succeeded in forming a largely professional force, the partnership's directors are under no illusions about the quality of person drawn to guard work, or about what could happen if the guards were managed poorly. Direct and quick communication between guards and supervisors is crucial to ensuring that guards are effective and stay within the bounds of the law. Guards are linked to their supervisors at all times by radios routed through the partnership's dispatching center on 34th Street. As they walk their rounds, guards talk frequently with their overseers, checking in over the radio and seeking approval for any consequential decisions.<p>
The partnership's supervisors are well-equipped to offer guidance. Each is a retired New York City police officer, with a minimum of 20 years on the force. The head of the group's security force, Richard Dillon, was a cop for 32 years before retiring in 1988 as assistant chief of the department. Most other supervisors retired as detectives or inspectors. <p>
Veteran supervisors are the partnership's insurance policy against mishaps. In addition to their superior equipmenteach carries a concealed pistol and a radio with a direct line to the police departmentsupervisors bring a solid knowledge of the penal code. While guards, many of whom aspire to be police officers, are apt to swagger and overstep their authority, supervisors remain cool. William O'Connor, a retired detective who keeps watch over seven guards, says he struggles every day to keep his men within their legal bounds. "They're loaded with enthusiasm, and they would want to do more than private citizens can do." But, as O'Connor reminds his guards repeatedly, they are nothing more than civilians in uniforms.<p>
The distinction is vital. Nothing could destroy Grand Central Partnership's security force more quickly than a guard who assumes police powers and abuses citizens. It has happened before. In the late-1980s, members of the Nation of Islam began providing security to public-housing projects in several cities, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. With grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the sect's security firm sent guards into projects to clear out drug dealers. For a time, the group restored a measure of order to the projects. In the process, however, the security guards intimidated not only the drug dealers but residents as well. In a number of housing complexes, police had to intervene to keep the guards under control. In one case, the group lost its contract with a housing project in Los Angeles after being charged with negligence.<p>
In order to avoid similar mistakes, the partnership drills its guards on the limitations on the use of force. Physical force may be used, the guards learn again and again, only as a final resort, in self-defense, or to protect the life of another person. The partnership's security handbook, which explains the limits of civilian authority, is referred to as "the Bible"; guards take refresher courses on it every Thursday afternoon. To further protect themselves from liability suits, guards are required to call their supervisors the moment a problem arises. If the guards make an arrest or become involved in an altercation with a citizen, supervisors routinely interview bystanders as potential witnesses. In the event of a lawsuit, the statements they take may be used to protect the guard. So far, the precaution has not been necessary. The partnership's security force has been sued only once, by a bystander who was injured by a guard chasing a suspect.<p>
The supervisors' broad experience allows them to fill another role as well, that of ambassadors to the city's police. A working partnership between the two groups is vital to the success of the security force, but relations did not come easily. Like most police officers, New York cops are naturally suspicious of security guards, or "square badges," as they are unaffectionately known. In the eyes of police, guards seem to occupy a confusing gray area between public official and private citizen that many cops find disconcerting.<p>
To the surprise of no one, the partnership's guards received a chilly welcome from police when they first arrived in midtown. Due partly to the presence of retired cops in its ranks, however, the guards ultimately developed an amiable relationship with local cops. The two groups now share a substation across from the train terminal, and meet monthly to discuss crime trends.<p><b><center>A Cop's Best Friend</b></center> <p>
Over the years, police have adopted a laissez-faire view of minor lawbreakers around Grand Central, including baggage hustlers, aggressive panhandlers, and small-time marijuana salesmen. "The police are involved with other matters," explains Panza, who spent more than 30 years on the force. "They cannot concentrate on the quality-of-life crimes when they have major crimes. They must first reduce homicides, robberies, assaults."<p>
For police officers, the priorities make good sense. When a cop makes an arrest for disorderly conduct, for instance, he is likely to spend the rest of his shift at the station house filling out forms.<p>
In the meantime, his post out on the streets may remain unfilled, creating opportunities for additional, perhaps more serious crimes to be committed. "That's where we come in," says Panza. "We are the eyes and the ears of the police department. They appreciate our work because we try to solve some problems ourselves, without police intervention."<p>
Guards often go to great lengths to avoid summoning police unnecessarily to the scene of a disturbance. When a knot of marijuana dealers proved especially hard to dislodge, for instance, security guards simply took photographs of the sellers and handed them over to police. Most of the dealers quickly found new retail locations. As in the vast majority of cases handled by the partnership's guards, police never became directly involved. <p>
Of the 6,916 incidents to which the partnership's guards responded in 1994, only 624 required police assistance, and 122 resulted in arrests. That year, guards came across 31 people smoking marijuana in public. In each case, the guards told the smokers to move along, and in each case the smokers did. In cases of narcotics dealing, police were called just 6 percent of the time; in bag-hustling cases, 2 percent; in illegal panhandling cases, 1 percent; and disorderly conduct cases, 9 percent.<p>
In January 1993, security guards told 141 unlicensed peddlers to leave the area. One hundred and thirty-five obeyed the guards without incident. Police were called to handle only six of those cases; only two peddlers were belligerent enough to get arrested.<p>
Most of the time, guards convince violators to comply by explaining which laws they have broken, then politely asking them to leave the area. Most accede. Some do not. <p>
Three-card monte dealers, in particular, have a reputation for ferocity, and only the largest security guards are sent to ask them to vacate the sidewalk. When they are challenged, however, it isn't physical strength most security guards are likely to rely upon, but the power to arrest.<p>
Like all citizens, guards can make arrests when they see crimes committed, hold suspects until the police arrive, and act as complainants in the case against the arrestee. The difference between security guards and most civilians, however, is that guards will, when pushed, actually make an arrest. Most lawbreakers in the area know the guards aren't bluffing.<p>
The threat of even a citizen's arrest is apt to get a wrongdoer's attention. As security chief Richard Dillon puts it, "Criminals, even in New York, where they know they're not going to stay in jail very long, still don't want to be arrested." And, according to Dillon, security guards will make a genuine effort to arrest some criminals. "Our guys chase them five or ten blocks."<p>
When the victims of crime are tourists, security guards make an additional effort to see that the perpetrators are locked up. Visitors from out of town make appealing marks partly because criminals know that even if they are caught, their victims will most likely never return to testify against them in court. The charges will be dropped. To encourage tourists to testify, the partnership authorizes its guards to offer to pay victims' airfare back to New York for the court date. The guards believe this policy makes criminals more inclined to plea-bargain.<p>
<b><center>Deterring Petty Thieves</b></center> <p>
The partnership's guards look strikingly like New York City cops. The resemblance is deliberate. Says Panza, "We want people to think from a distance that it may be a police officer. That is a deterrent. By the time they ascertain that the guy is not a police officer, maybe the opportunity to commit the crime has disappeared." When they are not putting the hustle on bag hustlers, the guards spend their days doing what New York's police department no longer has much time to do: walking a beat and deterring thieves with their uniformed presence. <p>
Coconuts, a music store next to the train station, has lost large amounts of merchandise to theft. Professional shoplifters carry double-walled "booster bags" lined with aluminum to neutralize the store's electronic security system, and they routinely load up with free compact discs and cassette tapes. Store employees, knowing police would be slow to respond, could do little. But the security guards, says Edwin Ortiz, the store's manager, have helped cut down on the thievery. "I call them and they come running and hold the shoplifter till the police come." <p>
Joel Oks, owner of Portabella, a men's clothing store on Vanderbilt Avenue, also had a problem with shoplifters. Now, he says, the thieves have moved on to other areas, along with the drug dealers who used to stand outside his store. The criminals, he claims, have been frightened away by the security guards. "Wouldn't you be scared of this guy?" asks Oks, pointing to Jimmy Mena, a guard the size of a rhinoceros. "We don't have security problems any more. I give them all the credit." <p>
Oks may give the guards credit, but he has no idea how much he gives them in taxes. Like every store owner I surveyed, Oks did not know what he pays each year to the Grand Central Partnership. And like the rest of the owners, he does not seem to care. Whatever the amount, he says, the protection he receives is "well worth it."<p>
Alan Maleh, owner of Goldrush Fine Jewelry at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, agrees. "I haven't seen a uniformed policeman around here in years." The guards, by contrast, "are there all the time. If we give a call, they come running over." Before the security guards, he says, "there were no cops." Muggers "would snatch a purse right in front of the store and they would be laughing, not even running away, walking away. They can't do that now. So they go somewhere else." Without guards, he says, "it's like a jungle out there."<p>
Store owners take comfort in the fact they can reach guards at any time on their portable radios and expect an immediate response. Toni Klein, who owns Cohen's Fashion Optical on 42nd Street, says she does not wait for a crime to occur before calling for help. The moment menacing-looking people enter her store, she requests a guard, who invariably arrives in moments. Like many citizens, Klein might feel foolish calling the police to deter crimes before they are committed. But the money she pays to the partnershipeven though she is unsure of its amountmakes her feel entitled to preventive police protection.<p><b><center>Fresh Flowers in the Men's Room</b></center>
<p>
Perhaps no location in midtown Manhattan has benefited more dramatically from the presence of security guards than Bryant Park, a nine-acre patch of grass  behind the city's public-research library and adjacent to Times Square. Situated in the center of the city and ringed by office buildings, Bryant Park is a natural place for couples to stroll and office workers to eat lunch. For years, however, few dared enter the area. Until the late-1980s, the park was a dangerous and notorious place: Drug-dealing was rampant, people lived on park benches, and there were murders. <p>
Bryant Park's fortunes began to change when two security guards were assigned to the area. The guards started enforcing some simple rules: no panhandling in the park, no drinking, no drugs, no sleeping on the benches, no feeding the pigeons, and no wading in the fountain. For those who didn't get the message, a sign was hung listing the prohibitions in bold letters. Within a short time, many of the park's seedier tenants left for more hospitable terrain. Soon, law-abiding citizens took the place of vagrants, and the atmosphere  began to change. <p>
Bryant Park now hosts concerts during the summer, and free movies on the lawn every Monday night. There is virtually no serious crime. "We're getting so many good folks here doing so many good things," says William O'Connor, who supervises guards in the park." You're an oddball when you're sitting out there being drunk or disorderly."<p>
Nothing illustrates the revival of Bryant Park more powerfully, however, than the condition of its men's room. By their nature, bathrooms are among the most vulnerable of public spaces. In New York, they are often stark symbols of urban decay. Frequently scarred by graffiti, and filled with drug dealers, amorous homosexuals, and vagrants bathing in the sinks, public men's rooms are places most savvy New Yorkers avoid at all costs. <p>
Bryant Park's men's room, however, is different. Its full-time attendant keeps the room tidy and stands guard. As a result of his vigilance, the men's room is as spotless as the lavatory in an upscale restaurant. Next to the sink is a bouquet of fresh flowers, fragrant evidence of the power of private security to enforce order in public spaces.<p>
More communities are certain to follow the example of the Grand Central Partnership. They may have to. Just as rising medical costs have forced hospitals to give more responsibility to nurses, cities may find that sworn police officerswhom they must train, pay relatively well, and sustain on pensionsare too expensive for fighting and deterring certain types of low-level crimes. To maintain basic civic order, rent-a-cops may be a better deal. <p>
Many communities already think so. In 1993, residents of Georgetown, an affluent and historic neighborhood on the western edge of Washington, D.C., hired a security guard from the Wells Fargo Company. Crimes, particularly thefts from cars, had been increasing in the area for years. About 100 neighbors chipped in approximately $160 a yearabout 44 cents a day per householdto hire a uniformed guard to patrol their six-block area. From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., five nights a week, the guard passes each house in the area at least once every hour.<p>
After a year of employing the guard, residents found their streets transformed. Fresh graffiti stopped appearing on buildings. Burglaries within the six-block area decreased by 55 percent, robberies by 50 percent. The security guard also stopped at least two serious crimes. In one instance, he frightened off two men attempting to kidnap a local couple. <p>
The decrease in crime was so dramatic that other parts of Georgetown soon began hiring guards. Within a year and a half, 90 percent of the neighborhood was covered by security guards.<p>
In the mid-1980s, East Hills, New York, a village of 6,700 on Long Island, hired about 30 uniformed security guards to take the place of sworn police officers. The unarmed guards cruise the streets of East Hills 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to county police, and generally acting as guardians of order. Although the service costs residents an extra $360,000 a year in property taxes, it has remained popular. Local politicians credit the program with reducing the town's burglary rate.<p>
Citizens concerned about disorder in their neighborhoods may find that security guards are the most cost-effective way to make their streets safer. "We don't do homicides, we don't do rapes," says O'Connor of the Grand Central Partnership. "But we do other quality-of-life things. Police are not going to come for an illegal peddler when they're up to their necks in gun runs. That's the reason we're here: We do the work the police have trouble getting to because they're so busy." If the results of these private security firms are any indication, this sort of policing can help restore community lifekeeping everyone less busy worrying about crime and more busy building families and neighborhoods.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

     Latest Blow to Spending Myth <P>
     Another Success for Reform in Milwaukee 
<P>

SCHOOL REFORM SWEEPS ACROSS NATION 
<P>
     Advocates of serious education reform are taking heart at the
recent explosion of state-level initiatives.  Many measures have been
enacted and more soon will be put to legislators or the voters.  Some
of them are:
<P>
California.  
<P>     One of the most closely watched reform initiatives is Proposition
174, a referendum on the November ballot in California.  If passed, it
would enable the parents of nearly 5.3 million California
schoolchildren to begin receiving vouchers worth $2,600 in state
funds, or 50 percent of the average per-pupil public school
expenditure, to help pay for their child to attend a private school 
(sectarian included) if they wished. 
<P>
     Leading the opposition to Proposition 174 is a broad coalition of
elected officials, newspapers, civil rights organizations, and the
California education establishment.  With the National Education
Association (NEA) leading the way, opponents of Proposition 174 have
raised $8.9 million, compared with the $718,000 amassed by supporters
of the proposition.  The NEA's affiliate, the California Teachers
Association, recently assessed all members $63 to help fund the anti-
Proposition 174 effort.
<P>
     The pro-voucher forces have tried to make the central issue of
the proposal the fierce opposition of teacher unions and bureaucrats. 
Ken Khachigian, the voucher campaign's chief strategist, believes that
this is the key to success in November.  "I love these kinds of
battles.  It's going up against people who have arrogantly accumulated
power and arrogantly wield it."
<P>
     With the election fast approaching, the outcome appears close. 
An October 21 Los Angeles Times poll has the measure losing, 56
against to 26 percent in favor, with 18 percent still undecided. 
However, in an off-year election, with no more than 35 percent of the
voters expected to show, opponents are not confident of victory.
<P>
Puerto Rico.  
  <P>   Another sweeping measure has already made it to the statute book. 
Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Rossello, on September 3,  signed into
law a bill creating an education voucher system potentially as radical
as that about to be voted on in California.  The vouchers, which are
limited to $1,500, allow families the opportunity to choose which
public or private school their child will attend.  The new law also
offers high school students the chance to take university-level
courses.
<P>
     Governor Rossello claims that the idea behind the program is to
broaden the educational choices for students.  As he made clear
shortly after signing the bill, "This is not a matter of good schools
versus bad schools.  Who will decide which is which?  Who will have
that power?  That's very simple -- the family."
<P>
     The $10 million pilot project went into effect immediately after
it was passed, despite the fact that the administrative unit which
will review applications has not yet been set up.  About one percent
of the public school population will be eligible during the first
year, with plans to expand later.  The state legislature will review
the project in September 1997, when it will "determine whether it
should continue, modify, or amplify the program."
<P>
Michigan.  
 <P>    Governor John Engler and the legislature recently eliminated all
state property taxes earmarked for schools, or about two-thirds of the
state's public education money.  As Governor Engler noted, "We've been
trying to do something about property taxes and school reform for two
decades.  It was time to do something drastic."  Engler is now
proposing to raise the sales tax and give each child's parents $4,500
to spend on their current schools, on other public schools, or on one
of the "charter public schools" that he would authorize any public
authority or group of teachers to create.
<P>
     The Governor hopes that the tax revolt will end the political
power of the most powerful teacher's union in the state, the Michigan
Chapter of the National Education Association.  With almost 70 percent
of school funding eliminated by the new law, Michigan has only until
fiscal year 1995 to come up with a new means of funding education. 
School reform proponents hope that the crisis will force a
consideration of revolutionary cost-saving measures and reforms. 
<P>
     Michigan certainly needs a shakeup in its school system.  The
state ranks 16th in school spending but 39th in students' SAT scores. 
Engler, who has already ruled out an income tax, hopes his plan will
put some competition into the Michigan public school system.  The
Michigan constitution currently prohibits public aid to private
schools.  Thus, the constitution must be amended before a private
school choice program could be implemented.
<P>
Georgia.  
  <P>   School choice advocates recently uncovered a 32-year-old statute
which permits any child between the ages of six and nineteen to
receive an "education grant" to pay all or part of the tuition at a
non-sectarian private school. 
<P>
     The law, approved by the Georgia legislature in 1961, originally
was passed to enable white students to flee desegregated public
schools.  Ironically, Atlanta lawyer Glenn Delk, who stumbled onto the
law by accident, now hopes to use the law to help poor, inner-city
children go to the private school of their choice.  Delk and the
Georgia Public Policy Foundation are urging parents to go to their
local school boards and demand funds for private schools.  Despite the
law, the Georgia education establishment has refused to provide these
funds, claiming that it will ruin public education.  State school
Superintendent Werner Rogers says he will ask the legislature to
repeal the law in January, when it next meets.  If the state does not
comply with the law and hand out the funds soon, Delk says parents
will file a lawsuit against the state.  School choice enthusiasts
estimate that each student would be entitled to as much as $3,800
under the law. 
<P>
Wisconsin.  
  <P>   Low-income families in Wisconsin, with the help of the Kansas
City-based Landmark Legal Foundation, are asking a federal court in
Milwaukee to declare unconstitutional the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program's ban on religious school participation.  These low-income
families have been turned away from the plan, which provides a $1,600
voucher for children to attend the private non-sectarian school of
their choice,  because the participating private schools have limited
space.
<P>
     The lawsuit is being brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Land-mark's attorneys claim the prohibition on the use of a voucher at
a religious school is a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional
rights to the free exercise of religion and equal protection under the
law.  Landmark President Jerald L.  Hill declares that "The Milwaukee
school choice plan has been a tremendous success for those fortunate
enough to participate, but the plan's unconstitutional exclusion of
religious schools deprives hundreds of children access.  We want to
remove that barrier to educational opportunity for low-income children
in Milwaukee."
<P>
     Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams, who steered the
Milwaukee plan through the legislature, enthusiastically endorses the
lawsuit.  "I am thrilled that Landmark Legal Foundation has returned," 
says Williams, "to help us empower more low-income families with
school choice opportunities.  Landmark's representation gives low-
income parents a fighting chance against the mammoth education
establishment." 
<P>
     The lawsuit will have important repercussions throughout the
school reform movement.  With California and other jurisdictions such
as Jersey City, New Jersey, including religious schools in their
proposals, the Milwaukee case could be crucial in finally clarifying
"church and state" issues in the politics of education choice.  This
could be the case that will finally bring genuine reform to the
American educational system.

   <P> 
PROFILE:  BUSINESSMEN LEAD CHOICE MOVEMENT
<P>
     As many business leaders struggle in their efforts to reform
America's failing schools, two business leaders, Joseph Alibrandi and
Bret Schundler, are having a profound impact on the education reform
debate.
<P>
     Joseph Alibrandi is CEO of the Los Angeles-based Whittaker
Corporation, a $190 million aerospace supplier, and is spearheading
Proposition 174, the California school choice initiative.  Formerly
chairman of the California Business Roundtable's Education Task Force,
Alibrandi believes that the biggest problem in education is the system
itself.  He is convinced that it will not be long before other top
business leaders will come to exactly the same conclusion that he did: 
school choice is the only hope for America's education system. 
Alibrandi maintains that until parents have the power to choose the
best school for their child, and can move education dollars to their
chosen school, the system will continue to fail the children. 
<P>

     Alibrandi emphasizes that school choice means the most to poor,
inner-city youngsters since they cannot afford to write out a check
for a private school or easily move to another neighborhood to find a
better school.  The only way to help these young-sters, he says, is to
allow an effective marketplace in learning to emerge through parental
choice.  Alibrandi is state chairman of A Better Choice, the state
organization behind Proposition 174, which will be on the November
ballot in California.
<P>
     Another businessman taking an active role in reforming the school
system is newly reelected Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.  A 34-
year-old former executive at Salomon Bro-thers, the Wall Street
investment firm, Schundler overcame the city's long-entrenched
Democratic machine in November 1992 to become Jersey City's first
Republican mayor since World War I.  In May 1993, 68 percent of Jersey
City voters reelected Schund-ler to a full four-year term in a city
that is only 6 percent Republican. 
<P>
     One of Schundler's top promises is to put into place a radical
school-choice plan for Jersey City.  Like Alibrandi, he now believes
the key to reform is to allow parents to choose the school that best
fits their child's needs.  Schundler argues that "The root of our
problem is how government is spending our money -- the tremendously
low productivity of government spending because of its fixation on
bureaucratic approaches."
<P>
     Schundler hopes to introduce his school choice bill to the New
Jersey legislature early next year.  He will need a majority in the
legislature -- and possibly two-thirds -- if Governor Jim Florio wins
reelection in November and vetoes the plan.  If the bill passes,
Jersey City will be the first American city to have a city-wide school
voucher system 
<P>
     Alibrandi and Schundler are giving new hope and direction to the
many business leaders who have grown frustrated with
business/education partnerships that cost a great deal of corporate
dollars and yet often do not lead to tangible improvements.

FORTUNE HOLDS SIXTH ANNUAL EDUCATION SUMMIT
<P>
     In September, Fortune magazine sponsored its sixth annual
education conference in Washington, DC.  Participating were over three
hundred leaders in education reform, drawn from government, business,
and academia.  The conference, entitled "How Far Have We Come?" 
evaluated business efforts to reform education.
<P>
     Speakers at the conference included Secretary of Education
Richard W.  Riley, Massachusetts Senator Edward M.  Kennedy,
Pennsylvania Representative William F.  Goodling, Michigan Governor
John R.  Engler, and David T.  Kearns, Chairman and CEO of the New
American Schools Development Corporation.
<P>
     Many speakers pointed out the education reform achievements of
the business community, but both speak-ers and participants agreed
that these have only been modest.  As Fortune Managing Editor Marshall
Loeb said, "Education reform is clearly not happening fast enough. ..
.. ..  In this increasingly competitive global economy, our students
must be more than adequately prepared for the challenges that the
rapidly changing market demands." 
<P>
     Although school choice and other innovative reform ideas were not
discussed as much as they had been in some past summits, Governor
Engler urged business leaders to push for structural changes in the
education system.  Engler discussed the elimination of school property
taxes in Michigan, charter schools, and school choice.  He claimed
that most present-day reforms have been "tinkering around the edge of
the system" and failed to make a real difference.
<P>
     The November 1 issue of Fortune will cover the Education Summit.
<P>
     
ONCE AGAIN, SPENDING ISN'T EVERYTHING
<P>
     A state-by-state analysis, issued September 9 by the Washington,
D.C.-based American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the nation's
largest private, bipartisan membership association of state
legislators, is the latest blow to the notion that increased school
spending is the key to better education.  The ALEC survey, A Report
Card on American Education:  A State-by-State Analysis 1972-73 - 1992-
93, is the first extensive study since the U.S.  Department of
Education ceased publishing the State Education Performance Chart in
1990. 
<P>
     Since 90 percent of all school funding accrues at the state and
local level, ALEC's state-by-state figures are a better guide to
spending and results than the more frequently used federal funding
figures.  School spending has increased by 390 percent over a twenty-
year period (47 percent in constant 1992 dollars) while school
enrollment has decreased by 7 percent during the same period.
<P>
     The study compares state rankings in each of the following
assessments:  scores from the National Assessment of Education
Progress (NAEP), the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and the American
College Test (ACT), as well as the school graduation rate. 
Consistently among the top ten in three or more of these assessments
were nine states:  Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  With the exception of
Wisconsin and Wyoming, all these states were in the bottom half in
school spending.  And all of them spent at least 40 percent less than
the state with the highest amount -- New Jersey -- which was $10,561. 
<P>
     The two states showing the great-est overall improvement of test
scores in the past twenty years in the SATs were Mississippi (up 151
points, to rank 16th in the nation) and Alabama (up 146 points, to
rank 14th).  In terms of current annual school spending, they rank
50th and 40th, respectively.
<P>
     Although a few states with high spending levels do achieve high
academic rankings, there are just as many -- if not more -- states
scoring high while spending less (See BEI #29).  This shows that money
does not correlate with better quality. 
<P>
     For further information or a copy of the report, contact Noel
Card at ALEC, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C.  20002,
or call (202) 547-4646.
<P>
     
SURVEY SAYS PAVE PROGRAM A SUCCESS
<P>
     According to a survey released by Family Service America, Inc., a
nonprofit organization headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
Milwaukee's Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) private
voucher program has successfully involved parents of low-income
students in their child-ren's education.
<P>
     PAVE is a non-profit volunteer  organization established to
provide families equal access to educational opportunities.  In 1992,
PAVE established a scholarship program designed to help low-income
families attend private and parochial schools in Milwaukee.  The
program funds half of the yearly tuition of children whose families
qualify to receive federal lunch programs. 
<P>
     The survey of 955 low-income parents whose children received
scholarships from the PAVE program found that parents are pleased and
that a majority of the parents are involved in school functions.  Some
96 percent of parents participate in school conferences while 67
percent regularly attend school meetings and 63 percent attend school
activities.
<P>
     According to the survey, parents of students in the PAVE program
also take an active role in their children's education at home.  The
survey found 94 percent of the parents read to their elementary school
children, the same percentage help with math problems, and 85 percent
assist with penmanship and writing assignments each week.  As one
mother of a PAVE scholarship student noted, "PAVE has dispelled the
myth that poor parents don't care about their children's education."
<P>
     Besides being involved in their children's education and school
activities, the parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with their
school, teachers, principals, and the amount their child is learning. 
Among the respondents, 90 percent of PAVE parents are satisfied with
their school choice.  Even the few parents (10 percent) who were
dissatisfied with their school choice were careful to point out in
their written comments that they were satisfied with the PAVE program
itself.  In addition, 96 percent were satisfied with the teachers in
their child's school, and 93 percent were also satisfied with the
principals.  The survey found that 96 percent of the parents were
satisfied with the amount their child was learning.
<P>
     Overall, the survey indicates that after the first year of the
PAVE program, it is well on its way to accomplishing the mission of
"providing the financial means for low-income parents to choose the
school best suited to their child's needs, just as more affluent
parents have done for years."
<P>
     For more information, write PAVE at 1434 West State Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53233, or call (414) 747-1580.

SCHOOL CHOICE CONTINUES TO GAIN GROUND 
 <P>   Business leaders and others supporting true education reform can
take heart from the surge of school choice legislation over the past
year.  Whether confined to public schools or expanded to include
private and parochial schools, school choice bills are moving in state
after state.  In fact, choice is the centerpiece of a growing grass
roots challenge to a government-run school system that is failing in
many areas of the country, particularly in America's inner cities.
 <P>   A clear pattern is emerging, according to the annual survey of
school choice measures published recently by The Heritage Foundation.
In 1993, some form of school choice legislation was introduced or
pending in 34 states.  In addition, 33 state governors have indicated
support for some form of school choice, up from 29 in 1992.  And, most
important, at least 35 states have parents' and grassroots' coalitions
working for school choice reforms.  Thus, despite the defeat last
November of Proposition 174, a major school choice initiative in
California (see BEI # 34), and the recent narrow defeat of a school
choice bill in the Arizona legislature, the movement continues to grow
stronger.
<P>     Voucher Programs a Success. Voucher programs passed in earlier
years continued successfully in 1993.  For example, the Wisconsin
state legislature in 1989 introduced a voucher program for Milwaukee
(see BEI # 3).  Currently, 1,000 low-income children can obtain a
voucher worth as much as $2,967 to attend a private school.  Despite
the bitter opposition of education bureaucrats, including the state
school boards association and the teachers unions, the Milwaukee
choice program withstood legal challenges and is forcing changes in
Wisconsin's educational establishment.  
  <P>   Although religious schools have space available in Milwaukee,
only 742 students received vouchers during the 1993-1994 school year
because religious schools are barred from the program and there is not
enough space available in other private schools. To use this space
availability more effectively, Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist and
Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams have called on state
legislators to increase the number of eligible students  from 1,000 to
5,000. This would be done by letting the students attend not just
secular private schools, but also parochial schools.
  <P>  In addition, the Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law
firm, has filed a lawsuit to expand the Milwaukee program. The suit,
on behalf of low-income families in Wisconsin, asks a federal court in
Milwaukee to include parochial schools in the Milwaukee Parental
Choice Program.  Landmark's attorneys claim prohibiting the use of the
vouchers at religious schools is a violation of the plaintiffs'
constitutional right to the free exercise of religion and equal
protection under the law.  
 <P>    The past year also saw the most comprehensive school choice law
yet passed in the United States.  Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Rosello
signed into law an educational voucher system for the entire territory
of Puerto Rico (see BEI #33). The vouchers, limited to $1,500 each,
offer families the opportunity to choose the public or private school
for their child. The new law also gives high school students the
opportunity to take university-level courses.  While opponents have
challenged the Puerto Rico reform in the courts, school choice
advocates are confident they will prevail.
   <P>  Open enrollment legislation, which gives parents the right to
choose the public school their child will attend, also has been making
headway.  Currently, six states offer "intradistrict open enrollment,"
meaning parents can choose a school within the confines of their
child's school district. Ten states have enacted "interdistrict open
enrollment plans," meaning parents can choose any public school within
the state, not just within their local district.  In addition, seven
states now have voluntary intradistrict plans, and four states have
voluntary interdistrict plans under which school districts can choose
to offer the programs.  And finally, six states have special,
district-based intradistrict plans in which individual cities have
implemented choice programs. 
  <P>  Charter Schools Explosion. Legislation creating chartered,
autonomous public schools is gaining ground, too.  Charter schools are
schools run by teachers, parents, principals, and others outside the
education bureaucracy, and are subject to much less regulation.  Prior
to 1993, two states had enacted charter school legislation: California
and Minnesota.
  <P>   In 1993, thirteen state legislatures considered charter school
legislation or the expansion of existing charter school laws.  Of
these, six states enacted such legislation: Colorado, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.  In early 1994,
Kansas became the ninth state to pass charter school legislation.
Private Voucher Programs Flourish. While legislative reformers were
busy introducing school choice initiatives, many business leaders took
matters into their own hands through private voucher programs. These
privately funded programs are designed to help low-income families
afford the school of their choice for their children.  During the
1993-1994 school year, over 5,000 low-income students have been able
to attend private schools as a result of these efforts.
  <P>   Private scholarship programs were pioneered by businessman Peter
Flanigan of Dillon, Read, & Company (See BEI #6, 9, 30, 34) in 1986.
His "Student-Sponsor Partnership" enabled 725 low-income high school
students in New York to attend private schools in the 1993-94 school
year.
   <P>  Likewise, the Golden Rule Insurance Company's Indianapolis-based
"CHOICE Charitable Trust" scholarship program has been an inspiration
to many corporate and philanthropic charities. Working with other
business groups in Indiana, the Trust helps poor children in
Indianapolis attend private schools  by awarding scholarships covering
up to half their tuition costs. During the 1993-1994 school year, some
1,100 pupils used these vouchers. While the education establishment
has vigorously attacked Golden Rule CEO J. Patrick Rooney, business
and philanthropic organizations see the benefits of the program and
are emulating it.  In 1993, there were eleven private scholarship
programs based on the Golden Rule model, up from five in 1992.  In
addition, at least three other cities are planning to begin similar
programs in September 1994.
  <P>   Public Supports Choice. The growth of school choice initiatives
coincides with strong public support for school choice.  For instance,
in a January 1994 telephone poll of Minnesotans conducted by the
Gordon S. Black Corporation for the Center of the American Experiment
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some 61% of the respondents favored
introduction of a voucher system.  In addition, 86% of the respondents
supported the interdistrict, public school choice program currently in
place in Minnesota.<P>

LOUISIANA BUSINESS GROUP STRESSES NEED FOR RADICAL REFORM 
 <P>    After a decade of failed reform in the Louisiana school system,
Louisiana business leaders are now calling for radical reform.
According to "Getting There . . . A Better Tomorrow Beginning Today,"
a recent report of the Louisiana Association of Business & Industry,
"Piecemeal attempts to change the present system in Louisiana haven't
worked and won't work.  The present system is a monopoly, and it has
no incentive to change."
<P>     Like other states, Louisiana has poured billions of dollars into
its public elementary and secondary schools. The state spent
approximately 60 percent of its revenues (excluding federal funds) 
$2.4 billion  on education in 1991-1992, the latest year for which
figures are available. In addition, the state spent $5.2 million in
1991-1992 on remediation in the elementary and secondary schools, and
another $14 million is spent on remediation in the state's colleges
and universities.
<P>     Despite this level of spending, Louisiana ranked 40th among the
41 states which gave their eighth graders the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP) math test in 1992.  In addition, a recent
U.S. Department of Education report says  about 58 percent of fourth
graders in the state read below the "basic" level and cannot
understand simple stories.
 <P>    Along with pouring more money into their schools, Louisiana has
lowered its class sizes over the past twenty years.  Between the
1971-1972 and 1991-1992 school years, the number of students in public
schools dropped 12 percent.  Despite this drop in enrollment, the
number of school employees went up 27 percent. Yet, the report states,
"Education in Louisiana is run like a collection of warring fiefdoms 
each protecting its own turf and seeking more money and power  after
losing sight of the goal: the education of the people."
  <P>   In order to overcome the inertia of the present bureaucratic
system, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry recommends
establishing public charter schools and a voucher program which would
allow parents to choose among government and nongovernmental schools. 
<P>

NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS GROUP EDUCATES STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN BUSINESS
PRINCIPLES 
  <P>   Business leaders' frustration with the lack of general business
knowledge among students is not confined to America. A private group
of business leaders in New Zealand have formed Enterprise New Zealand
Trust.  Its goal: a nationwide program to promote business and
economic education in the schools. According to Ken Baker, Executive
Director of Enterprise New Zealand, "It is now realized that if we are
to improve the standard of living of future New Zealanders, then we
need to be much more enterprising, [and] that we need to develop a
positive attitude towards business . . . . In our schools, we had a
non business culture. School programs operate as though business were
an aberration.  Given their background this is not surprising."
<P>     One of the trust's programs, Enterprise Studies, teaches
entrepreneurial skills to students through contact with local
enterprises, including businesses and volunteer agencies, both as
sources of information and as subjects of study.  After studying
entrepreneurship in the classroom, students are given the chance to
use their new skills by running some form of short-term enterprise.
  <P>   Enterprise New Zealand also instructs teachers and principals in
the principles of entrepreneurship and economics.  These instructional
courses have been extremely helpful in enabling teachers and
principals to apply the techniques of business in the classroom.  One
graduate, Barry Bean, the Principal of Mount Maunganui College,
comments: "I firmly believe that many of the procedures/ methods of
the business world can be transferred to schools.  I am more than
happy to promote the merits of the Principles of Management course to
our local group of Principals."

PRIVATE VOUCHER UPDATE 
 <P>    A recent report from The National Scholarship Center, Just Doing
It: First Annual Survey of the Private Voucher Movement in America,
shows the private voucher movement is picking up momentum all over the
country. According to the report, nearly 5,000 needy elementary and
secondary students are benefitting from one of eleven established
private voucher programs based on the model first developed by the
Golden Rule Insurance Company.  The survey addresses topics ranging
from the number and kinds of schools involved, to the income and other
characteristics of the children and families served, to the
administrative rules and operation of the programs. It gives a
prognosis for the future and lists programs that are likely to be
launched in the 1994-1995 school year.
 <P>    The comprehensive survey is only one of many indications that the
private voucher movement is beginning to receive the attention it
deserves. For instance, Golden Rule, which launched the Educational
CHOICE Charitable Trust program in Indianapolis, Indiana, was among
the 101 companies nationwide selected by members of the United States
Senate and Childhelp USA, a private organization working to combat
child abuse and neglect, to receive special recognition for unique
programs that are helping children and their families to succeed.     
Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust's executive director, Timothy P.
Ehrgott, accepted Golden Rule's award at a Congressional Awards
Luncheon hosted by Senator Orrin Hatch and Congressman Charles Rangel. 
Commented Ehrgott, "We only wish that the CHOICE families could be
with us in Washington.  They are the ones who have made enormous
sacrifices and deserve all the recognition.  We are just pleased to
have been able to help."
  <P>  The private voucher movement has hit even the nation's capital. 
Beginning in the Spring 1994 semester, scholarships became available
for grades K-8 to students who live in the District of Columbia and
are eligible for federally funded (free or reduced-price) school
lunches.  The scholarships are offered by the Washington Scholarship
Fund on a first-come, first-served basis and cover half of private
school tuition, up to a maximum of $1,500.  This semester, 50
scholarships were made available.  
<P>     Contributors to the Washington Scholarship Fund include such
major donors as Applied Energy Systems, the Bradley Foundation, and
business leaders such as Roger Naill, Robert J. Thompson, Randall
Byrnes, Patrick Rooney, and Earle Williams, in addition to a number of
smaller individual donors, including The Heritage Foundation.

<title>Setting the Record Straight on Medicare Part B -- Heritage</title>

<h3>SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MEDICARE PART B</h3>

By John C. Liu<br> 
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No . 72<br>
November 17, 1995<br>

<p>
"Under the Medicare proposals people could be making $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 a year and still receive medical assistance provided by the Federal Government from a tax on a poor man who has not enough money to put butter on his bread.... We should help people who cannot pay their own medical bills...."  -- U.S. Senator Russell B. Long (D-LA), August 31, 1964
<p>
"The American public is tired of political promises that go unfulfilled. They realize that tough choices must be made.... The first plan... would take $114 billion over five years from Medicare... increasing co-payments for beneficiaries.... The second and third plans reduce the spending cuts somewhat but replace them with substantial tax increases. The second plan... provides for $45 billion in Medicare cuts... increasing co-payments for beneficiaries.... My own preference would be  ... similar to Plan II." -- Leon E. Panetta, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, Press Release, May 26, 1992
<p>
"The President had less compelling reasons to veto the continuing budget resolution. His chief stated reason -- to protect Medicare patients -- is purely political. The bill would, as it should, prevent Medicare premiums for Part B... from falling $3.60 a month. At a time when Government services across the board will be sliced, there is really no reason to cut Medicare costs for the politically powerful elderly." -- <i>The New York Times</i>, November 14, 1995, p. A24
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The White House is attempting to draw a "defining difference" between the Medicare Part B premium savings in the respective House-Senate Balanced Budget Reconciliation Acts passed last month and President Clinton's own budget plan, released in June 1995. President Clinton's stated reason for opposing a continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating until December 1, 1995, is a provision requiring Medicare beneficiaries to continue paying what they pay today:  31.5 percent of the Medicare Part B program's costs.<sup>1</sup>  Medicare is also the most contentious issue in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995.<p>The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program, also known as Part B, pays for physician, auxiliary, and outpatient services, and for dialysis for those with end-stage renal (kidney) disease. Beneficiaries enroll in Part B voluntarily. In addition to the Part B premium, they are responsible for a $100 per year deductible. Once a beneficiary satisfies the deductible, the taxpayer pays 80 percent of all physician and related services for the rest of the calendar year. Utilization is unlimited, which means the program is an open-ended entitlement. Taxpayers today subsidize approximately 68.5 percent of the Part B program, regardless of a beneficiary's income or past level of contribution. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the uninsured population -- working Americans or their dependents, the working poor, and the lower middle class -- are forced to spend hundreds of dollars a year subsidizing Medicare, including high income beneficiaries through a mandatory Medicare payroll tax (HI tax) and general federal income taxes. 
<p>
When Part B was implemented in 1966, the Democratic Congress, under the leadership of the Johnson Administration, set the premium level to require beneficiaries to finance 50 percent of the program's costs. This was Congress's original contract with the American taxpayers. The terms of the contract have been broken. Due to excessively high utilization rates by seniors, Part B costs have grown much faster than the annual Social Security cost of living adjustments (COLAs). Since 1984, Congress has taken the politically safe route of requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B costs. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93), President Clinton and Congress again set the Part B premium to cover 25 percent of costs. OBRA 93 applies to Part B premiums from 1996 to 1998. Because of government miscalculations, the current Part B premium of $46.10 per month covers 31.5 percent of the program as opposed to 25 percent.<sup>2</sup><p><b>THE NEED FOR REFORM</b><p>In its 1995 Annual Report, the Board of Trustees for the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund concluded:  "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last 5 years. For the same time period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program."3  Two of the board's seven members are private citizens and referred to as "public trustees."  In the "Summary of the 1995 Annual Reports," these public trustees state:  "The SMI Trust Fund, while in balance on an annual basis, shows a growth rate of costs which is clearly unsustainable. Moreover, this fund is projected to be 75 percent or more financed by general revenues, so that given the general budget deficit problem, it is a major contributor to the larger fiscal problems of the nation."<sup>4</sup><p>In response to the Trustees' report, Congress proposed a minor yet significant step toward controlling the ever-increasing tax
payer subsidy for Medicare Part B:  requiring both current and future beneficiaries to contribute 31.5 percent of program costs ($53.50 per month) effective January 1, 1996, thereby reducing the substantial taxpayer subsidy while helping to insure that beneficiaries pay a fairer share of the costs. Under this policy, Medicare will save taxpayers $47.1 billion over the next seven years while continuing to maintain a very generous subsidy to enrollees.
<p>
The Clinton Administration and liberals in Congress insist that a 25 percent enrollee contribution ($43.70 per month) must prevail, which would force all working Americans to increase their current 68.5 percent subsidy to 75 percent as of January 1, 1996. Since Part B premiums are currently $46.10 per month, it is disingenuous for liberals in Congress to call a $53.50 per month premium in 1996 an "increase of $11 per month." 
<p>
Coincidentally, President Clinton's Health Security Act of 1993 (H.R. 3500/S. 1757), which modified the Part B benefit package while adding to the federal deficit, would have required an increase of $22 billion in premiums, or about $11 per month per enrollee.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, Leon Panetta, now President Clinton's Chief of Staff, as Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget recognized that the current $100 per year deductible was not acting to deter unnecessary utilization of medical services. In order to reduce the volume of small claims, an option advanced by Chairman Panetta included increasing the Part B deductible to $150 per year, indexed for future years. The budgetary savings from this change alone would have yielded $11.84 billion between 1993 and 1997.<sup>6</sup>  Similarly, the Senate's version of the seven-year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 included exactly the same proposal, to be effective January 1, 1996. It is therefore ironic for the Clinton Administration to condemn congressional efforts to balance the budget as "extreme proposals" that would "violate our values."
<p>
<b>TAXING THE ELDERLY</b>
<p>

Even President Clinton's own proposal to maintain a 25 percent contribution level would require Medicare beneficiaries to pay a larger portion of Part B's estimated costs. Worse, the 1993 Clinton budget raised the taxes of the nation's elderly receiving Social Security benefits. Despite the Clinton Administration's claim that the new 1993 tax increases were levied only on the rich, individual recipients earning $34,000 a year and couples with income over $44,000 a year saw the maximum portion of their Social Security check subject to income taxes jump from 50 percent to 85 percent, effective January 1, 1994. In other words, the Clinton Administration already has reduced the monthly income of senior citizens in its 1993 budget. Because of the revenues already being obtained from this specific tax, opponents of Medicare reform are able to claim that they are not dipping into the pockets of senior citizens. Nevertheless, this claim can only be short lived since the Clinton proposal would increase Part B premiums in 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Contrary to allegations by the Clinton Administration and congressional liberals that an increase in Part B premiums is designed to finance a tax cut for the rich, Medicare reform legislation requires any savings to be deposited in a newly created "Medicare Preservation Trust Fund."  The legislation explicitly states that the savings accrued from the Medicare Part B program may not be used to offset any change in the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, Medicare savings deposited into the new Trust Fund are in the form of public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and may be used only for Medicare expenditures.
<p>
The record clearly shows that the desire to ease the taxpayers' burden for Part B by raising deductibles, or even by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of program costs, is shared by liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. It is not an "extreme proposal."  Nor does it violate the values of equity and fairness. As Robert Reischauer, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and currently a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution stated recently:  "`31.5% as part of a fundamental structural change in Medicare is entirely appropriate, especially when combined with a surcharge on upper income beneficiaries,' as called for in the GOP plan."<sup>7</sup><p>

Executive Memo #401<br>

January 27, 1994<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
 
As the new Congress contemplates a major overhaul of the costly and 
controversial housing programs managed by the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD), all parties to this unfolding process should 
recognize the extent to which existing HUD policy and the three-decade 
legacy of failed reforms have been driven by the business and bureaucratic 
interests that benefit directly from HUD's $28 billion annual budget. 
Although HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros's proposals supposedly break with 
the past, they may do little to reduce taxpayer handouts to the housing 
industry. Some previous HUD Secretaries have pressed hard to end special-
interest programs for the industry, only to be thwarted by the congressional 
leadership. But the new Congress, elected with a mandate for real reform, 
has the opportunity to free HUD from its industry shackles and forge a new 
housing policy better suited to the needs of the poor and the interests of the 
taxpayer. 
<P>
The essential tension within U.S. housing policy is between the more 
traditional approach, called project-based assistance, where federal assistance
is linked to a specific building and assistance to the poor first goes through 
developers and local housing authorities, and the newer approach, called 
household-based assistance, which goes directly to the tenants so that they 
can afford better housing. In project-based assistance, the government, 
operating through a local public housing authority or a non-profit 
organization, provides a specific housing unit to an eligible household. The 
unit is usually part of a larger project that was constructed or renovated with
federal financial assistance: grants, low-cost loans, operating subsidies, or 
tax breaks to investors. Examples of project-based assistance are public 
housing, Section 8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation programs, 
and the Section 236 program. Although new commitments to these programs 
have been reduced since the reforms enacted under the Reagan 
Administration, more than 70 percent of HUD beneficiaries are still in such 
programs. 
<P>
Numerous studies over the past three decades indicate why reformers 
encounter intense opposition from housing industry lobbyists whenever an 
attempt is made to shift money from project-based programs to household-
based assistance. These studies conclude that project-based assistance is 
about twice as expensive as household-based assistance per household 
served. In addition to their high costs, project-based programs are less 
desirable because they segregate and concentrate the poor in specific inner-
city neighborhoods, typically with high crime rates and few job 
opportunities. Despite their sometimes staggering costs and enormous social 
problems, project-based programs are strongly supported by the housing 
industry and such organizations as the National Association of Housing and 
Redevelopment Officials. The reason: these programs channel money 
directly to developers, rental organizations, and housing authorities. 
<P>
In contrast, HUD's household-based programs provide eligible households 
with a certificate or voucher that can be applied to some or all of the rent fo
the apartment of their choice. Such apartments must meet certain minimum 
quality standards and are available through private landlords. Household-
based programs are substantially less costly per household served. One 
reason for this is that landlords compete for subsidized tenants just as they 
must for other tenants -- by offering the best price. In project- based 
programs they must lobby successfully for inclusion in the program, and 
often favoritism rather than need is the deciding factor. Household- based 
programs also provide households with a much wider choice of 
neighborhoods and allow them to be integrated into the community at large. 
<P>
Absent the intense industry pressure to maintain various forms of project-
based assistance, HUD probably long ago would have shifted the bulk of its 
resources and beneficiaries toward a voucher and certificate-based program 
to reduce costs, improve the quality of life for tenants, and increase the 
number of households that could be assisted with the same money. But 
because of industry pressure and pressure from lawmakers heavily supported 
by the industry, HUD continues to operate grossly inefficient project-based 
programs. Secretary Cisneros's Reinvention Blueprint gives the appearance 
of moving toward more sensible policies. But he, too, is subject to the 
inexorable pull of special interests and flinches from proposing a complete 
reform, instead sitting on the fence. 
<P>
Cisneros seems torn. Recognizing the manifest advantages of vouchers, the 
Secretary argues correctly in his Blueprint that project-based aid is a costly 
and wasteful way to help the poor. The Blueprint calls for an orderly 
withdrawal of federal support for public housing. It also proposes converting 
operating subsidies for public housing agencies to rental assistance for 
residents, who could stay where they were or move to apartments in the 
private rental market. Had this been the extent of the reinvention effort, 
Secretary Cisneros would be remembered for his major reform of HUD. 
Unfortunately, the remainder of the Blueprint is little more than a 
repackaging of the costly project-based programs and financing concessions 
that enrich the housing industry. 
<P>
For developers, builders, and non-profit organizations, Cisneros calls for a 
new Affordable Housing Fund to provide federal financial assistance for the 
production and rehabilitation of housing. And for those in the industry who 
make their living in sales and finance, there is to be a new, supposedly more 
entrepreneurial Federal Housing Administration (FHA) "to make home 
ownership affordable for more first time homebuyers, residents of inner-
cities and other groups and communities underserved by the private market." 
While the goal sounds lofty, similar efforts to extend taxpayer dollars and 
credits to not-yet-ready-to-own households in the past threw the once-
venerable FHA into technical insolvency when it lost more than $4 billion in 
one year. 
<P>
Indicative of the sorts of costly federal housing programs that members of 
the housing industry advocate, and their friends in Congress provide, are 
policies recently presented in a major housing trade association's campaign 
literature on behalf of one congressman running for reelection. According to 
the association, this congressman deserved reelection in 1994 because he 
favors reversing the tax code's passive loss restrictions on real estate, 
continuing tax-exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds, retaining tax credits for 
investors in low-income housing, and increasing FHA loan limits and loan-
to-value ratios. Each of these measures directly benefits Americans whose 
incomes are high enough to need tax shelters or who can afford higher-cost 
homes. 
<P>
Such industry-supported housing assistance programs provide direct benefits 
largely to well-to- do Americans in the hope that their actions will lead to 
indirect benefits for the poor. Such trickle-down welfare programs are highly 
inefficient and wasteful because only a fraction of the taxpayers' money 
actually goes to the poor. The remainder goes to those who purport to help 
the poor -- such as investors seeking tax shelters and developers. 
<P>
The key to an effective and efficient housing program is to reduce the 
"wedge" driven between what the program costs the taxpayer and what the 
intended beneficiary ultimately receives. The project-based programs 
favored by the housing industry lead to inefficient policies in which the costs
to taxpayers are substantially higher than the benefits ultimately received by 
assisted households. It is time for Congress to enact real reform at HUD by 
ending programs that make the Department little more than a lottery for 
some real estate developers, builders, and agents.

<p>
Friends of federalism are right to celebrate the recent Supreme Court decision striking down the federal law banning guns on school grounds. While we certainly must work to keep guns out of our schools, this is a state and local concern, one which almost all states already have addressed through their own legislation.<p>
In United States v. Lopez, the court ruled that Congress had relied on an indefensibly broad interpretation of the Constitution's interstate-commerce clause in claiming that possession of a firearm in a school zone could interfere with interstate trade. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that the Gun-Free School Zones Act "is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms."<p>
Though correct in claiming that Congress hadfor nearly 60 yearsused the commerce clause to justify the gradual encroachment of federal power over our lives, conservatives err when they pretend there are no serious threats to interstate commerce legitimately subject to congressional regulation. On the contrary, there is a growing and ravaging menace to interstate commerce that forces good products off the market, stifles innovation, hurts our ability to compete in the world marketplace, and is unjust both to consumers and manufacturers. It is embodied in the uncontrolled liability rulings and legal expenses that characterize the civil-justice system of most states in the nation. Despite conservative fears of legal reform at the national level, true federalists should embrace limited federal tort reform to rescue a court system that is helping to undermine the economic base of numerous businesses and industries.<p>
<center><b>First Principles</center></b>
<p>
We must, however, limit intervention from Washington according to the principles of federalism and with an understanding that the potential risks of national intervention always are high.<p>
When our Founding Fathers met in Philadelphia in 1787 they were faced with two major problems: The Continental Congress was having trouble raising money to conduct a national defense; and the states were engaging in the economically and socially destructive practice of taxing goods coming from all other states. The Framers solved the first problem by giving Congress the power to impose certain taxes. They solved the second by establishing national jurisdiction over interstate commerce, with the aim of promoting what Federalist 11 calls "a free circulation of the commodities of every part" of the union. <p>
Today we face threats to interstate commerce analogous to those faced by the Founders. Interstate commerce is restrained and even stifled by state-based liability rulings and legal transaction costs as destructive as the taxes about which the Founders were so concerned. The clearest example is in product liability, in which rulings and their costs create not a series of competitive state markets, but rather a restrictive, illogical, and inefficient national market. Moreover, we effectively already have a single unitary tort system in the law of products liability. Unfortunately, our unitary system comprises not a coherent, consistent body of laws, but the most commercially restrictive features of the tort laws of individual states. <p>
It is not difficult to see how this has come about: The law of the state in which the alleged harm occurs generally decides tort cases. Yet our market for products is national, so every company must be prepared to be sued in any state in which its product might be used. If a car built and sold in Michigan by a Michigan corporation is in an accident on a California freeway, California's tort law will determine whether the car maker is liable. If the California legislature decides that side air bags are a necessary safety feature, it could impose strict liability on the manufacturer of any car made anywhere in the United States without one.<p><center><b>No Experimenting Here</center></b>
<p>
Michigan cannot prevent this with tort reform. As a result, insurance companies already set their product-liability rates nationally, because under the current system all companies must abide by the law of the state with the strictest rules.<p>
Under these circumstances, how can states serve as "laboratories of democracy" in the area of product liability? No state will know or have any real incentive to find out whether its product-liability "experiment" has succeeded or failed. Why? Because liability costsin the form of higher prices for goods and servicesare spread nationwide. Meanwhile, the benefits of the state's product-liability system flow primarily to its residents, who constitute the vast majority of potential plaintiffs. A state that elects a less costly set of product-liability rules will see the benefits of that system shared by in- and out-of-staters alike, while its residents will continue to pay almost as much for products because of more costly out-of-state tort systems. Congress does not face the same obstacles in enacting product-liability legislation. It, and it alone, can develop a set of national rules designed to maximize the common good whose costs and benefits will be shared by all citizens.<p>
But, while Congress is uniquely qualified to undertake this task, that does not mean that it will in fact perform it well. Legislative efforts might be hijacked by one or another faction, leading to either excessive or insufficient liability being imposed. Indeed, virtually all political scientists and theorists agree that the Framers systematically underestimated the risks of national factions, largely because modern communication has profoundly changed politics.<p>
Nevertheless, product-liability reform presents fewer risks in this area than do most issues. The reason is that the status quo is bad enough that congressional intervention probably will make it better, and is quite unlikely to make it worse. We need federal action because the system is not just broken, it is falling apart.<p><b><center>Personal and Social Costs</b></center> <p>
One obvious problem with our system: It keeps even real victims, who have been injured and need financial help, from collecting their fair share of damage awards. Tillinghast Research reports that 57 cents of every dollar spent on civil suits in this country go to pay lawyers and other legal costs like the public expendses of the court system. <p>
Consumers also suffer. The huge costs of our legal system create a "liability tax" of 2.5 percent on the average product, built into the selling price by manufacturers. The figure is much higher for other products, such as step-ladders (30 percent) and vaccines (95 percent) that tend to attract lawsuits.<p>
In addition to making things more expensive, liability taxes make necessary goods scarce or even unavailable. Lawyer and engineer Peter Huber reports that between 1965 and 1985, the number of U.S. vaccine manufacturers shrank by more than half; by 1986, we relied on a single supplier for vaccines against polio, rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies. Our own Senate Commerce Committee reported that two of the three companies making the Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DPT, vaccine stopped production because of liability costs: They could not afford all the suits arising from the now clearly discredited theory that the vaccine might in very rare instances cause brain damage. <p>
The results of such policies can be devastating, particularly to the sick and helpless. There are some 5,000 diseases that affect small numbers of Americans. Many of these diseases, including leprosy, are extremely serious. But a number of them have gone untreated, because pharmaceutical companies cannot afford the risk. A West German chemical company, for example, at one time supplied Americans with botulinum. A paralytic poison, the drug controls a rare but incapacitating disease that affects the control of eye muscles. The company cut off American supplies to avoid being held liable should people misuse its product.<p>
Dozens of examples like this one prompted the federal government in 1983 to enact the Orphan Drug Act. This act provides special incentives and waivers to companies researching and manufacturing drugs for rare diseases. One of its purposes is to overcome the disincentives to produce needed products that have been built into our legal system, and it has done some good in this area. But orphan drugs are only the most visible signs of a deeper problem. Research and development are undercut when companies are afraid to enter the market for fear of massive, unfounded lawsuits. The result is a lack of innovation and improvement as well as a lack of competition among companiesthat is, a loss of the best means by which to keep quality up and prices down.<p>
The system also hurts our economic competitiveness. A 1994 Business Roundtable survey of 20 major U.S. corporations reveals that they receive 55 percent of their revenue from inside our country, but incur 88 percent of their total legal costs here. Clearly such discrepancies in legal costs put our companies at a disadvantage in the world market. So does our yearly litigation-related costs of $300 billion, or 4.5 percent of our gross domestic product.<p>
Given the nature of the American economy, then, our product-liability system can best be reformed at the national level. We need uniform standards encouraging safe conduct and discouraging frivolous lawsuits aimed only at garnering unjust rewards. In particular, we must limit punitive damage claims and bar joint liability. At the same time, we need a provision holding each defendant accountable for that portion of the damage for which he or she actually was responsible.<p><b><center>State Reforms</b></center>
<p>
Product-liability reform will not address all of our problems, however. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that product-liability reform will help only 35 percent of small businesses. The other 65 percent are not involved in these cases and so will not benefitand even may suffer worse harm by being brought into lawsuits under joint and several liability rules.<p>
Product manufacturers and sellers do not shoulder all of the burden of unjust tort claims and awards. According to Inside Litigation, there were 50 cases in the United States in 1994 in which jury verdicts exceeded $17.5 million. Of these, only seven were product-liability cases. The remaining 43 involved disputes concerning employment, securities, lenders, accountants, environmental claims, insurers, business torts, state and local governments, volunteer firefighters, medical claims, and personal injuries not involving products.<p>
What, then, should we do about these other suits? How should we protect volunteers, lenders, and others from our flawed legal system?<p>
We could devise a national standard for all civil litigation. In this way we could ensure uniformity in standards of conduct and thus much more uniform results. But national standards are neither necessary nor proper, in my view, outside the field of product liability. This is because other types of civil cases do not produce the same disproportionate consequences across states as do product-liability suits. Suits against hospitals are mostly by local patients, suits against volunteer firefighters are mostly by local litigants. Most of the rules for such litigation should properly be determined by the states.<p>
Even so, there are some implications for interstate commerceand therefore grounds for some federal involvement. Some of these lawsuits do involve cross-state litigants, and a dynamic similar to that in product-liability law has led to a systematic bias in favor of plaintiffs that is harmful to interstate commerce. States are unable to protect in-state defendants from unreasonable suits by out-of-state plaintiffs, because the plaintiff in an interstate suit can choose which state to litigate in, and therefore which state's laws apply. By contrast, states can easily establish rules that benefit in-state plaintiffsand they frequently do so. Thus the same pattern the Founders fearedby which state taxes are used against out-of-state goods and interfere with economic productivityis at work.<p><b><center>Ending Windfall Profits</b></center>
<p>
Rather than taking over underlying liability laws, we should use federal power judiciouslyand humblyin order to make modest changes in the structure or legal machinery by which decisions and judgment awards are made. We should replace state law with federal rules, however, only when we are dealing with clear casesbearing in mind the risks, as well as the benefits, of federal action.<p>
Here is my prescription. First, national lawmakers should extend to all civil cases the replacement of joint liability with proportionate liability for non-economic damages. Under the current system, partially responsible parties must pay for more than their fair share of the damages because other defendants have become judgment-proof. For example, in Walt Disney World Co. v. Wood, a woman was injured when her fianc struck the go-cart she was driving at Disney World. The jury found her 14 percent at fault, her fianc 85 percent at fault and Disney only 1 percent at fault. But, under the doctrine of joint liability, Disney was required to pay 86 percent of the plaintiff's claimed damages.<p>
Second, the existing structure of punitive damages is rife with abuse. The courts have rightly regarded punitive damages as the equivalent of a state-imposed fine. Huge punitive damage awards can put a company or individual into bankruptcy. Such awards are meant to be rare and aimed only at particularly egregious conduct. They also are supposed to be awarded only in addition to economic and non-economic damages.<p>
Yet Yale Professor George Priest reports that punitive damage claims have become "almost routine." According to Professor Priest, lawyers increasingly use punitive damage claims to bully even innocent defendants into settling cases for higher amounts. Our high and unpredictable punitive damage claims thus encourage litigation because in too many cases they produce "windfall profits"huge unearned rewards.<p>
A federal cap on punitive damages at some reasonable level would take nothing essential away from the plaintiff. It would, however, protect defendants and society from unfair and financially disastrous awards. These awards hurt all of us by raising prices for goods and services, sometimes so high as to make them effectively unavailable. They hurt, even bankrupt, small businesses in particular, and so cost jobs.<p><center><b>Rediscovering Discovery Costs</center></b>
<p>
Finally, we must do something about the enormous transaction costs incurred under the present system, which nobody can defend. Eighty percent of the cost of the average lawsuit is incurred during discovery. Sifting through documents, taking depositions and so onall of these practices consume massive amounts of time and money. And discovery costs relate as much to issues of courtroom tactics as to actual questions of fault and damage. The process is so costly because attorneys seek to "discover" absolutely everything about their opponents that might possibly be useful in the battleground of the courtroom. <p>
One way to attack this problem would be to change the incentives in the system to encourage parties to settle their disputes early. By encouraging settlement before discovery is complete, we will save everyone a great deal of time, money, and aggravation.<p>
How can we do this without infringing on anyone's right to full compensation? No one wants to deny any Americans the right to their day in court if they feel they are not being fully compensated for their damages. But just as surely, none of us wants to continue with the wasteful, unfair status quo.<p>
We should reward defendants for making full and fair offers early on, without declaring that the plaintiff must accept just any offer. We should increase and speed up recoveries for meritorious claimants. At the same time, we should reduce both the incentives of defendants to drag out these disputes through whatever means available and the costs of those recoveries to defendants.<p>
The method would be simple: Provide protection to defendants who quickly promise to pay the plaintiff's full economic damages, plus, perhaps, an additional amount set by a state schedule based on the severity of the injury. This helps plaintiffs by restoring in full their economic losses without months or years of legal struggle. It helps defendants by protecting them against unlimited non-economic damages claims if they make a fair offer early on. <p>
Faced with such a system, defendants will offer fair compensation more quickly, and plaintiffs will be less likely to turn down a fair offer. Both sides would benefit from early settlements by avoiding long, expensive, and perhaps unsuccessful litigation. Thus lawyers and litigants no longer would hold out for more money and higher fees unless they clearly are warranted. And defendants and their insurance companies would no longer drag out litigation in hopes of making plaintiffs give up their suits and go away. <p>
All of these reforms will increase the fairness and efficiency of our legal system. Moreover, all are amply justified under federalist principles by the peculiar incentives in our present systemincentives that encourage states to develop laws benefiting in-state plaintiffs at the expense of the public interest.<p><b><center>A Federalist Escape Clause</center></b>
<p>
We still should take care to protect and nurture federalism, however. In the case of my early-offer recommendation, for example, I would allow a state to opt out of the federal reformin whole or in partfor disputes entirely between citizens of that state. This would encourage those states that feel strongly about the issue to retain their own legal machinery, but only if they can justify to their own people that the machinery is sound and only if its costs and benefits are allocated to their own citizens.<p>
Some may not be convinced that other reforms (including barring of joint liability and punitive-damage caps) are justified by federalist principles. These people should consider going along with the reforms, but attaching a state opt-out provision. If a large number of states opts out of a particular reform under these circumstances, it would serve as a strong signal to Congress and the people that the national "reform" may in fact have been the product of national faction, rather than a necessary preemption of an illegitimate burden imposed by the states on interstate commerce. <p>
An escape mechanism of this sort could also be useful in other areas beyond legal reform, where there are legitimate differences of opinion on whether federal intervention is needed or desirable. In particular, Congress should consider allowing this opt-out provision whenever it exercises its commerce power to remove burdens on interstate commerce caused by a systemic bias that state competition cannot correct (see Easterbrook, "Madison, the State, and Public Choice," University of Chicago Law. School Record [Spring 1995]). Professor Akhil Amar also suggested an inquiry along these lines in a conversation with a member of my staff. If widely used by the states to evade provisions of federal law, the provision also would help us identify areas in which Congress was wrong to intervene, because the burden imposed on interstate commerce was in fact a legitimate state interest.<p>
This leads us back to Lopez. I have no doubt that civil-justice reforms crafted along the lines I have discussed would pass muster with the Supreme Court. The link between the legislation and interstate commerce would be quite clear. In addition, an opt-out feature of the sort I have described would eliminate cases in which there is no real connection between interstate commerce and the practice in question. Finally, an escape provision for close caseswhere there is some reason to believe that competition among the states' legal regimes is not functioning properly, but the evidence is not overwhelmingwould allow the system to send a useful signal to the Court. It would show that the underlying law was intended as a legitimate exercise of Congress's power to alleviate perverse burdens on interstate commerce, and not as a grab for power in the interests of some national faction.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>ashington is a city of monuments. Its grandest and most expensive is a work 
still in progress, but nearing completion: the District of Columbia itself, which 
commemorates the ruin of American liberalism.</P>
<P>	The D.C. government is bankrupt today because liberal policies have decimated 
its tax base. Washington is a hollow community of extreme rich and poor. Landlords and 
private employers have fled by the thousands, followed by nearly the entire middle class 
of taxpayers. Although Washington is the center of one of the most dynamic information-
based economies in the U.S, it has a declining population and a growing number of 
people below the poverty line. This year, twice as many households as in 1988 lack 
phones. In no other laboratory of democracy has the liberal experiment taken such pure 
form. Nowhere else have the results been so damning. </P>
<P>	The District is perhaps the most liberal city in America. Nine of every 10 
registered voters are Democrats, and the Socialist Workers Party fields more candidates 
for local office than the Republican Party. Conceived at the high tide of American 
liberalism, the District government is a product of its times, more concerned with the 
rights of groups than with the responsibilities of individuals. Many of the original office 
holders, political activists with no experience in private enterprise, are still in power 
today. The results are tragic. Among all U.S. states, the District has the highest per-capita 
murder and violent-crime rates, the highest percentage of residents on public assistance, 
the highest-paid school board, the lowest SAT scores, and the most single-parent 
families.</P> 
<P>	The political activists have built a government they can't afford. Although the city 
takes in an astounding $8,950 in revenue for every man, woman, and child in its 
jurisdiction (compared with $4,100 and $3,700 in nearby Maryland and Virginia, 
respectively), the District still manages to spend $1,000 more per person than it receives. 
The result is a budget deficit edging closer to $1 billion with each new audit. </P>
<P>	The victims of this ferociously progressive government are not the wealthy and 
privileged, but the middle class and beleaguered. Today, in some parts of the city, it 
seems entire neighborhoods are for sale. In places like Shepherd Park, Lincoln Park, 
Marshall Heights--communities once redolent of African-American pride and history--
there are lonely streets whose only splash of color appears on the real-estate signs that 
seem to sprout from every other garden plot. </P>
<P>	At the end of one of these streets stands the Florida Avenue Grill. From behind 
the counter of the often-crowded restaurant, Lacey Wilson Jr. has seen the District of 
Columbia ebb and flow. These days, it's mostly ebbing. Back in 1944, when Wilson's 
father opened his soul-food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th Street, 
near the LeDroit Park section of Northwest Washington, the city was a thriving 
community of educated descendants of freed slaves, flourishing family businesses, and 
urban sophistication. It was also a magnet of opportunity for blacks seeking to escape 
rural poverty. At mid-century, wartime Washington offered stable, well-paying white-
collar jobs in the federal bureaucracy. People came and put down roots. </P>
<P>	Eighteen years ago, when Lacey Wilson Jr. began working at the Grill full time, 
the neighborhood brimmed with well-kept houses and children playing. Today, the Grill 
stands alone in an otherwise vacant lot. In the short time since the District was granted 
home rule in 1974, Washington has gone from promised land to no-man's-land. "Most of 
the families who lived here have moved out to Maryland," says Wilson, himself a refugee 
to "the peace and quiet" of suburban Virginia. Those who stayed in the neighborhood, 
according to Wilson, are trapped in houses that have lost 30 percent of their value in the 
last eight years. </P>
<P>	Business used to be better, says Wilson. The vacant lot next door means more 
taxicabs can park at lunch time, but the crime that holds this city hostage each night has 
cut his after-dark dinner traffic by half. Proud of his restaurant's permanence in a 
turbulent world, Wilson stands below rows of signed photos of his famous patrons--
athletes, musicians, and local politicians, including a young Marion Barry glowing with 
promise before dissipation hardened his face and tarnished his reputation as a can-do 
mayor.</P>
<P>	Wilson and his patrons are concerned that Washington, once the incubator of 
America's black middle class, is now a place from which to escape. After reaching a peak 
population of 800,000, the city has withered to just 578,000 last year, and the trend has 
accelerated. Ten thousand residents desert the city each year. Even worse news is who is 
leaving: the homeowners, the entrepreneurs, the role models--in short, the black middle 
class. They are leaving for the suburbs, and with every defector, D.C. loses a taxpayer, 
which shrinks the tax base available for feeding a voracious welfare state that causes 
more frustrated residents to leave, and on and on.</P>
<P>	Census figures reveal that during the second half of the 1980s, 157,100 residents, 
or one-fifth of the entire population, moved out of the District. About half of those 
emigrants moved to Maryland and 12 percent to Virginia. According to the Greater 
Washington Research Center, black households earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year made up a disproportionate number of these refugees. In their place, affluent, single 
whites are moving into the city, but not enough to offset the loss. The result is a city 
rapidly dividing into segregated communities of economic extremes.</P>
<P>	Ask people at the Florida Street Grill about middle-class flight, and they'll tell 
you it is the little things that make life difficult in the District. Thomas Jones, finishing up 
his lunch before driving back to his job in Virginia, says it costs too much to live in the 
city. "Not just money," he says, "but time and aggravation." The Grill attracts an 
unusually diverse crowd for Washington, but there is agreement on one point: The 
government is no longer a neutral referee for self-sufficient citizens, but a muscular 
competitor against private enterprise. "For all the forms I need to fill out and all the 
inspections I'd have to have--and I'm not even talking about the fees and taxes," says 
one would-be entrepreneur, "why should I do business here? They've got open arms in 
Maryland. They make it easy there." A discussion soon erupts over the merits of 
suburban life, including such "innovations" as drive-through car registration, a one-stop 
business office where permits and licenses are issued, and same-day street repairs. The 
District, on the other hand, offers a notoriously slow motor-vehicles department, a 
bureaucracy suspicious of any profitable endeavor, and patchwork streets that haven't 
seen new asphalt in years. </P>
<P>	Wilson, Jones, and a number of other patrons own at least one rental unit in the 
city--often the place they used to live in. Thanks to the city government, these units are a 
steadier source of frustration than of income. The District has some of the most stringent 
rent-control and tenant's-rights provisions in the nation, but instead of helping 
disadvantaged renters, the laws tend to discourage rental activity. "It's not worth it to rent 
out your property," says Jones. He tells a harrowing story of a tenant who exploited all 
the rules to live, rent-free, for more than 16 months. "She had me in court. Never paid me 
anything, and she had the nerve to sue me!" Wilson and others at the counter nod 
knowingly. "I'll never rent out again," Jones declares. "After getting it up to code, what 
with rent control, it takes you 20 years to get your money back."</P>
<P>	Behind the cash register at the Florida Avenue Grill stands Edgar Featherson, a 
native Washingtonian with a quiet, genteel grace that reminds you of the once courtly 
city. After the lunch crowd dwindles, Featherson drives home through the LeDroit Park 
neighborhood in the early afternoon. The sidewalks overflow with students from the four 
public schools in the area. The children are a concern to Featherson.</P>
<P>	"They don't have the kind of family I was blessed with," he says. He is proud of 
his education, much of it the result of lessons his mother drilled into him years ago. The 
world has changed dramatically since then. He tells a story of the time he prepared dinner 
for his nephew and a friend from the neighborhood. "This boy had never seen anything 
like it. I made them put their coats away and wash their hands before we sat down," he 
recalls. "By the end of the night, you know that boy would not leave the house? He never 
had anyone telling him how to act, never had anyone treat him like a normal child." With 
a mixture of disgust and guilt, Featherson shakes his head. "This boy was so starved for 
love, he wouldn't leave." </P>
<P>	Featherson's nephew doesn't go to public school. He attends Archbishop Carroll 
High School in another part of town, partly because parents there are more involved in 
their children's education than they are in D.C. public schools. "If you don't show up at a 
parent-teacher meeting at Carroll, you get fined," he says. "They'd never try that in 
public school." To Featherson, public education is a mechanism for downward mobility, 
not a ladder out of poverty. "Look at Franklin Smith [the Superintendent of D.C. Public 
Schools]. He sends his kids to private school. He has a choice and he doesn't even send 
his own children to public school. Now what does that say about D.C. schools?" </P>
<P>	He mentions a news item from the Washington Times, reporting that in the 
seventh-grade "intensive" English class at one of the city's elite junior-high schools, not a 
single book was assigned to the class during the entire year. "And that's in the best 
schools," he says. "You can imagine what they're like in the rest of the city."</P>
<P>	John Robinson, another Grill customer, founded Black Diamond Industries in 
1976 to manufacture stainless-steel kitchen equipment for McDonald's and Wendy's 
restaurants. He exudes a world-weary optimism. His office is decorated with a yellowed 
picture of Jackie Robinson and a framed portrait of his mother. Robinson has not left the 
city yet. "This is where I live, my family is here, my church is here," he says. Still, the 
thought crosses his mind often.</P>
<P>	"Paperwork is my Achilles' heel," says Robinson. "With 20 employees, if I have 
one person doing nothing but government paperwork, non-income producing paperwork, 
then I've got 5 percent of my work force doing useless stuff." Robinson complains that 
he is a good employer in a city that needs private-sector job creation, yet the city ignores 
his needs. </P>
<P>	"The D.C. government doesn't care about my business--they don't see us we're 
so small--but it's businesses like this, with under 50 people, that are the real job 
producers," Robinson says. Washington has become something of a private-sector jobs 
vacuum. Job creation since 1980 has been anemic: 7 percent growth in employment, 
compared with 40 percent in suburban Maryland and 94 percent in suburban Virginia. 
Had D.C. managed to create jobs at the national average, it would have generated 80,000 
more jobs between 1980 and 1993.</P>
<P>	"Small business is about family and the community," says Robinson. "I work 
here. I live in the city. I hire people from the neighborhood. The government should be 
encouraging me, not just some big corporation. When I complain to the city government, 
they say `What's the problem? Every other business can do it. Why can't you?' But I'm 
not Marriott, I'm not MCI. I can't wait six weeks for an inspection or a permit. I'm out of 
business in six weeks. I could do about $100,000 more business a year if I didn't have so 
much paperwork," says Robinson.</P>
<P>	The solution to the worst of his problems is simple, Robinson says. "The city 
should announce tomorrow, `If you've got less than 50 employees, you don't need a 
license, you don't need a permit, all you have to do is pay taxes on time.' Just let me go 
to work. Nothing would make my life easier than that."</P>
<P>   If you drive along Minnesota Avenue in Anacostia, you'll see few private businesses. 
Many of the small outposts of enterprise are liquor stores, and likely owned by Korean-
born entrepreneurs. Douglas Kim, a small-businessman and head of the Korean-American 
Chamber of Commerce, says that nearly a third of all business licenses in the District of 
Columbia are held by low-capital Korean merchants. Recent immigrants often start up in 
the more hostile parts of the District. The risks may be higher, but the initial investment 
required is small compared to the more affluent suburbs. "After six or seven years," says 
Kim, "they move their business out of the city." Surveys show that 96 percent of all 
Koreans who own businesses in the District already live in the suburbs. </P>
<P>	Koreans are torn between the city and the suburbs, Kim says. The crime rate 
disturbs them. A recent survey showed that 89 percent of Korean merchants felt the 
police were "untrustworthy" or "very untrustworthy." But the biggest obstacle to a 
thriving Korean community in D.C. is the public-school system. "We come here for a 
better life for our children," says Kim, who lives in Virginia so his children can attend 
public schools there. "You know, it's the American dream." Kim's wife, who immigrated 
more recently, is still uncomfortable with the anonymity of the suburbs. "When my boys 
graduate," he says, "we'll move back to the city, but not now. --If there were excellent 
public schools in the District like there are in Virginia, all the Koreans would be living in 
the city tomorrow!"</P>
<P>	Many of the D.C. refugees are doubtless fleeing crime and the city government's 
inability to protect them from it. Don Scoggins, a refugee himself, is a real-estate broker 
who has helped hundreds flee bleeding neighborhoods. "Crime is more devastating to 
these communities than racism or Jim Crow ever was," says Scoggins, "but the city 
officials still think they're leading the civil-rights movement. They'd rather talk about the 
`root causes of crime' instead of locking up the criminals."</P>
<P>	To Scoggins, a black government worker-turned-entrepreneur, the story is 
depressingly routine. "The people running D.C. are more concerned with the people who 
can't take care of themselves," he says, "at the expense of the rest of us, the ones who 
have made an investment in the city's future." </P>
<P>	Joe Corey is a restaurateur in the upscale Glover Park section of Northwest D.C. 
Though his business required a large initial investment, he's not so different from the 
Korean merchants across town. When he had a chance to expand his business, he chose to 
open a restaurant in Virginia instead of D.C. "The taxes are too high, the bureaucracy is a 
mess," he says. "I told [former city council chairman] John Wilson on a radio call-in 
show that I wanted to stay in the city, but I couldn't afford the time and effort. You know 
what he told me? `Don't let the door hit you on the way out.' Is that anyway to treat a 
taxpayer?"</P>
<P>	It's the small things that make Corey think of leaving town--like the city's 
passion for writing parking tickets. Most residents will agree that the one thing the 
government does with breathtaking efficiency is issue tickets. "To them it's another 
source of income, so sure they write as many as they can, whether they're valid or not," 
says Corey. Since there's revenue at stake, the city for once turns to the lowest-cost 
provider, a private corporation called Lockheed Information Management. "The city is so 
shortsighted," says Corey. "They ticket my customers so they can raise a couple of 
hundred dollars in revenue, and they drive the customers away. They don't think of the 
business I'm doing and the taxes I'm paying. My business is worth much more to them in 
the long run than the few bucks they'll get from parking tickets." </P>
<P>   Corey perceives a hostile climate for business in the District. "They neglect you if 
you're a taxpaying business," he says. "When I call the city government, I can never get 
the right person on the phone or the right answer to a question. I can call down there on a 
Wednesday afternoon and no one answers the phone at all. But if I lose an employee, that 
guy gets unemployment benefits the next day, and God help me if I make a mistake with 
unemployment insurance. They're all over me." Corey speculates that career city 
employees are suspicious of anyone making money. "In this city, non-taxpayers are more 
privileged than the ones who are paying the taxes." As a result, many businessmen have 
fled the District, leaving behind an anemic economy in which the Washington Post and 
McDonald's are two of the largest private employers.</P>
<P>	For the Washingtonians who have invested their lives in District neighborhoods, 
there is sometimes no escape. Benjamin Thomas has lived in Benning Heights since 
1958. "It's a nice neighborhood, good working people," he says, but for five years the 
community has been besieged by drug dealers and the murderous outgrowth of their 
trade. "We're overrun by crime. I heard gunshots just last night and no one will respond." 
The breakdown of law and order is almost total. "We've got cars driving around here 
with no license plates, never been inspected, parked anywhere they come to a stop." 
Overwhelmed by violent crime, the police don't bother to enforce the basic laws that 
protect a neighborhood from chaos. "We're completely surrounded here," says Thomas. 
His home is now on a hostile frontier, and he sees little chance to escape. "Where can I 
go? Even if I find somebody who wants to buy my house, I won't have enough money 
even for a down payment anywhere else."</P>
<P>	Thomas places the blame squarely on the city government. "I've written letters to 
the mayor, to the city council, but no one ever answers. We're on our own out here." 
Thomas recalls the city was unresponsive even before the neighborhood disintegrated. "I 
fought 10 years to get a traffic light on Benning Road [a major point of entry to the city], 
and I never heard a thing from downtown."</P>
<P>	As Ray Dickey sees it, the transformation from neighborhood to no-man's-land 
begins at home. Dickey says he was the first black to move into the North Michigan Park 
neighborhood, back in 1957. "It starts when parents don't spend time with their kids, and 
don't let their children's friends in the house." The children eventually get the message 
that they're on their own, and they grow up not caring about anyone but themselves. 
"Neighbors don't even talk to each other anymore," says Dickey. "Now I live in a 
neighborhood of strangers. It's sad."</P>
<P>	North Michigan Park suffers from a disorder that no amount of government 
largess can remedy. "It's not about money," he says. "Money won't fix it. Government 
can't bring these people together and make them care." Dickey looks for non-government 
institutions to help bridge the gap, but finds them badly weakened by middle-class flight. 
"There are 10 churches in this neighborhood," says Dickey, "but they're not part of the 
neighborhood anymore. The people coming to church are all from the suburbs. They 
come on Sunday for an hour, then leave. The rest of the week, the doors are locked."</P>
<P>	A government's main mission is to ensure the safety of its citizens. Yet in the 
middle-class neighborhoods of Ward 6, the police presence has been cut back just when 
the neighborhood needs it the most. "I'm trapped in my own home," says Sheila Stamps, 
a widowed mother of five living in public housing on Capitol Hill. "You can't let 
children out by themselves, and the playground is littered with intravenous needles." 
Marion Barry, the newly elected mayor, recently threatened to withdraw the police from 
Ward 6 unless its city-council representative supported a controversial tax increase. This 
news brings Stamps to a boil. "You can't touch the police and the fire department. That's 
public safety. You can't touch that and expect people to stay here much longer."</P>
<P>	Stamps knows what's wrong with her city and what to do about it. "There are two 
things that must be there," she says. "Public safety and good schools." She wants the 
police to build a substation in her neighborhood so the same policemen can live and work 
in the area. "We need police here so they can live with the problem, so they'll know what 
it is like." Stamps also wants school choice. "Any child in this city should be able to go to 
the best schools," she says. "If they meet the criteria, let them go." She says the 
politicians and the media people who live in affluent Ward 3 don't want poor black 
children in their schools. "The president can send his child to any school he wants." she 
says. All she wants is the same opportunity. "We've got a lot of smart kids down here, 
hard-working kids. But they don't get the chance."</P>
<P>	Based on the liberal premise that poor citizens will always be poor and affluent 
citizens will always be affluent, the District government is perplexed that middle-class 
citizens are seeking opportunity elsewhere. After hundreds of tax increases, the city's 
ledgers are soaked with red ink. Despite employing tens of thousands of civil servants, 
even basic services are abysmal. The solution parroted by city officials has always been 
to grant statehood to the District. The reality is that the city government has squandered 
what sovereignty it has. More than 50 of the city's agencies are under court control, and 
the District owes $21 million in contempt-of-court fees due to its mishandling of its 
limited responsibilities. </P>
<P>	There can be no solution to the District's problems until the flight of middle-class 
families is stanched and reversed. That will require the District government to compete 
with its suburbs to provide the basic services middle-class taxpayers expect. The city can 
attract new residents by emphasizing public safety and quality public education, and by 
providing a competitive regulatory climate for entrepreneurs and a low-capital point of 
entry to the economy. Projects and services that do not add to the appeal of Washington 
as a place to raise a family can no longer be justified. The city must close the law school 
of the University of the District of Columbia, which produces no lawyers, privatize the 
appalling D.C. General Hospital, and lower its tax rates to compete with those of 
surrounding jurisdictions. </P>
<P>	The solution is hardly draconian. Other cities take great pride in performing the 
basics efficiently. Washington has the advantage of being the kind of city many people 
would like to live in. But it must first shed its Great Society heritage. The D.C. 
government has betrayed the very people it was intended to serve. True, it has succeeded 
in creating an integrated community where African-Americans can live in peace and 
thrive economically. Unfortunately, that community is just over the District line--in 
Maryland's Prince George's County.</P>
<P>	Why does Featherson stay in the District? "Well, it's like the Grill," he explains. 
"We've been here so long, for 50 years. I just hope there are some kids who walk by and 
think, `They've made it, they've been here through everything, they're proof you can 
make it if you work hard.' That's why I stay here. I want these kids to say `If Mr. 
Featherson can make it, maybe I can too.'"</P>
