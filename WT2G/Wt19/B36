<P>
<font size=+2>W</font>ithin the UN system, the IAEA is an autonomous organization 
in its own right. Often  thought of as the "Atoms for Peace" 
organization, the Agency traces its origins to the vision of US President 
Dwight Eisenhower. In December 1953, Eisenhower proposed to the UN 
General Assembly in New York the creation of an international atomic 
energy agency to harness the atom for the benefit of humanity. In 
1954, the General Assembly set the proposal in motion, and a group 
was formed to define the new agency's mandate.
<P>
The IAEA Statute was approved on 26 October 1956 at an 
international conference held at UN headquarters in New York, and 
the Agency came into existence in Vienna, Austria, on 29 July 1957. 
In November 1957, the General Assembly approved an agreement on the 
IAEA's relationship with the UN. The IAEA reports annually to the 
General Assembly and, whenever necessary, to the Security Council, 
which has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace 
and security, and the Economic and Social Council, which coordinates 
developmental work of the UN and its specialized agencies.
<P>
Today, the Agency has 122 Member States who are directly 
involved in most aspects of nuclear energy's global development. The 
global role of the IAEA is basically twofold: One, to help interested 
countries put peaceful nuclear technologies to work for beneficial 
applications in fields such as electricity production, health care, 
agricultural development, and industry. And two, to monitor civil 
nuclear activities, at the request of a State, to verify that safeguarded 
nuclear materials are not diverted to military purposes. This dual 
role has many dimensions. The IAEA's technical cooperation programme 
comprises nearly 1400 projects in about 90 developing countries, at 
a value of about US $50 million. Additionally, some 150 IAEA-supported 
research programmes are in some phase of operation around the world. 
Nearly 3000 experts are sent each year to developing countries to 
run training courses, for example, and more than 1000 scientific fellows 
and visiting scientists receive hands-on experience each year, at 
national or regional institutes, or at one of the IAEA's three research 
centres and laboratories.
<P>
Activities related to safeguards and verification are fundamentally 
based on the Agency's Statute and safeguards agreements concluded 
with States. At the end of 1994, there were 843 nuclear facilities 
under safeguards, including facilities and other locations containing 
nuclear material. Safeguards agreements have been concluded with 118 
States, including 102 States party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons, under which the IAEA is the designated inspectorate.

<body>
<H2>Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency</H2>
<HR size=3>
The Statute was approved<STRONG> on 23 October 1956 </STRONG> by the Conference on the Statute of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was held at the Headquarters of
the United Nations. It came into force on 29 July 1957, upon the fulfilment of
the relevant provisions of paragraph E of Article XXI.<p>
<p>
The Statute has been amended three times, by application of the procedure laid
down in paragraphs A and C of Article XVIII. On 31 January 1963 some amendments
to the first sentence of the then paragraph A.3 of Article Vl came into force;
the Statute as thus amended was further amended on I June 1973 by the coming
into force of a number of amendments to paragraphs A to D of the same Article
(involving a renumbering of sub-
paragraphs
in paragraph A); and on 28 December 1989 an amendment in the introductory part
of paragraph A.l came into force. All these amendments have been incorporated
in the text of the Statute reproduced in this booklet, which consequently
supersedes all earlier editions.

requested by the parties concerned to apply safeguards, the Agency shall have
the following rights and responsibilities to the extent relevant to the project
or arrangement:<p>
1. To examine the design of specialized equipment and facilities, including
nuclear reactors, and to approve it only from the view-

point
of assuring that it will not further any military purpose, that it complies
with applicable health and safety standards, and that it will permit effective
application of the safeguards provided for in this article;<p>
2. To require the observance of any health and safety measures prescribed by
the Agency;<p>
3. To require the maintenance and production of operating records to assist in
ensuring accountability for source and special fissionable materials used or
produced in the project or arrangement;<p>

materials solely to ensure that this chemical processing will nat lend itself
to diversion of materials for military purposes and will comply with applicable
health and safety standards; to require that special fissionable materials
recovered or produced as a by-

product
be used for peaceful purposes under continuing Agency safeguards for research
or in reactors, existing or under construction, specified by the member or
members concerned; and to require deposit with the Agency of any excess of any
special fissionable materials recovered or produced as a by-

product
over what is needed for the above-

The IAEA Board Committee considering further measures for <b><tt><a href="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-17.html">STRENGTHENING NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS</a></b></tt> will hold its third session 
in early 1997, beginning 20 January at the Agency's headquarters in Vienna. The Committee specifically is negotiating a legal instrument required for the introduction of 
verification measures that go beyond the IAEA's authority under existing comprehensive safeguards agreements concluded with States. The latest edition of the <i><a 
href="/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull384/">IAEA Bulletin </a></i> features articles describing the safeguards development programme and the Agency's experience so far in 
introducing some new measures that the Board already has approved. For a full listing of the nuclear facilities and locations under IAEA safeguards around the world, see the <a

<br>
<b><tt>FACTS ABOUT THE WORLD'S USE of NUCLEAR POWER</b></tt> for electricity generation -- and associated environmental and economic benefits -- were emphasized by IAEA Director 
General Hans Blix in Manila recently. Speaking at the Second Philippine Nuclear Congress, Dr. Blix said that the world's greater use of nuclear power could "significantly alleviate 
the dilemma of an increasing need for energy and an increasing need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions". The <a href="/worldatom/inforesource/dgspeeches/dgsp1996n14.html">full 
text</a> of his address, as well as the <a href="/worldatom/inforesource/dgspeeches/dgsp1996n15.html">text of a lecture</a> he gave on nuclear applications in medical and other

<B><I>FOREWORD</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Since its inception over 30 years ago, the Agency safeguards system has evolved and been strengthened by the regular introduction of new methods and techniques, improving both its effectiveness and efficiency for detecting diversion of nuclear material placed under safeguards.  The increasing importance of assurance regarding the absence of any undeclared nuclear activities  and installations in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements made it imperative to update the safeguards system by integrating into it measures that will give the Agency an improved capability of detecting clandestine nuclear activities if such exist.
<P>
<LI>Beginning in 1992, a number of decisions by the Board of Governors reaffirmed the requirements that Agency safeguards provide assurance regarding both the correctness and the completeness of nuclear material declarations by States with comprehensive safeguards agreements, endorsed some individual measures for increasing the Agency's capabilities in respect of verifying the completeness of States' declarations and requested the Director General to submit to it concrete proposals for the assessment, development and testing of measures for strengthening safeguards and improving its cost effectiveness.  In response to this request the Secretariat presented in December 1993 a Programme, "Programme 93 + 2," which aimed to evaluate the technical, financial and legal aspects of a comprehensive set of measures, including those recommended by the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI), and to present, early in 1995, proposals for a strengthened and more efficient safeguards system.  
<P>
<LI>A report was presented to the March 1995 meeting of the Board of Governors (GOV/2784) which gave an overview of measures proposed for strengthening the safeguards system, and discussed each measure in terms of its cost, effort, assurance, legal aspects and its interrelations with other measures.  The extensive comments made at this meeting resulted in the submission for the Board's consideration in June 1995 of a further document (GOV/2807) which contained a comprehensive set of strengthening and efficiency measures divided in two parts.  Part 1 consisted of measures which could, in the Secretariat's view, be implemented under existing legal authority and which the Secretariat would proceed to implement.  Part 2 consisted of measures which were believed to require complementary authority.  The Board of Governors noted the Secretariat's intention to proceed with Part 1 measures on the understanding that concerns of Member States would be clarified and implementing arrangements elaborated by consultations between the Secretariat and Member States.
<P>
<LI>"Programme 93 + 2" called for a major effort by the Secretariat.   The work done has been accomplished with the extensive support of a large number of Member States.  States have availed themselves of numerous opportunities, including the General Conferences, to provide the Secretariat with their views on the programme.  Progress on the programme was previously reported to the 1994 and 1995 General Conferences in documents GC(XXXVIII)/17 and GC(39)/17.
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(39)/RES/17 the General Conference last year requested the Director General to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	continue to develop the measures proposed under Programme 93 + 2, in order to bring about a more effective and efficient system covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of a State which has concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement, and to make arrangements to implement at an early date the measures outlined in Part 1 of document GOV/2807 after consulting individual States;
<P>
<DD>-	put before the Board of Governors as soon as possible clear proposals for the measures proposed in Part 2; having taken into account the views on Part 2 of Programme 93 + 2 expressed in the Board of Governors and at the General Conference's thirty-ninth regular session and the outcome of the  consultations with Member States individually or collectively; and
<P>
<DD>-	report on the implementation of this resolution to the General Conference at its fortieth regular session.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>This report provides information on the Secretariat's activities and the Board of Governors' consideration and decisions since the thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference and on ongoing work to implement measures under existing legal authority.
<P>
<B><I>ACTIVITIES SINCE THE THIRTY-NINTH GENERAL CONFERENCE</I></B>
<P>
<LI>As part of the process called for by GC(39)/RES/17, the Director General presented a discussion paper to the Board of Governors at its December 1995 session.  The paper described and explained the need for the new measures for which complementary legal authority would be required (Part 2 measures), and presented a draft protocol showing how the authority could be granted.  It also expressed the expectation that following a short term increase in costs the implementation of the envisaged new measures would be cost-neutral.
<P>
<LI>Following a discussion of the paper the summing up by the Chairman of the Board of Governors noted, <I>inter alia</I>, that the Board of Governors welcomed the Director General's initiative in presenting the paper which was seen as a step in the consultative process undertaken prior to finalizing the proposals for Part 2 of Programme 93 + 2.  The Board and the General Conference had asked the Director General to prepare the proposals to create strengthened and cost-effective safeguards system, to give the Agency an improved capability for verifying declared nuclear inventories and to detect any undeclared nuclear material and activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI>Based on the discussion by the Board of Governors in December 1995 and on subsequent consultations with Member States the Secretariat produced a new discussion paper, Discussion Draft II.  When the Director General introduced this paper informally to Board members in February 1996 so that they might prepare for discussion at the March 1996 meeting of the Board of Governors, he pointed out the need to strike an appropriate balance between measures to credibly strengthen safeguards and the need to avoid excessively difficult or burdensome obligations for Member States. 
<P>
<LI>Following discussions during the March 1996 Board of Governors meeting the Chairman's summing up recorded that the Board had welcomed Discussion Draft II and had commended the Secretariat for its positive response to concerns expressed.  In addition some Governors were of the view that the proposals in the Discussion Draft II represented a reasonable balance between the needs of a strengthened safeguards system and the obligations to be undertaken by States.  At the same time there continued to be divergences of view concerning a number of proposed Part 2 measures.  The Secretariat was requested to take into account all comments made and to continue consultations with Member States with a view to submitting a formal text for the Board's consideration in June 96.
<P>
<LI>Basing itself on Discussion Draft II and taking into account further consultations with Member States, discussion at the
 March 1996 meeting of the Board of Governors, and written comments submitted by some Member States, the Secretariat prepared 
a formal document for consideration at the June 1996 Board of Governors' meeting (GOV/2863, included as <A HREF="#annex">Annex 1</A>).
<P>
<LI>The Director General introduced GOV/2863 by reminding Board members that Part 1 measures and the measures described and 
proposed in the document were the culmination of several years of work by the Board and the Secretariat.  He said that the 
Secretariat had endeavoured to define in the document a set of measures which, together with actions already taken by the 
Board, would further improve the safeguards system, while leading neither to discrimination in application nor to 
unacceptably burdensome or intrusive measures.  The Director General recalled that for several years the Board had 
maintained a steady momentum leading to the current proposals and said that this momentum should not be lost.  He also 
said that a committee established by the Board to refine the protocol, meeting perhaps for two weeks early in July 1996, 
would help to move the full Programme 93 + 2 towards a timely conclusion.  The text of the Director General's introductory 
statement is included in <A HREF="#annex">Annex 2</A>.
<P>
<LI>In summing up the Board's discussion, the Chairman recalled that for three years the Secretariat and Member States had been engaged in an extensive effort to develop and evaluate measures for further strengthening the safeguards system and making it more cost-effective, with a principal objective of enhancing the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  
<P>
<LI>The Chairman further recalled the Board's endorsement of the general direction of Programme 93 + 2 and of their acknowledgement that additional information, environmental sampling and increased physical access would strengthen the Agency's ability to detect any undeclared nuclear material and activities.  He said that these new measures, however, should strike a balance between the Agency's need for information and access on the one hand and the State's need to protect its legitimate interests and to respect its constitutional obligations on the other.  He also emphasized that implementation of those measures should be subject to strict rules of confidentiality with regard both to information received and to the entire verification process.
<P>
<LI>The Chairman said that the Board had concluded that the examination of a draft model protocol would provide opportunities to find precise language striking a balance between the concerns of individual States and the need to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the measures proposed.  Therefore, the Board had decided to establish a open-ended committee with the task of drafting a model protocol basing itself on Annex 3 to document GOV/2863 and taking into account, <I>inter alia</I>,  the explanation of the measures contained in that document and the discussions on the matter in the Board.  
<P>
<LI>The full text of the Chairman's summing-up is contained in <A HREF="#annex">Annex 3</A>.
<P>
<LI>The committee entitled the "Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the Efficiency of the Safeguards System, established by the Board of Governors on 14 June 1996" held its first series of meetings from 2 to 4 July 1996.  Representatives of sixty-one States attended.  The committee undertook a first reading of the draft protocol (Annex 3 of GOV/2863) article by article and Member States' comments  were discussed on each article.  Member States were asked to submit to the Secretariat comments on the Protocol by 1 August 1996.  The Secretariat undertook to publish a compendium of comments by 1 September 1996.  The date of the next series of meetings of the committee was set for 1 October 1996.   The Chairman undertook to provide a progress report to the Board at its September, 1996 session.  This report will be distributed, when available, as an addition to this report.
<P>
<B><I>ON-GOING ACTIVITIES</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is proceeding with the implementation of Part 1 measures as rapidly as time and resources allow.  Following the June 1995 Board of Governors' meeting a detailed implementation plan was developed, and letters were sent to States with comprehensive safeguards agreements describing the actions the Secretariat had identified as necessary in order to proceed.  The letter indicated that the Secretariat would implement Part 1 measures in 1996 as broadly and extensively as possible, subject to operational and budgetary constraints.
<P>
The following is a summary of the activities undertaken in implementation of the Part 1 measures :
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)	Broader access to information
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	A questionnaire regarding States' systems of accounting and control was finalized and sent to all States with operative comprehensive safeguards agreements.  The questionnaire was sent to 59 States and two regional systems and 25 responses had been received by the end of July 1996.  A methodology for the analysis of the information is being tested using the responses received.
<P>
<DD>-	A letter requesting information on certain closed-down or decommissioned nuclear facilities and locations outside facilities (LOFs) and on nuclear facilities which were built but where nuclear material was never introduced, was sent to all States with comprehensive safeguards agreements at the end of March 1996. 25 responses have been received by the end of July 1996.  A letter requesting the additional information regarding the nuclear fuel cycle that can be sought under existing legal authority is being prepared.
<P>
<DD>-	Initial implementation of environmental sampling is being focussed on enrichment plants and certain hot-cell facilities.  General guidelines for the application of environmental sampling have been developed and approved, candidate facilities have been identified, sampling objectives, plans and procedures for specific facilities are being developed and consultations with Member States regarding implementation have been initiated.  Analytical equipment for the Agency's new clean laboratory at Seibersdorf has been installed.  The laboratory is now able to receive and handle samples with full operation scheduled for September 1996.   Base-line sample collections have been conducted at enrichment and hot-cell facilities with additional facilities in 10 Member States to be sampled this year.
<P>
<DD>-	A procedure has been planned for improved information analysis.
<P>
<DD>-	The procedures for protecting safeguards confidential information are being reviewed to ensure that protective measures are up-to-date and adequate.  Particular attention in being paid to the means of controlling access to safeguards confidential information in computer data files.  A Consultants Group of Member State experts met in Vienna in early December 1995 and, <I>inter alia</I>, reviewed the Secretariat's procedures for the distribution of environmental samples and for reporting results, intended to protect the anonymity of samples and the confidentiality of results.  The Group agreed that implementation of the procedures would meet the objectives of the Agency and of Member States.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>(b)	Increased physical access
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	Work is underway to identify how no-notice inspections (unannounced routine inspections), particularly in combination with additional operational data and advanced technology, could lead to more effective and efficient safeguards for a number of facility types.  An approach is currently being tested in a low enriched uranium fuel fabrication facility, and detailed consultations are underway in an attempt to define an approach for a similar facility.
 </DL>
<P>
<DD>(c)	Optimal use of the present system
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	A wide variety of advanced technology is being examined and demonstrated.  The objective is the development of new safeguards approaches which combine the new technology with no-notice inspections thereby permitting reductions in inspection frequency and effort.  Two digital surveillance cameras and an electronic seal using remote transmission through a satellite link to Vienna have been operational from a facility in Switzerland since mid-January 1996.  The specific location in the facility is a room with a vault containing a semi-static store of direct-use material.  Similar applications of advanced technology are being demonstrated at a facility in the US and another in South Africa.  In all cases the demonstrations include the authentication requirements of the Agency and the encryption requirements of the State.
<P>
<DD>-	A number of training courses necessary for the implementation of Part 1 measures are in various stages of preparation.  A training course on environmental sample collection and handling is in place and by the end of September 1996 approximately 100 inspectors will have received this training.  Training courses on enhanced observational skills are being evaluated and other courses dealing with the conduct of no-notice inspections and design verification of closed-down and decommissioned facilities are being prepared.  Courses for the training of personnel implementing State systems of accounting and control are also being prepared.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Front Cover:</B></FONT> The IAEA's system of international safeguards - which States have built over the past 40 years to serve as one of the world's barriers against the spread of nuclear weapons - depends upon close co-operation between State authorities and the Agency's inspectorate.  Under steps being taken to strengthen the system, even greater co-operation is taking gplace in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness, as described in articles featured in this edition of the <I>IAEA Bulletin</I>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>										
The nuclear power option is attracting increasing attention in East and South East Asia.  It is not difficult to understand why.  The fastest developing economies in the world require rapid growth in their energy resources.  In the Republic of Korea, where a phenomenal economic development has taken place, electricity use per person was at 100 kWh per year in 1964.  Today it is 4000.
<P>
	The Republic of Korea is fast developing its nuclear programme.  Today it has 11 reactors operating.  In 10 years time there may be over 25.  Japan, which has hardly any indigenous energy resources and whose post war development was an even greater economic miracle than that of Germany, has today more than 50 nuclear power reactors providing some 33% of Japan's electricity.  China, a late starter in the nuclear power field, currently has only three reactors operating, but the prospects are for a very fast expanding programme.
<P>


	The use of fossil sources of energy is growing even faster than nuclear, whose usefulness at present is mainly in responding to the demand for electricity.  Indeed, overall oil, gas and coal - fossil fuels - provide most of the commercial energy that the world uses - or about 90%.  Of this 36% is oil, 31% is coal and 22% is gas.  Nuclear power and hydro power provide about 11% - nuclear a little less than hydro.  Geothermal gives us about 0.5% and commercial renewables, like solar, wind and biomass, about 0.1%.
<P>

	It is precisely this crushing domination of fossil fuels that has led in the last thirty years to the active consideration - and increased use - of nuclear power.  It used to be said that the cheapest energy is the best energy and the price tag still certainly remains of crucial importance.  However, some other factors cannot be ignored.
<P>
	One of the early worries about the fossil fuels concerned the resource base.  The Club of Rome and other institutions warned that oil and gas would soon be depleted.  The resource worry is voiced with less intensity as more oil and gas and coal finds are made and become exploitable with new techniques.  Nevertheless there is a broad understanding and agreement that at current levels of use exploitable oil and gas will run out within 50 years, while coal may last more than 200 years.  Considering that the lead times are very long in the field of energy, we cannot allow ourselves to ignore the resource issue.  We must know how we shall satisfy our future need for energy.
<P>
	Industrialized countries also became concerned about the risks of being dependent on oil and gas from politically volatile areas like the Middle East.  The oil blockade was a powerful alarm clock that led energy poor countries like France and Japan to diversify their energy base and turn to energy saving and to nuclear power in order to become less vulnerable.  Today, however, this lesson seems to carry little weight in many places.  For instance, despite the continued lack of stability in the Middle East, the United States dependence on oil from this region is growing.
<P>
	While the dramatic price increases following the oil blockade and OPEC control had a strong impact on energy policies, the price of oil and gas has dropped drastically since then and the shock has worn off.  With economies happily sailing on a sea of cheap oil or floating on a cushion of cheap gas, thoughts about future energy supply are not allowed to seriously disturb the complacency of the moment.  And yet, more and more analysts, commentators and politicians are becoming concerned about the stagnation of nuclear power in the Western industrialized countries and aware of the need to bring nuclear power development back into gear.  Today the actual and potential environmental consequences of the current level of use of fossil fuels contribute strongly to this awareness.  The situation is somewhat paradoxical.  One reason why a sizeable segment of public opinion became sceptical about nuclear power was undoubtedly the concern which it felt generally about industrial waste and pollution - in which it included nuclear waste.  While this scepticism and concern, in the minds of many, are still felt about nuclear power and its waste, it is realized today by many others that nuclear power, which releases hardly any greenhouse gases, may help alleviate one of our greatest environmental threats, namely global warming.
<P>
<B>Fossil Fuels and the Environment</B>
<P>
	Let me focus for a moment on the environmental dangers of continued use of fossil fuels at current or increased levels.  In the 1970s and early 1980s the major concern was that the release of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides led to acid rains, damaging forests and lakes.  This concern remains, but several techniques now exist to eliminate or drastically reduce the emission of these noxious gases - though at considerable cost.  However, no technique is available to remove or neutralize the CO<SUB>2</SUB> which is formed at the burning of all fossil fuels and which, together with some other gases like methane leaked during the extraction and piping of natural gas, are believed to lead to an increase in the temperature of the world's atmosphere - global warming.

<P>
	At a conference here in Manila last February, Asian and Pacific leaders focused on the question of climate change.  It was reported that the emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> - mainly from the burning of fossil fuels - had increased from some 16 billion tons in 1972 to some 23 billion tons/year currently.  If present trends continued these CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, which trap heat in our atmosphere, would accelerate a warming of the global climate with vast consequences, including rising sea levels - through melting ice - and severe effects on coastlines and island States.  President Ramos was reported to have said that it would be ironical if an agreement on the freeze of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions were to freeze the Third World countries in a state of under-development.  However, the conference seems to have urged only the industrialized countries - not the Third World countries - to reduce by the year 2005 their 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.  After all, these are the countries that have been responsible for the excessive emissions that raise the current problem.  How the reductions were to be achieved was not explained.  Nor did the Climate Convention, which was adopted at the Rio Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, say how such reductions were to be achieved.  The worrisome reality is that in fact reductions are <I>not</I> taking place, but the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions continue to increase practically everywhere - including in the industrialized countries.  Indeed, an OECD report on the world energy outlook predicts that energy-derived CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions will <I>increase</I> by almost 50% by the year 2010.
<P>
	There does not seem to be any doubt that a greater use of nuclear power could significantly alleviate the dilemma of an increasing need for energy and an increasing need to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.  In a speech before the Second Session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Mr. Priddle, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency of the OECD, noted that "nuclear power accounted for the greater part of the lowering of carbon intensity of the energy economies of the OECD countries over the last 25 years".

<P>
	Indeed, if the some 435 nuclear reactors which exist in the world today were to be replaced by coal plants of equivalent capacity, some 2600 million tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB> would be added to the world's atmosphere annually - i.e. 9% of all CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from fossil fuels.
<P>
	Before focusing further on the nuclear energy option to help restrain CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, I should discuss some other approaches.
<P>
<B>Are there Alternatives to Nuclear Power?</B>
 <P>
	One approach - to which everybody agrees - is to bring about a <I>more efficient use of energy</I>.  It is rightly said that the least polluting energy is the energy you don't use.  Or, the less fossil fuels are used, the less CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.  Efficiency gains are achieved as technologies develop.  Today's cars run twice as far on a litre of gasoline as the cars did 10 years ago.  However, this gain is likely to be neutralized by a doubling in the number of cars.  Similarly, today's refrigerators and lamp bulbs use less electricity than yesterday's.  However, there are more refrigerators and lamps ...  This, of course, is no reason to ignore possible economic efficiency gains.  But for dedicated efforts in this area the situation would be even worse.

<P>
	Another, perfectly realistic approach, consists in a <I>switch from coal to oil and gas</I>, as the burning of oil and gas produce less CO<SUB>2</SUB> per energy unit than from the burning of coal.  In the Western industrialized countries an evolution of this kind may be taking place.  Coal is not the energy of choice today.  The use of gas is favoured, partly because at current prices it is economic, and partly for environmental reasons.  Gas use is expected to increase by 55% in absolute terms from 1992 to 2010.  We have to face the reality, however, that globally there is also a strong increase in the use of coal.  Again between 1992 and 2010 the annual coal production is expected to increase dramatically:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	in Australia from 178 million tons to 290 million tons;
<P>
<DD>-	in China from 1138 million tons to 2100 million tons;
<P>
<DD>-	in India from 240 million tons to 485 million tons;
<P>
<DD>-	in South Africa from 182 million tons to 326 million tons;
<P>
<DD>-	in the United States from 823 million tons to 1070 million tons.
</DL>
<P>
If one may assume that all this coal will be used, one must conclude that the combustion will lead to more CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.
<P>
	One question which naturally is asked is whether it would be feasible to <I>sequester</I> - separate and neutralize - the CO<SUB>2</SUB> that is formed when fossil fuels are burnt.  While theoretical suggestions have been made about such separation and about the piping of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the injection of  it at 3000 metres depth in the ocean, no realistic schemes of this kind exist.
<P>
	A greater use of <I>renewable sources of energy</I> - wind and solar power and biomass - is invariably urged from the environmentalist quarters.  Considerable research and development resources are devoted to these energy sources and it is to be hoped that they will one day provide substantial amounts of energy in the future.  However, as I noted earlier, currently their contribution - hydro power and geothermal not counted - is only about 0.1% of world energy.
<P>
	It is perhaps tempting to believe that the sunshine which is free and everywhere and the wind that blows all over the world and the biomass that grows freely, could become limitless, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-free sources of energy.  Regrettably, these sources have several inherent and severe handicaps which affect their economy and usefulness.  Solar rays and wind are intermittent - it does not shine or blow all the time - and so long as we have not found effective ways of storing electricity these sources cannot provide the electricity that we need around the clock - the baseload electricity.
<P>
	Another inherent handicap in renewable sources is that they are <I>dispersed</I>.  If you want significant amounts of energy (electricity) from solar or wind or biomass, you must "harvest" them over large areas and this is expensive.  It has been calculated that, to achieve the electricity generating capacity of one of today's commonly sized power plants of 1000 MW(e), you would need:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>an area of 50 to 60 km<SUP>2</SUP> of solar cells or windmills; or
<P>
<DD>an area of 3000 to 5000 km<SUP>2</SUP> of growing biomass.
</DL>
<P>
	It is not difficult to understand that it will be hard to make such energy sources economically competitive.  What I have said should not be taken as expressing a negative attitude to non-conventional renewable sources of energy.  I support continued research, development and trial use of these sources.  Solar energy is presently of use for the heating of household water and for the generation of electricity where only small amounts of electricity are needed, as in watches or instruments, and where there exist real cost-benefits as in isolated places to which power lines would be very costly.  Wind and biomass also have their applications.  However, we should have no illusions that in the short or medium term these sources will bring us the huge quantities of energy that will be demanded.  Despite the welcome gradual progress that has been made in the effectiveness of renewable sources, these are not expected - by neutral analysts such as the World Energy Council - to reach but very modest shares of the world energy use in the foreseeable future.
<P>
	Mankind has gone from the use of wood to coal, oil, gas and uranium because the higher energy concentration has offered economy and convenience.  Sailing ships were replaced by steamers using coal-fired engines and these were replaced by oil-fired diesel engines.  Were it not for the resistance and fear of nuclear energy, nuclear power reactors might have been used not only in aircraft carriers, ice-breakers and submarines, but also to replace the diesel engines in large cargo ships.  Some figures may help to further illustrate the meaning of energy density:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>1 kg of firewood produces about 1 kWh electricity;
<P>
<DD>1 kg of coal produces about 3 kWh electricity;
<P>
<DD>1 kg of oil produces about 4 kWh electricity;
<P>
<DD>1 kg of natural uranium produces about 50 000 kWh electricity;
<P>
<DD>1 kg of plutonium produces about 6 000 000 kWh.
</DL>
<P>
	Understandably the differences in energy density have an impact on the measures needed for extraction, storage and transportation of the fuel.  In a referendum Austria decided not to operate a nuclear power plant which it had built and which would have used some 30 tons of uranium/year.  The two coal-fired power plants which were built as a substitute now burn five train loads of coal <I>per day</I> - or about 1.5-2 million tons of coal per year ...  Another example illustrating how high density energy can be used is a small nuclear power plant of four units of 12 MW(e) that the Russians have built to provide electricity to an isolated mining community in an inaccessible Arctic area.  The uranium fuel can be flown in!  And the resulting spent fuel can be flown out!
<P>

<B>Energy Choices</B>
<P>
	It is evident that before making a choice among the various energy options comparisons should be made from several viewpoints.  Economy may still be the most important aspect, but their impact upon life, health and environment is an increasingly important factor.  As I have noted, the degree of energy independence that an option may give can also be of relevance.  The same is true of the level of technical or scientific infrastructure that an energy option may require.
<P>
	When I suggest that "we" should compare the economic, ecological and other aspects of different energy options from fuel extraction to waste disposal, I speak as if there existed some global planning commission.  In reality the decisions are taken by individual governments, sometimes perhaps even by private utilities.  While the decentralization of decision-making has great advantages, it also poses problems.  In an individual State the government can legislate to bring individual action in line with the national good, but how can a world community of sovereign States bring the action of individual States in line with global needs?
<P>

	The problem is by no means unprecedented.  Take fisheries:  it may be advantageous for a State to allow its fishermen to catch as much fish as they can in international waters.  But if all States reason this way, the stock may disappear.  So some agreement regulating catch needs to be worked out between the States to make fishing a sustainable activity.  Or take the problem of the thinning ozone layer:  it may be advantageous for a country to allow the free use of CFCs (chlorofluorcarbons), but if all States do that, the ozone layer, which protects us from too much ultraviolet rays, may disappear, leading to sharp increases everywhere in skin cancer.  We evidently need agreement between States to ensure that CFC emissions be minimal.
<P>
	The risk of global warming resulting from the excessive emissions of greenhouse gases by individual nations raises a similar problem and a similar need for international agreement.  However, the uncertainties and dimensions of this problem are far greater and the difficulties are compounded by the modest outlook for renewable sources of energy and the controversy surrounding nuclear power.  Clearly a first step for reaching some internationally agreed policy is to create a realistic perception of facts and understanding of the problems we face.
<P>
	Various scenarios which have been worked out show that significantly less CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions would result from a global energy mix in which nuclear power formed a greater part than is currently the case.  At this nuclear conference I shall focus on nuclear power, its merits and problems.  A few illustrations may be clarifying.
<P>	
	A nuclear plant of 1000 MW(e) capacity emits no CO<SUB>2</SUB>, but produces some 35 tons of highly radioactive spent fuel.  If the spent fuel is reprocessed, the volume of highly radioactive waste will be about 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The entire nuclear chain supporting this 1000 MW(e) plant - from mining through operation - will generate, in addition, some 200 m<SUP>3</SUP> of intermediate level waste and some 500 m<SUP>3</SUP> of low level waste per year.

<P>
<DL>
<DT>A 1000 MW(e) coal plant with optimal cleaning equipment will emit:
<P>
<DD>900 tons of SO<SUB>2</SUB> per year;
<P>
<DD>4500 tons of NO<SUB>x</SUB>;
<P>
<DD>400 tons of heavy metals; and
<P>
<DD>6.5 million tons of CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
</DL>
<P>
	Another illustration:  in the UK, where some 70% of electricity is generated by coal, the emission of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per kWh is 0.78 kg. In France, where more than 70% of electricity is generated by nuclear power, the emission of CO<SUB>2</SUB> per kWh is about one tenth of the UK value, or      0.086 kg.
<P>
	If the almost total absence of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions makes nuclear power an attractive option to respond to the risk of global warming, other aspects of nuclear power must also be discussed.  Let me first touch on the <I>economy</I>.
<P>
	Nuclear power used to have a strong competitive economic advantage over fossil-fuelled electricity.  This advantage has largely disappeared through increased costs resulting from many new demands on the safety side.  However, while fossil-based electricity may be increasingly forced to carry the cost of expensive anti-pollution measures, nuclear power can probably still envisage construction improvements which will make the plants cheaper in the future.  At present the OECD calculates that with variations due to specific locations and different discount assumptions, the cost of nuclear generated electricity and coal-based electricity is roughly on par.  However, this conclusion does not deal with one relevant factor.  A large part of the cost of nuclear power is upfront - in the construction of the plant.  The uranium fuel for the plant is relatively cheap.  For the coal plant the situation is the opposite:  the cost of the construction is not so great, but the cost of the fuel over the life span of the plant is considerable.  For developing countries short of investment capital, this is clearly a negative factor in the nuclear option.  Further, for many developing countries the need for a certain level of industrial and technological infrastructure and for well trained cadres of engineers may also make the choice of the nuclear option inadvisable.
<P>
	There are three other factors that, in the view of many, speak against the nuclear option:  the issues of waste, safety and proliferation.
<P>
	I touched already on the issue of <I>nuclear waste</I>.  At this point I need only add that it is an erroneous belief that there are no safe and satisfactory ways of isolating wastes which remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years - that the nuclear industry is like an aeroplane taking off without knowing where to land.  There is, indeed, a global consensus in the nuclear industry on appropriate methods and a convention on the subject of management of spent fuel and waste, laying down the basic rules and obliging the parties to mutually accept peer review of their waste installations, is expected to be signed under IAEA auspices next year.  The problem we face on nuclear waste is not technological but rather one of explaining to the public that the solutions are adequate.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
	Fear of nuclear accidents resulting in emissions of radioactivity to the environment is probably at the heart of many peoples' sceptical attitude to nuclear power.  The Chernobyl accident ten years ago stands as the frightening image.  It would be far for me to belittle that tragic accident, yet it must be seen in a larger perspective and nuclear safety must be compared with safety in alternative ways of generating electricity.  It should first be remembered that most new technologies encounter some accidents - from which lessons are learnt.  Both the Three Mile Island accident - from which no radioactivity escaped to the environment - and the Chernobyl disaster have led to the introduction of new safety features in nuclear reactors and in the operating procedures.  Also of importance is the fact that gradually an international nuclear safety culture is developing.  The IAEA is very active in bringing it about - through rules and services.  Fortunately we can see, in the lower number of unplanned reactor stoppages, in the lower radiation dosages affecting the personnel and in the higher availability of the plants that this safety culture is yielding results.  Improved reactor constructions will also help to strengthen safety in new plants that are built.
<P>

	Nevertheless, we know that as in any other technology there will be some incidents and we hope that there will be no accidents.  The risks are not zero.  The IAEA has introduced an International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) which grades accidents  - just as we grade earthquakes - from 1 to 7.  We hope this scale will help the public realize that most incidents are of very minor significance and result in no threat to public health.
<P>
	When considering the risk of nuclear generation of electricity one must be aware that alternative ways of generating the desired electricity would also carry some risk.  Actually the largest accidents - in terms of casualties - in the energy field are connected with the bursting of hydro dams.  One example was the failure in 1979 of a dam in Macchu in India, where 2500 people perished.  There are also, as we know, severe accidents connected with the piping and storing of gas, the mining of coal and the transportation of oil.  A gas pipeline explosions in Guadalajara in Mexico killed 200 people in 1992.  In China, a recent coal mine explosion last week is reported to have killed many miners. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power and Nuclear Weapons</B>
<P>
	Lastly, let me discuss the concern that an expansion of nuclear power might lead to a further spread of nuclear weapons and to illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  These concerns must be taken seriously.  However, with the end of the Cold War and the accelerated dismantling of nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia, there is a broad - but not universal - movement away from nuclear weapons.  Latin America and Africa are now nuclear-weapon-free continents and nuclear-weapon-free zones have been established in the South Pacific and - last year - in South East Asia.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended for an indefinite period of time and a complete test ban treaty has recently been adopted by the United Nations.  Tests in the Pacific and elsewhere have ceased.
<P>
	If nuclear disarmament continues and detente could be developed in the Middle East, on the Indian subcontinent and on the Korean peninsula, the world might be exiting from the nuclear weapons era.  This would be an enormous blessing in itself.  It would hopefully also make it easier to obtain public acceptance of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  For its part the IAEA is very actively engaged in strengthening the verification that must be linked to all peaceful uses of nuclear energy to give confidence that any misuse would be discovered.  We don't want another Iraq.
<P>

	In concluding let me make two further points.  First, it is not my task or the task of the IAEA to "sell" nuclear power to anybody.  All States take their own decisions, on their own responsibility.  My belief is, however, that a global nuclear revival will become indispensible, that the industrialized countries in the West, which once spearheaded nuclear power, will in due course follow the examples of Asia and that gradually more, technically advanced developing countries will also turn to the nuclear option - as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, India and Pakistan have done, and as the Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan (China) are now doing on a large scale.
<P>
	The second - and last - point I want to make relates to regional co-operation.  In May of this year President Ramos called on East Asian countries to discuss the possible creation of an "Asiatom".  And in July, Foreign Minister Siazon amplified these ideas at the Third ASEAN Regional Forum in Jakarta.  In my view, it is wise to suggest the early consideration of such ideas.  Indeed, good examples already exist.  The IAEA-supported Regional Co-operation Agreement for Asia and the Pacific brings together national nuclear institutions in a range of nuclear related activities contributing to development.  Also the South East Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone provides for interaction on issues such as safety and waste disposal.
<P>
	There is little doubt that there could be advantages in further measures on a regional basis, for example to train operators, scientists and regulators.  Also, looking to the future, there could be a case, for reasons of economy, transparency and mutual confidence to consider the operation of fuel cycle installations, like enrichment or reprocessing plants and waste disposal sites under regional arrangements.
<P>
	Although trafficking in nuclear material has not been common in Asia, regional co-operation to prevent it could well be advantageous.  Safeguards verification under the Non-Proliferation Treaty will most likely remain international.  In fact, all existing regional nuclear-weapon-free zones rely on the IAEA for verification and confidence in non-proliferation is best enhanced by outside inspection.  However, in some areas regional inspection arrangements may well be useful or needed to <I>supplement</I> international safeguards.
<P>

	Lastly, even as regards nuclear safety, it must be remembered that it is a global concern and that regional efforts to promote safety will not supplant but might well supplement the joint efforts made on a global basis.  I am happy to end by telling you that the IAEA International Convention on Nuclear Safety will enter into operation in the spring of 1997.

<H3>The Good uses of Nuclear Energy

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A famous faculty of medicine does not need to be told that there are good uses of nuclear energy.  It is fully aware that radioactivity was discovered a hundred years ago and has been used for human benefit, not least in the medical field, for half a century.  It knows that modern medicine would be unthinkable without diagnostic radiology and radiotherapy. Indeed, these techniques have become so common, so reliable and so accurate that, in the Western industrialized world, about one patient in every three undergoes some form of radiological procedure - diagnostic or therapeutic.  In this lecture I propose nevertheless to describe how the International Atomic Energy Agency seeks to promote the development and dissemination of nuclear techniques which are beneficial to us, including nuclear medicine.
<P>
	Before I do so, however, I must acknowledge what is implicit in the title of this lecture on the <I>good</I> uses of nuclear energy, namely that there are also uses which are not good.  Indeed, I fear most people associate the word "nuclear" primarily with weapons, and perhaps secondly with nuclear power accidents and these associations often spill over on their attitudes to the nuclear uses that are beneficial.  Although regrettable, this is perhaps after all not so surprising.  It is more than 50 years since the first - and only - atomic bombs were used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Who can forget the devastating effects they had, and the immense suffering that they caused?  Then, just ten years ago, there was Chernobyl when a nuclear power reactor of very special design surged out of control during an ill-conceived experiment and hurled radioactivity into the sky.  That major disaster still affects the populations in the region and still has a major impact on people's attitude to nuclear power.  These two dramatic cases certainly remind us of the destructive potential of the atom turned loose.  We should perhaps remember, however, that nuclear energy is by no means unique in having a potential for giving both good and bad.
<P>
	Take fire.  Fire is fundamental to human civilization.  It permitted our ancestors to shape tools that enabled them to till the soil and harvest crops.  But it also enabled them to wage war on neighbours.  And we know that throughout history fire let loose has brought immeasurable destruction to villages, cities and forests.  Fire, like nuclear energy, can be used for good and bad.
       <P>                                                                               
	Another example: gunpowder.  Its invention has helped to perfect weapons for hunting and to blast mineral ores.  Yet, how many millions of human beings have been killed or injured in war, insurgency and in random violence?
<P>
	One last example: the aeroplane.  The same technology that has made the world smaller and brought us closer is the one that introduced terrible new dimensions to warfare, including the bombardment of cities far behind the lines of battles.
<P>
	The United States, as the first country to make a nuclear bomb, and also the first in which a controlled nuclear chain reaction took place, was quick to recognize nuclear's potential for good and evil.  It decided to provide a disincentive for the military use by offering to share with other States much of its knowledge of the peaceful use of nuclear energy - in return for pledges of <I>exclusively</I> peaceful use from the recipients of such know-how.  This bargain was articulated in President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech at the United Nations in the early 1950s and the International Atomic Energy Agency (or IAEA) traces its origin to this policy.
<P>
	A conference in Geneva in the 1950s revealed vast amounts of thitherto secret scientific data and raised tremendous hopes for a new nuclear era.  Forty years on we can see that some of the hopes have come true - both regarding actual peaceful use and regarding pledges against the military use.  Today some 17% of the world's electricity is nuclear-generated, to point to the most spectacular result.  And, under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), some 180 non-nuclear-weapon States have now committed themselves for an indefinite period of time not to acquire nuclear weapons.  Moreover, a Comprehensive Test Ban has recently been adopted.  There are also disappointments, however.  Despite the beginning of nuclear disarmament, the five declared nuclear-weapon States still have thousands of nuclear warheads and neither the risk of proliferation nor the risk of trafficking in nuclear materials have been eliminated.
<P>
	The IAEA itself was set up in 1957 precisely to promote the good applications of nuclear energy and to help States verify, at their request - through international inspections  - that their uses of nuclear energy were indeed peaceful.  You will find our inspectors going about their work daily from South Africa to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, from Iraq to Argentina and Brazil.  In performing our statutory tasks, we have accumulated a rich experience in serving the international community in two major respects - as an institution generating norms and providing services and assistance for the use of peaceful nuclear technology and acting as what might be termed external auditors to keep track of stocks of nuclear materials to give confidence that they are not diverted for weapons purposes.
<P>
<B>The Field of Medicine</B>
<P>
	Let me now revert to the field closest to your professional calling, namely medicine.  A major part of the IAEA's technical co-operation programme is devoted to the promotion of human health.  Examples are projects through which the Agency is helping to foster the use of cancer diagnosis and therapy by nuclear means in developing nations such as Ghana, Tanzania, Mongolia and Nicaragua.  I might also mention brachytherapy, which the IAEA is helping to apply in all our developing Member States in Asia.
<P>
	Nuclear techniques - and particularly medical ones - must be used under proper rules and rigorous control.  The IAEA is one of six international organizations that co-operated in developing some rules of fundamental importance, the so-called Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources - the BSS for short.  The IAEA also co-operates with the World Health Organization (WHO) in establishing conformity of radiation measurements in radiotherapy units worldwide through a network of secondary dosimetry laboratories (SSDLs).  In industrialized countries, hospitals achieve conformity through calibration of their dosimeters to national primary standards.  But the heavy workload of the world's 13 Primary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories does not allow the calibration of reference dosimeters from thousands of other hospitals throughout the world. Competent national authorities have therefore designated SSDLs, in a programme started in 1976,  to provide certified calibrations.
<P>
	The Agency also seeks to provide a forum for discussion of effects of low-level radiation, which is an area of much scientific controversy and some public anxiety.  The health hazards of exposure to high levels of radiation are well known and documented: exposed persons show acute clinical effects and the severity is directly linked to the radiation dose.  In general, however, the doses at which statistical links can be demonstrated to illness and death in human populations are many times higher than the doses from which governments seek to protect their populations.  An important question is whether very small increases of radiation doses above the natural background levels in reality result in any increased risk.  The International Commission on Radiation Protection recommends the use of a linear, no-threshold model to extrapolate the risks of low dose exposure from higher dose observations.  Some argue that this leads to exaggerated, unduly expensive protection measures.  Regardless of these differences all experts agree that the risks from low-level radiation are very small.  The need is for policies that are both prudent and practical.  The linear, no-threshold hypothesis has merit as a basis for precautionary action, but very small risks should not be allowed to lead to absurdly expensive protective measures. The use of the hypothesis as a basis for regulation and decisions needs to be approached with care and the same is true for public information about it.
<P>
<B>Food and Agriculture</B>
<P>
	I turn now to comment on the good use of nuclear techniques in the field of agriculture -  a key area for the developing world.
<P>
	To give some examples, radioisotopes and radiation are applied in this field,

<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	 to create induced mutations in plants to obtain desired agricultural crop varieties;
<P>
 <DD>- to determine conditions necessary for optimizing fertilizer and water use, as well as biological nitrogen fixation;
<P>
<DD>- 	to eradicate or control insect pests;
<P>
<DD>-	to improve reproductive performance, nutritional status and yield of animals;
<P>
<DD>- 	to reduce post-harvest losses by suppressing sprouting and contamination and extending shelf life of foodstuffs; and 
 <P>
<DD>-	to study the pathway of pesticides and agrochemicals in the environment and food chain.
</DL>
<P>
	Let me explain further and give you some concrete examples.
<P>
<B>Water</B>
<P>
	Isotopic techniques provide important analytical tools in the management and husbanding of existing supplies of water and in the identification of new, replenishable and exploitable sources of water.  The IAEA has a dedicated isotope hydrology laboratory that supports development activities in Member States.  We assist countries with chronic water shortages such as Morocco, Senegal and Ethiopia.  Over the last ten years the IAEA has supported almost 160 projects worth 20 million dollars to help Member States develop national infrastructure in isotope hydrology applications.  Some 550 scientists have been trained in the relevant skills.
<P>
<B>Measurement of nitrogen uptake in crops</B>
<P>
	In co-operation with the FAO, the IAEA has perfected the N<SUP>15</SUP> technique method to measure how nitrogen is taken up by plants from the atmosphere, from the soil and applied fertilizers.  The technique provides an estimate of the total nitrogen fixed during the entire growing season.  By this means, more efficient nitrogen fixing legumes with higher yield and protein content can be identified and selected.  The FAO and IAEA jointly support some 30 projects worldwide on the production and use of biofertilizers for increasing biological nitrogen fixation and yield of grain legumes.  Where biofertilizers are applied, production has been raised by 25 percent in countries like Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
 <P>
<B>Tsetse Fly</B>
<P>
	You are familiar with the sleeping sickness, transmitted by the tsetse fly.  The presence of this insect has prevented settlement and development of large areas of Africa.  While some species of tsetse have been temporarily controlled in West Africa, eradication has proved an elusive goal.  Along with the FAO, the IAEA has recently successfully been targeting one species of tsetse that has caused sizeable losses of cattle on the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania) and we are confident that eradication will result.
<P>
	The technique used involves a unique, non-polluting method which has already been applied successfully to numerous other insect pests in recent years.  Tsetse flies are reared in vast numbers and radiation-sterilized male flies are released in large numbers by air over an infested area.  When they mate with wild females, no offspring are produced and infestation can thus be reduced and ultimately eliminated.  This is particularly true in a confined area such as the island of Zanzibar, where the risk of re-infestation from the outside is minimal and where we hope to achieve success by the end of 1997.  It would also be true of the Southern Rift Valley in Ethiopia where we expect to apply the technique in the near future.
<P>
<B>Food Irradiation</B>
<P>
	The use of irradiation technology to preserve food is gaining more attention around the world.  In 37 countries, health and safety authorities have approved irradiation of over 40 kinds of food, ranging from spices to grains, to deboned chicken, fruit and vegetables.  Today, consumers can safely enjoy irradiated strawberries in France, or local irradiated sausage in Thailand, for instance.
<P>
	Here, too, rules and standards are needed for a responsible use of the technique.  A worldwide standard for irradiated food was adopted already in 1983 by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which is a joint body of the FAO and the WHO representing over 130 countries.  An expert committee has reported to the Commission that the irradiation of any food commodity up to an overall average dose of 10 kilogray presented no toxicological hazard, required no further testing, and introduced no special nutritional or microbiological problems.
<P>
	Governmental interest in the process stems from a variety of reasons:  there are high losses of food (typically 25% of all food production) due to infestation, contamination and spoilage after harvesting;  concern about foodborne diseases;  and growing international trade in foodstuffs that must meet stringent import standards of quality and quarantine.
<P>
	While the Codex Alimentarius Commission exercises oversight regarding the foodstuffs, international radiation protection regulations lay down rules for the safe operation of plants where irradiation takes place.  The IAEA helps in formulating such rules.  The Agency has likewise often provided assistance to countries wishing to test or use this novel technology.  I should add that food irradiation still encounters resistance from various groups.  Considering that astronauts and especially sensitive patients are often given irradiated food to reduce the risk of stomach infections, one may wonder why healthy people in normal conditions would object.
<P>
<B>INDUSTRY</B>
<P>
	Industrial applications of nuclear techniques are numerous.  Let me mention some.
<P>
<B>Polymerization</B>
<P>
	In today's high-tech telecommunications world, there is a great demand for lightweight, durable and versatile polymer covers, for example for cables.  Exposure of polymers to low levels of radiation delivers precisely that kind of product to the electronics industry.  It is a growing business and the IAEA has been active to help transfer this technology to South East Asia, under a long-standing and very successful regional co-operation agreement for Asia and the Pacific (RCA).
<P>

<B>Gauging</B>
<P>
	Another important application of nuclear techniques is the fine measurement of industrial products, such as paper thickness.  The tightness of welds on gas or oil pipelines can also be verified by the application of gamma radiography, a nuclear technique that is not so different from X-rays.
<P>
<B>Geothermal power</B>
<P>
	As you will know, the five million inhabitants of the island of Negros in the Philippines obtain all their electricity from geothermal plants.  At the IAEA isotope hydrology laboratory in Vienna, we investigate geothermal systems by isotopic techniques to optimize the use of such geothermal resources.  In some countries, like Costa Rica and Nicaragua, the Agency has also provided isotope techniques to help map the geothermal resources to decide on the best location of installations.
<P>
<B>Flue gas emissions</B>
<P>
	Another power-related development I want to tell you about is the use of accelerator generated electron beams in the chimney stacks of conventional coal-burning power plants.  By this ingenious and original technique you can virtually eliminate sulphur and nitrogen emissions to the environment.  Indeed, by adding ammonium, you transform these potentially polluting flue gases into fertilizers - ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate!  This method is currently being demonstrated in a project which the IAEA is supporting near Warsaw in Poland.  The method will not fulfil the alchemist's dream of transforming lead into gold, but transforming pollution into fertilizer is already not bad.
<P>

<B>ENVIRONMENT</B>
<P>
	Ever since the major UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio four years ago, hardly a week has gone by without a new report being issued somewhere in the world about the "greenhouse effect".  It seems increasingly certain that the rapidly growing concentration of carbon dioxide and methane and other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will lead to a rise in the temperature of the earth's atmosphere - global warming.  There is much talk about the stabilization or reduction of the emissions of "greenhouse gases".  However, the rhetoric and the reality go in opposite directions:  carbon dioxide emissions actually continue to rise everywhere.  In a speech here in Manila the other day I tried to show that a greater reliance on nuclear power in the world could help restrain the burning of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emitting fossil-fuelled plants.  I shall not repeat what I said, but I might add in this research-oriented forum that techniques using radioisotopes are proving to be valuable tools in improving the understanding of the complex carbon cycle in the atmosphere and the oceans.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power</B>
<P>
	I shall also not repeat in this lecture what I said about the pros and cons of nuclear power and the likelihood of and need for a more general revival of the nuclear option, which has suffered stagnation in much of the Western industrialized world during the last 15 years but which is espoused in some of the rapidly developing countries in Asia.  I would like to point out before this audience, however, that nuclear power may have several other uses than electricity generation.  It may be used to produce industrial heat or steam for district heating in countries where this is demanded, and even for propulsion systems for merchant shipping.  The nuclear-propelled aircraft carriers and submarines of the Great Powers have demonstrated the viability of the technology, and the Russian ice-breakers have shown that nuclear-powered ships can work year after year in the most difficult climatic conditions in the world - in the Arctic.  
<P>
	Moreover, countries short of drinking water - and such countries are regrettably becoming more numerous - are looking at the heat generated by nuclear reactors to desalinate sea water and make it potable.  For some time the IAEA has been actively engaged in helping to explore that option, for instance in countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
<P>
	And further - although there are a number of nuclear reactors in the world that have already been successfully operating for 40 years, nuclear power is still a relatively young technology.  A second generation of fission reactors is just arriving - for example, the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor which went recently into operation in Japan.  Given sufficient interest by governments and utilities, I see the potential for the third generation fission reactors, which are on the drawing-board today and which are expected to be simpler, cheaper and safer still. 
<P>
	One special type of reactor has had a good deal of adverse publicity - the fast breeder.  Its special characteristic is to produce - breed - more plutonium fuel in the process of burning the original fuel.  In fact, the breeder uses the energy contents of uranium some 40 times more effectively than an ordinary light water reactor.  I do not suggest that the breeder is the answer to today's energy problems, because it is expensive and there is no shortage of uranium.  However, the existence of the breeder as an already available technology gives us assurance that nuclear power can offer an almost inexhaustible supply of energy.  It could be an important part of the answer to the world's fuel problems 30 years from now, when oil and gas and also uranium may be scarcer and more expensive, and renewable energies have not proved capable of generating the large volumes of energy needed.
<P>
	One frequently voiced objection to nuclear power is the highly radioactive waste it produces.  While there exist today satisfactory methods for safely disposing of this waste, I want to mention in this science-oriented forum that the day may come when these wastes can be managed through new advanced processes known as actinide partitioning and transmutation.  Research into this is moving ahead in several countries along several parallel tracks. One involves use of an advanced liquid-metal reactor as part of an integrated fast reactor and fuel cycle system; another is an accelerator-driven, sub-critical fast reactor system.  However, these new approaches still have a long way to go.
<P>
<B>Fusion</B>
<P>
	One exciting prospect, which is still worked on in the laboratories by the scientists, is the harnessing of nuclear fusion - essentially replicating the energy of the sun.  This is a formidable and expensive scientific and technological challenge. Yet the magnitude of the progress achieved so far has encouraged several major countries around the world to support further work on a fusion reactor, including work that is being conducted under the aegis of the IAEA.
<P>
	The role of fusion in nature can hardly be exaggerated: it is fusion that has powered the stars for billions of years.  Fusion is therefore not only the source of solar energy but also of all fossil and most renewable forms of energy available on our planet.  Here on earth, however, it is far more difficult to artificially create the conditions required for a self-sustaining, net power producing reaction in the case of fusion than in the case of fission.
<P>
	Let me conclude:  Having unlocked many of the secrets of the atom and benefiting from it, it is also our obligation to lock up the evil uses and to make sure, in addition, that our peaceful use of nuclear energy is safe and environmentally acceptable.  Nuclear science and technology are giving the world a vast number of gifts, beneficial to health and wellbeing, including electric power.  We should make good use of these gifts.

IAEA Director General Addresses 40<SUP>th </SUP> Regular Session of IAEA General Conference
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Entering its 40th year of international service for the safe and peaceful development of nuclear energy, the IAEA continues to change the thrust of many  programmes in response to changes in the international climate and the needs and interests of its 124 Member States, IAEA Director General Dr. Hans Blix said today in an opening statement to the Agency's General Conference.  The Conference, which is being attended by Ministers and high-level governmental delegates from more than 100 countries, is meeting this week in Vienna, Austria.
<P>
In commenting upon the international agenda,  Dr. Blix noted that attention increasingly is concentrated on how to improve the well-being of the Earth and its population, rather than on how to avoid extinction through nuclear war.  "This is a welcome change of focus with important consequences for the work of international organizations, including the IAEA," he said.  
<P>
In reviewing the Agency's programmes, the Director General highlighted specific developments in various areas related to nuclear verification, safety, energy and the environment, and technology transfer.  He pointed out that despite limitations on resources, the Agency's work has expanded in recent years to take on new activities, both through the phasing out of some programmes and through efficiency gains.  "This process continues," he said, noting that the budget for 1997 assumes substantial cuts in overhead costs and provides an increase of some US $10 million in programmatic activities.
<P>
Selected highlights of the Director General's address follow.
<P>
<I>Safeguards and verification.</I>  Both the dimension and direction of the Agency's safeguards activities have changed considerably over time, Dr. Blix said, noting that 120 States to date have concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA.  He pointed out that the  IAEA is about to take a major step forward in further developing its safeguards system,  a step he called "essential to introduce new cost-effective methods and techniques and to provide vitally needed confidence that non-proliferation commitments are fully respected".  This step -- which is designed to provide the IAEA inspectorate with more information from States having comprehensive safeguards agreements and with greater access to data for its inspectors -- will also help to make the safeguards system an adequate instrument that can be used to verify future nuclear arms control and disarmament measures, he noted.   The Director General also said he would be meeting on 17 September with the United States and Russian Ministers present to discuss the possibility of verification by the IAEA that nuclear material released through dismantling of weapons is irreversibly transferred to the peaceful sector.
<P>
<I>Nuclear inspections in Iraq.</I>  The IAEA's ongoing monitoring and verification activities under terms of United Nations Security Council resolutions have included more than 600 inspections since August 1994, the Director General said.  Activities are continuing, he noted, though some activities that should take place outside of the Baghdad region can only be resumed when conditions permit, given the prevailing circumstances in Iraq, he said.  Over the past year, he said that the Agency's activities in Iraq have involved extensive efforts to analyze the vast amount of information that was handed over to the IAEA and the UN Special Commission in August 1995.  Work soon will start to verify the completeness and correctness of Iraq's re-issued Declaration of its former nuclear weapons programme, which last week was formally transmitted to the Agency's Nuclear Monitoring Group in Baghdad, he said.  
<P>
<I>Safeguards in the DPRK.</I>  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) still is not in full compliance with its safeguards agreement, he said.  Recent technical discussions resulted in some progress, he said, although the DPRK still did not accept various measures which the IAEA considers important for verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration, in particular measures for the preservation of data and the provision of information about certain facilities.  A next round of technical talks is being scheduled, he noted.
<P>
<I>Radiological assessments of test sites.</I>  The IAEA has become engaged over recent years in the assessment of the radiological situation at three former nuclear weapons test sites, the Director General pointed out.  These are the Semipalatinsk site in Kazakstan, the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia.  A final report on this assessment is expected by the end of 1997, he said. 
<P>
<I>Nuclear safety and waste management.</I>   The global nuclear safety regime is becoming more firmly established through a range of Agency services and  programmes, Dr. Blix said.  He pointed to the increasing number of international conventions providing legally binding norms as part of the regulatory framework, noting that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which covers nuclear power plants worldwide, will enter into force 24 October 1996.  Progress is also being registered toward the adoption of new rules in the field of nuclear liability, and in the preparation of a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management, he said.
<P>
<I>Nuclear power.</I>    Studies are needed for a more factual understanding of the benefits, costs, and risks of all energy options at the national and global levels, including discussions connected with the Climate Change Convention and the International Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Blix said.  "Global energy consumption is going to increase and the present tendency is for an increase in the use of fossil fuels which accelerates the emission of carbon dioxide," he said.   Scenarios for future energy mixes that show the greatest promise of restraining greenhouse gas emissions, he noted,  include a strong expansion of nuclear-generated electricity.  
<P>
<I>Technology transfer.</I>   The use of nuclear power for purposes other than electricity production, such as the production of heat for industrial processes and for potable water, is receiving greater attention, Dr. Blix said.  Agency programmes are facilitating the transfer of nuclear and radiation technologies and helping to ensure that basic infrastructures are in place for their safe use and sound regulation.   In areas of technical co-operation, he cited  new approaches that place a premium on projects that effectively help end users attain benefits for better health, greater food supply, and  sufficient water resources.  He specifically cited projects to eradicate the tsetse fly from Zanzibar, Tanzania; to help countries combat soil salinity, which is a major problem worldwide; and to assess problems of pollution affecting the Black Sea.

<P>
<B>Introduction</B><P>
<DT>
<DD>	In many countries around the world today the public sector is examined critically in view of resource constraints.  It is natural that also the international public sector be subjected to critical evaluation.  To remain relevant and responsive to the interests of their Members  intergovernmental organizations must be alert to the need for change and to the need for efficiency in their methods of work.
<P>
<DD>	The subjects of recent years' world conferences - environment, human rights, population and women - signal that our attention is now concentrated on how to improve man's and the planet's wellbeing rather than on how to avoid extinction through nuclear war.  This is a welcome change of focus with important consequences for the work of international organizations - including the IAEA.
<P>
<DD>	The Agency was set up nearly 40 years ago to enable all countries to make good and safe use of the dramatic progress in nuclear science and technology and to ensure so far as it was able, that the wide dissemination of this science and technology did not further any military purpose.  These missions, laid down in the Statute, remain relevant but as my discussion will show the needs and interests of Member States and the changed international climate have led and is leading to many changes in the thrust of the Agency's programme.
<P>
<B>Development and Use of Nuclear Science and Technology</B>
<P>
<DD>	In many Member States today, nuclear science and the development of nuclear techniques are no longer top priority.  In many nuclear activities, private enterprise has taken over from government institutions - with the latter focussing more on the policy framework and regulation.  These changes are mirrored in the Agency by a reduced emphasis on basic science and by expanded activities in the fields of nuclear safety and waste.  However, science is by no means abandoned.  For the international sharing of scientific data and experience and the promotion of some new nuclear techniques, the IAEA remains a very practical - and relatively inexpensive - instrument.  I have in mind the Agency's roles inter alia in offering a forum for discussion and a framework for co-operation in areas like fusion and accelerator-driven transmutation, which may one day become of great practical importance.  Interest also continues in a number of countries in the development of advanced nuclear reactor systems, of fast reactors and in the use of nuclear power for purposes other than production of electricity, e.g. for the production of heat for industrial processes and for potable water.  Our Agenda has an item on this subject and a report has been prepared by the Secretariat. 
<A HREF="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-4.html">(GOV/2855-GC(40)/4)</A>
<P>
<DD>	The safe management, use or disposal of plutonium is a subject that is again calling for attention. The global inventory of civil plutonium will increase for several years to come and disarmament measures will contribute sizeable quantities.  What should be done with this plutonium?  The issue was raised at the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit last spring and France will host a meeting in October on "Safe and effective management of fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes".  The Agency is invited to participate and is also itself arranging a major symposium next June entitled "Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Reactor Strategy: Adjusting to New Realities".
<P>
<DD>	I turn now to the Agency's role in the field of nuclear power.  Today nuclear generated electricity is not universally accepted, nor is it invariably the cheapest option.  Some governments are determined opponents, some are strong supporters of an expanded use and most governments have a low profile on the subject.  The declaration adopted at the Moscow Nuclear Summit last spring probably expressed the views of many governments when, stressing the issue of safety, it declared: "... we are committed to measures which will enable nuclear power, already a significant contributor to electricity supply in those countries choosing to exploit it, to continue in the next century to play an important role in meeting future world energy demand ...".
<P>
<DD>	The IAEA programme in this area reflects the shift in government attitudes and interests and now has its emphasis on:
<P>
<UL>

	<LI>	improving safety in the operation of nuclear power plants;

	 <LI>	promoting the safe management and disposal of nuclear waste; and

	 <LI>	assessing - often together with others - the benefits, risks and costs of the nuclear option and comparing these with those connected with other energy options.
</UL>
<P>
	I should like to comment first on our work to assess energy options.
<P>
<DD>	The Agency has a long tradition in assessing the economic cost of generating electricity by nuclear power and comparing it with the cost of other options.  The economic cost remains a vitally important factor, influenced by construction time, interest rates, etc.  While the costs have generally increased, not least due to additional safety measures, the prospects of standardization, factory produced parts and better planning in construction and operation suggest that in the future the costs of nuclear generated electricity - with fairly large variations from one country to another - will remain competitive with electricity generated through fossil fuels for base load electricity generation.  Today, however, comparisons between energy sources cannot be limited to direct economic cost, but must take into account factors such as reliability, energy independence and the impacts on life, health and the environment.  The comparative studies of the Agency have been adapted to cover these aspects as well and the data obtained provide interesting input into the discussion of national and global energy mixes.
<P>


<DD>	From experience we know a good deal about the risks posed to life and health and the environment by the different energy sources - coal, oil, gas, hydro, nuclear or renewables.  While the highest health risks are connected with accidents and even the normal use of fossil fuels, and while hydropower accidents are responsible for the largest number of casualties, the very small risk of a big nuclear accident - the Chernobyl type - raises the fear of nuclear power.  This circumstance tends to blind many to the data which show that there is a steady increase in the reliability of nuclear power and that the impact of civilian nuclear power upon the global environment is minimal.  No scenarios for future energy mixes show greater promise to restrain greenhouse gas emissions than those that include a strong expansion of nuclear power generated electricity.  Against this background it seems paradoxical that in the discussions connected with the Climate Change Convention and the International Panel on Climate Change, only marginal consideration is given to nuclear power.  At the recent second session of the parties to the Climate Convention, Mr. Priddle, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, was one of the few who focussed on nuclear power.  He noted  - I quote - that "nuclear power accounted for the greater part of the lowering of carbon intensity of the energy economies of the OECD countries over the last 25 years".
<P>
<DD>	In my view, the Agency should continue to work dispassionately - preferably together with other international organizations  - on the refinement of the relevant data and place them before the fora concerned, e.g. the meetings of the Climate Convention and UN bodies concerned with sustainable development.  Global energy consumption is going to increase and the present tendency is for an increase in the use of fossil fuels which accelerates the emission of CO2.  The welcome renewable sources - apart from hydro - will play only a marginal role in the next few decades at any rate.  In this situation understanding of the benefits, costs and risks of the nuclear option compared to others is important.
<P>
<B>Non-Power Applications</B>
<P>
<DD>	The attitude of governments and the public to most non-power applications of nuclear science and technology remains positive and there is no reason for a change of direction in the Agency's efforts to help promote and disseminate these applications, especially to the benefit of developing countries.  However, a continuous evaluation is required to ensure that only those nuclear techniques that are clearly superior to other existing or emerging techniques are passed on.  Moreover, nuclear techniques which can now be bought by States in the market at reasonable cost, should be obtained through the market.  However, the transfer of nuclear applications frequently requires a concomitant attention to training, impartial expert advice and, not least important, to radiation protection - things that are not provided easily except through governmental or intergovernmental channels.  Let me mention in this context that one of the largest ongoing TC projects, eventually covering some 50 developing countries, aims at ensuring, before the end of the century, that their legislation and practices in the area of radiation protection are satisfactory.  In the field of training, institutions in Member States and our laboratories in Seibersdorf and Monaco provide unique assistance.  The Agency is thus facilitating the use of nuclear technology in less developed countries not only by assisting in transferring the required technology but also by helping to ensure that the basic infrastructure is in place.
<P>
<B>Technical Co-operation</B>
<P>
 <DD>	The many new initiatives and approaches which the IAEA has taken in recent times, including the establishment of the Standing Advisory Group on 
 Technical Assistance and      
 Co-operation (SAGTAC) and the introduction of "model projects" described in the papers before you, Strengthening of the Agency's Technical Co-operation 
 Activities <A HREF="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-5.html">(GOV/2857-GC(40)/5)</A> and the TC Annual Report for 1995 <A HREF="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-3.html">(GC(40)/3)</A>.  These new approaches, inter alia, place a premium on projects that effectively help the end user to better health, more food and adequate water resources.  You will be pleased to hear also that, through improved management, TC programme delivery has reached a record high and that improvements in quality are evident.  Let me further note that the regional co-operation arrangements covering the African, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions (AFRA, RCA and ARCAL) are proving very effective in bringing about technical co-operation among developing countries (TCDC).
   We try to pursue such TCDC also through contracts with a few centres of excellence in developing countries.  
 In terms of regional priorities, we are particularly mindful of the Secretary-General's special initiative on Africa.  
 As is evident from our activities focussing on water resources, food and health, we continue to pay particular attention to the needs of this region.
<P>
<DD>	We hope that the good performance in TC delivery will be matched by good performance in contributions:  that all States - industrialized and developing - pledge their share in full and pay it in full.
<P>
	Let me now by way of example mention three different projects.
<P>
<B>Eradication of Tsetse Fly</B>
<P>
<DD>	Radiation induced sterilization of certain insects - usually called the Sterile Insect Technique - has proved very effective, when combined with conventional control methods, in projects in eradicating the medfly in South and Central America and the tsetse fly in Africa.
<P>
<DD>	The TC Model Project for eradication of the tsetse fly from Zanzibar, Tanzania, which I visited in May, should be completed in the next 18 months.  The excellent progress made is attributable to a combination of host Government commitment, bilateral and multilateral funding, co-operation with FAO, and many years of remarkable innovation by the Agency's laboratory at Seibersdorf. Most recently some of the improvements in methodologies for the rearing of flies have been transferred to the tsetse production facility in Tanga, Tanzania.  
<P>
<DD>	The results of the Model Project in Tanzania have led to a strong interest by the Ethiopian authorities in an eradication campaign in a 20 000 sq. km. area of the Rift Valley.  Such a project would have strong national support and good prospects of funding.  I hope it will materialize. 
<P>
<B>Fighting Soil Salinity</B>
<P>
<DD>	A second example: soil salinity, is a major problem world-wide.  Studies and field trials in Pakistan and elsewhere, encouraged by an Agency co-ordinated research programme, have demonstrated that economically viable use of such land is possible through cultivation of salt-tolerant plants.  Nuclear techniques are used to determine appropriate soil, water and plant management practices.
<P>
<DD>	Eight countries from North Africa and Asia are now planning to expand the use of this biosaline agriculture through an Inter-regional Technical Co-operation project starting in 1997.  
<P>
<B>Marine Environment</B>
<P>
<DD>	The third area of work I want to mention is the problem of pollution and rapidly declining fisheries in the Black Sea.  It involves the Agency in three ways.  First, the Agency's Laboratories of Marine Environment and Hydrology are participating in the international efforts to determine marine processes in the Black Sea.  Second, through a TC project, regional laboratories are being equipped and trained to collect marine samples, to monitor marine radioactivity, and to apply marine tracer techniques.  A third component is the collaboration with the Global Environment Facility's Black Sea Environmental Programme to upgrade the region's capacity to monitor organic and inorganic pollutants. 
<P>
<DD>	The main difficulty in our inter-agency work on the marine environment issue is the unpredictability of extrabudgetary funding.  On the other hand, I am pleased to report the continued unstinting generosity of the Principality of Monaco, which is providing the Marine Environment Laboratory with new excellent facilities for its research and training programmes.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
<DD>	I turn now to the field of nuclear safety, where over the years the Agency has significantly expanded its activity - in response to the wishes of Member States.  It has come to be recognized - most recently at the Moscow Nuclear Summit - that nuclear safety in any country is the legitimate concern of all other countries.  While it has not been suggested that supervisory or regulatory functions should be conferred on the IAEA, it has been concluded that the IAEA is the appropriate institution to use for the establishment of an international infrastructure comprising three main elements - basic binding conventions, recommended standards and advisory services and assistance.
<P>
<DD>	Within the IAEA Secretariat these activities are now the charge of a separate Department and during this year the various advisory groups, in which government experts consider draft international safety standards and guides, have been strengthened and reorganized.  Through these changes strong input and guidance from Member States and products of high quality and consistency should be ensured.
<P>
<DD>	The number of <I>international conventions</I> which provide legally binding norms as part of the regulatory framework is increasing.  While the so-called Chernobyl Conventions on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on Emergency Assistance were concluded in 1986, the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which addresses the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide, will enter into force very shortly, on 24 October - United Nations day!  I urge all governments that have not yet ratified the Convention to try to speed up the required procedures.  A meeting of the States parties will take place within six months of the entry into force to prepare for the full operation of the Convention.
<P>
<DD>	Another important event will be the expected adoption, next year, of new rules in the field of nuclear liability.  After years of difficult work in the Standing Committee of Legal Experts, it now seems that sufficient agreement has been reached on the major issues to call a diplomatic conference to revise the Vienna Convention and to adopt a convention on supplementary funding.  I hope the momentum which has built up through progress in the negotiations, through the signature by Russia of the Vienna Convention on 8 May and through the declaration of the Moscow Nuclear Summit, will lead us to agreement and also encourage more States to sign the Vienna Convention.
<P>
<DD>	A third important development is the drafting of a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management.  Much progress has already been made in an international working group headed by a former President of this General Conference, Professor Alec Baer.  I hope that Member Governments will move to settle the issues yet unresolved without much further delay so that a conference to conclude the Convention can be called next year.
<P>
<DD>	In the field of nuclear safety, let me lastly refer to the provision of services and assistance.  For a number of years we have offered peer reviews under OSART, ASSET and other programmes.  These services will remain available but in the interest of economy and as many are now familiar with the review methodologies, emphasis will shift to missions ensuring quality of similar national safety services.  In the area of safety assistance, attention continues to be devoted to reactors built to earlier standards, notably WWER-440 and RBMK type reactors.
<P>
<B>Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel</B>
<P>
<DD>	As greater quantities of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste result from the civilian nuclear activities, governments are increasingly interested in sharing knowledge and experience.  Given that some such material is transported between countries, that in the past some has been disposed of at sea and also that some long-lived waste will be a heritage to future generations, there is also a legitimate international interest in commonly respected standards of conduct.  The Waste Management Convention, which I have just mentioned, is an important way of responding to this interest.  So are the standards developed by the IAEA in the RADWASS programme and the related services which are available.
<P>
<DD>	The idea of regional nuclear waste disposal sites is advanced from time to time.  While it is evident from some of the reactions to this concept that its time has not yet come, it is hard to understand why such regional sites freely accepted should be more worrisome than regional disposal sites for any other toxic substances.  From a global point of view and from the view point of economy, it would seem preferable to have a smaller number of well-placed, well-equipped, repositories for shared disposal than expecting every country, regardless of the size of its nuclear activities and resources, to arrange such facilities.
<P>
Let me note two other developments.
<P>
<B>Waste Management in the Russian Federation</B>
<P>
<DD>	First, at the request of the Nordic Council and with the co-operation of the Russian Federation, the Agency organized, in May 1995, a Seminar on International Co-operation on Nuclear Waste Management in the Russian Federation.  Following that seminar, a Contact Expert Group (CEG) was established under the auspices of the IAEA for international projects in the Russian Federation.  Nine countries are already full participants.  The IAEA has agreed to provide secretariat services to it including, if required, assistance to identify priority activities and help to match partners with projects.
<P>
<B>Spent Fuel from Research and Test Reactors</B>
<P>
<DD>	Second, many countries which have acquired research reactors in the international market have experienced difficulties in the disposal of the spent fuel.  In July 1993 I wrote to the Secretary of Energy of the United States urging the renewal by the US Department of Energy (DOE) of its Off-Site Fuel Policy under which foreign research reactor spent fuel of US origin was returned to the US.  On 2 February 1995, I also wrote a letter to the Minister for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation suggesting a similar take-back programme of foreign research reactor spent fuel enriched in the former USSR.  I welcome the move by the US to resume for a number of years a programme for returning spent fuel of US origin and I hope that similarly positive steps could be taken by other suppliers of research reactor fuel.
<P>
<B>Assessment and Remediation</B>
<P>
<DD>	While most of the Agency's activities aim at making current or future nuclear activities safer or more effective, the IAEA is also being called upon to provide professional and impartial international assessment of the causes and consequences of accidents with radiological consequences and of the effects of nuclear testing.
<P>
<B>The International Conference on the consequences of the Chernobyl Accident </B>
<P>
<DD>	In April this year, Minister Angela Merkel of Germany chaired an Agency-hosted conference to "sum up" the results of various assessments and specialized meetings on the consequences of the Chernobyl accident.  It attracted high-level political participation and over eight hundred experts from 71 countries and concluded with a remarkable degree of consensus, considering the many controversial issues involved. 
<P>
<DD>	Among the conclusions of the Conference, let me mention that there was a consensus on the early health effects clinically attributable to radiation exposure as a result of the accident.  There was also confirmation of a significant increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer among children. So far, no increase could be demonstrated in the incidence of any other malignancies or hereditary effects that could be attributed to the accident.  The Conference confirmed that, in the population affected by the accident, there was a high incidence of psychological disorders which cannot, however, be related to radiation exposure and are difficult to distinguish from effects associated with the economic and social hardship being experienced in the regions. The conference indicated that no sustained severe impacts on ecosystems had so far been observed.  I should lastly mention that officials from the affected countries reported to the Conference on the severe economic, social and institutional consequences of the accident.  The summary of the conference results - reported both in INFCIRC/510 and in a brochure - deserve wide dissemination to help build an accurate international understanding of the consequences of the accident.
<P>
<B>Nuclear test sites</B>
<P>
<DD>	At the request of Member States concerned, the Agency has become engaged in the assessment of the radiological situation at three former nuclear weapons test sites.
<P>
<DD>	An assessment of the <I>Semipalatinsk</I> nuclear test site has provided assurance that radiation levels in villages around the site are very low.  However, it has also been concluded that lengthy human occupation of the test site itself would lead to unacceptably high radiation doses and the authorities of Kazakstan have been advised to take steps to clean up the site or - more realistically - prevent access to it.
<P>
<DD>	The habitability of the <I>Bikini Atoll</I> in the <I>Republic of the Marshall Islands </I>was assessed, in particular to determine whether the islanders, who had been evacuated from the atoll before the start of nuclear testing, could safely resume living there.  The assessment, which was made by an international, scientific advisory group convoked by the Agency, concluded that if some contaminated soil was removed and if the uptake of radioactive caesium by crops were controlled through the use of special fertilizers, the Bikini Atoll could be re-occupied without restriction.
  <P>
<DD>	The third study, now underway, is of the test site at <I>Mururoa and Fangataufa </I>in <I>French Polynesia.</I>  It is directed by an international advisory committee chaired by Dr. Gail de Planque of the United States.  <A HREF="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40inf4.html">Document GC(40)/INF/4</A> contains a full description of the status of this study.  A final report can be expected by the end of 1997.
<P>
<DD>	As the world is now hopefully putting the era of nuclear weapons testing behind it, I find it appropriate that impartial international assessments are made of whatever radiological hazards may remain from past testing.
<P>
<B>SAFEGUARDS</B>
<P>
<DD>	The mission of IAEA safeguards to verify that nuclear material, equipment and installations are not used to "further any military purpose" has been with the IAEA from the outset, but the dimension and direction of the safeguards activities have changed considerably over time.  The most dramatic development followed the obligation laid down for States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and regional nuclear weapon-free-zone treaties to place all their present and future nuclear activities and material under Agency safeguards.  Some 177 States have thus legally committed themselves to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements and 120 States have actually done so.  Those States which have not yet fulfilled their obligation are from time to time reminded by the Secretariat of their duty to do so without further delay.  At the present juncture we are particularly anxious that all the States parties to the Tlatelolco Treaty - notably some Caribbean States - should enter into safeguards agreements, as otherwise the full entry into force of that Treaty might be delayed.  We have every reason to believe that Cuba, which has signed the Treaty, will proceed with ratification.  There have already been contacts on the subject of the safeguards agreement.
<P>
<DD>	With regard to two other nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties - the Pelindaba Treaty for Africa and the Bangkok Treaty for South East Asia - the Agency is preparing for verification and other tasks laid upon it.  May I further mention that, as requested by the General Conference, I have continued consultations with States in the Middle East regarding the application of IAEA safeguards in that region.  A report on these efforts is before you <A HREF="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-6.html"> (document GC(40)/6).</A>
 <P>
<DD>	As you are aware, the IAEA is about to take a major step forward in further developing the safeguards system - a step essential to introduce new cost-effective methods and techniques and to provide vitally needed confidence that non-proliferation commitments are fully respected. This development will also help to make the safeguards system an adequate instrument that can be used to verify future nuclear arms control and disarmament measures - a need recently stressed in the report of the Canberra Commission.
<P>
<DD>	At this point let me note that the traditional "safeguards statement", contained in this and earlier years' Safeguards Implementation Reports (SIR), that it is reasonable to conclude that "the nuclear material and other items which were declared and placed under safeguards remained in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise adequately accounted for", is based chiefly on nuclear accountancy and inspection.  Obviously, the more extensive these accountancy and inspection efforts are, the more confident we can be that the absence of evidence of diversion is due to a real absence of diversion.  We believe that had Agency inspectors had access - which they did not - to some activities that took place in the declared nuclear centre at Tuwaitha in Iraq, they would have suspected that safeguards obligations were being violated.  The case of Iraq also points to the conclusion that if more comprehensive information had been available about the Iraqi nuclear programme, inconsistencies would, in all likelihood, have been discovered and questions would have been prompted.
<P>
<DD>	It is this experience combined with the vital interest of States in reliable safeguards that has led to the development of "Programme 93+2" and a protocol additional to comprehensive safeguards agreements, designed to give the IAEA Secretariat much more information - notably, more data from the State and more data through observations by inspectors granted wider access.  Only if the available information and inspection access is sufficiently broadly based will the absence of evidence of diversion give confidence that non-proliferation commitments have not been breached.  The demand of Members that safeguards must give confidence, not only about non-diversion of declared material but also about the absence of non-declared nuclear material and installations, makes this access to more information and greater access for inspectors a high priority.
<P>
<DD>
	The requirements which are placed on States under the proposed additional protocol are not insignificant, but States which accepted them on a trial basis did not find them overly onerous.  In any case Members will have to weigh their interest in effective verification in other States and their interest in demonstrating convincingly their own compliance with non-proliferation commitments against the burden which they may feel they are assuming by accepting such verification for themselves.
<P>
<DD>	It is clear that all parties to comprehensive safeguards must be treated equally.  As a result, States with large nuclear programmes will have to supply more information and allow the visit of inspectors to more sites and locations than will States with small programmes.  However, the need for follow up will depend somewhat upon the quality - rather than the quantity - of the supplied information.
<P>
<DD>	It is further clear that States with non-comprehensive safeguards may be able to contribute information of value for the operation of the comprehensive safeguards, e.g. regarding exports and imports.  They may also help make the Agency's safeguards operations more effective and less costly by accepting in the operation of the safeguards to which they are subjected some new techniques, like environmental sampling and remote data transmission.  They may further help by joining others in dispensing with visa requirements or granting multiple entry visas and accepting streamlined inspector designation procedures.  However, the central rationale for strengthening safeguards verification in States with comprehensive safeguards, namely to increase confidence about their compliance with their non-proliferation pledge, is not applicable to the States with non-comprehensive safeguards - as they have made no such pledge.  This being the case, it would appear appropriate, in my view, to suggest that these States accept international verification of the steps they are taking, or hopefully will be taking, toward nuclear arms control and disarmament, for instance verification to create confidence that nuclear material released through dismantlement of weapons, is irreversibly transferred to the peaceful sector.  This matter was explicitly raised in the Moscow Nuclear Summit and I have invited the United States and Russian Ministers present here to discuss with me the possibility of such verification by the IAEA.  I should add that, at the invitation of the United States, the Agency has already performed verification of some quantities of such nuclear material.
<P>
<B>Iraq</B>
<P>
<DD>	The Agency's ongoing monitoring and verification (OMV) activities in Iraq have, since August 1994, involved more than 600 inspections, the majority of which were conducted without prior notice.  No instance of proscribed activities, or of the presence of proscribed materials or equipment have been detected.
<P>
<DD>	The Agency's activities in Iraq during the past year have also involved extensive efforts to analyse the vast amount of documentation which was handed over to the IAEA and the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) following the departure from Iraq, in August 1995, of the late Lt. General Kamel Hassan Al Majid.  Much work has also been devoted to the follow up of procurement transactions and to assess draft versions of Iraq's re-issued "Full, Final and Complete Declaration" of its former nuclear weapons programme.  A few days ago, Iraq formally transmitted its finalized version of the Declaration to the Agency's Nuclear Monitoring Group in Baghdad.  As soon as we receive it in Vienna we shall start the work of verifying its completeness and correctness.
<P>
<DD>	Let me add that IAEA inspectors remain in Baghdad and continue their ongoing monitoring and verification activities.  In the circumstances now prevailing there, activities take place only in areas with reliable radio communications with our Monitoring and Verification Centre in Baghdad.  Those of our activities which should take place away from the Baghdad region will be resumed as soon as conditions permit.  Transport to and from Baghdad has been severely affected by the recent events and the situation, with respect to the safety of our personnel in Baghdad, is being closely followed by us and the United Nations.
<P>
<B>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)</B>
<P>
<DD>	The Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 1995 states that the IAEA remained unable to verify the initial declaration of nuclear material made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and that the DPRK was still not in full compliance with its safeguards agreement.  This is still the case.  A full report on this matter is found in document GC(40)/16.
<P>
<DD>	Most recently, technical discussions between the IAEA and the DPRK took place in late June.  These discussions resulted in some progress but the DPRK still did not accept various measures considered important by the Secretariat for verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration - in particular measures for the preservation of data and the provision of information about certain facilities.  On the positive side, the DPRK did agree to measures to improve Agency communications from the DPRK and to accept the designation of more inspectors.  A next round of technical discussions is planned to take place very soon.
<P>
<B>Efficiency and Management</B>
<P>
<DD>	I began this statement by stressing the necessity for international organizations to be alert to the changing needs of their Members and I hope I have demonstrated how the IAEA is meeting this requirement.  I also stressed the need for continuously improved efficiency in our work.  I believe the IAEA has achieved a great deal in this regard.  Let me give you examples:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>	Despite the limitations on resources, the Agency's programme has expanded over the years to take on new activities, for example to counteract illegal trafficking in nuclear materials.  Resources for such new activities have become available both through the phasing out of some programmes and through efficiency gains.  This process continues:  the budget for 1997 assumes substantial cuts in overhead costs and provides an increase of some US $10 million in programmatic activity;

	<LI>	Systematic evaluation of programme performance is now in routine use as an important tool for increasing efficiency.  In addition, the independent external auditors help to identify shortcomings in efficiency and the internal audit and management services, which work to the same objective, are being strengthened;


	<LI>	The IAEA makes increasing use of efficient modern information technologies: for the compilation and dissemination of data; for the better management of the many projects in the TC programme; for the processing and analysis of the vast amounts of safeguards data; and for financial and personnel administration.  The Agency has an extensive home page on Internet - where, for instance, all professional posts are advertised.  Our official documentation is becoming available on-line to Missions and Governments - which improves efficiency.  Apart from that, IAEA documents becoming available on-line to the public enhances transparency.  Through a recent decision these documents will now comprise also most Board documents which are more than two years old and which were earlier restricted;

	<LI>	Good staff and good staff management are crucial to both programme delivery and efficiency.  The paramount consideration in the choice of staff must remain "efficiency, technical competence and integrity" and I am pleased to report that these qualities continue to characterize our staff and that management-staff relations are healthy and founded on mutual respect.  The change in the staff composition over the last 15 years has been considerable.  In 1981, when the first Resolution on the "Staffing of the Secretariat" was under discussion, a number of Members proposed that a target of 30% be set for the representation of developing countries on the professional staff.  Today, 32.5% of the Agency's staff comes from developing countries.  However, the number of professional women while steadily increasing is still far from adequate.  Even though representation has doubled since 1981, it stands at only 18%.  We will continue our efforts to improve the situation.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>	Let me conclude by stressing that Member States can contribute in a number of ways that are crucial to making the IAEA even more efficient and responsive to their own changing needs.  I shall cite only two:
   <P>
<DD>	.	Effectively interacting and co-operating with other Member States and with the Secretariat to achieve the desired results of the many programmes and activities which form the substance of the Agency's work;
<P>
<DD>	Paying their contributions to the Regular Budget as well as to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund in full and on time.  Late or limited payments jeopardize programmes and efficiency and undermine the reliability of the Agency as a provider of essential services, e.g. in the areas of radiation protection, nuclear safety and safeguards.
<P>
<DD>	In the Secretariat we are proud of the good reputation of the IAEA.  We feel the Agency could play an even greater role in responding to the needs of its Members in the future.
<P>
<DD>	Let me end with my traditional thanks to the Government of Austria and the City of Vienna for their help and support.

The IAEA Board Committee considering further measures for <b><tt><a href="/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-17.html">STRENGTHENING NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS</a></b></tt> will hold its third session 
in early 1997, beginning 20 January at the Agency's headquarters in Vienna. The Committee specifically is negotiating a legal instrument required for the introduction of 
verification measures that go beyond the IAEA's authority under existing comprehensive safeguards agreements concluded with States. The latest edition of the <i><a 
href="/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull384/">IAEA Bulletin </a></i> features articles describing the safeguards development programme and the Agency's experience so far in 
introducing some new measures that the Board already has approved. For a full listing of the nuclear facilities and locations under IAEA safeguards around the world, see the <a 
href="/worldatom/program/safeguards/95tables/facilities.html">listings</a> in the IAEA <a href="/worldatom/inforesource/annual/anrep95/">Annual Report</a>.
<br clear="right">
<br>
<b><tt>FACTS ABOUT THE WORLD'S USE of NUCLEAR POWER</b></tt> for electricity generation -- and associated environmental and economic benefits -- were emphasized by IAEA Director 
General Hans Blix in Manila recently. Speaking at the Second Philippine Nuclear Congress, Dr. Blix said that the world's greater use of nuclear power could "significantly alleviate 
the dilemma of an increasing need for energy and an increasing need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions". The <a href="/worldatom/inforesource/dgspeeches/dgsp1996n14.html">full 
text</a> of his address, as well as the <a href="/worldatom/inforesource/dgspeeches/dgsp1996n15.html">text of a lecture</a> he gave on nuclear applications in medical and other 
fields, are now on line.
<br>
<br>
Preliminary information about <b><tt><a href="/worldatom/thisweek/preview/">SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MEETINGS</a></b></tt> being convened by the IAEA during the coming year is 
available. The month-to-month listings include titles, dates and venues.
<br>
<br>
<i><b>WorldAtom's</b></i> pages now feature <b><tt><a href="/worldatom/infcircs/">IAEA INFORMATION CIRCULARS (INFCIRCS)</a></b></tt>, documents that the Agency regularly issues to 
its 124 Member States on a range of nuclear topics and developments.

<P></CENTER>
Welcome to the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) and its associated database. 
The IAEA and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have been surveying the content of hydrogen and oxygen 
isotopes in precipitation since 1961. The data are used for a variety of purposes in fields of hydrology, oceanography 
and hydrometeorology in investigations related to the Earth's water cycle and climate changes, for example.
<P>
Precipitation samples are collected in cooperation with WMO and national meteorological services. 
The samples are analyzed in the IAEA's Isotope Hydrology Laboratory in Vienna, and in <A HREF="lablist.htm">cooperating laboratories</A>. 
Each contributing laboratory is responsible for the accuracy and precision of its own analyses.
Thanks are due to these and other laboratories which have contributed data from private collections. 
GNIP data may be freely used, provided acknoledgement of the source is made.

<p>
<HR SIZE=3>
Welcome to the pages about the IAEA's safety programme for <A HREF="wwer.html">WWER</A> and <A HREF="rbmk.html">RBMK</A> 
nuclear power plants. The Agency established the programme in 1990 to assist countries of Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union to improve the safety of their first-generation WWER plants (WWER-440/230s). The scope of the programme was 
extended in 1992 to include RBMK, WWER-440/213 and WWER-1000 plants. Click here for a recent 
<A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/documents/gc40inf5ac-2.html">overview of the programme</A> submitted to the IAEA 
General Conference.
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<STRONG>
Programme objectives: 
</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>to identify major design and operational safety issues;
<LI>to establish an international consensus on priority safety improvements;
<LI>to provide assistance in the review of the completeness and adequacy of safety improvement programmes.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
Programme scope and direction:
</STRONG>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>The programme covers <A HREF="reactors.html">58 operational units and 13 units under construction</A> in seven countries. It is conducted within the Safety Assessment Section of the Division of Nuclear Safety of the IAEA.  The programme has a staff of 14 professional and six secretaries.
</DL>
<P>
More than <A HREF="publications.html">100 documents</A> have been published covering techical missions, safety guidelines, and reactor systems and features.
<P>
A <A HREF="wwersc.html">WWER Steering Committee</A> and a <A HREF="rbmksc.html">RBMK Steering Committee</A> oversees the project.

<H3>Co-ordinated Research Programme of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture</H3>
Recent advances in DNA-based technologies increase the likelihood for molecular genetic techniques to positively affect plant breeding in developing countries, as well as in the well-equipped genetic engineering laboratories in developed countries.  The use of linked DNA markers makes possible for the first time the large scale application of indirect selection for important agronomic traits.  This project helps ensure multinational co-operation for transferring modern biotechnology to developing coutries with the active participation of leading laboratories.

<P>
Development of nuclear fusion as a practical energy source could
	provide great benefits. This fact has been widely recognized and fusion research
	has enjoyed a high level of international co-operation. Since early in its history,	
	the International Atomic Energy Agency has actively promoted the international
	exchange of fusion information.	 
<P>
	In this context, the IAEA responded in 1986 to calls at summit
	level for expansion of international co-operation in fusion energy development. 
	At the invitation of the Director General there was a series of meetings in Vienna		
during 1987, at which representatives of the world's four major fusion programmes
developed a detailed proposal for co-operation on the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Conceptual Design Activities
(CDA). The Director General then invited each interested Party to co-operate
in the CDA in accordance with the Terms of Reference that had been worked
out. All four Parties accepted this invitation.
<P>
The ITER  CDA, under the auspices of the IAEA, began in April 1988 and were successfully completed in December 1990. The information produced within the CDA has been made available to ITER Parties and IAEA Member States for use either in their own programmes or as part of an international collaboration.
<P>
After completing the CDA, the ITER Parties entered into a series of consultations on how ITER should proceed further, resulting in the signing of the ITER EDA (Engineering Design Activities) Agreement and Protocol 1 on 21 July 1992 in Washington by representatives of the four Parties. The Agreement entered into force upon signature of the Parties and shall remain in force for six years, with the EDA being conducted under the auspices of the IAEA. Protocol 1 expired on 21 March 1994. On this very day representatives of the ITER Parties signed in Vienna Protocol 2, which entered into force upon signature. This Protocol covers the remaining part of the EDA.
<P>
As part of its support of ITER, the IAEA is pleased to publish the ITER EDA Newsletter on a monthly basis. Copies can be requested from the ITER Office Vienna, IAEA, Wagramerstrasse 5, P.O. Box 100, A-1400 Vienna, Austria, or by fax: +43 1 237762.
<P>
The ITER EDA Newsletter is available on line only in <I>.pdf</I> format.

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

Indeed, for many years now IAEA has been applying isotopic and other techniques in a vast array of global scientific challenges - from controlling marine pollution and understanding climate change to boosting livestock production.  One of the potentially most fruitful areas for new health-related applications of isotope techniques is in the field  of human nutrition.  Agency activities in Human Health, as well as in Technical Co-operation, include a new emphasis on isotope techniques as tools to evaluate human nutritional status and the nutritional quality of foods within the context of national development programmes.  These techniques are now considered the best methods for measuring the uptake and bioavailability of may important vitamins and minerals.  They are thus well suited for determining the success of food supplementation programmes and other interventions aimed at combating many forms of malnutrition.

This booklet provides a brief description of pioneering Agency-supported work to evaluate vitamin A and iron deficiencies, bone disease, undernutrition and obesity and the special nutritional requriemtns of pregnant and lactating women and their children.</FONT>

After the discovery of the secret nuclear weapons development programme in Iraq, 
the threatened withdrawal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and the break-up of the former Soviet Union, 
some commentators have taken the view that the NPT and other barriers against the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries are collapsing. These developments certainly pose new challenges. However, there are a number of factors which are helping to expand and strengthen commitments to the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and constitute an encouragement for the non-proliferation effort: the end of the Cold War, the increasingly active co-operation between the nuclear weapon States in peace-keeping, disarmament and non-proliferation matters, the public renunciation by South Africa of its previously existing nuclear weapons programme and the relinquishing by Argentina and Brazil of a nuclear weapons option.
<BR><BR>
Verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that nuclear activities are being undertaken exclusively for peaceful purposes is an important component of what has been termed the "non-proliferation regime", i.e. the various treaties and other arrangements that have been made with a view to preventing or impeding a spread of nuclear weapons. This document describes the role of IAEA verification activities, or safeguards, in this regime and shows how safeguards provide confidence that States fulfil the obligations they have undertaken in relation to the peaceful use of atomic energy. It also describes ways in which this role could develop in the future.

<TD><FONT SIZE="-1"><CENTER>The desire to extend the many benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology to all countries led as long ago as 1957 to the establishment of the IAEA and to the immediate introduction of a technical co-operation programme. In the more than thirty years that have passed since that time, the potential applications of nuclear techniques have greatly expanded, as have the associated benefits for social and economic development. Over this period, many of the applications have moved from research laboratories into hospitals, farms and industrial enterprises. The IAEA has meanwhile remained as a unique international source of expertise on nuclear technologies. <I>(Excerpt from the Introduction) </I>

<P>
Heat and light are types of radiation that people can feel or
see, but there are other kinds of radiation that human senses
cannot detect.  Indeed, we constantly receive such invisible
radiation from the sky, the ground, the air, and even our food
and drink. Such "ionizing" radiation has been put to many uses:
doctors use X rays to diagnose disease or injury; factories use
radiation to check welds in machine components; gamma rays are
used to sterilise medical equipment for safe use; and many new
varieties of crops have been produced through radiation-induced
mutations. Today, moreover, about 17 percent of the world's
electricity is supplied by nuclear power plants.
<P>
The usefulness of radiation means that many people receive small
doses of radiation from artificial sources as well as doses from
nature.  The IAEA has produced this booklet in order to enhance
public understanding about the sources and effects of radiation,
and to describe the measures that have been developed
internationally to ensure the safe use of radiation. 
<P><A NAME="one">
<B><I>Types of Radiation</I></B></A>
<P>
"Ionizing" radiation passes through matter and can cause some of
its atoms to become electrically charged, or ionized. In living
tissues, the ions caused by such radiation can affect normal
biological processes. Ionizing radiation comes in several
different
forms:
<P>
<I>Alpha particles</I> - are positively charged particles. They
are easily stopped by paper or skin, and are only hazardous if
alpha-emitting materials are swallowed or breathed into the body.
<P>
<I>Beta particles</I> - are electrons and have a greater
penetrating power than alpha particles, but can be stopped by
thin layers of water, glass or metal. However, beta emitting
material can be hazardous if taken into the body.
<P>
<I>Gamma and X rays</I> - are electromagnetic radiations similar
to light and radio waves but with shorter wavelengths. They are
very penetrating and heavy shielding materials like lead and
concrete are needed to stop them.
<P>
<I>Neutrons</I> - are particles with no charge; they are neutral,
and because of this they can penetrate many materials very
easily. They do not produce ionization directly, but their
interaction with atoms can give rise to alpha, beta, gamma or X
rays which produce ionization.  Neutrons can only be stopped by
thick masses of concrete, water or paraffin.
<P>
Ionizing radiation from radioactive materials diminishes over
time at various rates as the atoms change into other atoms.
Often, there is not just the disappearance of one kind of
radiation, but the production of different radiations if the new
atoms are radioactive. The time for half the radioactivity to
dissipate is called the "half-life".  Half-lives vary from a
small fraction of a second to many millions of years.
<P><A NAME="two">
<B><I>Measuring Radiation</A> </I></B>
<P>
The amount of radiation  the `dose' received by people is
measured in millisieverts (mSv). This unit belongs to the same
family as the litre and kilogram, the most commonly accepted,
international system of units. 
<P><A NAME="three">
<B><FONT COLOR="#9932CD">Sources of Natural
Radiation</FONT></B></A>
<P>
Everyone is exposed to radiation, and for most people nature is
the largest source of exposure.(see Fig.1)
<P>
<I>Cosmic radiation</I> comes through the earth's atmosphere,
some from the sun and energy sources in our galaxy or outside it.
Those from the sun are more intense during solar flares but the
others are fairly constant in number. However, the density is
affected by  the earth's magnetic field, which makes it greater
nearer the poles than the equator.  The radiation dose people
receive increases therefore with latitude. In addition, the
earth's atmosphere is a partial shield to the radiation. As one
goes higher there is a lower shielding effect and the dose
increases as the altitude increases. Buildings and the fuselages
of aircraft provide little protection.(see Fig.2)  The global
yearly average dose is 0.39 millisieverts. 
<P>
<I>The Earth's Crust</I> is made up of materials that are
naturally radioactive. Uranium, for instance, is dispersed
throughout rocks and soil, mostly at very low concentrations. So
are thorium and potassium-40.  They nearly all emit gamma rays
which irradiate the whole body more or less uniformly. Since
building materials are extracted from the earth, they can be
slightly radioactive, and people are irradiated indoors as well
as out of doors. The radiation doses vary according to the rocks
and soils of the area and the building materials in use but the
global yearly average is <B>0.46 millisieverts</B>.
<P>
<I>Radon</I> is a naturally radioactive gas that comes from the
uranium that is widespread in the earth's crust. It is emitted
from rocks or soil at the earth's surface and disperses in the
atmosphere unless it enters a building, in which the
concentration can build up.  Radon decays to form other
radioactive atoms which, when inhaled, can lodge in the lung and
irradiate tissue. The global yearly average dose is <B>1.3
millisieverts</B> but in high radon areas the doses can be many
times higher.  The radiation dose can most easily be reduced by
preventing the radon gas from entering it in the first place.(see
Fig.3)
<P>
<I>Food and Drink.</I> Since radioactive materials occur
everywhere in
nature it is inevitable that they get into drinking water and
food, giving a global yearly average dose of <B>0.23
millisieverts</B>. Potassium-40 in particular is a major source
of internal irradiation, but there are others.  Potassium-40 in
the body varies with the amount of muscle, for instance, being
twice as high in younger men than in older women. Some foods, for
example shellfish and Brazil nuts, concentrate radioactive
materials so that, even when there is no artificial
radioactivity, people who consume large quantities can receive a
radiation dose significantly above average.
<P><A NAME="four">
<B><FONT COLOR="#9932CD">Sources of Artificial
Radiation</FONT></B></A>
<P>
Doses from artificial radiation are, for most of the population,
much smaller than those from natural radiation but they still
vary considerably. They are in principle fully controllable,
unlike natural sources.
<P>
<I>Medical</I>. Radiation is used in medicine in two distinct
ways: to diagnose disease or injury; and to kill cancerous cells.
In the oldest and most common diagnostic use, X rays are passed
through the patient to produce an image. The technique is so
valuable that millions of X ray examinations are conducted every
year. One chest X ray will give 0.1 mSv of radiation dose. For
some diseases, diagnostic information can be obtained using gamma
rays emitted by radioactive materials introduced into the patient
by injection, or by swallowing or by inhalation.  This technique
is called nuclear medicine. The radioactive material is part of a
pharmaceutical chosen so that it preferentially locates in the
organ or part of the body being studied. To follow the
distribution or flow of the radioactive material a  gamma camera 
is used. It detects the gamma radiation and produces an image,
and this indicates whether the tissue is healthy or provides
information on the nature and extent of the disease.
<P>
Cancerous conditions may be treated through radiotherapy, in
which beams of high energy X rays or gamma rays from cobalt-60 or
similar sources are used. They are carefully aimed to kill the
diseased tissue, often from several different directions to
reduce the dose to surrounding healthy tissue. Radioactive
substances, either as small amounts of solid material temporarily
inserted into tissues or as radioactive solutions, can also be
used in treating diseases, delivering high but localised
radiation doses.
<P>
Medical uses of radiation are by far the largest source of
man-made exposure of the public; the global yearly average dose
is <B>0.3 millisieverts.</B>
<P>
<I>Environmental Radiation</I>. Radioactive materials are also
present in the atmosphere as a result of atomic bomb testing and
other activities.  They may lead to human exposure by several
pathways external irradiation from radioactive materials
deposited on the ground; inhalation of airborne radioactivity,
and ingestion of radioactive materials in food and water.
<P>
<I>Radioactive fall-out</I> from nuclear weapons tests carried
out in the atmosphere is the most widespread environmental
contaminant but doses to the public have declined from the
relatively high values of the early 1960s to very low levels now.
The global yearly average dose is <B>0.006 millisieverts</B>.
However, where tests were carried out at ground level or even
underground, localised contamination often remains near weapons
sites.
<P>
<I>Nuclear and other industries,</I> and to a small degree
hospitals and universities, discharge radioactive materials to
the environment. Nearly all countries regulate industrial
discharges and require the more significant to be authorized and
monitored. Monitoring of such effluent may be carried out by the
government department that authorizes the discharges as well as
by the operator.
<P>
<I>The nuclear power industry</I> releases small quantities of a
wide variety of radioactive materials at each stage in the
nuclear fuel cycle. For the public the global yearly average dose
is <B>0.008 millisieverts</B>.  The type of radioactive
materials, and whether they are liquid, gaseous or particulate
depends upon the operation of each process. For instance, nuclear
power stations release carbon-14 and sulphur-35, which find their
way through food chains to humans. Liquid discharges include
radioactive materials that people may ingest through fish and
shellfish.
<P>
The yearly dose to individuals living close to a power plant is
small - usually a fraction of a millisievert; doses to people
further away are even smaller.  <I>Reprocessing nuclear fuel</I>
produces higher doses which vary greatly from plant to plant. For
the most exposed members of the public, they can be as high as
<B>0.4 millisieverts</B>, but for most of the population they are
very much smaller. 
<P>
World-wide, there are estimated to be four million workers
exposed to artificial radiation as a result of their work, with
an average yearly dose of about <B>1 millisievert</B>.  Another
five million (mostly in civil aviation) have yearly average doses
due to natural radiation of <B>1.7 millisieverts</B>. 
<P>
<I>Non-nuclear industries</I> also produce radioactive
discharges. They include the processing of ores containing
radioactive materials as well as the element for which the ore is
processed. Phosphorus ores, for instance, contain radium which
can find its way into the effluent. A very different industry,
the generation of electricity by coal-fired power stations,
results in the release of naturally-occurring radioactive
materials from the coal. These are discharged to air and transfer
through food chains to the population. However, the radiation
doses are always low <B>- 0.001 millisieverts or less</B>. 
<P>
<I>Accidental releases of radioactive materials</I>. Apart from
contamination due to the normal operations of the nuclear
industry, radioactivity has been widely dispersed accidentally.
The most significant accident was at Chernobyl nuclear power
station in the Ukraine, where an explosion caused the release of
large amounts of radioactivity over a period of several days.
Airborne radioactive material dispersed widely over Europe and
even further afield. Contamination at ground level varied
considerably, being much heavier where rain washed the
radioactivity out of the air. Radiation doses therefore varied
significantly from normal. More than 100,000 people were
evacuated during the first three weeks following the accident.
Whole body doses received from external radiation from the
Ukrainian part of the 30-km exclusion zone showed an average
value of <B>15 millisieverts</B>. (source OECD, 1995) 
<P>
<I>Radiation in Consumer Products</I>. Minute radiation doses are
received from the artificial radioactivity in consumer goods such
as smoke detectors and luminous watches, and from the natural
radioactivity of gas mantles. The global yearly average dose is
extremely small <B>(0.0005 millisieverts)</B>.
<P><A NAME="five">
<B><FONT COLOR="#9932CD">Biological Effects of Ionizing
Radiation</FONT></B></A>
<P>
The health effects of radiation may be divided into those that
occur early and those that occur late. 
<P>
Short term: It has long been recognized that exposure to high
levels of radiation can harm exposed tissues of the human body.
Such radiation effects can be clinically diagnosed in the exposed
individual; they are called deterministic effects because once a
radiation dose above the relevant threshold has been received,
they will occur and the severity depends on the dose. 
<P>
Long-term: Studies of populations exposed to radiation,
especially of the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, have shown that exposure to radiation can also lead
to the delayed induction of cancer and, possibly, of hereditary
damage.  Effects such as these cannot usually be confirmed in any
particular individual exposed but can be inferred from
statistical studies of large populations: they appear to occur at
random in the irradiated population.
<P>
Information on the biological effects of ionizing radiation is
assembled and published periodically by a number of expert
bodies. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of
Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) is an inter-governmental Committee
made up of prominent scientists from many countries around the
world and is charged with assembling, studying and disseminating
information on the observed levels and the effects of ionizing
radiation, both natural and man-made. The International
Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) was established
nearly 70 years ago, and is an independent, non-governmental
group of experts whose recommedations are generally adopted as
the basis for national regulations governing radiation exposure. 
<P><A NAME="six">
<B><I>Measuring Exposure</I></B></A>
<P>
For radiation protection purposes, exposure to ionizing radiation
is most often measured in terms of "effective dose." This is
based on the energy deposited in tissue by radiation, taking into
account the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the tissues
irradiated.  It is thus a measure of the overall risk arising
from the exposure. The unit is the sievert, but millisieverts
(mSv) are commonly used. 
<P><A NAME="seven">
<B><FONT COLOR="#9932CD">International Standards for Radiation
Protection</FONT></B></A>
<P>
To control the radiation exposure of workers, medical patients
and the public, many countries have developed laws, which are
supported by administrative measures and enforced by inspectors. 
Equally important is to have internationally agreed standards,
and the International Atomic Energy Agency has played a lead role
in developing and refining these. The IAEA  together with the
World Health Organization, International Labour Organisation,
OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, Food and Agriculture Organization and
Pan American Health Organization recently revised and updated its
International Basic Safety Standards (BSS) for protection against
ionizing radiation and the safety of radiation sources.
<P>
The new Standards are intended to ensure the safety of all types
of radiation sources and to complement engineering safety
standards developed for large and complex radiation sources, such
as nuclear reactors and radioactive waste management facilities.
The Standards are not mandatory, but can serve as a practical
guide to all those involved in radiation protection, taking into
account local situations, resources, etc. The BSS are enforced in
all activities involving IAEA assistance and support. 
<P>
A wealth of new information about radiation exposure over the
past decade prompted the revision of the BSS.  First and
foremost, a study of the biological effects of radiation doses
received by the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki suggested that exposure to low-level radiation was more
likely to cause harm than previously estimated. Other
developments  notably the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island
in 1979 and that at Chernobyl in 1986, with its unprecedented
transboundary contamination  had a profound effect on the public
perception of the potential danger from radiation exposure. 
There were serious accidents with radiation sources used in
medicine and industry in Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador and other
countries.  In addition, more has been discovered about natural
radiation  such as household radon  as a cause of concern for
health. Finally, natural radiation exposures of workers such as
miners, who were not thought of as radiation workers, were
discovered to be much higher than had been realized.
<P><A NAME="eight">
<B><I>Principles of radiation protection</I></B></A>
<P>
The BSS apply to both "practices" and "interventions":
<P>
<I>Practices</I> are activities that add radiation exposure to
that which people normally receive due to background radiation,
or that increase the likelihood of incurring exposure.  These
include the use of radiation or radioactive substances for
medical, industrial, agricultural, educational, training and
research purposes and, of course, the generation of energy by
nuclear power.  Also included are facilities containing
radioactive substances or devices such irradiation installations,
mines and mills processing radioactive ores and radioactive waste
management facilities. 
<P>
<I>Interventions</I> are any activities that seek to reduce the
existing radiation exposure, or the likelihood of incurring
exposure.  These apply to both chronic exposure situations such
as radon in buildings, and emergency situations such as those
created by contamination in the aftermath of an accident. 
<P>
Protection under the BSS is based on the principles of the
International Commission on Radiological Protection, which can be
summed up as follows:
<P>
Justification of the practice.  No practice involving exposure to
radiation should be adopted unless it produces a benefit that
outweighs the harm it causes or could cause. 
<P>
Optimization of protection. Radiation doses and risks should be
kept as low as reasonably achievable economic and social factors
being taken into account; constraints should be applied to dose
or risk to prevent an unfair distribution of exposure or risk. 
<P>
Limitation of individual risk. Exposure of individuals should not
exceed specified dose limits above which the dose or risk would
be deemed unacceptable.
<P>
All three principles apply to the protection of workers and the
public. However, to protect patients during the medical use of
ionizing radiation only justification and optimization apply.
Dose limits are not applicable to medical exposure, but guidance
levels which show what is achievable by good practice may be
established for use by medical practitioners. Dose limits are
also inapplicable to interventions, which are concerned with
reducing exposure. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=2 WIDTH=90% CELLPADDING=5>
<TR>
<TD><SMALL>The dose limits for practices are intended to ensure
that no
individual is committed to unacceptable risk due to radiation
exposure.  For the public the limit is 1 mSv in a year, or in
special circumstances up to 5 mSv in a single year provided that
the average does over five consecutive years does not exceed 1
mSv per year</SMALL></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
The objective of the BSS is to prevent the occurrence of short
term effects of high doses of radiation and to restrict the
likelihood of occurrence of long term effects. Assuming that a
practice is justified, the objective is achieved both by
optimizing the protection of the exposed individuals and by
ensuring the safety of the source of exposure.
<P>
For any justified interventions, the objective is achieved by
keeping the individual doses lower than the threshold levels for
deterministic effects and keeping all doses as low as reasonably
achievable in the circumstances.
<P>
Justification of practices and interventions involves many
factors, including social and political aspects, as well as
radiological considerations. Some practical guidance on
justification for practices and interventions is provided by the
BSS, and some examples are provided here:
<P>
An intervention is justified if it is expected to achieve more
good than harm, having regard to health, social and economic
factors. Protective actions are nearly always justified if, in
the absence of intervention, doses are expected to approach
certain specified values related to deterministic effects.

<P><A NAME="nine">
<B><FONT COLOR="#9932CD">Application of the Basic Safety
Standards</B></FONT></A>
<P>
The BSS set out detailed requirements for practices and
interventions to protect workers, patients and the general public
from radiation exposure. They also recommend procedures for
ensuring the safety of sources, for accident prevention, for
emergency planning and preparedness and for mitigating the
consequences of accidents. Although the majority are of a
qualitative nature, the BSS also establish many requirements
expressed in terms of restrictions or guidance on the dose that
may be incurred by people. The range of  doses  spreads over four
orders of magnitude, from ones that are so minute that they
should be exempt from the requirements to doses that are large
enough to make intervention almost mandatory.
<P><A NAME="ten">
<B><I>Organizational requirements</I></B></A>
<P>
National governments usually have the responsibilities for
enforcing radiation safety standards, generally through a system
that includes a regulatory authority. In addition, governments
usually provide for certain essential services for radiation
protection and safety and for interventions that exceed or that
complement the capabilities of regulators. The BSS can only be
effectively applied when such a national infrastructure is
firmly in place. In addition to legislation and regulations, the
essential elements are:
<P>
<I>A Regulatory Authority</I>.  This should be empowered to
authorize
and inspect, and to enforce the legislation and regulations. It
must have sufficient resources, including adequate numbers of
trained personnel. There must be arrangements for detecting any
build up of radioactive substances in the general environment,
for disposing of radioactive waste and preparing for
interventions, particularly during emergencies, that could result
in exposure of the public.
<P>
<I>Education, training and public information</I>. There must be
adequate arrangements and resources for these, as well as for the
exchange of information among specialists. There must also be
appropriate means of informing the public, its representatives
and the information media about health and safety concerns. 
<P>
<I>Facilities and services for radiation protection and
safety</I> must be well established at the national level. These
include laboratories for personal dosimetry and environmental
monitoring, and calibration and intercomparison of radiation
measuring equipment; they could also include central registries
for radiation dose records and information on equipment
reliability.
<P><A NAME="eleven">
<B><I>Management requirements</I></B></A>
<P>
To ensure radiation safety, the BSS promotes development of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A Safety Culture - that encourages a questioning and
learning attitude to protection and safety, and discourages
complacency.
<P>
<LI>Quality Assurance Programmes - that provide, as
appropriate, adequate assurances that the specified requirements
related to protection and safety are satisfied.
<P>
<LI>Control of Human Factors - limiting, as far as practicable,
the contribution of human error to accidents and other events
that could give rise to exposures. This can be achieved by
ensuring that all personnel on whom protection and safety depend
are appropriately trained and qualified.
<P>
<LI>Qualified experts - made available for providing advice on
the observance of the BSS.
</UL>
<P><A NAME="twelve">
<B><I>Technical requirements</I></B></A>
<P>
The BSS promotes sound technical planning and implementation
through the following:
<P>
<I>Security of sources</I>. Radiation sources must be kept secure
so as to prevent theft or damage.
<P>
<I>Defence in depth</I>. A multilayer system of protection and
safety
provisions commensurate with the radiation hazards involved is
applied to sources, so that a failure at one layer is compensated
for or corrected by subsequent layers.
<P>
<I>Good engineering practice</I>. This reflects approved codes
and
standards, and must be supported by reliable management and
organization to ensure protection and safety throughout the life
of the sources.
<P>
<I>Verification of safety</I>. Protection and safety measures for
sources must be made in a way that they can be regularly
monitored and verified for compliance. In addition, records
should be kept of the results of monitoring and verification.
<P>
<B><I>Transport</I></B>
<P>
Additionally, radioactive substances have to be transported in
accordance with the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of
Radioactive Material and with any applicable international
convention.

<P>
Most of the ionizing radiation that people are exposed to in
day-to-day activities comes from natural, rather than manmade,
sources.  The health effects of radiation both natural and
artificial are relatively well understood and can be effectively
minimized through careful safety measures and practices. The
IAEA, together with other international and expert organizations,
is helping to promote and institute Basic Safety Standards on an
international basis to ensure that radiation sources and
radioactive materials are managed for both maximum safety and
human benefit.

The eighth edition of the IAEA Yearbook concentrates on developments in nuclear science and technology. The first article provides an account of the IAEA's involvement in international efforts over the past ten years to compile and disseminate scientifically assessed information on the causes and consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. Part A focuses on the IAEA's efforts to improve the quality of technical co-operation projects, with emphasis on better planning to maximize the impact of these programmes. Part B provides details on how nuclear techniques can be used to improve human health and welfare, on new developments in food irradiation, and on the role of isotope tools in the fight against malnutrition. A report on the latest status and trends in the area of nuclear power, the nuclear fuel cycle and radioactive waste management is presented in Part C. The Nuclear Safety Review, Part D, concentrates on selected areas of special interest covering nuclear safety, radiation safety and radioactive waste safety.  Part E, dealing with IAEA safeguards activities, provides a report on the status of safeguards implementation in 1995, as well as articles on the IAEA's new 'Clean Laboratory' at Seibersdorf, on combating the illicit trafficking of nuclear material and other radioactive sources, and on new trends in safeguards inspector training.

<HR NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he world population has nearly
doubled
over the last
three
decades and will continue to increase. Current estimates forecast
that by 2020 there will be about 8,1 billion people living on
this planet, with nearly 90% of the population increase taking
place in developing countries. In these countries, current
electricity consumption per capita, which may be used as an
indicator of standard of living, is very low, one or two orders
of magnitude lower than in the industrialised countries. In
addition to many urgent needs, such as food, clothes,
accommodation and work, availability of energy is an important
prerequisite for socio-economic development in all parts of the
world.
<P>
Depending on the geographic location and the level of
industrialisation, final energy is consumed in different forms:
as electricity, for transport, or as heat. Among the different
energy supply alternatives that countries may choose, nuclear
power represents one of the few options that provide a means to
produce energy in all forms, i.e. as electricity, low and high
temperature process heat, and process steam, both economically
and under environmentally acceptable conditions. Environmental
concerns about the effects of burning fossil fuels for energy
production have stimulated interest in low-polluting energy
sources. Further development and deployment of nuclear power may
thus appear an attractive option to some nations for contributing
to a long term, safe and reliable energy supply.
<P>
Over the past three decades, thousands of reactor-years of
operating experience have been accumulated with current economic
and reliable nuclear energy systems. New generations of nuclear
power plants have been, or are being, developed, building upon
this background of success and applying lessons learned from the
experience of operating plants; hence, the new, advanced designs
are anticipated to become even more safe, economic and reliable
than their predecessors.
<P>
Advanced designs generally incorporate improvements of the
safety concepts, including, among others, features that will
allow operators more time to perform safety actions, and that
will provide even more protection against any possible releases
of radioactivity to the environment. Upgraded designs may also
include introduction of passive safety features that are based on
natural forces, such as convection and gravity, making safety
functions less dependent on active systems and components like
pumps and valves.
<P>
Great attention is paid to making new plants simpler to operate,
inspect, maintain and repair, thus increasing their overall cost
efficiency. In the event of disturbances and accidents, largely
digitalised control, monitoring and protection systems will
automatically bring the plant back to normal conditions or to a
safe shutdown state, without operator action. Typical design
objectives imply that safety actions by the operators shall not
be needed within at least 30 minutes, leaving them time to assess
the situation carefully before acting. Increased thermal inertia
in the reactor system and reduced core power densities are two
such design related factors.
<P>
With respect to passive safety features, their function will
normally also be independent  of power supply, (at least
following an initiation of the function), by utilisation of
thermal hydraulic phenomena, such as density differences due to
different temperatures, and elevated water reservoirs, e.g., to
permit coolant flow to the reactor system by gravity to top up
coolant levels.
<P>
Development of a new reactor design is a costly and demanding
task that requires a lot of resources. To overcome this problem,
co-operation, on a national or international level, has
frequently been established, and the advantages of pooling
resources in development projects have been demonstrated. As an
international forum for exchange of scientific and technical
information, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is
playing a major role in this context, bringing together experts
for a world-wide exchange of information about national
programmes and co-ordinating research programmes for advanced
reactor development projects.
<A NAME="note_a"><P>
<H3>Advanced designs</H3></A>
<P>

One alternative for meeting future energy needs is to gradually
increase the deployment of nuclear energy by introducing advanced
designs into the energy supply systems throughout the world. In
this context, it may be noted that an advanced design is
characterised as a plant design of current interest or merit but
which has not yet been constructed or operated; such advanced
designs, in turn, can be divided into evolutionary and
developmental designs. An evolutionary design is a descendant
from an existing plant design featuring design improvements and
modifications based on feedback of experience and incorporating
new technological achievements; an evolutionary plant design at
most requires engineering and confirmatory testing prior to
commercial deployment.  A developmental design, on the other
hand, will incorporate more significant departures from existing
plant designs, and may require also construction of a
demonstration plant and/or prototype plant prior to large-scale
commercial deployment.  A developmental design that incorporates
radical changes in the design may be called an innovative design,
which thus represents a special sub-category of developmental
designs.
<P>
Advanced designs presently under development comprise three
basic types:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>water-cooled reactors;
<P>
<LI>fast reactors; and
<P>
<LI>gas-cooled reactors,
</UL>
<P>
which are discussed further below.
<P>
<B><I>Water-cooled reactors</I></B>
<P>
Water-cooled reactors are characterised by the use of water as
moderator and coolant; light water reactors (LWRs) utilise
ordinary  "light"  water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O) and heavy water
reactors (HWRs) use heavy water (D<SUB>2</SUB>O), at least as
moderator. In heavy water, the hydrogen atoms (H<SUB>2</SUB>)
have been replaced by deuterium (D<SUB>2</SUB>), a heavy isotope
of hydrogen.
<P>
Some 330 LWR plants are currently operating throughout the world,
representing about 75% of all nuclear power plants in operation.
This type of reactor has been operating for more than 35 years.
Continual upgradings and evolutionary improvements of the LWR
plant designs have formed the basis for the development of
advanced LWR plant (ALWR) designs, of both boiling water reactor
(BWR) and pressurised water reactor (PWR) types.<I><A
HREF="lwrdesig.html">(Some examples of advanced LWR
designs.)</A></I>
<P>
Both large and medium size reactors are being developed; the
former would to a large extent represent extensions of existing
designs, whereas the smaller typically would enhance the use of
passive safety features to achieve plant simplification and
savings in order to become cost competitive in spite of the
smaller size. Some developmental designs, in particular
innovative designs, like the Swedish PIUS PWR, incorporate safety
functions of a different nature compared with the traditional
safety features of existing designs, e.g., self-protective
functions for reactor shutdown in the event of unacceptable
operating conditions and for reliable removal of the decay heat
(the heat developed in the fuel after shutdown) from the reactor
core.
<P>
Fuel improvements have steadily been implemented in operating
plants over the years; e.g., enhanced use of burnable absorbers
in the fuel and increased fuel burnup have yielded substantial
reductions in uranium consumption, some 20% compared with the
INFCE (International Fuel Cycle Evaluation) study of 1978/1979.
<P>
Recycling of plutonium through mixed oxide (MOX) fuel has become
commonplace in a number of countries, such as France, Germany and
Switzerland, and several other countries may follow.
<P>
Advanced designs will normally try to take full advantage of
progress in the fuel field; their core designs will be optimised
taking into account advanced burnable absorber strategies and
extended fuel burnups. Many of them will have the capability of
operation with up to 100% MOX fuel in the core.
<P>
HWR plants account for some 7% of all operating nuclear power
plants; most of them are CANDUs, the Canadian pressure tube
reactor design. Most such plants have operated safely, reliably
and competitively from the initial start-up.
<P>
Design improvements on the CANDU type reactors focus on enhancing
plant safety, increasing plant lifetime to as much as 100 years,
simplifying replacement of all components that cannot be designed
for such a service lifetime, shortening construction time, and
producing electricity at costs that are competitive with other
energy sources (e.g. brown coal).
<P>
<B><I>Fast reactors</I></B>
<P>
Fast reactors use "fast" neutrons for sustaining the fission
process, in contrast to water- and gas-cooled reactors that use
 thermal  neutrons. Fast reactors are also commonly known as
breeders since they produce fuel, as well as consuming it.
Plutonium breeding allows fast reactors to extract sixty times as
much energy from uranium as thermal reactors do, which may make
them economical and advantageous for countries which lack
abundant uranium resources. Increased deployment of nuclear power
in the decades to come would likely lead to a depletion of
uranium resources, and use of breeder reactors to produce fissile
material may become necessary within the next half century.
<P>
In the fast neutron spectrum present in such reactions, all
transuranic elements become fissionable, and therefore, fast
reactors may also contribute to burning of plutonium, arising
from operation of other types of reactors and from the
dismantling of nuclear weapons, and to decreasing the total
inventory of transuranics inside the "macro-system" by
transmuting them to energy and fission products; fuel
reprocessing and recycling in fast reactors would allow "burning"
of the very long-lived transuranic radioisotopes, vastly reducing
the required isolation time for high-level waste. 
<P>
The fast reactors are normally cooled by liquid metal
(sodium) and are therefore called liquid metal-cooled fast
reactors (LMFRs).  Successful LMFR plants have been designed,
constructed and operated, e.g. the BN-600 in Russia, the 1200 MWe
Superphenix in France, and the 280 MWe Monju in Japan.
<P>
The further development of fast reactors is focusing on
revised safety and economic requirements for the next generation
of nuclear power plants. Work is also continuing on improving
fuel burnup and the fuel recycling technology to reduce the
amounts of radioactive waste produced at plants.
<P>
A number of different types of LMFRs are being studied, as
well as wider use of passive systems for further safety; examples
are the BN-800M in Russia, the DFBR in Japan, and the PFBR in
India. There is also an advanced LMFR design in small and medium
power range, developed by General Electric in the USA. This ALMR
concept incorporates passive safety features, and includes waste
management and reprocessing facilities, as well as fuel
manufacturing at the plant site, forming a single  nuclear park 
to minimise the risk of proliferation of fissile materials. Other
advanced fast reactors include the European fast reactor (EFR)
which may become widely used for recycling of  plutonium and
electricity production. 
<P>
<B><I>Gas-cooled reactors</I></B>
<P>
High-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGR) have been under
development for a long period of time, and a number of prototype
or demonstration plants have been built, but without complete
success in operation. The HTGR is basically a graphite moderated
reactor with a gas (helium) as the coolant. The inert He gas and
a special fuel design make it possible to operate at temperatures
considerably above those in water-cooled reactors, and this, in
turn, makes it possible to produce steam at a much higher
temperature (and pressure) for supplies to conventional steam
turbine generators, yielding a much improved thermal efficiency
of the plant, or to produce high-temperature process heat for
special applications. 
<P>
In recent years, development has focused on small, modular units,
since experiments and analyses have shown that such units can
achieve an exceptional degree of self-protection. 
<P>
HTGR fuel is not contained in fuel pins clad in metal as in LWR
and LMFBR fuel, but in fuel particles. The particles are about
0,2-0,6 mm in size and consist of a mixture of oxide or carbide
uranium or thorium or uranium/thorium. In order to retain fission
products, each particle is enclosed by several coatings of
ceramic material with a high temperature stability. The particles
are homogeneously dispersed in a graphite matrix that is
subsequently compressed to spherical elements, pebbles, or in the
form of rods, filled into fuel channels of a multi-hole graphite
block. The particles remain intact and retain virtually all
fission products up to a temperature of about 1600 &#176;C. They
do
not melt at a given threshold temperature and fail only gradually
under accident conditions; hence, a sudden release of fission
products cannot occur.
<P>
Further HTGR development will concentrate on improved plant
performance and life extension studies. With respect to the
former, much effort is currently devoted to the so-called
gas-turbine-cycle in which high temperature gas is conveyed
directly to a gas turbine, yielding very high thermal efficiency
and promising low energy cost, and to production of very high
temperature process heat. 
<A NAME="note_b"><P>
<H3>The IAEA and advanced reactor development</H3></A>
<P>
Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of burning
fossil fuels have led to  renewed international interest in
nuclear technology. National development programmes have been
supplemented by international efforts in advanced reactor
development, particularly for those with innovative features.
Technical programmes and projects of the IAEA in this field focus
on enhanced safety, increased reliability, improved economic
efficiency, public understanding, and the possible introduction
of advanced reactors.
<P>
<B><I>International working groups</I></B>
<P>
Agency activities in the area of development of advanced designs
are co-ordinated by three international working groups which meet
periodically to discuss and exchange information on national
programmes, to identify areas of common interest for co-operation
and to advise the Agency on its technical programmes and
activities, including the establishment of co-ordinated research
programmes. The activities of the groups also include workshops
on topics related to the development of advanced designs.
<P>
<B><I>Technical assistance programmes</I></B>
<P>
Through its technical assistance programmes, the Agency helps
developing countries establish the expertise needed to
incorporate advanced reactor technologies into their own research
programmes by providing expert advice, training, fellowships and
special equipment and research. For countries interested in
developing research programmes, the IAEA publishes reports on the
status of advanced designs development. 
<A NAME="note_c"><P>
<H3>Trends</H3></A>
<P>
Advanced nuclear reactor designs derive advantage from the
extensive operating experience gained from current systems and
results of world-wide research and development, the aim being to
provide very safe, reliable and economical nuclear power plants,
which will also be friendly to the environment. 
<P>
Improved reactor systems and increasing public awareness and
concern about global warming and environmental pollution have led
national decision makers to look more closely at the nuclear
option for their future electricity generation mix. Successful
use of nuclear power in the years to come does not depend only on
technical excellence: understanding and acceptance both by the
public and by national authorities are an absolute prerequisite.

<i>Nuclear power can be an effective tool in reducing stress on
the 
environment.</i></center>
<hr noshade>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>E</B></FONT>nvironmental concerns are high on 
today's political agenda.
People's awareness of the planet's 
precarious health has been  reinforced by scientific warnings
that quick,
vigorous, and sustained action must be taken  if we are to
preserve the world in which we
live.
<p>
Public perception and anxiety about acid rain, ozone layer
depletion, and the greenhouse
effect have been heightened in recent years. Enhanced awareness
offers an unprecedented 
opportunity for members of the world community to make rational,
informed decisions in
the environmental debate.
<p>         
Energy, in particular electricity generation, is fundamental to
social and economic
development. The use of hydropower, coal, oil and gas has helped
to stimulate economic
growth and raise the standards of living of people worldwide. All
major forms of
electricity generation, however, have some effect on the
environment, frequently with 
starkly negative results. The burning of fossil fuels, scientists
say, can contribute some 50
percent to the warming of the global atmosphere. Man's harnessing
of these resources
involves risks to the environment, as well as to people involved
in activities associated
with energy technologies.
<p>         
The link between energy and the environment is undeniable. The
world must therefore
carefully examine its energy alternatives, and alternatives must
be found to reduce the influence
of fossile fuels on the environment, in parallel with
conservation efforts. Nuclear energy can
claim to be a clean, economical option for the generation of
electricity and as one 
when looking at ways to help relieve stress on
the environment.
<p>         
Conclusions of the 14th Congress of the World Energy Conference
in Montreal in late
September, 1989 indicate that environmental effects of energy
uses and the world's 
growing demand for electricity are prime reasons warranting a
renewed emphasis on nuclear
power.
<p>                    
Conservation is a significant, realistic, and necessary element
in trying to reduce the 
burning of fossil fuels. Conservation implies both a more
efficient and more discriminating use of
energy. But, as the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA)
Director General Dr. Hans
Blix has said, current plans of developing countries foresee a
sharp increase in the use of
fossil fuels. This means that if we are to succeed in stabilizing
and indeed diminishing the
greenhouse effect, industrialized countries must make the major
effort. Nuclear power can be
one effective tool in this vital endeavour. Additionally, ways
must be found to allow 
industrializing nations to play their part without jeopardizing
their growth prospects.

<h3>Nuclear power's role in environmental protection</h3></CENTER></A>
<HR NOSHADE>
<center><i>
The world community is beginning to realize that no source of
energy is risk-free and
that environmental considerations must be taken into account.
</center></i>
<HR NOSHADE>                      
         If the electric energy that was generated from
         nuclear power last year had instead been produced
         by coal-fired power plants, it would have given rise
         to additional emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> of about 1600
         million tons. This figure is not small compared
         with the 4000 million tons which the Toronto
         Conference on the Changing Atmosphere
         recommended as a target for reductions by 2005.
<p>         
           The wastes resulting from the operation of all
         nuclear power plants last year gave rise to some
         7000 tons of spent fuel, a small amount compared to
         other energy sources. If the electricity had been
         generated by the combustion of coal, it would have
         resulted in millions of tons of SO<SUB>2</SUB> and
NO<SUB>X</SUB>, in addition to the 1600 million tons of
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, even with the
         best flue gas cleaning equipment available.
Additionally, there would have been some 100,000 tons
         of poisonous heavy metals, including arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, copper, lead, and vanadium.
         These remain poisonous forever and are not isolated
         from the biosphere.
<p>         
           The Agency provides assistance to its Member
         States in nuclear power production and services to
         assure that nuclear power plants are safely managed
         and operated. For example:
<p>         
<dl>
<dt><b>Radiation and nuclear safety standards</b>
<dd>For more than 30 years, the Agency has established
international safety standards and guidance on
radiation and nuclear safety and assisted Member States in their
application nationally to promote the
safe use of nuclear technologies in medicine, research,
agriculture, industry and energy production.
Two complementary sets of documents constitute an internationally
recognized frame of reference for
safety--the Basic Safety Standards for Radiation Protection and
its 
associated Safety Series publications, and the recently updated
Nuclear Safety
Standards (NUSS). The NUSS Codes of Practice and supplementary
Safety Guides 
promote a common approach to governmental organization, siting,
design, operations, and quality assurance at nuclear power
plants.
<p>         
<dt><b>Operational nuclear safety</b>
<dd>The Agency has an interactive system of activities available
to help ensure that nuclear power
plants and research reactors are operated in a safe manner and 
non-detrimental to human and environmental well-being. The
Operational Safety Review
Team (OSART) programme provides international expert teams for
impartial on-site reviews of safety
practices at individual plants. The Assessment of Safety
Significant Events Teams (ASSET)
programme offers a direct exchange of experience
between the operating organization and international
experts on causes and corrective actions for incidents occurring
at nuclear power plants. 
The Incident Report System (IRS) facilitates an international
exchange of reliable information about safety related incidents
at nuclear power plants.
<p>
<dt><b>Environmental risks of energy production</b>
<dd>Properly viewed, the level of risk nuclear power
poses to human health and the environment compares favorably with
that 
of viable energy alternatives. To help provide this perspective,
the Agency,
together with other organizations, is comparatively
assessing the risks of nuclear power production with
viable energy alternatives, building up a reliable
database on different types of health and environmental impacts
posed 
by the total cycle of the energy system. It has joined with the
United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization 
(UNIDO) in assessing the health and environmental risks from 
energy and other complex industry systems. This assessment
represents a pioneering international effort to
develop an integrated approach to risk management.
<P>         
In 1991, it will team with UNEP, WHO, and a host of other
organizations 
to sponsor an international symposium aimed at understanding the
environmental and health effects of different means of
generating electricity and how this knowledge can
be translated into practical policies and practices on
electricity and the environment.
<p>
<dt><b>Radioactive waste management/disposal</b>
<dd>To protect the environment and avoid health
hazards, the Agency assists Members States in planning the
management and disposal of radioactive
wastes. Efforts concentrate on the control, containment, and
isolation of such wastes from the biosphere. Practical
assistance, guidelines for safety
assessment procedures, publications, symposia, and
training are provided in radioactive waste management.
<P>         
The IAEA publishes safety standards on radioactive waste
management and disposal. A new safety
standard released in 1989 reflects an international concensus on
the safety principles and technical
criteria for the underground disposal of high-level radioactive
wastes.
<P>         
The Waste Management Advisory Programme (WAMAP) assists Member
States through advisory
missions by teams of experts to establish regulations, develop a
regulatory framework for licensing
and inspection, analyse problems and select solutions, and
design, construct, and operate waste
management facilities.

<h3>Nuclear techniques for environmental protection</h3></CENTER></A>

The practical contributions of nuclear energy and the IAEA's
activities to enhance
environmentally sound and sustainable international development
have gained wide
recognition in the global community. The use of
nuclear techniques in fields such as agriculture,
industry, and research supports environmental
objectives. The following are some examples of
IAEA activities in these areas:
<p>
<dl>         
<dt><b>Soil fertility and crop production</b>
<dd>Nitrogen fertilizers are used widely to increase
agricultural production. Many fertilizers, however,
can harm the environment. Nuclear techniques are
used to trace fertilizers to determine the best form,
timing, and placement to avoid waste and to reduce
its movement into the environment. Others are used
to detect, measure, and track fertilizer-supplied
nutrients in soil and plants, determine the
availability of soil moisture, and study and promote
the natural process of nitrogen fixation.
<p>         
<dt><b>Irrigation</b>
<dd>Agricultural production requires an adequate
supply of water in soils. Neutron moisture gauges
are used to improve traditional irrigation methods to
cut total water use by some 40 percent. Different
practices to increase water conservation in rain-fed
areas have been tested and have resulted in immediate practical
application.
<p>
<dt><b>Plant Breeding</b>
<dd>Nuclear techniques are used to develop new
strains of important food crops. These new varieties
of species such as rice, wheat, and soybean, may
have a better resistance to disease, be of a higher
product quality, or have a higher yield.
<p>
<dt><b>Pest control</b>
<dd>The Agency's studies and applications of the
sterile insect technique to control and eradicate the
Mediterranean fruit fly and the tsetse fly within certain
geographical areas have produced significant
successes, thereby helping to reduce the use of insecticides.
<p>         
<dt><b>Pesticides</b>
<dd>To reduce damage to the ecosystem, the release
of active pesticide compounds over time can be improved to
decrease the quantities used by farmers.
Nuclear techniques also track the residues of pesticides in the
environment.
<p>         
<dt><b>Hydrology</b>
<dd>Techniques using "environmental" isotopes are
among those that meteorologists, hydrologists, and
hydrogeologists use in the study of water. Study of
the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water, or of
elements contained in dissolved salts which have the
same behaviour as water, enable exact recording of
phenomena affecting the occurrence and movement
of water in all its forms.
<p>         
<dt><b>The Amazon Project</b>
<dd>Nuclear techniques play a key role in investigating
the environmental consequences of the clearing of
tropical rainforests. Because of their sensitivity, stable
isotopes can measure small changes over short time
periods and environmental and ecological changes
caused by relatively small cleared areas and basins.
They provide data on vapour movements, stream
flow, sedimentation, water quality, plant productivity, and soil
changes. Using such techniques, the
Amazon Project, which the IAEA participates in, is
expected to yield information that will lead to the
development of methods for optimizing plant nutrition and
fertilizer utilization. Nuclear techniques
also are used to study the nutritional and water
cycles in the region demonstrating climate changes
and fragility of the ecology in the region. Ultimately,
it should have a decisive impact on the ecological management of
the region.
<p>         
<dt><b>Research and development</b>
<dd>The Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf provides
research and scientific support to developing
countries at their request. It provides training and
laboratory services to scientists in areas such as
analytical techniques for radioisotope measurements
and the use of nuclear techniques for the determination of
non-radioactive pollutants. Training in the
use of isotope and nuclear techniques for the assessment of
pesticide residues, studies of soil/water
problems and entomology has provided expertise to
thousands of scientists from developing countries over the years.
<P>         
The Agency's Laboratory at Monaco carries out
studies of radioactivity in the marine environment,
collaborating with oceanographic institutes
worldwide and conducting projects in co-operation
with the UN Environment Program (UNEP), for example.
<P>         
The International Centre for Theoretical Physics,
in Trieste, helps foster advanced study and research
in physical and mathematical sciences serving as an
international forum for scientific contacts among
scientists and providing facilities for research. It
holds courses on solar energy, ecological modelling,
and atmospheric and ocean sciences, all of which are
of direct relevance to scientists in developing
countries working in areas related to the environment.
<p>         
<dt><b>Environmental pollution</b>
<dd>The use of isotopes and the development of
analytical tools, including tracer methods, neutron
activation analysis, X-ray fluorescence and atomic
absorption spectrometry, have added to the techniques available
for the 
study and detection of environmental pollutants such as
pesticides and toxic metals.
<P>         
These tools have become standard methods for assessing water and
mineral resources. The use of
nuclear techniques to help solve pollution problems
is well known and is an important contribution to the
concept of sustainable development.
<p><dt><b>Environmental monitoring and impact assessment</b>
<dd>The Agency collects, analyses, and publishes information on
radioisotopes in the environment. A
number of safety standards, guides, recommendations, procedures
data and relevant technical reports
have been published over the years. Such environmental monitoring
includes 
surveillance and checking for compliance with authorized
procedures, as
well as monitoring for research purposes, such as collecting
information 
relevant to assessing the behaviour and pathways of radionuclides
in the 
environment.
<P>         
Radiological assessment models are used widely
for environmental safety at nuclear facilities. The
Agency is working with an expanding network of researchers
worldwide to validate long-range transport
models for atmospheric pollutants and to validate
models for the transfer of radionuclides in terrestrial,
urban, and aquatic environments.
<p>         
<dt><b>Radiation processing</b>
<dd>The Agency supports research and development
activities in the use of electron beam irradiation to
clean flue gases originating from the combustion of fossil fuels.
<P>
Radiation processing of urban waste sludges is
also under investigation to kill pathogens and
facilitate disposal or recycling of waste products.
<p>
<dt><b>Emergency preparedness</b>
<dd>The IAEA Emergency Response System can
respond rapidly to nuclear or radiological emergencies, informing
national authorities about accidents
and coordinating assistance that Member States, the
IAEA and other international organizations could
provide to mitigate environmental and health impacts. To
complement national efforts, the Agency
provides technical guidance and assistance to Member 
States for effective emergency preparedness at nuclear
facilities.

Although the nuclear industry has an excellent safety record,
Chernobyl demonstrated that 
accidents can and do happen. During and after a nuclear accident,
effective communication is 
essential to enable authorities to take prompt measures and to
provide reliable information 
to the public at large. Such measures can address the
consequences of a nuclear accident, 
save lives, and protect the environment.
<p>         
Comprehensible information passed from nation to nation also
allows other States to
react to the situation and to learn from it later. Whether the
effects of an accident are
limited to the facility, or have widespread implications, the
immediate response of 
national and international authorities is vital.

<A NAME="ers"><p>         
<blockquote>
<h3>The IAEA emergency response system</h3></A>

In its early years, the International Atomic Energy Agency's
(IAEA) role in co-ordinating 
emergency planning and preparedness was minor. Following the
Three Mile Island
(TMI) accident, attention to the IAEA's role in major
radiological events increased. The
accident prompted the Agency to re-evaluate its emergency
response system and to
issue guidelines for information exchange and co-operation among
States before and
during such events.
<p>         
A few years later, Chernobyl underscored the need for such a
system. As a result,
Member States supported the establishment of two international
conventions: one focusing on 
early notification and the other on assistance in the case of a
nuclear accident.
The conventions now form the basic framework of the Agency's
emergency response
system. They specifically outline the  Agency's role and that of
its Member States
in the event of a nuclear incident, accident or radiological
emergency.
<p>         
Through this system, the Agency gathers and verifies information
relating to nuclear
and radiological emergencies. It can provide information to its
Member States, other 
international organizations, the media, and the public. It also
provides technical assistance
to the affected States when requested. Naturally, for the system
to be effective, 
co-operation among the Agency, its members and other
international organizations is necessary.
<p>
<b><i>The early notification convention</i></b>
<p>        
Under the convention on early notification, Member States agree
to notify the
Agency in case of a nuclear emergency that could result in a
transboundary radiological
release. In return, the Agency's role is to record the
notification of an accident from a
State, to inform other States which may be affected and to relay
details about the 
accident that may be useful to other Member States or
international organizations in 
responding. Prompt notification, provision of information, and
technical assistance can
help to minimize any radiological consequences of the emergency.
<p>         
Because accidents can occur at any time, the emergency response
system operates
around the clock. During normal working hours, notice of an
incident or accident
comes directly to the Agency's emergency response unit. Out of
office hours, the security staff 
periodically scans messages that arrive at the communication
centre. If an
emergency is reported, they contact the appropriate experts. A
State would specify
the level of safety significance of the event and can report on
damage to the plant and
any health or environmental consequences. It may classify the
accident using the International 
Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
<p>         
Senior level managers, information officers, technical experts,
and support staff
then come together to perform pre-assigned duties. If the Agency
verifies the emergency
as having transboundary radiological implications, it
communicates with Member States
via telex, fax, telephone, and the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO)-operated
global telecommunications network. As the international source of
information, the
IAEA may also inform other organizations including the World
Health Organization
(WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.N.
Environment Programme (UNEP), the U.N. Disaster Relief
Organization (UNDRO), and the WMO.
<p>         
Press and information releases are coordinated through a high
level group which
guides the Agency's response to the many inquiries of the public,
the media, the national 
authorities of Member States, and other international
organizations. Here, INES
can act as a means to relay information to the press and public
to counter any distorted 
reports and unnecessary fears. Appropriate response to an
emergency presupposes
effective communication.
<p>         
<b><i>The assistance convention</i></b>
<p>         
The assistance convention provides for prompt aid when requested
by Member
States to minimize any radiological consequences of an event, and
to protect life,
property, and the environment. The convention states that "if a
State party needs 
assistance in the event of a nuclear accident or radiological
emergency, whether or not
such accident or emergency originated within its territory...it
may call for such 
assistance from the Agency."
<p>         
Under this convention, the Agency is also committed to respond to
requests for
support from a State and, where necessary, act as a "broker"
between States which provide 
and receive the assistance.
<p>         
IAEA assistance includes medical consultations, radiological
monitoring, health
physics support, public information, and technical assistance.
The Agency can help
provide additional equipment and material. IAEA experts, familiar
with the plant, the
reactor technology, and the language of the State, can provide
appropriate support and
guidance regarding health and environmental implications.
Although the Agency may 
provide assistance during a nuclear emergency (including on-site
support), plant operators
and local authorities are ultimately responsible for mitigating
any consequences.
<p>         
A State may also request technical assistance from other
intergovernmental or international organizations. It must specify
the
scope and the type of assistance needed and identify its
available local resources such as
experts, equipment and materials.
<p>         
<b><i>Preparedness</i></b>
<p>         
The IAEA periodically conducts exercises to assure that the
system functions
properly. These exercises involve a full response of the IAEA
teams and participation
by several Member States and international organizations.
Feedback from the participants 
and exercise evaluations show that they are worthwhile and
useful. The lessons
learned during these exercises help the  Agency improve the
emergency response
system, modify operational procedures, upgrade resources and
facilities, and correct
communication problems.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<A NAME="outlook"><h3>Outlook</h3></A>
         
The IAEA has taken its responsibilities under the international
conventions seriously. 
It has provided dedicated space, labor, and resources towards
developing a
comprehensive emergency response system. Team building and
training have resulted in
effective implementation of the system.
<p>         
With the increasing use of nuclear generated electricity
worldwide, an emergency 
response system is more important than ever before. Improvement
of communications
methods, coupled with the Agency's comprehensive exercises will
undoubtedly help
it to fulfil its appointed mission.
</blockquote>         
<blockquote>
<A NAME="ines"><h3>The International Nuclear Event Scale
(INES)</h3></A>
         
Although not a part of the emergency response system, INES is an
important communications tool 
used by the Agency and its Member States to categorize
radiological events. It creates a common understanding
of nuclear events among the nuclear community, the media, and the
public. It is
widely used within the nuclear community and among the 48 Member
States participating in the 
system to describe the magnitude of an incident. It is also used
to inform the
public promptly and consistently of the safety significance and
implication of
events reported at nuclear installations.
<p>         
The scale ranges from level zero for an incident having no safety
significance, to
level seven for a major accident with widespread health and
environmental consequences. On INES, for example, the TMI
accident would have rated as a level five; the on-site damage was
severe but the offsite 
release of radioactivity was minor. Chernobyl, which had
extensive off-site effects,
would have rated at the top of the scale, as a level seven.
<p>         
Though most nuclear events described using INES are below scale
or level one, they
often draw intensive media coverage. INES is proving very useful
in meeting this communication 
need, particularly considering the technical nature of nuclear
power and
the industry's specialized terminology.
<p>         
INES was designed by the IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency of
the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (NEA/OECD). An example
of its effectiveness is its 
international use during the nuclear incident at the St.
Petersburg nuclear power plant in the Russian Federation
in Spring 1992. Partly because the incident occurred at a
Chernobyl-type reactor, media
interest was high. The Agency received many inquiries from the
media, its Member
States and the public when news reports of the event started
coming in. The Russian
authorities used the scale in their prompt reporting of the
incident to the Agency and
INES became a commonly understood point of reference.
<p>         
Since its creation, INES has been used predominantly to describe
events at nuclear
power plants. Recently it was adapted to include potentially all
civil nuclear 
installations and transport incidents involving radioactive
materials.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a central component
of the world's commitment to control the spread of nuclear
weapons. Under agreements that States conclude with the IAEA,
Agency inspectors regularly visit nuclear facilities to verify
records that State authorities keep on the whereabouts of nuclear
material under their control, check IAEA-installed instruments
and surveillance equipment, and confirm physical inventories of
nuclear materials.  They then prepare detailed reports to the
State concerned and to the IAEA. Taken together, these and other
safeguards measures provide independent, international
verification that governments are living up to their commitments
to peaceful uses of nuclear technology.
<P>
The rapid development of nuclear energy and the growing
acceptance of IAEA safeguards are reflected in the volume of
safeguarded nuclear facilities and materials. Safeguards are
applied most intensively at facilities containing materials
(namely, plutonium and highly enriched uranium) that could be
used to manufacture a nuclear explosive. Inspection goals, which
take into account potential diversion paths and other technical
criteria, are formulated accordingly and give top priority to
safeguards at such facilities to verify the whereabouts of these
materials.  Overall, the IAEA, within the limits of its authority
and resources, has been able to improve attainment of inspection
goals throughout the entire civilian nuclear fuel cycle. The
levels provide assurance that no diversion for military purposes
has occurred within safeguarded activities.
<P>
The system consists of three major components:
<UL>
<LI><B>Accountancy</B>, i.e. reporting by States on the
whereabouts of the fissionable material under their control, on
stocks of fuel and of spent fuel, on the processing and
reprocessing of nuclear materials, etc.;
<P>
<LI><b>Containment and surveillance</B> techniques, such as seals
which allow conclusions that no material has disappeared, film
and TV-cameras which record any action occurring in a particular
area of a nuclear installation; and
<P>
<LI><B>Inspection</B> by Agency inspectors, checking instruments
and seals installed, verifying books, confirming physical
inventories of fuel or spent fuel.
</UL>
<P>
A basic feature of safeguards is that verification can take place
only on the basis of an agreement with the State in which the
inspection is to occur. The IAEA is not a supranational
organization with powers to impose its inspection on any State.
Acceptance of safeguards is a voluntary act. The State is not
giving up anything. It is issuing an invitation to inspection
that it finds to be in its own interest.
<P>
A great many IAEA agreements on safeguards envisage Agency
verification of all present and future fissionable material in a
given State.  They are referred to as  full-scope  safeguards
agreements. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT), and the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties,
contracting States are obliged to conclude agreements of this
scope with the Agency. Other safeguards agreements are concluded
to cover individual nuclear installations or individual
quantities of fissionable material normally as a result of an
agreement between a supplier and a recipient State. Lastly,
safeguards agreements have been worked out between the IAEA and
all five nuclear-weapon States, under which the latter invite the
Agency to apply safeguards to all or some of the peaceful nuclear
installations in their territory. <I><A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/program/safeguards/95tables/p77b.html">(Number of installations under safeguards or containing safeguarded material)</A></I>
<P>
To be credible, safeguards must be thorough and systematic. To
operate the safeguards system is a major responsibility for the
IAEA. Even after some 35 years of experience, new challenges
arise. Complicated installations are built that handle large
quantities of fissionable material which have to be safeguarded.
Verification techniques which were once satisfactory become
obsolete. Today the discussion of disarmament on many fronts has
opened up a much greater general readiness to accept verification
than existed at the time when safeguards were the first swallows
in the air.  IAEA safeguards will benefit both in cost efficiency
and credibility if they are allowed to keep up with the advances
made in other verification schemes.

<A NAME="note_a">
<H3>Inspectors:</H3></A>
The most visible components of the IAEA's safeguards systems are
the designated inspectors. Under agreed rights of access, they
regularly visit nuclear installations to verify records, check
instruments and surveillance equipment, and confirm physical
inventories of nuclear materials; they later prepare detailed
reports to the State concerned and to the IAEA. In Member States
of the European Union (EU), IAEA inspectors work with those of
the European Atomic Energy Commission (Euratom). In 1995, 2285
safeguards inspections were performed at 548 facilities and other
locations worldwide.
<A NAME="note_b"><P>
<H3>Containment and surveillance:</H3></A>
At many nuclear installations the IAEA uses surveillance cameras
and other electronic techniques to continuously and automatically
record activities in key places. Also used are specially designed
small metal seals which are fixed on the camera housings and
other IAEA equipment to prevent undetected tampering, or at
nuclear material storage areas or containers to safeguard the
contents.  Films and seals are regularly analyzed.  During 1995,
2638 surveillance films and 3807 video tapes were reviewed.  In
addition, 23,877 affixed seals were successfully verified by
Agency inspectors.
<A NAME="note_c"><P>
<H3>Verification of nuclear material:</H3></A>
On a regular basis, the IAEA receives and analyzes reports from
State authorities on the whereabouts of nuclear material under
their control. Reports cover stocks of nuclear fuel and the
export/import of safeguarded materials and equipment. Annually,
about one million data entries are processed and stored in IAEA
computers.
<A NAME="note_d"><P>
<H3>Field and laboratory testing:</H3></A>
The fact that nuclear materials have distinctive radioactive
characteristics makes it possible to detect and measure them;
consequently, they can be accounted for with a high degree of
accuracy. During inspections, IAEA inspectors conduct independent
measurements for on-the-spot confirmation of the enrichment level
and content of nuclear material. They also collect samples of
certain types of safeguarded nuclear materials that are later
tested and measured at the IAEA's Safeguards Analytical
Laboratory (SAL) near Vienna, Austria, or at some national
analytical laboratories. SAL and 18 laboratories in various parts
of the world form a co-operative network.
<A NAME="note_e"><P>
<H3>Agreements:</H3></A>
Legal agreements are the basis of IAEA safeguards. Many are
popularly known as  full-scope agreements because they extend to
all peaceful nuclear activities and materials in the State. These
mainly relate to the <A HREF="/worldatom/glance/legal/npttext.html">Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</A> (NPT) and also to the Treaty for the
Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco) and
to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty (the Rarotonga Treaty). Other safeguards
agreements
cover individual nuclear installations or individual quantities of nuclear material.  At
the end of 1995, 207 safeguards agreements were in force in 125
States (and Taiwan, China), compared with 200 agreements with 119 States (and Taiwan, China) at the end of 1994. This includes safeguards agreements
which were in force with 108 States pursuant to the NPT.  The
greater part of the safeguards activities was in those States
where safeguards were being applied pursuant to full scope
safeguards agreements (INFCIRC/153 type). Safeguards were also
being applied to facilities, equipment, and non-nuclear material
under agreements covering individual facilities (INFCIRC/66 Rev.2 type).
<A NAME="note_f"><P>
<H3>Safeguards in Non-Nuclear Weapon States:</H3></A>
As of 31 December 1995, 175 Non-Nuclear Weapon States (NNWS) had
adhered to the NPT in addition to China, France, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America 
and have thus entered into an international legal commitment not
to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in
any manner whatsoever.
<A NAME="note_g"><P>
<H3>Safeguards in Nuclear-Weapon States:</H3></A>
IAEA safeguards are applied in the nuclear-weapon States in a
limited number of facilities selected by the IAEA under so-called
voluntary-offer  agreements concluded with the Agency. 
<A NAME="note_h"><P>
<H3>Other safeguards:</H3></A>
There are a number of States not party to the NPT or the Treaty
of Tlatelolco which have nuclear facilities in operation or under
construction. In some of these States only some installations are
under safeguards and there are unsafeguarded nuclear facilities
known to be in operation or under construction.

<H3><I>Uses of Nuclear Technology</I></H3>
For well over half a century, nuclear technologies have been
contributing to a better quality of life in a wide variety of
fields:
<P>
<B><I>Energy:</I></B> Almost one-fifth of the world's electricity
is supplied
by nuclear power plants. In some countries, nuclear power
accounts for over 50% of the supply.
<P>
<B><I>Medicine:</I></B> Nuclear techniques are extensively used
in the
diagnosis and treatment of  life-threatening diseases like
cancer.
<P>
<B><I>Economic Development:</I></B> Nuclear applications are
enhancing the
productivity of industry and agriculture worldwide, and
contributing to scientific advancement in many areas. 
<P>
<B><I>Environmental Protection:</I></B> Isotopic techniques are
improving the
management of water resources and the biosphere, and helping to
control pollution. 
<P>
Like many natural and human-induced processes, however,
applications of atomic energy produce wastes - residues that must
be handled and disposed of effectively in order to protect human
health and the environment. 
<A NAME="note_a"><P>
<H3><I>What is radioactive waste?</I></H3></A>
 According to the IAEA, radioactive waste is any material that
contains a concentration of radionuclides greater than those
deemed safe by national authorities, and for which no use is
foreseen. Because of the wide variety of nuclear applications,
the amounts, types and even physical forms of radioactive wastes
vary considerably: some wastes can remain radioactive for
hundreds or thousands of years, while others may require storage
for only a short decay period prior to conventional disposal.
<P>
To facilitate communication and information exchange among its
Member States, the IAEA instituted a revised waste classification
system in 1994 that takes into account both qualitative and
quantitative criteria, including activity levels and heat
content. IAEA's three principal classes include exempt waste, low
and intermediate level waste, and high level waste. This
classification system is illustrated in Figure 1.
<P>
<B>Exempt Waste</B> (EW) contains such a low concentration of
radionuclides that it can be excluded from nuclear regulatory
control because radiological hazards are considered negligible.
<P>
<B>Low and Intermediate Level Waste</B> (LILW) contains enough
radioactive material that it requires actions to ensure the
protection of workers and the public for short or extended
periods of time. This class includes a range of materials from
just above exempt levels to those with sufficiently high levels
of radioactivity to require use of shielding containers and in
some cases periods for cooling off. LILW may be subdivided into
catagories according to the half-lives of the radionuclides it
contains, with "short lived" being less than 30 years and "long
lived" greater than 30 years.
<P>
<B>High Level Waste</B> (HLW) contains sufficiently high levels
of radioactive materials that a high degree of isolation from the
biosphere, normally in a geologic repository, is required for
long periods of time. Such wastes normally require both special
shielding and cooling off periods. 
<P>
Substantial amounts of radioactive waste are generated through
civilian applications of radionuclides in medicine, research and
industry.  But a major source of non-military waste is nuclear
power generation, including various steps in the nuclear fuel
cycle such as fuel fabrication, power plant operation,
reprocessing, and the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. 
<A NAME="note_b"><P>
<H3><I>How Much Waste Is Being Produced?</I></H3></A>
The generation of electricity from a typical 1000 MW(e) nuclear
power station, which would supply the needs of a city the size of
Amsterdam, produces approximately 300 m<SUP>3</SUP> of low and
intermediate
level waste per year and some 30 tonnes of high level solid
packed waste per year. See Figure 2.
<P>
By way of comparison a 1000 MW(e) coal plant produces some
300,000 tonnes of ash alone per year, containing among other
things radioactive material and heavy metals which end up in
landfill sites and in the atmosphere. 
<P>
Nuclear power generation facilities produce about 200,000
m<SUP>3</SUP> of
LILW and 10,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of HLW (including spent fuel
designated as
waste) each year worldwide. <I><A HREF="sources.html">(Sources of
Radioactive Waste)</A></I>
<A NAME="note_c"><P>
<H3><I>Responsible Management of Wastes</I></H3></A>
Radioactive Waste Management (RWM) incorporates all
administrative, operational and safety-related activities that
are involved in the treatment, conditioning, storage and disposal
of all categories of radioactive wastes, including
transportation. While RWM methods vary from country to country,
the primary objective is the same - protect people and the
environment from hazards arising from radioactive waste and
effluents, both for the present and the future. The IAEA promotes
a "systems approach" to RWM, that is, a logical, integrated
strategy for determining the requirements, technologies,
resources and impacts of each element of a waste management
system. 
<P>
<B>Management and disposal of LILW (short lived)</B>
<P>
These types of wastes are often treated (to achieve volume
reduction) and/or conditioned (waste immobilization) prior to
disposal. A variety of safe and effective treatment  options are
available including chemical precipitation, incineration and
compaction. These may be followed by immobilization in materials
such as concrete, bitumen, or polymers. 
<P>
Disposal methods for treated and conditioned wastes are typically
in shallow concrete-lined trenches or engineered surface
structures. Safe near surface disposal of LILW has been practiced
in many countries for over 30 years. The isolation period is
usually up to 300 years, thus facilitating institutional and
administrative control of the disposal site.
<P>
Disposal methods for low and intermediate level wastes vary in
IAEA Member States. The two main options currently employed or
planned by countries are:
<P>
<OL>
<B><I><LI>near surface disposal facilities; and 
<LI>geologic repositories.</I></B>
</OL>
<P> 
Worldwide, about 40 near surface disposal facilites have been
safely operating during the past 35 years, and an additional 30
facilities are expected to be in operation over the coming 15
years. 
<P>
<B>Management and Disposal of LILW (long lived)</B>
<P>
Some LILW contains long lived radionuclides in quantities that
require a high degree of isolation from the biosphere. This is
typically provided by disposal in geologic formations at a depth
of several hundred meters. Such wastes remain in storage pending
ultimate disposal.
<P>
<B>Management and disposal of HLW and spent fuel</B>
<P>
Most countries operating nuclear power plants also have or are
developing facilities for managing HLW. Although national
strategies differ, the approach and methodologies are often quite
similar, thus creating a sound basis for information exchange and
other co-operative activities. 
<P>
Not all countries with spent fuel, either from nuclear power
reactors or from research reactors, have active disposal
programmes mainly because they plan to return spent fuel to a
foreign supplier. Typically, these countries must provide interim
storage for 5-10 years prior to returning the spent fuel. 
<P>
Once spent fuel has been removed from a nuclear reactor, it is
placed in interim storage at the reactor site. Afterwards, it may
be handled in two different manners: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Placed in storage facilities away from the reactor for 5 to
100 years, conditioned after an appropriate decay period, then
stored before final disposal in a geologic repository; or
<P>
<LI>Reprocessed after away-from-reactor storage. The resulting
liquid HLW is then immobilized in a stable matrix (i.e.
borosilicate glass), and then stored until final disposal in a
geologic repository. 
</OL>
<P>Regardless of which option is selected, there is broad
scientific
agreement that deep geologic disposal using a system of
engineered and natural barriers to isolate the waste is the best 
method. 
<P>
The first geological repositories for high level and long lived
wastes are expected to begin operation around 2010. About 20 more
repositories are projected to be commissioned by the end of 2030.
(see figure 3). The principal features of the geological
repository concept is to place packaged waste in a stable
formation several hundred meters below the surface with
engineered barriers around and/or between the waste packages and
the surrounding rock.
<A NAME="note_d"><P>
<H3><I>IAEA's Role in Radioactive Waste Management</I></H3></A>

The IAEA has fostered international co-operation in the waste
management field since it was established in 1957. Reflecting the
very diverse range of interests among its Member States, the
IAEA's waste management programme encompasses activities which
benefit Member States regardless of their degree of
sophistication in the uses of nuclear energy.
<P>
IAEA's waste management programme concentrates on several key
activities:
<P>
<DL>
<DD> - Collecting, reviewing and publishing up-to-date scientific
and
technical information.
<P>
<DD> - Providing direct services, particularly to developing
Member
States and the newly independent states of the former Soviet
Union, through technical assistance, training, and other
programmes to strengthen national infrastructures, including the
demonstration of waste management techniques.
<P>
<DD> - Fostering and co-ordinating research and development
through
co-ordinated research programmes.
<P>
<DD> - Establishing safety standards for the management and
disposal
of wastes by building international consensus.
<P>
<DD> - Implementing international codes of practice and safety
conventions.
<P>
<DD> - Providing advisory and peer review services for both
developed
and developing countries.
<P>
<DD> - Providing a forum for the dissemination and exchange
of information at international conferences, symposia and
seminars including the promotion of education, public information
and training.
<P>
<DD> - Developing and implementing special projects, including
assessment of the environmental and radiological impacts of waste
disposal.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>N</B></FONT>uclear energy saves lives.  As one
of the tools used
in the
human health area, nuclear energy can be harnessed and used in
a variety of techniques to prevent, diagnose, and treat
disease.
<P>
Techniques using nuclear energy in medical sciences have the
unique ability to show bodily functions across time - as a
film shows picture frames one after the other - quickly and
accurately.  The significance of this advantage is clear when
one realizes that one out of every three patients attending a
hospital in an industrialized nation benefits from some type
of nuclear procedure.
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World
Health Organization (WHO) play a key role in the development
and transfer of nuclear techniques, experience, and technical
know-how to Member States - particularly developing countries.
<A NAME="methods"></BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote>
<H3><I>Diagnostic methods</I></H3></A>
Worldwide, more than half of the total number of
cancer cases
are in developing countries, the WHO estimates.  Some 75% of
these patients have been found to be incurable at the time of
diagnosis.  These statistics are changing due to two distinct
diagnostic techniques - in vivo and in vitro.  These methods
determine the presence of a disease and the extent to which it
has invaded the body and can help to determine the best means
of treatment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<B><I>In vivo</I> techniques</B>
<P>
In vivo diagnostic techniques are based on an approach called
the "tracer" principle.  A radionuclide - in a carefully
chosen chemical form and duration of being radioactive called
a radiopharmaceutical - is administered to the patient to
trace a specific physiological phenomenon by means of a
special detector, often a gamma camera, placed outside the
body.  The radiopharmaceutical can be designed to seek out
only desired tissues or organs, such as the lungs.  By
directing radiation only where it is needed, rather than
randomly, modern techniques increase the health benefits
available through nuclear applications.
<P>
Some 100-300 available radiopharmaceuticals mostly organic in
nature and labeled with artificial radionuclides, such as
indium-111 and gallium-67, are used to study organs and
tissues without disturbing them.  Nuclear diagnostic methods
expose the patient to a small radiation dose.  This is
minimized further through the use of more short-lived
radioisotopes, such as technetium-99m, which decay to stable
form within hours.
<P>
The radiopharmaceutical is administered to the patient,
usually by intravenous injection, oral ingestion, or
inhalation.  Through the use of a special detecting device, a
gamma camera, it is observed as it travels throughout the body
where it is specifically concentrated in a given tissue or
organ.  A gamma camera detects photons escaping the body,
creating a two-dimensional image with the help of a computer
and a video display unit.  These images depict the regional
quality of a specific function in a given organ.  This process
is called planar imaging or static scintigraphy.
<P>
These images, when received in a fast successive fashion,
create a dynamic study of the radiopharmaceutical behavior,
revealing such detailed functional information as the emptying
of the stomach, the breathing process in the lungs, or the
pumping activity of the heart.

<P>
Such procedures may, like an X-ray, provide a picture of some
particular body organ or part of it.  The essential difference
is that in nuclear medicine, the picture obtained provides a
measure of the activity of a specific physiological or
biochemical function in the body, while an X-ray image depicts
anatomical details.
<P>
With the increased power of modern computers, clinical images
can be acquired at multiple angels, creating a replica of the
body's cross-section, a technique called computerized
tomography (CT).  The two most advanced forms using
radionuclides are single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) and position emission tomography (PET).
<P>
<B>SPECT</B> uses a rotating gamma camera to obtain images from
multiple angles of the distribution of a conventional gamma
emitting radiopharmaceutical within an organ.  This technique
is particularly valuable because of its unique ability to
locate the exact position of a physiological abnormality in
the body through a series of computer-generated bidimensional
slices of the organ, from which three-dimensional pictures of
the organ can be reconstructed.
<P>
PET, valuable in the detection and management of cancer,
employs one or several rings of stationary detectors around the
patient's body to detect very strong diverging gamma-rays (511
keV) produced by the interactions of positrons (emitted by a
previously administered radionuclide) with the free electrons
within the body.  This information is then processed to create
body slices similar to those obtained by SPECT.  PET has the
unique ability to depict regional biochemical processes within
the body and can demonstrate the biochemical foundation of
neurological disorders and mental diseases.
</blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><I>In vitro</I> techniques</B>
<P>
The second method of diagnosis, in vitro, allows clinical
diagnosis without the patient being exposed to radiation.  In
fact, the patient need not even be present.  A blood sample
taken from the patient is sent to the laboratory and examined
through nuclear techniques such as radioimmunoassay (RIA), or
immunoradiometric assay. (IRMA).
<P>
These tests measure precisely previous and current exposure to
infection by assessing antibodies.  RIA is also used to
measure substances such as hormones, vitamins, and drugs in
the body fluids in the detection of nutritional and
endocrinological disorders and to track bacterial and
parasitical infections such as tuberculosis and malaria. 
Supported through IAEA co-ordinated research programmes, some
500 hospitals, universities, and laboratories in the
developing world alone are engaged in RIA on some scale and
the numbers are increasingly annually.
<P>
Another application of RIA and IRMA techniques includes the
detection of tumour markers, which are specific substances
secreted by many, but not all, tumours and can indicate the
presence of malignancy.  Nearly two dozen tumours markers are
available.  Despite the increased accuracy, as well as cost
and convenience factors, tumour markers remain complementary
to other diagnostic procedures in the detection of cancer
during its early stages, but they are especially valuable in
monitoring the progress of disease and the effects of
treatment.
<A NAME="disease"></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<H3><I>Treatment of disease</I></H3></A>

Radiation is widely used in the treatment of diseases, such as
hyperthyroidism and cancer.  To control the disease, or to
prevent recurrence through spreading of loose cancerous cells
which can lead to secondary cancer, all malignant cells in a
tumour must be completely destroyed.
<P>
Radiotherapy accomplishes this by focusing radiation to a
specific tumour, most often using cobalt-60 gamma rays, or
high-LET (linear energy transfer) systems, as energy sources.
<P>
The radiation source can have either no contact with the
tumour, an external treatment technique called teletherapy, or
can be in direct or immediate contact with the tumour, a
technique called brachytherapy.  Brachytherapy, applied in
special cancer types - such as cancer of the cervix of the
head and neck - provides protection against radiation for
delicate, healthy organs or tissues by directing radiation
only to a specific site.  Brachytherapy can not only treat
but, in particular cases, can also cure many patients.
<P>
Being effective, simple to operate, and relatively
inexpensive, brachytherapy is helping to save the lives of
hundreds of cervical cancer patients in Egypt alone through
work supported by the IAEA, the WHO, and the Government of
Italy.
<P>
Only recently developed, another procedure using radiolabelled
monoclonal antibodies is valuable in the treatment of cancer. 
Monoclonal antibodies, which are disease fighting proteins,
seek out and bind to a specific tissue or cancer cell.  A
radionuclide, chemically bonded to these monoclonal
antibodies, can deliver a large dose of radiation to a
specific area without affecting the surrounding tissue.

<B>Reduction and elimination of pain</B>
<P>
Nuclear medicine serves another therapeutic function--namely, the
reduction of pain. Many patients with bone cancer or cancer that
has spread to the bones suffer intolerable pain. Radiotherapy can
be administered to palliate the pain, replacing
pain-killing drugs which eventually lose their effectiveness.
<P>         
Physicians can administer a bone-seeking compound labelled with a
high-LET radiation emitter. Using this nuclear technique, the
level of pain is quickly lowered, or totally eliminated,
providing almost instant relief to the patient.
<P>
<B>Sterilization of medical devices</B>
<P>         
Medical instruments used in diagnosing or treating a patient--
especially those likely to penetrate the protective skin
barrier--must be totally free of germs. Inadvertent use of an
unsterile medical device, such as a hypodermic syringe and
needle, could transmit infection resulting in a cross-infection
or, in the worst case, a fatality; in either case, contradicting
the goal of medicine.
<P>         
Gamma rays from cobalt-60 are used to sterilize instruments that
cannot be sterilized through other methods, and at a much lower
health risk. Some 150 facilities located in 44 countries
worldwide provide sterile medical devices in even the most remote
areas of the world.
<P>         
<B>Dosimetry</B>
<P>         
Application of accurate doses, determined for each patient
through careful evaluation and calculations, is of utmost
importance for the effectiveness of the application of radiation.
Therefore, dosimetry, while not a diagnostic or treatment method,
also plays an important role in the application of radionuclides
and radiotherapy. The IAEA--in co-operation with WHO--coordinates
a global network of Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories  
(SSDLs) located in 51 Member States to improve dosimetric
accuracy, particularly in radiation therapy.
<P>         
These laboratories maintain the link between the users of
radiation and an international measurement system calibrating the
dosimeters of radiotherapy centres. Comparisons are performed for
SSDLs testing the accuracy of their"secondary standard"      
dosimeters to ensure world wide unification of measurements.
<P>         
The accuracy and the proper use of dosimeters of radiotherapy
centres are also tested through the IAEA/WHO postal dosimetry
service using thermoluminescent dosimeters. Since 1969, about
2000 tests were performed involving more that 700 radiotherapy
centres from 89 countries.
<A NAME="future"></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><I>Future plans and developments</I></H3></A>

The Agency has helped to raise the level of health-care in Member
States through the transfer of state-of-the-art nuclear
techniques, especially in less developed countries, where
available facilities are either absent or grossly inadequate. The
Agency conducts training courses, offers fellowships, and 
provides technical assistance and co-operation to optimize the
manpower and equipment already available.
<P>         
Future plans are aimed at the introduction of simpler techniques
and specialized instruments which many laboratories in IAEA
Member States lack. These will help lower expenses and increase
availability of nuclear techniques in medicine.
<P>         
As nuclear techniques become easier to use and therefore
applicable universally, the need for appropriate and practical
technology for health care and research remains an ever-changing
challenge to be met by the IAEA.

<B><I>Power and Progress</I></B>
<P>         
Electricity consumption is practically synonymous with modern
life in the industrialized world. Our communications, transport,
food supplies, and most amenities of contemporary homes, offices
and factories depend on a reliable supply of electrical power.
<P>         
As more countries industrialize, ever greater amounts of power
are consumed. Worldwide energy consumption has multiplied
twenty-five fold since the last century. Average per capita
consumption of electricity is about ten times higher in
industrial countries than in the developing world.
<P>         
But with the economies in many developing nations now expanding
rapidly, electricity demand in the "South" is expected to grow at
over 5% annually during the next fifteen years. Meeting this
demand will require a dramatic rise in electricity output.
<A NAME="price"><P>         
<B><I>The Price of Power</I></B></A>
<P>         
The generation of electric power around the world remains largely
dependent on the burning of fossil fuels--oil, gas and
coal--which are heavily polluting. One of the most serious
threats to the global environment comes from such pollution--the
rapidly rising emissions of so-called "greenhouse" gases,
especially carbon dioxide(CO<SUB>2</SUB>) which many scientists
believe is principally responsible for global warming.
<P>
Indeed, the newest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) warns that unless the world community takes
immediate and drastic steps to stabilize and reduce the emissions
of such heat-trapping gases, global temperatures may rise by at
least 1.5 degrees centigrade by the middle of the next century--a
rate of increase that would be comparable to the warming that
ended the last Ice Age, and with perhaps equally profound effects
on sea levels and climate. Among the most alarming predictions
of the report: entire ecosystems could vanish as rainfall and
temperature patterns shift; huge swaths of densely populated land
could be inundated by rising seas; and droughts, floods and
storms could become more severe.
<P>         
While the IPCC may intend this as a worse-case scenario, there
is a widespread consensus among scientists that rising volumes of
green-house gas emissions combined with other noxious forms of
air pollution represent a sizeable threat to both global
ecological stability and human health.
<A NAME="done"><P>         
<B><I>Is Anything Being Done?</I></B></A>
<P>        
When representatives from around the world gathered in Brazil at
the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development, they agreed in principle to a set of proposals to
slow emissions of greenhouse gases. The richer developed
countries committed themselves to holding atmospheric emissions
to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But progress since the Earth
Summit has been uneven and in some cases negligible. Emission
rates of carbon dioxide have slowed only marginally in some
industrialized countries--mainly due to the slowing down
of their economies--and in most developing countries have
increased significantly owing to expanding energy demand and
reliance on polluting fossil fuels.
<P>
Changes in the patterns of resource consumption are also unlikely
to result from fossil fuels becoming scarcer or more expensive.
According to the World Resources Institute, fossil fuel
production and consumption are continuing to rise almost
everywhere. And proven reserves of petroleum, natural gas and
coal are currently estimated to cover the demand of the next 40,
60 and some 230 years respectively. Over the next two decades,
India plans to treble and China to double the consumption of coal
for electricity consumption.
<P>         
In an effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, some
countries are turning to natural gas, which is economically
competitive with oil and coal. However, natural gas consumption
also produces carbon dioxide (though less than coal or oil) and,
moreover, methane leakages from extraction, transmission and
distribution of natural gas are globally in the 5 to 10 % range,
a level which more than offsets the gains from lower
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.
<P>         
Given the prospects of ever rising consumption of fossil fuels
for electricity production and an increasing threat to the global
environment, nuclear power can play an important part for
countries that need increasing energy supplies without increasing
greenhouse gas emissions.
<A NAME="option"><P>         
<B><I>The Nuclear Option</I></B></A>
<P>         
Nuclear power plants already provide about 17% of the world's
total supply of electricity. They produce practically no carbon
dioxide(CO<SUB>2</SUB>), sulphur dioxide(SO<SUB>2</SUB>) or
nitrogen oxide(NO<SUB>x</SUB>)
emissions. At least five countries, including France, Sweden and
Belgium, rely on nuclear power for more than 50% of their total
electrical supplies. Another ten countries, including Finland,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Spain and Switzerland rely on nuclear
plants to provide 30% or more of their total supplies. And a
large number of developing nations, including Argentina, Brazil, 
China, India, Mexico and Pakistan, have operational nuclear power
plants. Worldwide there are more than 430 reactors currently in
operation producing about as much electricity as obtained from
hydropower.
<A NAME="greenhouse"><P>         
<B><I>Avoiding Greenhouse Emissions</I></B></A>
<P>         
The increasing use of nuclear power since the 1960s, combined
with steady increases in hydropower, have helped curb worldwide
carbon dioxide output. If the electric energy generated worldwide
by nuclear power each year were produced instead by coal-powered
plants, there would be additional emissions of 1,600 million
tonnes of CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
<P>         
Put another way: if the world were not employing nuclear power
today, global carbon dioxide emissions would be at least 8
percent greater every year.
<P>         
Nuclear power is more environmentally friendly from a waste
management perspective as well. In addition to the large
quantities of greenhouse gases and sulfuric acid generated, a
1000MW(e) coal-burning plant produces some 300,000 tonnes of ash
per year, containing among other things radioactive material and
heavy metals which end up in landfill sites and in the
atmosphere. On the other hand, the radioactive waste arising from
a nuclear plant of the same capacity amounts only to some 800
tonnes of low and medium level waste, and some 30 tonnes of high
level waste per year, which can be isolated from the biosphere.
<P>         
While a global trend toward reducing the amounts of
CO<SUB>2</SUB> produced for each unit of energy consumed has been
espoused by governments, relatively few countries have succeeded
in reducing output of greenhouse gases through a switch to
non-fossil fuels. France, Japan, India, Republic of Korea and
Sweden have all markedly reduced their CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
per unit of energy output by up to 30 percent over the past 30
years. Countries with no nuclear power (such as Ireland, Italy
and Denmark) have seen their energy related emissions drop by
less than 10 percent.
<A NAME="future"><P>         
<B><I>The Energy Future: Striking a Balance</I></B></A>
<P>       
The combination of population growth, economic development and
industrialization around the world means global energy
consumption will continue to grow. These trends, together with
the continuing reliance on fossil fuels for primary energy, also
mean that worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases will continue
to rise. Even with stringent reduction measures, current
projections do not show a leveling off of emissions until about
2050.
<P>         
It is within this broader environmental context that nuclear
power is being considered by some governments and power
generating utilities, especially in the developing world. Through
its "Decades" programme the IAEA is working together with many of
these countries to carry out comprehensive energy planning
through comparative assessment of energy sources and their
respective impacts on health and environment.
<P>         
Should the nuclear option be found viable, the IAEA can, if
desired, assist Member States in carefully planning
implementation, including help in the establishment of adequate
industrial and organizational infrastructures and personnel
training, and ensuring efficient and safe operation and
maintenance of nuclear power facilities.
<A NAME="air"><P>         
<B><I>Clearing the Air</I></B></A>
<P>         
In many industrialized countries, abroad sector of public opinion
remains hesitant or opposed to an increased use of nuclear power,
or even a continuation at present levels. Such opposition hinges
on three factors: fear of accidents; fear of long-lived
radioactive wastes; and fear that the use of nuclear power will
contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<P>         
The expansion of nuclear power, however, has not led to
proliferation of nuclear weapons. To the contrary, there has been
a continuous increase in the number of countries committing
themselves to non-proliferation.
<P>         
While public and media remain sensitive to every minor
disturbance in nuclear installations, nuclear power plants in
fact generally allow great reliability and resilience. Nuclear
power plants have an accumulated operating experience of nearly
7,200 reactor-years. The lessons learned have been used to make
changes in operational design and engineering to achieve
increased reliability and safety.
<P>         
Like every other source of energy, nuclear power generates wastes
that must be managed and disposed of properly. The technologies
for safe disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive
wastes are well proven and extensively utilized in IAEA Member
States. Long term storage of high-level wastes like spent fuel
under safe conditions is technically achievable, but is
confronted by political obstacles that governments must overcome.

Many countries are urgently working to identify sites, or to
construct and complete facilities for long-term disposal of high
level wastes. Such deep underground facilities will have to meet
the highest environmental, geological and human safety standards.
The nuclear community is conscious of its responsibilities, and
collectively invests more on safety measures than any other
comparable industry.

<B>General description of the scale</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="scale.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">The International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) is a tool to promptly and consistently
communicate to the public the safety significance of reported events at nuclear installations.
By putting events into proper perspective, the Scale can ease common understanding among
the nuclear community, the media, and the public. It was designed by an international
group of experts convened jointly by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the
Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. The group was guided in its work by the findings of a series of international
meetings held to discuss general principles underlying such a scale. The Scale also reflects
the experience gained from the use of similar scales in France and Japan as well as from
consideration of possible scales in several other countries.
<P>         
Initially applied for a trial period to classify events at nuclear power plants, 32 countries
participated in the trial and international agencies and user countries monitored progress. The
Scale operated successfully and now has been made available for formal adoption by each
country. The Scale also has been extended and adapted to enable it to be applied to all
nuclear installations associated with the civil nuclear industry and to any events occurring
during the transport of radioactive materials to and from those facilities.
<P>
Events are classified on the Scale at seven levels. Their descriptors and criteria are shown
opposite with examples of the classification of nuclear events which have occurred in the past
at nuclear installations. The lower levels (1-3) are termed incidents, and the upper levels (4-7)
accidents. Events which have no safety significance are classified as level 0/
below scale and are termed deviations. Events which have no safety relevance are termed out
of scale.
<P>
<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">            
The structure of the Scale is shown opposite, in the form of a matrix with key words. The
words used are not intended to be precise or definitive. Each criterion is defined in detail
within an <B>INES Users' Manual</B>. Events are considered in terms of three safety
attributes or criteria represented by each of the columns: off-site impact, on-site impact, and
defence in depth degradation.
<P>         
The second column in the matrix relates to events resulting in off-site releases of
radioactivity. Since this is the only consequence having a direct effect on the public, such
releases are understandably of particular concern. Thus, the lowest point in this column
represents a release giving the most exposed person off-site an estimated radiation dose
numerically equivalent to about one-tenth of the annual dose limit for the public; this is
classified as level 3. Such a dose is also typically about one-tenth of the average annual dose
received from natural background radiation. The highest level is a major nuclear accident with
widespread health and environmental consequences.
<P>         
The third column considers the on-site impact of the event. This category covers a range from
level 2 (contamination and/or overexposure of a worker) to level 5 (severe plant damage such
as a core melt).          
<P>
All nuclear facilities are designed so that a succession of safety
layers act to prevent major on-site or off-site impact and the extent of the safety layers
provided generally will be commensurate with the potential for on and off-site impact. These
safety layers must all fail before substantial off-site or on-site consequences occur. The
provision of these safety layers is termed "defence in depth". The fourth column of the matrix
relates to incidents at nuclear installations or during the transportation of radioactive
materials in which these defence in depth provisions have been degraded. This column spans
the incident levels 1-3.          
<P>
An event which has characteristics represented by more than one
criterion is always classified at the highest level according to any one
 criterion.
<A NAME="using"><P>
 <B>Using the Scale</B>
<P>
<UL></A>
<LI>Although the Scale is designed for prompt use following an event,
there will be occasions when a longer time-scale is required to understand
and rate the consequences of an event. In these rare circumstances, a
provisional rating will be given with confirmation at a later date. It is also
possible that as a result of further information, an event may require
reclassification.
<P>         
<LI>If a radiological emergency were to occur in the vicinity of a nuclear
installation or during the transport of radioactive materials, existing
national emergency planning arrangements would be implemented. The
Scale should not be used as part of the formal emergency arrangements.
<P>         
<LI>Although the same scale is used for all installations, it is physically
impossible for events to occur which involve the release to the environment
of considerable quantities of radioactive material at some types of installation. For these
installations, the upper levels of the scale would not be
applicable. These include research reactors, unirradiated nuclear fuel
treatment facilities, and waste storage sites.
<P>         
<LI>Industrial accidents or other events which are not related to nuclear
or radiological operations are not classified and are termed "out of scale".
For example, although events associated with a turbine or generator can
affect safety related equipment, faults affecting only the availability of a
turbine or generator would be classified as out of scale. Similarly, events
such as fires are to be considered out of scale when they do not involve
any possible radiological hazard and do not affect the safety layers.
<P>         
<LI>The Scale is not appropriate as the basis for selecting events for
feedback of operational experience, as important lessons can often be
learnt from events of relatively minor significance.
<P>         
<LI>It is not appropriate to use the Scale to compare safety performance
among countries. Each country has different arrangements for reporting
minor events to the public, and it is difficult to ensure precise international
consistency in rating events at the boundary between level 0 and level 1.
The statistically small number of such events, with variability from year to
year, makes it difficult to provide meaningful international comparisons.
<P>         
<LI>Although broadly comparable, nuclear and radiological safety
criteria and the terminology used to describe them vary from country to
country. The INES has been designed to take account of this fact.

<B>Examples of classified nuclear events</B>
<P>
<UL></A>
<LI>The 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Soviet Union (now in the Ukraine) had widespread environmental and
human health effects. It is thus classified as Level 7.
<P>         
<LI>The 1957 accident at the Kyshtym reprocessing plant in the Soviet
Union (now in Russia) led to a large off-site release. Emergency measures
including evacuation of the population were taken to limit serious health
effects. Based on the off-site impact of this event it is classified as Level 6.
<P>         
<LI>The 1957 accident at the air-cooled graphite reactor pile at
Windscale (now Sellafield) facility in the United Kingdom involved an         external release
of radioactive fission products. Based on the off-site
impact, it is classified as Level 5.
<P>         
<LI>The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in the United States resulted
in a severely damaged reactor core. The off-site release of radioactivity was
very limited. The event is classified as Level 5, based on the on-site impact.
<P>         
<LI>The 1973 accident at the Windscale reprocessing plant in the
United Kingdom (now Sellafield) involved a release of radioactive material
into a plant operating area as a result of an exothermic reaction in a
process vessel. It is classified as Level 4, based on the on-site impact.
<P>         
<LI>The 1980 accident at the Saint-Laurent nuclear power plant in
France resulted in partial damage to the reactor core, but there was no
external release of radioactivity. It is classified as Level 4, based on the
on-site impact.
<P>         
<LI>The 1983 accident at the RA-2 critical assembly in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, an accidental power excursion due to nonobservance of safety
rules during a core modification sequence, resulted in the death of the
operator, who was probably 3 or 4 metres away. Assessments of the doses
absorbed by the victim indicate 21 Gy for the gamma dose together with
22 Gy for the neutron dose. The event is classified as Level 4, based on
the on-site impact.
<P>         
<LI>The 1989 incident at the Vandellos nuclear power plant in Spain did
not result in an external release of radioactivity, nor was there damage to
the reactor core or contamination on site. However, the damage to the
plant's safety systems due to fire degraded the defence-in-depth significantly. The event is
classified as Level 3, based on the defence-in-depth
criterion.
<P>         
<LI>The vast majority of reported events are found to be below Level 3.
Although no examples of these events are given here, countries using the
Scale may individually wish to provide examples of events at these lower
levels.

<HR NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and its Member
States support hundreds of development projects involving nuclear
science and technology. Technical experts are sent to research
centres and laboratories as advisers or lecturers; group and
individual training is conducted in conjunction with national and
regional host institutes; and equipment is supplied for research
and technical projects in the field.
<P>         
Through these and other avenues, the tools, skills, and
experience that are vital for the safe development of nuclear
energy and science are transferred to where they are needed.
<P>       
Using the IAEA as a base for technical co-operation, many
countries are harvesting the benefits of nuclear energy for their
development. The Agency provides assistance in numerous fields
where nuclear techniques offer advantages over others or can
usefully supplement them.
<P>         
Some activities relate to the generation of electricity by
nuclear reactors. However, the scope of the technical
co-operation programme is much broader, encompassing fields such
as health, agriculture, industry, hydrology, radiation
protection, environmental monitoring, and energy--all areas that
are especially relevant to developing countries.
<P>         
The primary objective of IAEA technical co-operation is to assist
Member States in achieving self-reliance in nuclear science and
technology by strengthening human resources and institutions.
<P>         
The greatest challenge facing many of the IAEA Member States is
the adequate supply of food. Careful husbanding of water and
soil, together with the use of state-of-the-art techniques to get
the most out of natural resources, while still maintaining a
healthy environment, are essential for their economic and social
development.
<P>         
Nuclear techniques are used to help meet these challenges, and
the IAEA technical co-operation programme seeks to assure that
they are available to its Member States. Techniques using
radiation and isotopes are used to improve crop and animal      
production in areas such as soil fertility, plant breeding,
animal health, insect and pest control, pesticide use, and food
preservation.
<P>         
Much work is carried out by the Agency together with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) through the Joint FAO/IAEA
Division of nuclear techniques in food and agriculture. Founded
in 1964, the division works to solve practical problems related
to agricultural production and food protection in the developing
world.
<A NAME="note_a">
<H3>        
Soil fertility, irrigation, and crop production</A>
</H3>

Nitrogen fertilizers are used widely to increase agricultural
production. Many fertilizers harm the environment and lead to
pollution of water supplies if they are used excessively or
inappropriately. A nuclear technique, which uses a stable
nitrogen isotope as a tracer, helps determine the best form,
timing, and placement of fertilizers to avoid waste and to reduce
its movement in the environment. Others are used to detect,
measure, and track fertilizer supplied nutrients in soil and
plants, determine the availability of soil moisture, and study
the natural process of nitrogen fixation by certain plants, thus
considerably reducing fertilizer costs, while increasing plant
protein.
<P>         
Sustainable agricultural production requires an adequate supply
of water in soils. Work in this area helps irrigation specialists
and others to choose the most appropriate option that will
increase or improve the way water resources are used. Results of
co-ordinated research programmes where neutron moisture gauges
are used extensively show that traditional irrigation methods
can be improved to cut total water use by 40%. Water can thus be
diverted to irrigate additional areas. Different practices to
increase water conservation in rainfed areas have been tested
that have resulted in immediate practical application.
<A NAME="note_b">
<H3>Plant breeding and genetics</H3></A>
Nuclear techniques--sometimes in combination with other
biotechnology--can be used to develop new strains of important
food crops. These techniques have yielded new varieties of many
different crop species, such as rice, wheat, and soybean. Such
varieties may have a better resistance to disease, be of a
higher product quality, or have a higher yield. Worldwide, more
than 1500 mutant cultivars of crop plants and ornamental plants
have been released to growers in the past 30 years. Eight percent
of agricultural land in China, for example, is planted with
mutants of rice, wheat, com, and cotton.
<P>         
The Agency provides assistance to Member States in the proper
application of mutation breeding techniques in highly diversified
plant breeding programmes. Research contracts and agreements
focus on the advancement of mutation breeding technology
particularly to improve root and tuber crops, oil seed crops, and
cereals, and to improve resistance to disease.
<A NAME="note_c">
<H3>Animal production and health</H3></A>
         
Sensitive techniques based on the use of radioactive "tracers"
are used to examine methods of improving animal production and
health. Such techniques are used in studies of cattle, buffalo,
sheep, and goat reproduction in developing countries. For
example, the Agency carries out work on the productivity of
domestic buffalo in Asia and on sheep and goats in Africa and
Asia. Similar methods are used to determine whether animals are
infected with disease-causing agents, an approach which is now
being used widely in veterinary centres in many parts of the
world to diagnose debilitating diseases and monitor control
methods.
<P>         
Co-ordinated research programmes are carried out on the
development of feeding strategies for livestock in areas where
the availability and quality of feed fluctuates greatly between
seasons; the use of nuclear techniques to improve the
reproductive efficiency and diagnosis of diseases in Asian
livestock; seromonitoring of rinderpest vaccination in Africa;
improved methods for diagnosing animal diseases in Latin America;
and improved methods to diagnose and control trypanosomiasis in
cattle and camels in Africa.
<P>         
To make these techniques easier to use in the field, the Agency
produces standardized kits in its laboratory in Seibersdorf and
distributes them worldwide. For example, under the Pan-African
Rinderpest Campaign, appropriate kits are sent regularly to l7
African countries so that veterinarians can monitor accurately
the progress of their vaccination programmes. Additionally, more
than 500 000 assay units for progesterone determination are sent
to animal production research institutes to assist in the
assessment of the reproductive status of livestock species and
hence improve breeding programmes.
<A NAME="note_d">
<H3>Insect and pest control</H3></A>
         
Radiation can be used to sexually sterilize insects. When insects
that are mass-reared and sterilized in laboratories are released
in the wild population, the female mates of sterilized males will
not produce offspring. This method, called the Sterile Insect
Technique (SIT), has been used successfully to control or
eradicate dangerous insects and pests which account for
substantial losses in food supplies and animal production.
<P>         
The technique has been further developed al the IAEA's
Seibersdorf Laboratories. Mass rearing facilities for fruit flies
and tsetse flies using methods developed at the Laboratories,
have been built in a number of countries. The most successful SIT
campaign eradicated the New World Screwworm from the southern
United States, most of Mexico, as well as the islands of Puerto
Rico and Cura&ccedil;ao. The successful eradication is saving
livestock owners more than US$ 378 million each year in the USA
alone. The SIT will be the eradication component in the recently
initiated New World Screwworm Eradication Programme in North
Africa. It also has been used in projects to successfully
eradicate the Mediterranean fruitfly in Mexico and against
various species of tsetse fly in Nigeria.
<A NAME="note_e">

<H3>Agrochemicals and residues</H3></A>
        
The controlled release overtime of active pesticide compounds can
reduce the quantities used by farmers, and thus minimize damage
to the ecosystem. Labelling techniques using radioactive atoms
are a key area of research in agrochemicals and residues. These
techniques track the residues of pesticides in the environment
and greatly facilitate research on studying controlled release of
pesticides. Ecosystems receiving attention are the rice-fish
systems, and the control of tsetse flies through the deployment
of screens and targets treated with pesticides.
<A NAME="note_f">
<H3>Food preservation</H3></A>
         
Member States continue to show interest in food irradiation, a
preservation method increasingly being used along with
traditional ones. It is a physical means of food treatment
comparable to processing food by heating or freezing. Foodstuffs
are exposed to controlled amounts of radiation to delay spoilage,
or to kill insect eggs or micro-organisms which contaminate food.
No radioactivity is induced in the items.
<P>         
Agency activities have focussed on investigating the application
of food irradiation as one way to ensure a safe and adequate food
supply, as well as a plant quarantine treatment to promote
international trade in agricultural products and to transfer the
technology under strict control. Decades of research have shown
conclusively that there are no adverse effects from the
consumption of irradiated foods and that food irradiation is a
safe and effective preservation technique when used under
controlled conditions at licensed facilities. International
efforts have centered on possible uniform regulation of
irradiated foods and to establish an international label to
identify foods that have been irradiated.
<P>         
At the end of 1989, the number of countries where one or more
irradiated food items had been approved for human consumption
totalled 37; of these, 24 countries are using commercial or
demonstration irradiators to process several food items for
commercial purposes.
<A NAME="note_g">
<H3>Nuclear medicine</H3></A>
         
Nuclear techniques are used in a variety of ways in medical
fields. The use of X-rays as a diagnostic aid is well known, but
a wide spectrum of other techniques is available to physicians as
well. It has been estimated that about one fourth of all hospital
patients in the Western industrialized world benefit from the
use of nuclear medicine.
<P>         
Chemical compounds "labelled" with short-lived radioactive
isotopes are especially useful for diagnostic purposes. The
compounds are "watched" as they travel through the organ being
studied to assess how well the organ is functioning. Another
class of diagnostic techniques, in which biological samples taken
from patients are studied using radiochemicals in the laboratory,
reduce risk even further. Such techniques are used to assess
organ functioning by measuring hormone levels, certain proteins
associated with virus infections, and in evaluating the effects
of drug treatments.
<P>         
Within the framework of the IAEA's regional co-operative
agreement for Asia and the Pacific (RCA), a programme to promote
the production and use of bulk reagents for radioimmunoassay has
reduced significantly the cost of the assays of thyroid-related
hormones. A similar programme has been introduced in Latin
America.
<A NAME="note_h">
<H3>Radiation biology and radiotherapy</H3></A>
         
In many countries, doctors use sterile medical care supplies,
such as hypodermic syringes and needles, that are thrown away
after only one clinical use. This is perhaps the most visible
product of the growing use of the microbicidal effects of
radiation to sterilize prepacked medical supplies. A wide variety
of other materials are also sterilized in this way. To improve
quality control of sterility, scientists collaborating in an IAEA
co-ordinated research programme in the Asia and Pacific region
have developed a set of technical procedures. The  Agency has
developed a code of practice for the radiation sterilization of
disposable medical supplies.
<P>         
Radiation also is used for cancer treatment. A variety of
techniques has been developed which is especially useful in
developing countries, where hospital resources are often
limited. One particularly successful development concerns a
technique for the treatment of cervical cancer, which is
prevalent in many developing countries. The Agency and the
World Health Organization (WHO), with the Government of Italy,
are supporting work in Egypt which is saving hundreds of lives
each year.
<A NAME="note_i">
<H3>Radiation dosimetry</H3></A>
        
One out of every three cancer patients receive radiation
treatments. The dose of radiation each patient receives must be
precise. Accurate dosimetry--the measurement of radiation
doses--is a key IAEA field of concern. The Agency and
participating institutes in Member States have established a
network of Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories (SSDLs) to
expand the number of laboratories that can maintain accurate
standard measurement instruments. National laboratories
participating in the SSDL network can determine the accuracy of
their own instruments and check instruments used in the field.
For countries without an operational SSDL, the IAEA's dosimetry
laboratory at Seibersdorf provides calibration services upon
request.
<P>         
To assist users of radiotherapy equipment, the Agency and WHO
operate a"postal dose intercomparison service". Hospitals using
this service receive dosimeters whose accuracy is known, and are
requested to expose them to what their instruments tell them is a
certain calculated dose. The dosimeters are returned to Vienna
for checking, and the hospitals told the results so that they can
check their instruments. Some 340 hospitals make use of this
service, most of them repeatedly.
<A NAME="note_j">
<H3>Nutrition and health</H3></A>
         
Nuclear techniques are used widely in studies of the body's need
for, and use of, trace elements; and in ways in which we are
affected by pollution in the environment. The Agency's
 work in this area is largely centered on co-ordinating work in
the field, and in providing advice and training. It also supports
work in Member Slates by making available certified reference
materials against which workers studying human nutrition and
environmental pollution can check their measurements. Programmes
are conducted in areas where nuclear techniques are used in
analyses of toxic elements in foodstuffs and in the study of
environmental pollution associated with solid wastes.
<A NAME="note_k">
<H3>Research reactor support</H3></A>
         
Nuclear power is used for electricity generation in only certain
countries, but many others use research reactors as a training
tool, for pure research, to support analytical techniques, and
for the production of radioisotopes used in industry,
agriculture, and medicine.
<P>         
Today there are 325 research reactors operating in 54 Member
States, including 71 in 34 developing countries. The Agency's
programme is aimed at converting some research reactors from the
use of high-enriched uranium fuels, which are limited, to
low-enriched fuels. It also seeks to enhance the use of these
reactors to serve multiple purposes in areas of research and
practical applications.
<A NAME="note_l">
<H3>Industrial applications</H3></A>
         
Many beneficial applications of radiation and radioisotopes are
now well established in industry in advanced countries. Main
areas of application include activities in radiography,
non-destructive testing, radiation engineering and technology,
control systems and radioactive tracers, analytical techniques
and quality control, borehole logging and rock characterization,
and the production of radioactively-labelled pharmaceuticals,
including necessary quality control techniques and procedures for
their safe use.
<P>         
For example, radiotracer applications in the chemical, oil
production and refining, steel, cement, automotive, and maritime
industries have offered considerable economic benefits and have
provided solutions to problems which could not be solved by other
techniques.
<A NAME="note_m">
<H3>Development of water and mineral resources</H3></A>
         
Techniques using "environmental" isotopes are among those that
meteorologists hydrologists, and hydrogeologists use in the study
of water. Study of the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water,
and of elements contained in dissolved salts which have the same
behaviour as water, enables exact recording of phenomena
affecting the occurrence and movement of water in all its forms
(ice, gas, or liquid).
<P>         
In the Amazon Basin, for example, such techniques play a key role
in investigating the  environmental consequences of the clearing
of tropical rain forests. Stable isotopes are providing data on
vapour movements, stream flow, sedimentation, water quality,
plant protection and soil changes. Ultimately these studies
should have decisive impact on the ecological management of the
region.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>R</B></FONT>adioactivity is a part of our earth -- it has existed all
along. Naturally occurring radioactive materials are present in its crust, the floors and walls of
our homes, schools, or offices and in the food we eat and drink. There are radioactive gases
in the air we breathe. Our own bodies -- muscles, bones, and tissue -- contain naturally
occurring radioactive elements.
<P>         
Man has always been exposed to natural radiation arising from the earth as well as from
outside the earth. The radiation we receive from outer space is called cosmic radiation or
cosmic rays.
<P>         
We also receive exposure from man-made radiation, such as X-rays, radiation used to
diagnose diseases and for cancer therapy. Fallout from nuclear explosives testing, and
small quantities of radioactive materials released to the environment from coal and
nuclear power plants, are also sources of radiation exposure to man.
<P>         
Radioactivity is the term used to describe disintegration of atoms. The atom can be
characterized by the number of protons in the nucleus. Some natural elements are unstable.
Therefore, their nuclei disintegrate or decay, thus releasing energy in the form of radiation.
This physical phenomenon is called radioactivity and the radioactive atoms are
called nuclei. The radioactive decay is expressed in units called becquerels. One
becquerel equals one disintegration per second.
<P>         
The radionuclides decay at a characteristic rate that remains constant regardless of external
influences, such as temperature or pressure. The time that it takes for half the radionuclides
to disintegrate or decay is called half-life. This differs for each radioelement, ranging from
fractions of a second to billions of years. For example, the half-life of Iodine 131 is eight
days, but for Uranium 238, which is present in varying amounts all over the world, it is 4.5
billion years. Potassium 40, the main source of radioactivity in our bodies, has a half-life of
1.42 billion years.
<A NAME="types"><P>         
<B>Types of radiation</B>
<P>         </A>
The term "radiation" is very broad, and includes such things as light and radio waves.
In our context it refers to "ionizing" radiation, which means that because such radiation
passes through matter, it can cause it to become electrically charged or ionized. In
living tissues, the electrical ions produced by radiation can affect normal biological
processes .
<P>         
There are various types of radiation, each having different characteristics. The
common ionizing radiations generally talked about are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B><I>Alpha radiation</I></B> consists of heavy, positively charged particles emitted
by atoms of elements such as uranium and radium. Alpha radiation can be stopped completely
by a sheet of paper or by the thin surface layer of our skin (epidermis). However, if
alpha-emitting materials are taken into the body by breathing, eating, or drinking, they can
expose internal tissues directly and may, therefore, cause biological damage.
<P>
<LI><B><I>Beta radiation</I></B> consists of electrons. They are more penetrating than
alpha particles and can pass through 1-2 centimetres of water. In general, a sheet of aluminum
a few millimetres thick will stop beta radiation.
<P>         
<LI><B><I>Gamma rays</I></B> are electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays, light, and
radio waves. Gamma rays, depending on their energy, can pass right through the human
body, but can be stopped by thick walls of concrete or lead.
<P>         
<LI><B><I>Neutrons</I></B> are uncharged particles and do not produce ionization directly.
But, their interaction with the atoms of matter can give rise to alpha, beta, gamma, or X-rays
which then produce ionization. Neutrons are penetrating and can be stopped only
by thick masses of concrete, water or paraffin.
</UL>
<P>         
Although we cannot see or feel the presence of radiation, it can be detected and measured in
the most minute quantities with quite simple radiation measuring instruments.
<A NAME="dose"><P>
<B>Radiation dose</B>
<P>        </A> 
Sunlight feels warm because our body absorbs the infra-red rays it contains. But,
infra-red rays do not produce ionization in body tissue. In contrast, ionizing radiation can
impair the normal functioning of the cells or even kill them. The amount of energy necessary
to cause significant biological effects through ionization is so small that our bodies cannot
feel
this energy as in the case of infra-red rays which produce heat.
<P>         
The biological effects of ionizing radiation vary with the type and energy. A measure of the
risk of biological harm is the dose of radiation that the tissues receive. The unit of absorbed
radiation dose is the sievert (Sv). Since one sievert is a large quantity, radiation doses
normally encountered are expressed in millisievert (mSv) or microsievert (&#181;Sv) which
are one-thousandth or one millionth of a sievert. For example, one chest X-ray will give about
0.2 mSv of radiation dose.
<P>         
On average, our radiation exposure due to all natural sources amounts to about 2.4 mSv a
year--though this figure can vary, depending on the geographical location by several hundred
percent. In homes and buildings, there are radioactive elements in the air. These radioactive
elements are radon (Radon 222), thoron (Radon 220) and by products formed by the decay of
radium (Radium 226) and thorium present in many sorts of rocks, other building materials
and
in the soil. By far the largest source of natural radiation exposure comes from varying
amounts of uranium and thorium in the soil around the world.
<P>         
The radiation exposure due to cosmic rays is very dependent on altitude, and slightly on
latitude: people who travel by air, thereby, increase their exposure to radiation.

Additionally, we are exposed to varying amounts of radiation from sources such as
dental and other medical X-rays, industrial uses of nuclear techniques and other consumer
products such as luminized wrist watches, ionization smoke detectors, etc. We are also
exposed to radiation from radioactive elements contained in fallout from nuclear explosives
testing, and routine normal discharges from nuclear and coal power stations.
<A NAME="protection"><P>         
<B>Radiation protection</B>
<P>  </A>       
It has long been recognized that large doses of ionizing radiation can damage human
tissues. Over the years, as more was learned, scientists became increasingly concerned about
the potentially damaging effects of exposure to large doses of radiation. The need to regulate
exposure to radiation prompted the formation of a number of expert bodies to consider what
is needed to be done. In 1928, an independent non-governmental body of experts in the field,
the International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee was established. It later was
renamed the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Its purpose is to
establish basic principles for, and issue recommendations on, radiation protection.
<P>         
These principles and recommendations form the basis for national regulations
governing the exposure of radiation workers and members of the public. They also have
been incorporated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into its Basic Safety
Standards for Radiation Protection published jointly with the World Health Organization
(WHO), International Labour Organization (ILO), and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency
(NEA). These standards are used worldwide to ensure safety and radiation protection of
radiation workers and the general public.
<P>         
An intergovernmental body was formed in 1955 by the General Assembly of the United
Nations as the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR).
UNSCEAR is directed to assemble, study and disseminate information on observed levels of
ionizing radiation and radioactivity (natural and man-made) in the environment, and on the
effects of such radiation on man and the environment.
<P>         
Basic approaches to radiation protection are consistent all over the world. The ICRP
recommends that any exposure above the natural background radiation should be kept as
low as reasonably achievable, but below the individual dose limits. The individual dose limit
for radiation workers averaged over 5 years is 100 mSv, and for members of the general   
public, is 1 mSv per year. These dose limits have been established based on a prudent
approach by assuming that there is no threshold dose below which there would be no effect.
It
means that any additional dose will cause a proportional increase in the chance of a health
effect. This relationship has not yet been established in the low dose range where the
dose limits have been set.
<P>         
There are many high natural background radiation areas around the world where the
annual radiation dose received by members of the general public is several times higher than
the ICRP dose limit for radiation workers. The numbers of people exposed are too small to
expect to detect any increases in health effects epidemiologically. Still the fact that there is no
evidence so far of any increase does not mean the risk is being totally disregarded.
<P>         
The ICRP and the IAEA recommend the individual dose must be kept as low as reasonably
achievable, and consideration must be given to the presence of other sources which may cause
simultaneous radiation exposure to the same group of the public. Also, allowance for future
sources or practices must be kept in mind so that the total dose received by an individual
member of the public does not exceed the dose limit.
<P>
In general, the average annual dose received by radiation workers is found to be considerably
lower than the individual dose limits. Good radiation protection practice can thus result in low
radiation exposure to workers.
<A NAME="harmful"><P>         
<B>At what level is radiation harmful?</B>
<P>        </A> 
The effects of radiation at high doses and dose rates are reasonably well documented. A very
large dose delivered to the whole body over a short time will result in the death of the
exposed person within days. Much has been learned by studying the health records of the
survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We know from these that some of the
health effects of exposure to radiation do not appear unless a certain quite large dose is
absorbed. However, many other effects, especially cancers are readily detectable and
occur more often in those with moderate doses. At lower doses and dose rates, there is a
degree of recovery in cells and in tissues.
<P>         
However, at low doses of radiation, there is still considerable uncertainty about the
overall effects. It is presumed that exposure to radiation, even at the levels of natural
background, may involve some additional risk of cancer. However, this has yet to be
established. To determine precisely the risk at low doses by epidemiology would mean
observing millions of people at higher and lower dose levels. Such an analysis would be
complicated by the absence of a control group which had not been exposed to any radiation.
In addition, there are thousands of substances in our everyday life besides radiation that can
also cause cancer, including tobacco smoke, ultraviolet light, asbestos, some chemical dyes,
fungal toxins in food, viruses, and even heat. Only in exceptional cases is it possible to
identify conclusively the cause of a particular cancer.
<P>         
There is also experimental evidence from animal studies that exposure to radiation can
cause genetic effects. However, the studies of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki give
no indication of this for humans. Again, if there were any hereditary effects of exposure to
low-level radiation, they could be detected only by careful analysis of a large volume of
statistical data. Moreover, they would have to be distinguished from those of a number of
other agents which might also cause genetic disorders, but whose effect may not be
 recognised until the damage has been done (thalidomide, once prescribed for pregnant
women as a tranquilizer, is one example). It is likely that the resolution of the scientific
debate will not come via epidemiology but from an understanding of the mechanisms through
molecular biology. 
<P>
With all the knowledge so far collected on effects of radiation, there is still no definite
conclusion as to whether exposure due to natural background carries a health risk, even
though it has been demonstrated for exposure at a level a few times higher.
<A NAME="risks"><P>         
<B>Risks and benefits</B>
<P>         </A>
We all face risks in everyday life. It is impossible to eliminate them all, but it is
possible to reduce them. The use of coal, oil, and nuclear energy for electricity production,
for example, is associated with some sort of risk to health, however small. In general, society
accepts the associated risk in order to derive the relevant benefits. Any individual exposed to
carcinogenic pollutants will carry some risk of getting cancer. Strenuous attempts are made in
the nuclear industry to reduce such risks to as low as reasonably achievable.
<P>         
Radiation protection sets examples for other safety disciplines in two unique respects:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First, there is the assumption that any increased level of radiation above natural
background will carry some risk of harm to health.
<P>
<LI>Second, it aims to protect future generations from activities conducted today.
</UL>
<P>         
The use of radiation and nuclear techniques in medicine, industry, agriculture,
energy and other scientific and technological fields has brought tremendous benefits to
society. The benefits in medicine for diagnosis and treatment in terms of human lives saved
are enormous. Radiation is a key tool in the treatment of certain kinds of cancer. Three out
of every four patients hospitalized in the industrial countries benefit from some form of
nuclear medicine. The beneficial impacts in other fields are similar.
<P>         
No human activity or practice is totally devoid of associated risks. Radiation should
be viewed from the perspective that the benefit from it to mankind is less harmful
than from many other agents.

governments in ensuring the safe and peaceful global development
of nuclear energy and related technologies.  
<P>
To carry out its mission, the Agency is headed by a <A HREF="/worldatom/glance/profile/blixcv.htm">Director General</A> and
organizationally structured into <A HREF="/worldatom/glance/profile/#item2">six Departments</A>, each headed by a Deputy Director General.  Its <A HREF="/worldatom/glance/policy/">policymaking organs</A> of Member States are the General Conference and the 35-member IAEA Board of
Governors.  
<P>
All told, the IAEA has about 2000 staff members from more than 80
countries with expertise in a variety of scientific, technical,
managerial, and professional disciplines.  Most of these men and
women work at Agency headquarters in Vienna, Austria, with others
working at IAEA field offices in Toronto and Tokyo, liaison
offices in New York and Geneva, and <A HREF="/worldatom/laboratory/index.html">research laboratories</A> in Seibersdorf, Austria, and in Monaco.
<P>
Staff members are international civil servants subject to the
authority of the Director General.  As such, they  may not seek
or accept instructions in regard to the performance of their
duties from any government or other authority external to the
Agency.   While all staff members are subject to the laws and
regulations of the duty station country, they are entitled to
certain privileges and immunities in the interests of the IAEA. 
These include immunity from legal process in respect of words
spoken or written, and of acts performed in line with official
duties; immunity from seizure of personal and official baggage;
exemption from taxation in respect of salaries paid by the IAEA;
and exemption from immigration restrictions and alien
registration.  
<P>
For professional positions, the IAEA follows a policy of
rotation.  This means that appointments typically are for an
initial three-year period with no expectation or right to
extension, renewal, or conversion to another type of appointment.

Based on programme requirements and work performance, the Agency
may offer an extension for a period of two years, bringing the
total service to five years.  As a rule, five years constitute
the maximum period a staff member can expect to be employed by
the IAEA.
<P>
In terms of language backgrounds and skills, IAEA staff typically
are multi-lingual.  Agency business is usually conducted in
English, but knowlege of other official languages (Arabic,
Chinese, French, Russian, or Spanish) is an advantage.  At Agency
headquarters in Vienna, knowledge of German is an additional
asset, both for working contacts and for life outside of office
hours.
<P>
Detailed information about employment opportunities at the IAEA
may be obtained by writing to the Recruitment Unit, Division of
Personnel, IAEA, P.O. Box 100, A-1400 Vienna, Austria.

<H3>How to Apply for Posts</H3>
</CENTER></A>
<P>
Interested applicants may inquire about employment opportunities
at the IAEA at any time.  To be assured of consideration for a
specific position, however, they must apply in writing following
the issuance of an official Vacancy Notice.  Applications must be
received before the Closing Date as stated on the Vacancy Notice
itself.  (The Personal History Form accessible here can be printed out and used for the application
process; it may not be transmitted to the IAEA electronically, however.) 
<P>
Vacancy Notices are issued months before a position becomes
available at the Agency.  As a matter of routine, they are now
accessible over the Internet at the IAEA's main address (<A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at">http://www.iaea.or.at</A>).  Copies
of announcements also are sent to all Member States, typically to
the Atomic Energy Commissions, Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
other international organizations, universities and other
educational institutions.  Abridged forms of the announcements
are published in the <I>IAEA Bulletin</I>, the Agency's quarterly
journal.  
<P>
In a cover letter, applicants should state their nationality and
quote the number of the Vacancy Notice for which they are
applying.  Applications should be sent to the Division of
Personnel, IAEA, Wagramerstrasse 5, P.O. Box 100, A-1400 Vienna,
Austria.  Applicants will be informed of the outcome of the
evaluation process approximately two months after the Closing
Date.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Agency's 1995 programme on radioactive
waste management focused on three major areas: strengthening
waste management infrastructures in developing Member States;
establishing international principles and standards for the safe
management of wastes; and preparing
for the convention on waste safety. The increased importance
placed by Member States on the
decommissioning/dismantling of nuclear installations and the
restoration of radioactively contaminated
sites was reflected in the introduction of new initiatives in
these areas.   
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Handling, Treatment, Conditioning and Storage
of Radioactive
Wastes</I></B></FONT>
<P>
There are 45 WWER-type reactors in operation around the world and
several more are under
construction. One of the common features of many of these units
is an under-designed waste
management system that generates higher amounts of radioactive
wastes as compared with other
types of reactors. As a consequence, waste management issues were
studied in a technical assistance
regional project on waste minimization at WWER type reactors that
was completed in 1995. Project
activities included a review of common problems and the
identification of the processes and activities
needed to improve existing waste management systems.  
<P>
Progress was made in developing guidance material on quality
assurance and quality control
requirements in the production of radioactive waste packages
acceptable for the transport, long term
storage and disposal of wastes. A report on the characterization
of radioactive waste forms and
packages was completed. This report provides a comprehensive
summary of waste form, container and
package properties which are important in obtaining regulatory
approval for the use of a waste package
for transport, storage and disposal.  
<P>
The Sealed Radiation Sources (SRS) Registry package, a project
within the spent sealed sources programme, was completed. The SRS
Registry package consists of a program diskette and documentation
on the Registry, installation and operating instructions, and a
guide for Registry administrators in Member States. A policy has
been formulated governing the distribution of the SRS package,
the financial obligations involved and issues related to
implementation, such as training and updating. The Registry is
one of the primary components of Agency programmes aimed at
improving the control of in-use and spent radiation sources, and
will assist countries in their efforts to keep track of all
sealed radiation sources from 'cradle to grave'. The first
training seminar/workshop for administrators of the SRS system
was held in October 1995 in Vienna. In addition, several
countries
offered to implement the Registry nationally on a test basis.

A five year CRP on the performance of engineered barrier
materials in near surface disposal was
concluded in 1995. The CRP provided an opportunity to share the
experience of Member States in the
application of engineered barrier materials and to enhance the
use of such barriers by improving the
techniques and methods used for selecting, planning and testing
the performance of various types of
materials.   
<A NAME="decontamination">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Decontamination and Decommissioning of
Nuclear
Installations</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Decommissioning is a topic of great interest to many countries
because of the large number of facilities
which have reached or are nearing the end of their operational
lifetime. Until recently, attention was
focused on the decommissioning of nuclear power and research
reactors. Some countries, however,
are now devoting greater attention to the decommissioning of
non-reactor nuclear facilities, with
implementation of these decommissioning programmes being seen as
a high priority. As a
consequence, the Agency has begun preparation of a technical
report, which will be first of its kind
dealing specifically with the decommissioning of non-reactor
facilities. It will present information on
installations already decommissioned and on those for which
decommissioning actions are planned or
under way.   
<P>
A number of WWER-440 type nuclear power plants are in operation
in seven countries of central and
eastern Europe (Armenia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
the Russian Federation, Slovakia
and Ukraine). Five WWER-440 units have been shut down permanently
in eastern Germany. In addition
to reactors already shut down, a number of reactors will soon
reach the end of their foreseen lifetime
(2530 years) and become candidates for decommissioning.  
<P>
Recognizing the region's need for support in this area, a four
year technical co-operation project on
planning and managing the decommissioning of WWER type nuclear
power plants was initiated in
1995. The project will emphasize WWER-440 reactors, since they
have received very little attention in
relation to facility decommissioning. An additional complication
is that documentation on design,
construction and operational aspects, which inevitably have an
effect on decommissioning, is scarce
and not readily available. The project has been planned in such a
way as to include regional workshops
and technical visits to several reactor sites, and will assist
countries in the development of
decommissioning plans for these reactors.  
<P>
Radioactive contamination of the environment has resulted from
several causes: accidents involving
radioactive materials; nuclear weapons production and testing
activities, activities associated with
nuclear power generation; the disposition of by-products from the
mining and milling of radioactive ores;
past waste management practices (including disposal and
releases); and abandoned facilities (e.g.
radium factories) where radioactive substances were used. The
Agency recently initiated a programme
to assist Member States in the remediation and restoration of
radioactively contaminated sites. The
principal efforts over the next several years will be on:
gathering information and data, performing
analyses and publishing technical guides, reports and documents
on key aspects of environmental
restoration; conducting a CRP and an interregional training
course on environmental restoration.   
<A NAME="radiological">

<P></A>
The Agency will present a report by the end of 1996 to the
Convention on the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (the London
Convention 1972) on the potential
impact of the high level radioactive wastes dumped in the shallow
waters of the Kara Sea, and on the
feasibility of possible remedial measures. During 1995, work on
acquiring basic information on waste
inventories and making predictions of future releases of
radionuclides from the dumped wastes was
completed by a working group. The data acquired will be used in
1996 by the environmental modelling
and impact assessment working groups as a basis for their
calculations.   
<P>
In support of the final assessment task, experimental and field
work was carried out in national
institutes and at IAEA-MEL to determine the distribution
coefficients between sea water and sediment,
and concentration factors for biological species of the Arctic.
In relation to possible remedial actions, a
set of options, such as in situ capping or retrieval of certain
wastes, followed by transport and storage
on land, were selected for closer examination. These options will
be examined for their technical
feasibility, costs of implementation and radiological impacts,
and will be compared with the option of
leaving the wastes in the shallow Arctic waters.  
<P>
A symposium to review recent developments and studies on the
environmental impact of radionuclide releases was held Vienna in
May. The review included the results of studies aimed at
reconstructing radiation doses to exposed individuals due to
releases in the early years of the nuclear industry and of
projects concerned with the remediation of land contaminated as a
result of past releases. The symposium also provided a forum for
presenting the main results of an Agency CRP entitled 'Validation
of Environmental Model Predictions' (VAMP), and to review
progress in the International Arctic Seas Assessment Project
(IASAP). The final session of the symposium featured a topical
discussion on
protection of the environment and the 'precautionary principle'
(which calls for precautionary action to be
taken to protect the environment from potentially harmful
contaminants even if there is no concrete
evidence that these contaminants have an adverse effect), a
controversial concept which is being
debated in many international forums.  
<P>
Within the framework of the IASAP, IAEA-MEL completed
radiochemical analysis of seawater and
sediment samples taken during the joint 1994 Norwegian-Russian
Federation expedition to the Kara
Sea. The results showed that a leakage of several radionuclides
had occurred from the waste
containers dumped in the Abrosimov and Stepovoy Bays, but that
the resulting sediment contamination
is limited to the immediate vicinity of the containers. Global
and regional modelling of a hypothetical
large scale release of radionuclides from the dump sites has
shown that only local scale radiological
effects may be of importance. The analysis of seawater and
sediment samples taken during the 1994
Japan-Republic of Korea-Russian Federation expedition to the far
eastern seas did not show any effects
from the dump sites.  
<P>
Other activities related to IASAP included laboratory and field
experiments to examine radionuclide
accumulation by sediments and biota under Arctic conditions.
These studies involved organisms
typically found in the Arctic Seas. Measurements were made of
their uptake response when exposed to
key waste derived radionuclides at low (-2&#176;C) temperatures.
It was found that brown macroalgae
would be excellent bioindicator organisms for detecting
radionuclide contamination in the Kara and
Barents Seas.  
<P>
An intercomparison exercise on biota samples collected on Mururoa
Atoll was completed under the
Analytical Quality Control Services (AQCS) programme. The
radioanalytical performance of the
participating laboratories proved to be good, although the
activity of the samples analysed was very
low.  
<P>
The field programme carried out by IAEA-MEL on Eutrophic Limits
in the Northern Adriatic (ELNA),
which employed nuclear techniques to assess carbon flux and
burial in the Adriatic Sea, was concluded
in mid-1995. The findings were instrumental in establishing the
pollution histories of important
environmental contaminants, such as PCBs and mercury, in this
region of the Adriatic Sea.

The costs associated with radioactive waste management and the
decommissioning of nuclear facilities
are of interest to Member States planning nuclear power
programmes. To assist them, the Agency
convened a meeting of experts in June to prepare a report on this
subject. One suggestion was that the
Agency should work with other interested international
organizations to develop and define a
comprehensive list of cost related terminologies. This can
potentially facilitate greater communication
and more standardized use of terms within the waste management
community.   
<P>
A milestone in the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS)
programme was the publication of
a Safety Fundamentals document on radioactive waste management
and a Safety Standard on
establishing a national system for radioactive waste management.
These two documents will help to
address the need for a set of internationally recognized
principles and standards. They are also finding
use as source material in the preparatory work for a convention
on the safety of radioactive waste
management.  
<P>
At the request of the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority
(NRPA), the Agency assembled a five
member team, under its Waste Management Assessment and Technical
Review Programme (WATRP),
to review Norway's work on establishing a combined storage and
disposal facility for low and
intermediate level wastes. The WATRP review team found that the
quality, approach and status of the
Norwegian programme was satisfactory. The original WATRP review
report, which includes a
Norwegian translation, was published by the NRPA in December
1995.  
<P>
Co-operative efforts are continuing to identify effective ways to
assist the newly independent states of
the former USSR and the Russian Federation with various waste
management problems. One activity
in this area was a seminar in Vienna on international
co-operation on nuclear waste management in the
Russian Federation. As a result, a Contact Expert Group (CEG) has
been established to try to resolve
various radioactive waste management issues.   
<P>
The Agency will act as Secretariat of the CEG, which will include
senior representatives from the
Russian Federation and co-operating countries. Among other
responsibilities, the Agency will maintain a
database on high priority Russian waste management needs, and on
planned or ongoing co-operative
projects.  
<P>
Among the activities directly assisting developing Member States
was a project to create or promote
regional technical centres for demonstrating pre-disposal waste
management methods and procedures.
In 1995, steps were taken to establish two regional centres, one
at the Cekmece Nuclear and Training
Centre in Istanbul, and the second at the Nuclear Research Centre
in Santiago, Chile.

  <H3>Director General Reviews Changing Global Nuclear Agenda</H3></A>Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly in New York, IAEA Director General Hans Blix underlined the Agency's growing role to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to verify nuclear arms control and disarmament agreements. Dr. Blix also reviewed the changing agenda in other areas of nuclear energy's safe development worldwide. He addressed the General Assembly 28 October 1996.<P>
"With the nuclear arms race over, a number of arms control or disarmament treaties have been concluded or are in the making that may require additional verification tasks from the IAEA," he said. In this context, he noted that the United States and Russian Federation are exploring with the IAEA technical and other issues connected to the further verification of certain nuclear material from dismantled nuclear weapons. Verification in nuclear-weapon States, he said, can provide "assurance that fissionable material from dismantled weapons does not go into new weapons." Additionally, he noted, it could assure that a possible future cut-off agreement prohibiting the production of plutonium or highly enriched uranium for weapons is respected.<P>
In reviewing the IAEA's verification role, Dr. Blix also pointed to the increasing number of regional nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties and to the long-standing multilateral Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which all require and rely upon IAEA safeguards. Though the recently adopted Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will have its own verification organization, Dr. Blix emphasized the IAEA's existing role under the NPT, which obliges non-nuclear-weapon States to refrain from nuclear weapons tests and entrusts the verification of these obligations to the IAEA.<P>
Dr. Blix underlined the IAEA's ongoing efforts to strengthen its safeguards system, noting that many measures already have been introduced under the Agency's existing legal authority. Other measures that go beyond this authority remain under discussion by the IAEA's Board of Governors. Most of these measures have been tried out in several States without great problems for the Agency or the State concerned, Dr. Blix said. While a few other countries have raised objections about the burden they may impose, Dr. Blix said the measures were needed for improving the IAEA's verification capabilities. "Regrettably, as we all know from our experience of controls at airports, security against possible violations by a few requires some inconveniencing of many," he said.<P>
In addressing other areas, Dr. Blix noted how the changing global agenda continues to significantly influence the IAEA's programmes and resources: "There is no lack of challenges in the nuclear sphere," he said, "Over time the work of the Agency has both expanded and changed considerably....Suffice it to mention the names Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, Iraq and the DPRK, Semipalatinsk and Mururoa to evoke the growing engagement of the IAEA in the fields of nuclear safety, safeguards verification, and assessment of the radiological situation at nuclear weapons test sites." He emphasized, however, that the IAEA's budget frequently "limits what can be tackled." Many new tasks, he said, such as measures countering illicit trafficking in nuclear materials or projects concerning nuclear safety and waste are, in fact, handled in large measure on the basis of extrabudgetary voluntary contributions from countries. "This is not satisfactory," he said, "but far better than inaction." - <I>The full text of the statement is accessible on line through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services on the World Wide Web at <A HREF="/worldatom/">http://www.iaea.org/worldatom.</A></I>

<H3> IAEA Board of Governors </H3></A>
At meetings scheduled to begin Tuesday, 26 November 1996, the IAEA Board of Governors' Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee is considering matters related to the Agency's proposed programme for 1997-98 and the evaluation of technical co-operation activities. Also before the Committee will be a report on the IAEA's current technical co-operation programme, whose implementation rate continues to rise to new high levels. The Committee's recommendations go to the full Board, whose next meetings are scheduled to begin at IAEA headquarters 3 December.  Included on the Board's provisional agenda is a report on the work of its Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the Efficiency of the Safeguards System. The Committee has held two sessions, one in July and the second in October, to negotiate a new legal document that would be attached to existing comprehensive safeguards agreements. This document would define <I>inter alia</I> the nature of additional access to information and to nuclear-related locations for the Agency's inspectors. A third session of the Committee is scheduled for late January 1997.<P>
<B>Board membership.</B> Ambassador Peter Walker of Canada is the newly elected Chairman of the IAEA Board for the period 1996-97.

<H3>Nuclear Safety Convention enters into Force</H3></A>
The Convention on Nuclear Safety - the first international legal instrument on the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide - entered into force 24 October 1996. The Convention  commits its Parties to ensure the safety of land-based civil nuclear power plants. This includes a legislative and regulatory framework; general safety considerations such as quality assurance, assessment, and verification of safety; human factors; radiation protection; emergency preparedness; and specific obligations on the safety of nuclear installations; siting; design and construction; and operation. The Convention obliges Parties to submit reports at periodic review meetings. These reports will focus on the measures each State has taken to implement its obligations.<P>
"The Convention marks a major step forward in strengthening international co-operation in the safety field," said IAEA Director General Hans Blix. "Though the safe use of nuclear energy remains clearly a national responsibility, the Convention signals the growing recognition of the global interdependence of safe nuclear development." <P>
Through October, 27 States have consented to be bound by the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  These are Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mali, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The Convention has been signed by 65 States.<P>
A preparatory meeting of States Parties will be convened within the next six months.  At that meeting, among other matters, guidelines will be established regarding the form and structure of reports that States are required to submit for review at periodic meetings, and the process for reviewing such reports. The Convention calls for  the first review meeting to be convened as soon as possible, but no later than 30 months from its entry into force. - <I>The full text of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and its latest status is accessible through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services on the World Wide Web at <A HREF="/worldatom/">http://www.iaea.org/worldatom</A>.</I>

<H3>Safeguarding Fissile Materials Released from Defense Programmes</H3></A>
Under a trilateral initiative announced in September 1996, the first steps are being taken by the United States, Russian Federation, and the IAEA to expand the international verification of weapons-usable nuclear materials through the application of IAEA safeguards. In early November 1996, delegations from the IAEA, United States, and Russian Federation visited three US Department of Energy sites - the Argonne National Laboratory - West in Idaho, the Hanford site in Washington, and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology site in Colorado. At Argonne, the visits centred on demonstrations of remote monitoring technology, and at Hanford and Rocky Flats they focused on how IAEA safeguards inspections have been carried out to verify that excess plutonium at those sites is not reused for weapons. Following the site visits, the Russian and IAEA delegations met with senior US officials in Washington D.C. to discuss implementation of the trilateral initiative.<P>
The trilateral initiative was announced in September 1996 at the IAEA General Conference in Vienna. At that time, US Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov, and IAEA Director General Hans Blix met to consider practical measures to fulfill statements made by the Presidents of the United States and Russian Federation in April 1996 concerning the IAEA's verification of weapon origin fissile materials.  The purpose of the initiative is to verify that fissile materials no longer needed for US and Russian defense purposes are not reused to produce new nuclear weapons. It advances the commitments made by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin to ensure the transparency of nuclear arms reductions and the control of fissile material removed from weapons.  To address the various technical, legal, and financial issues associated with implementing IAEA verification of relevant fissile materials, a joint group has been formed which will report on progress by June 1997.

<H3>Technical Support to Newly Independent States in Non-Proliferation Field</H3></A>
A meeting was held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna 6-8 November to review implementation of agreed plans to help Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union in fulfilling their nuclear non-proliferation commitments.<P>
As most NIS have become parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear weapon States, a number of donor countries have offered bilateral assistance  to set up State Systems of Accountancy and Control (SSACs) of nuclear material; physical protection of such material; and import/export controls. The IAEA has played a coordinating role by identifying specific needs in individual states and appropriate donor support.<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of 14 NIS and 9 donor States - Australia, Finland, France, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Sweden, United Kindom and United States. In addition, Argentina, Canada, the Republic of Korea and Turkey attended as observers.<P>
The meeting underlined the need for an integrated approach to nuclear non-proliferation encompassing SSACs, physical protection and import/export controls. Also stressed as basic requirements were the establishment of an appropriate framework of national nuclear laws and regulations in each recipient state, plus the necessary political commitment and coordination. The IAEA's continued role in coordinating technical support for the NIS was welcomed, and the Agency has offered to organize similar annual reviews in the future, provided the necessary assistance is forthcoming.

<H3>Analysis and Screening of Safety Events Team (ASSET)</H3></A>
Since the service started a decade ago, the IAEA has organized 120 nuclear safety missions to more than two dozen countries within the framework of its ASSET programme. The service was launched in 1986 to assist countries having nuclear power plants in areas of safety assessment and analysis. Missions completed so far have included 69 training sessions in 28 countries to demonstrate the practical use of ASSET analysis procedures, and 51 analytical missions in 19 countries that focused on assessing the root causes of safety problems that have affected the plant's operational safety. Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia hosted the first ASSET mission in 1986 and it was the site where ASSET experts recently conducted a mission marking the 10th anniversary of the service.<P>
ASSET was initiated shortly after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, and at the time the idea of having IAEA expert teams invited to assess operational events at nuclear power plants was viewed as quite progressive for an intergovernmental organization. Over time, operating organizations and nuclear plant regulators became attracted to ASSET's technical procedures for analyzing root causes and to the usefulness of conclusions directed at the prevention of incidents. By 1990, the ASSET analytical process started to be used as a technical tool to enhance the performance of a plant's operational safety. A notable case in point was Germany's request for an ASSET mission to the Greifswald nuclear plant before its decision to close down four WWER 440/230 operating units and to stop construction of four WWER 440/213 units.<P>
The ASSET methodology has not changed over the past decade and still provides guidance on how to answer the basic questions: What happened? Why did it happen? Why was it not prevented? However, the specific uses of the ASSET methodology have changed dramatically over the years to meet the needs of operating and regulatory organizations. Early on, the IAEA anticipated that Member States would mostly be interested in the analysis of root causes for single events of higher significance to plant safety. In fact, requests from Member States were directed to the application by ASSET teams of the analysis procedures to the whole population of operational events, especially deviations of little or no significance. This was because the analysis of such events is known to provide the basis for enhancing efforts for the prevention of incidents and accidents. <P>
In 1994, in recognition of the progress made in plant analysis capabilities and incident prevention, IAEA Member States urged the ASSET service to shift its emphasis to the promotion of plant self-assessments of safety performance. This should be done, they said, on the basis of the analysis of the operational events which reflect safety problems or deficiencies in safety culture and in association with peer reviews of the self-assessment results by international ASSET teams. This feature is now receiving greater attention as States work to comply with their reporting commitments in the framework of the international Convention on Nuclear Safety. - <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety.</I>

<H3>Nuclear Power and Sustainable Energy Development</H3></A>
For environmental and other reasons, nuclear power's contribution to the global energy mix needs to be expanded in years ahead in the view of IAEA Director General Hans Blix. <P>
"It is now generally understood that current patterns and trends in the world's energy use are not sustainable," he said. "Hence the call for restraint in the emissions of carbon dioxide through restraint in the use of fossil fuels....Nuclear power releases hardly any emissions to the world's atmosphere: no CO<SUB>2</SUB>, no SO<SUB>2</SUB> and no NO<SUB>x</SUB>.... and does not contribute to acid rains or global warming, the very problems which result from the present accelerated use of fossil fuels and which make excessive reliance on them unsustainable." The carbon dioxide equivalent emission factors for the entire nuclear fuel chain, from uranium mining to waste disposal, range from 10-50 grams per kilowatt-hour, or about the same as for energy generated by wind power, he said. <P>
Dr. Blix made his remarks in an address to the 10th Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in Kobe, Japan, 21 October 1996. The speech focused on nuclear energy's current and potential role in helping to meet the world's electricity needs, and the problems, real and perceived, that are often raised in the nuclear debate. Dr. Blix specifically emphasized areas of nuclear safety and radioactive waste disposal, as well as applications of nuclear energy outside the electricity sector. - <I>The full text of the address is available through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services on the World Wide Web at <A HREF="/worldatom/">http://www.iaea.org/worldatom</A>.</I>

<H3>General Conference adopts Safeguards, Safety Resolutions</H3></A>
States meeting at the IAEA General Conference 16-21 September 1996 adopted resolutions to strengthen international safeguards and global co-operation in areas of nuclear safety and technical assistance. The Conference was attended by Ministers and high-level governmental delegates from the IAEA's 124 Member States. Elected President of the Conference was Mr. William G. Padolina, Secretary of the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology.<P>
Highlights of adopted resolutions follow.<P>
<B>Strengthening the IAEA's Safeguards System.</B> Convinced that IAEA safeguards can promote greater confidence among States and contribute to greater collective security, the Conference called upon the Agency to continue its implementation of previously approved ("Part 1") measures to strengthen the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its safeguards system, and it urged the States concerned to facilitate the process. It further welcomed the IAEA Board of Governors' work begun in July 1996 to draft a model protocol to reinforce and improve the Agency's capacity to detect any undeclared nuclear activities. <P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA Technical Co-operation Activities.</B> Citing nuclear energy's existing and potential social, economic, and environmental benefits in many fields, the Conference requested the Agency to strengthen its technical co-operation activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries in peaceful uses of nuclear energy for electricity production and other applications, and at achieving sustainable development. <P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq.</B> Reaffirming the need for full implementation by Iraq of Security Council resolutions 687, 707, and 715, the Conference demanded that Iraq hand over to the IAEA's Action Team without further delay any currently undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material, and information. It further demanded that Iraq allow the Action Team immediate, unconditional and unrestricted rights of access in accordance with Security Council resolution 707. It stressed that the Agency's Action Team will continue to exercise its right to investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards any further relevant information that Iraq may still be withholding. <P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK.</B> The Conference expressed its concern over the DPRK's continuing non-compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement, and noted with regret the limited progress from IAEA-DPRK discussions of outstanding safeguards issues. It called upon the DPRK to comply fully with the safeguards agreement and to take all steps the Agency may deem necessary to preserve all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with the agreement. The Conference further commended the Agency for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as requested by the United Nations Security Council. <P>
<B>Safeguards in the Middle East.</B> The Conference requested the Director General to continue consultations with States in the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope IAEA safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) in the region. <P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ).</B> The Conference commended the African States for their concerted efforts on the establishment of an African NWFZ, and requested the IAEA Director General to continue to assist them in this regard. It urged African States to make every effort to ratify the Treaty so that it can enter into force without delay, and reaffirmed its convction that the establishment of other NWFZs, especially in the Middle East, would enhance the security of Africa and viability of the African NWFZ. <P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Materials.</B> Noting the programme for preventing and combatting illicit trafficking agreed upon at the Moscow Nuclear Summit in April 1996, the Conference welcomed the IAEA's activities in support of efforts against illicit trafficking, and invited the Agency to continue working in accordance with relevant conclusions of its Board of Governors. <P>
<B>Nuclear, Radiation, and Waste Safety.</B> The Conference adopted several resolutions. One resolution, on the establishment of waste demonstration centres, invites the Agency to assist interested Member States in expanding the use of suitable existing training centres for practical training and demonstration of techniques for the processing and storage of radioactive waste from the application of nuclear techniques in medicine, research, and industry, so that a demonstration and training facility would be available in respective regions through greater co-operation and co-ordination of resources, including those available in developing countries. A second resolution, on the Convention on Nuclear Safety, welcomed the fact that it will enter into force on 24 October 1996, and expressed satisfaction that the Agency will convene a preparatory meeting of Contracting Parties no later than April 1997 on the Convention's implementation. A third resolution, on the safety of radioactive waste management, expressed appreciation for work done so far by the Open-ended Group of Legal and Technical Experts to draft a Convention on the subject, and hoped that progress at the Group's next meeting, to be hosted by South Africa, will allow timely completion of the preparatory work and adoption of a convention in the near future. <P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically.</B> Emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in many countries and noting the World Bank's call to hold a world water conference in 1997, the Conference welcomed the Agency's work in this field to date, and requested the Director General to assign appropriate priority to the nuclear desalination of seawater in preparing the Agency's programme and budget, and invited him to establish an advisory body on nuclear desalination to take appropriate measures to assist Member States in the process of preparatory actions for demonstration projects. <P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management.</B> The Conference requested the Agency to identify and upgrade selected isotope hydrology laboratories in Member States so as to provide easy regional access to analytical facilities for field hydrologists. It further requested the Agency to work with other United Nations agencies to encourage the introduction of isotope hydrology and isotope geochemistry in university courses in Member States so as to provide a stronger foundation for future growth in the area of water resources management. <P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1997 and Target for Technical Co-operation Fund.</B> The budget resolution approved expenditures in 1997 of $222 million (at an exchange rate of 12.7 Austrian schillings to the US dollar). The Conference further approved the target amount of US $68 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund in 1997. <P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat.</B> Two resolutions were adopted. One requests the Agency to intensify its efforts to increase the number of staff members from developing countries, particularly at senior and policy-making levels, as well as from Member States that are not represented or are under-represented in the Secretariat. The second resolution requests the Agency to pursue a target of equal representation of women at all levels of Agency employment, and it called upon the Director General to further integrate the Platform for Action developed at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women into the Agency's relevant policies and programmes. <P>
<B>Representation on the IAEA Board.</B> In a resolution pertaining to Article 6 of the IAEA Statute, the Conference recognized there is a widely held view among Member States on the need to expand the size and composition of the Agency's Board of Governors, and it requested the Board to develop a process of negotiations and to submit its report on a finalized formula for approval by the General Conference at its 41st regular session next year.<P>
<B>GENERAL CONFERENCE EVENTS AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME.</B> In conjunction with the Conference, several events were organized. They included a briefing session on the IAEA's safeguards development programme at which Director General Hans Blix presented a long-term perspective on the strengthening of safeguards; a traditional meeting of senior national officials responsible for nuclear safety; and meetings of officials from Member States concerning regional co-operative arrangements in Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. Additionally, a scientific programme featured three subjects:<P>
<B>Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycle: New Concepts for the Future.</B> Opened by Mr. V. Mourogov, IAEA Deputy Director General for Nuclear Energy, the meeting covered key aspects of the advanced nuclear fuel cycle. Topical presentations were made by national representatives on the prospects for utilizing thorium for energy production (India); the fuel cycle option with plutonium burnup and utilization (Russian Federation); the fuel cycle for burning minor actinides (France); burning light-water reactor spent fuel in heavy water reactors (Republic of Korea); and the challenge for energy sustainability of an advanced fuel cycle system (Japan). A panel discussion further explored issues related to the reduction of stockpiles of plutonium; and the reduction of radiotoxicity or hazards in fuel cycle options. Participants noted that the full scope of nuclear fuel cycle issues, focusing especially on the use or disposal of plutonium, will be examined at an IAEA symposium in June 1997.<P>
<B>Trends in Research Reactor Utilization.</B> Opened by Mr. S. Machi, IAEA Deputy Director General for Research and Isotopes, the meeting explored issues facing countries that are operating research reactors around the world. Topical presentations were made by national representatives on material science studies (Austria); industrial applications (South Africa); nuclear power development, education, and training (India); isotope production (Canada); and cancer therapy (Germany). A concluding panel discussion explored reactor management issues.<P>
<B>Information Management for Member States.</B> The meeting included an overview of the IAEA's approach to information management and various topical presentations by Agency staff on the benefits derived from the effective use of information technology. The topics covered included access to IAEA databases and electronic documents; the International Nuclear Information System (INIS) on compact disks; the Incident Reporting System; on-line project information management for technical co-operation; and remote data transmission of confidential data for safeguards purposes.

<B>International Symposium on Reviewing the Safety of Existing Nuclear Power Plants, 8-11 October 1996, Vienna.</B> This meeting emphasized the importance of safety reviews and feedback systems for exchanging experience and applying lessons learned from operations at the world's nuclear power plants. Attending were nuclear power plant operators, regulators, designers, manufacturers, and technical support experts. Several types of safety reviews are used to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants, including those built to earlier standards of safety, as one way for judging the need for safety improvements and the acceptability of continued safe plant operations. Similarly, a number of feedback systems have been developed as a means for exchanging experience on a range of activities, from nuclear plant design, through operation, to decommissioning of the plant. The Symposium noted that many past and ongoing safety review and feedback programmes can be applied to obligations that States are undertaking through the international Convention on Nuclear Safety, which entered into force in October 1996. - <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety.</I><P><B>Workshop on Public Information Issues, 16-18 October 1996, Argentina.</B> In co-operation with Argentina's Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), the IAEA organized a public information workshop in Buenos Aires for nuclear communicators, governmental authorities, and invited journalists. The workshop featured national reports from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, France, Japan, Peru, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as topical sessions on public information approaches for specific issues, including waste transport, food irradiation, and nuclear safety. The seminar was organized under an extrabudgetary public information programme being funded by Japan. - <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</I><P><B>International Symposium on Harmonization of Health-Related Environmental Measurements using Nuclear and Isotopic Techniques, 4-7 November 1996, India.</B> Experts investigating relationships between environmental pollutants and health met in Hyderabad to share the latest information on the application of nuclear and isotopic techniques in research. The meeting topics related to studies of air particulates, solid waste products, sediments, food, water, human tissues, biomonitors, and other kinds of environmental samples. Experts addressed a range of topics related to quality assurance systems and strategies for nuclear analytical techniques and laboratories. A particular strength of nuclear methods lies in analytical quality assurance, including the validation of analytical methods and the development of analytical reference materials. The methodologies are playing an important role in the application of newly emerging quality management and quality assurance standards, and are helping to meet some of the goals of the UN's Agenda 21 for monitoring and control of environmental pollutants. The symposium was hosted by the Centre for Compositional Characterization of Materials of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).

<H3>India Donates Analytical Instruments</H3></A>
India's Department of Atomic Energy has donated two laser fluorimeters to the IAEA's Laboratories at Seibersdorf. On 18 October 1996, Dr. D.D. Bhawalkar,  Director of the Centre for Advanced Technology in Indore, India, officially presented the instruments to Dr. Sueo Machi, IAEA Deputy Director General for Research and Isotopes, and Dr. Pier Danesi, Director of the Seibersdorf Laboratories. The laser fluorimeter, which India markets commercially, detects uranium salts dissolved in water in very small concentration, as small as 0.1 parts per billion. The instrument uses a sealed nitrogen laser whose pulsed ultraviolet beam excites fluorescence in uranium salts dissolved in water samples. Measurement of the fluorescence intensity provides the concentration of the uranium in the water sample. The Seibersdorf Laboratories will use the instruments for training scientists in nuclear analytical techniques, to provide analytical services to Member States, and to screen samples related to safeguards analysis.<P>
India has previously donated nuclear instrumentation to the Seibersdorf Laboratories, most recently in 1995 when it supplied seven instruments that allow in situ determination of many chemical elements of nuclear and environmental relevance, as well as on-line monitoring of low-level radioactivity of noble gases and elements such as iodine-131.  - <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratories.</I><P>

<H3>World Food Summit</H3></A>
Global leaders from nearly 200 countries and delegates from national, regional, and international organizations are meeting at the World Food Summit in Rome 13-17 November 1996 to renew the commitment to the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of universal food security. 
The Summit is being convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Attending from the IAEA are Mr. Sueo Machi, Deputy Director General heading the Department of Research and Isotopes, and Mr. James Dargie, Director of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. The Department carries out a range of projects and research programmes that assist countries in areas such as child nutrition, soil fertility, crop production, food preservation, plant breeding, animal productivity and health, agrochemicals, and insect and pest control. <P>
The Summit is intended to provide a forum at the highest political level to address the need for action to achieve food security around the world. It is expected to lead to the adoption of appropriate policies and strategies at international and national levels, as well as a plan for implementation involving governments, international institutions, and the private sector. Today more than 800 million people in developing countries face chronic undernutrition and almost 200 million children under the age of five suffer from protein or energy deficiencies, the FAO reports. At the same time, levels of financial commitment to food assistance are falling. If no action is taken to reverse present trends, the number of chronically undernourished people may still be some 730 million by the year 2010, over 300 million of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Summit's agenda recognizes that food security depends on actions and decisions that extend far beyond the agricultural sector. Its objective is to set realistic food security targets that countries can attain individually or in partnership with others.<P>

<H3>Bangladesh Studies Pollution Levels</H3></A>
In work partly supported by the IAEA, scientists at the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) are studying levels of pollution in air and water. One study has found that pollution levels of lead in Bangladesh are among the world's highest during the dry season, according to Dr. M. Khaliquzzaman, a chief scientific officer at BAEC, with levels falling during periods of medium and heavy rainfall. Dr. Khaliquzzaman attributed the high lead levels to the use of leaded fuel in vehicles. He said that lead poses a public health danger, especially  to children, by penetrating the lungs and entering the blood stream, and can lead to impaired intelligence.<P>
The study included work done within the framework of IAEA co-ordinated research and technical co-operation projects. BAEC scientists also are studying water pollution, and they have detected high levels of arsenic in sub-surface water in some parts of the country where countermeasures were then taken.<P>
The IAEA is supporting a number of research programmes and technical co-operation projects to assist Bangladesh and other countries interested in studying heavy metals and other environmental pollutants. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and mercury, among other toxic elements, are all amenable to study by a variety of nuclear and related techniques. Many of these programmes fall within the framework of the United Nations "Agenda 21", a group of activities relating to sustainable development which arose from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.<P>

  <H3>Board moves toward finalizing safeguards measures</H3></A>
At its meetings in June 1996, the IAEA Board of Governors
reviewed the implementation of IAEA safeguards during 1995. It
also gave a green light to moving ahead to finalization of
increased rights and responsibilities for the Agency's safeguards
inspectorate.
<P>
<B>Safeguards implementation in 1995.</B> During 1995, the IAEA
did not
find any indication of the diversion of nuclear material, nor of
the misuse of any facility, equipment, or non-nuclear material
placed under safeguards. It therefore concluded that such items
remained in peaceful use or were otherwise accounted for.
However, the Agency was still unable to verify the initial
declaration made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK). The DPRK is not in full compliance with its safeguards
agreement.
<P>
At the end of 1995, Agency safeguards agreements were in force
with 125 States (and Taiwan, China). Sixty-six of these States
(and Taiwan, China) had nuclear activities and were inspected.
Safeguards were also implemented in five States with bilateral or
multilateral agreements covering specified nuclear or non-nuclear
material, facilities or equipment, as well as at designated
installations in the five nuclear-weapon States. During 1995, a
total of 554 nuclear facilities and other locations containing
nuclear materials were inspected. A total of 2285 inspections
were carried out requiring 10,167 person-days of inspection
effort.
<P>
The IAEA employs approximately 200 field inspectors for this
work, and the budget for this activity in 1995 was US $88.6
million, plus a further US $14 million of extrabudgetary funds
contributed by eight Member States. Most of the IAEA's inspection
work is carried out under agreements pursuant to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which was
extended indefinitely in May 1995.
<P>
<B><I>Other highlights of the IAEA's safeguards activities in
1995.</I></B> The IAEA maintained, and still maintains, a team of
inspectors in Iraq and in the DPRK. In the United States,
safeguards were applied on nuclear material released from the US
military programme in 1995 and voluntarily placed under Agency
safeguards, in addition to material already released in 1994.
Also in 1995, the IAEA conducted verification activities on the
initial inventories of nuclear materials submitted by Belarus,
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, three of the Newly Independent States
emerging from the former Soviet Union.
<P>
Although the IAEA's safeguards activities were effective in 1995,
several implementation difficulties have been encountered. These
included technical difficulties with the Agency's surveillance
equipment and also administrative restrictions imposed by several
States on the designation of inspectors and on the availability
of long-term multiple entry visas for inspectors. The Agency is
taking steps to resolve these problems.
<P>
<B>Measures to strengthen safeguards.</B> In a separate action at
its
June meetings, the Board agreed to establish a special Committee
to negotiate a new legal document that would be attached to
existing comprehensive safeguards agreements. This document would
define <I>inter alia</I> the nature of additional access to
information
and to nuclear-related locations for the Agency's inspectors.
<P>
The Board acknowledged that additional information, including the
taking of environmental samples and increased physical access,
would strengthen the Agency's ability to detect undeclared
nuclear material and activities. It emphasized that the new
measures should strike a balance between the Agency's need for
information and access on the one hand and the State's need to
protect its legitimate interests and to respect its
constitutional obligations on the other. It also emphasized that
implementation of these measures should be subject to strict
rules of confidentiality to be observed by the Agency, with
regard both to information received and to the entire process of
verification. The Board further considered that, in order to
strengthen the Agency's capability to detect in the States
concerned undeclared nuclear material and activities in an
effective manner and increase the efficiency of the safeguards
programme, co-operation is needed from all States. In this
connection, it welcomed the willingness expressed by the
nuclear-weapon States to consider how best to contribute to the
implementation of the strengthened programme under consideration.
<P>
The Board Committee will begin its work in early July under
current Board Chairman Ambassador Joost van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen
of the Netherlands. The Committee is expected to report progress
to  the Board when it next meets in September, and report the
outcome of its work to the Board at its December meeting this
year.
<P>
Commenting on the Board's action, IAEA Director General Hans Blix
said: "This latest and welcome step clearly provides the
necessary momentum and reflects the desire of IAEA Member States,
in the light of experience gained in Iraq and elsewhere in recent
years, to reinforce the IAEA's ability not only to verify
declared nuclear inventories and States' adherence to
non-proliferation pledges, but also to detect indications of
activity that could be indicative of a possible violation of such
undertakings." 
<P>
<B>Director General's Statement.</B> In his introductory
statement to
the Board, Dr. Blix addressed several other matters, including
those related to:
<P>
<B><I>Programme and budget for 1997.</I></B> The Director General
reviewed
measures that the Secretariat had taken in response to comments
that had been raised by the Board's Administrative and Budgetary
Committee in May. The Committee had requested the Secretariat to
revise some of its proposals in the 1997 budget and to look for
further savings in administrative and support costs. Following
its discussion, the Board approved the regular budget for 1997,
authorizing expenditures of US $221.99 million (at an exchange
rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the dollar). It further
recommended a target of US $68 million for voluntary
contributions to the IAEA's Technical Co-operation Fund for 1997.
<P>
<B><I>Technical assistance and co-operation.</I></B> Citing
examples in
Tanzania, Costa Rica, and other countries, the Director General
said that the concept of model projects that now guides technical
co-operation activities "is successfully demonstrating that
nuclear techniques can make an important contribution to social
and economic development". At the same time, he said, the
management of technical co-operation continues to be reviewed to
achieve even greater efficiency and effectiveness. He further
noted that, although the level of contributions to the Technical
Co-operation Fund still is below levels achieved in the 1980s,
the situation has improved and he urged continuation of the
present trend.
Regarding other projects related to the transfer of technology,
Dr. Blix mentioned activities related to the preparation of
feasibility studies for the technology of nuclear desalination
and to applications in isotope hydrology, including two regional
technical co-operation projects in Africa and the Middle East
involving 13 countries having an acute shortage of water.
<P>
<B><I>Safeguards in the DPRK.</I></B> Dr. Blix said that
technical talks
between the IAEA and DPRK are focusing on the need for urgent
implementation of measures adequately to preserve relevant
information without which the Agency will lose the possibility of
being able, in the future, to verify the correctness and
completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration. The discussions
also  cover issues related to safeguards implementation in the
country, including the installation of Agency monitoring
equipment at nuclear waste tanks in the reprocessing plant and
the monitoring of the freeze under the US-DPRK Agreed Framework.
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear safety.</I></B> The Convention on Nuclear Safety is
nearing entry
into force, Dr. Blix reported, and the Agency has taken important
preparatory steps for its implementation, including developing
procedures and guidelines with representatives from Member States
concerning the Convention's peer review process. The draft
Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management has made
good progress, he said, and could be ready by the end of this
year or early next.

<H3>Uranium Resources, Production and Demand</H3>
</A>
The IAEA and Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for
Economic Co-operation
and Development have jointly issued the latest edition of the
"Red Book", Uranium 1995 - <I>Resources, Production and
Demand</I>. It
presents the results of the 1995 review and is the foremost
reference in this field. The report provides a statistical
profile of the world uranium industry as of 1 January 1995. It
contains data on uranium exploration activities, resources, and
production for 54 countries, updating the 1993 edition. New
information is provided for a number of countries for which data
was previously not easily accessible, and this edition contains
reports for 23 of the 25 uranium-producing countries, which
accounted for about 92% of world uranium production in 1994.
<P>
The world uranium market has changed dramatically in the 1990s
due to political and economic developments in uranium-producing
and -consuming regions. The over-production of the 1980s has
changed during this decade to a more ambiguous situation where
production is meeting less than 60% of demand. Meanwhile prices
have remained low because a continued abundant supply of uranium
is expected from new sources. While world nuclear electricity
generating capacity and related fuel cycle requirements continue
to expand modestly, uranium stockpiles are decreasing and
production has been contracting in most regions of the world.
However, a steady increase in uranium spot prices since late 1994
suggests that the situation may be changing.
<P>
The "Red Book" shows that seven nations hold almost 90% of the
world's recoverable uranium resources. For each country, the book
gives the total number of tonnes of uranium oxide which are
"reasonably assured", plus estimated additional resources.
Australia holds 29% followed by Kazakhstan with 19%, Canada with
11%, South Africa and Namibia each with 9%, Brazil with 8%, and
the United States with 4%. - <I>More information may be obtained

<H3>Atoms in Agriculture</H3>
</A>
Agency scientists are playing important roles in the development
of new methodologies being used by developing countries to
improve agricultural production. 
<P>
Leguminous plants, such as soybean or common bean, are important
food and forage crops in developing countries due to their high
protein content. Certain beneficial nitrogen fixing bacteria
(<I>Rhizobium</I> or <I>Bradyrhizobium</I>) found in the root
nodules of these
plants "fix" atmospheric nitrogen and make this important
nutrient available to the plant. These nitrogen fixing systems
play a key role in promoting sustainable agricultural production
by greatly reducing the need for, and lessening the pollution
from, the application of nitrogenous fertilizers. They are also
used in intercropping and mixed cropping systems because nitrogen
is passed on to succeeding or companion crops so maintaining the
fertility of the soil. 
<P>
The Soil Science Unit at the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and
Biotechnology Laboratory in Seibersdorf developed methodologies
that utilized the stable isotope, nitrogen-15, to quantify the
amount of nitrogen fixed and thereby provide a means of selecting
highly effective bacterial strains for inoculating soils. Since
many soils contain aggressive native strains which only fix small
amounts of nitrogen, in addition to effectiveness, competitive
ability is an important parameter. Recently, the Soil Science
Unit developed new molecular biology techniques, known as the
<I>gusA</I> and <I>celB</I> marker gene techniques, for simple
identification
of bacterial strains. Strains marked with either <I>gusA</I> or
<I>celB</I> can
be visualized by the development of a blue or red colour.
Microbial identification is essential in order to select
competitive and stress tolerant strains for inoculation into
soil. Only simple equipment and basic microbiological procedures
are needed to perform the technique. To enable developing
countries to utilize this technology, a GUS Gene Marking Kit was
developed in Seibersdorf by the same Unit. The kit is suitable
for microbiologists and agronomists in countries who wish to use
the system but who are not familiar with the methodology and do
not have the resources to establish it in their laboratories. At
present, 24 scientific groups participating in ongoing FAO/IAEA
Co-ordinated Research Programmes or Technical Co-operation
Projects have received the kit.The development of new molecular
biology methodologies and their transfer to the Third World will
promote the use of "organic" systems in an effort to achieve
sustainable agricultural practices. In addition, they will allow
scientists to gain a better understanding of the immense
diversity of soil bacteria in these countries which has not been
utilized to date.

<H3>Controlling Insect Pests</H3></A>
The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), a
radiation-based technology, is playing a lead role in eradicating
fruit and tsetse flies in Chile, Mali, Tanzania, and Peru, which
is among the latest countries  expressing interest in SIT.
<P>
<B><I>Chile.</I></B> Chile's successful eradication of the
Mediterranean Fruit
Fly with the help of the Sterile Insect Technique is expected to
give the country's fruit industry access to new export markets.
The economic impact to Chile's international trade is estimated
by Chilean authorities to represent an increase of up to US $500
million annually over the next 5 years.
<P>
The Medfly is a pest that destroys millions of dollars in fruit
per year in infested areas. Because of quarantine reasons, it had
been interfering with Chile's multibillion dollar fresh fruit
export industry. Although the southern and central regions of
Chile were already free of this pest, the produce there was still
being restricted from certain international export markets
because of fear of outbreaks originating from the Medfly's
presence in northern Chile. The fly was eradicated using the SIT,
which was applied following a decade of Chile's unsuccessful
attempts to rid its northern region of the fly using
insecticides. The technique relies on rearing vast numbers of
male insects in special facilities where they are sterilized by
low doses of radiation and then released into the wild where they
mate without producing offspring.
<P>
The SIT project was supported by the Joint Division of the IAEA
and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the IAEA's
Department of Technical Co-operation working with the Chilean
Agricultural Service. The Agency provided support in areas of
project planning, the design of the construction of a Medfly
mass-rearing and sterilization facility in Chile's Arica-Lluta
Valley, the training of professional project staff, and the
provision of expert services and specialized equipment. As a
result, a Medfly mass-rearing facility with a production capacity
of about 60 million sterile flies per week was completed in 1993,
when fly releases were initiated. No wild Medflies have been
detected in Chile since early 1995, thereby successfully
concluding the country's 32-year campaign against this pest,
which was first introduced into Chile in 1963. The Chilean
Government's official announcement of the Medfly eradication was
made at a ceremony in December 1995 presided over by the former
President of Chile, the Minister of Agriculture, and foreign
dignitaries. 
<P>
<B><I>Mali.</I></B> The Government of Mali convened a roundtable
in late May
1996 with its development partners to discuss co-ordinating
activities for an integrated approach for the management of
tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis. The French, German, and United
States aid agencies have sponsored livestock-related projects in
the area. Livestock development in much of Africa is limited by
the range of the tsetse fly, which transmits a type of sleeping
sickness called nagana. Livestock infection rates of up to 45%
have been recorded in the peri urban zone of Bamako in Mali. 
<P>
As reported in the June 1996 edition of <A
HREF="/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull382/4briefs.html#mali"
><I>INSIDE TC</I></A> (a
feature series appearing in the  <I>IAEA Bulletin</I>) the
roundtable 27-31 May 1996 discussed the possibility of initiating
area-wide conventional fly suppression activities (traps,
screens, and chemical treatments) involving local communities to
drastically reduce the tsetse population in an area of
approximately 2000 square kilometers. This is a prerequisite for
the potential use of the Sterile Insect Technique. The Government
also is
documenting  through a socio-economic study the extent of the
tsetse and trypanosomiasis problem. On the basis of these
promising discussions, the IAEA now is moving ahead with
technical feasibility studies on aspects of a SIT campaign.

<P>
<B><I>Tanzania.</I></B> A new insectary has been inaugurated at
the mass-rearing facility of the Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis
Research Institute (TTRI) in Tanga. Along with other refurbished
insectaries and new equipment provided by the IAEA with the
support of major donors, the insectary  will be used in a
campaign to combat the tsetse fly on the island of Zanzibar using
the Sterile Insect Technique. 
<P>
In remarks at the inauguration ceremony, IAEA Director General
Hans Blix commended what he described as outstanding progress in
the tsetse eradication project. "The progress made at Tanga and
on Unguja has received considerable attention by other African
countries," he said, noting that other countries in the region
have inquired about the eradication project. For the future
implementation of projects in the region, TTRI may very well be
one of the production facilities to supply the necessary sterile
flies, as well as serving as the major training site for
technicians and scientists, he said.
<P>
<B><I>Peru.</I></B> In co-operation with Chile, Peru is seeking
to eradicate
the Medfly in the southern regions of the country, and to prepare
for an integrated control campaign in other regions. Project
officers from Peru and Chile, which are jointly pursuing
technical assistance for the proposed project, are scheduled to
meet this July in Vienna with IAEA officials and technical staff
to prepare strategies and work plans concerning the project. It
is foreseen that the Agency's support would include providing
Medfly gene-tic sexing technology to the mass-rearing facility in
Chile, as well as training, specialized equipment, and technical
backstopping to field activities in Peru. Under the project, the
Chilean mass-rearing facility would provide the sterile flies to
Peru.
<P>
The eradication campaign already has started in Tacna, the
southernmost valley in Peru. Through a co-operative effort mainly
financed by Chile, more than 20 million sterile Medflies produced
in Chile's Arica facility are being shipped and released weekly
in the Peruvian region. The Medfly is a costly problem for Peru,
whose multi-million dollar fruit production covers more than
175,000 hectares. Estimated losses attributed to the fruit fly
amount to more than US $25 million per year. Mango, grapes,
mandarin, and other citrus are the main fruits for export. Peru's
activities planned are part of an ambitious National Fruit Fly
Control and Eradication Programme.  They include plans to build
two new mass-rearing facilities and to upgrade an older facility
in Lima. They will be used to produce sterile Medflies and
<I>Anastrepha</I> fruit flies, which co-exist with Medflies in
many regions and also must be controlled.

journalists, governmental officials, and nuclear communicators
from Mexico and other countries.  In an opening address, IAEA
Director General Hans Blix focused on the subject of nuclear
energy and sustainable development, citing projects in Mexico and
other countries that are demonstrating the practical and
potential roles of nuclear technologies that support
environmentally sound development. Other speakers addressed a
range of topics, including nuclear energy's use for electricity
generation, the safety of radiation technologies, applications of
radioisotopes in fields of  agriculture, hydrology, and health
care, the transfer of technologies through technical co-operation
programmes, and regional aspects of nuclear non-proliferation.

<B>International Symposium on Experience in the Planning and
Operation of Low-Level Waste Disposal Facilities, 17-21 June
1996, Vienna.</B> Most countries are involved in the management
of
low-level radioactive wastes (LLW) that arise from nuclear fuel
cycle activities and  from the use of radionuclides in medicine,
research, and industry. In some countries, LLW disposal
facilities have been in operation for many years and a
considerable base of experience in operation exists. A few
repositories have even reached the end of their operational lives
and have been closed, so a limited amount of experience now
exists on closure and post-closure phases of waste disposal. On
the other hand, efforts in other countries are still being made
to site and license the first repositories. 
<P>
In opening the symposium, IAEA Deputy Director General for
Nuclear Energy, Mr. V. Mourogov, cited the extensive experience
that has been gained worldwide in the disposal of low-level
radioactive waste. "Spin-offs from this experience can contribute
much toward the development of facilities for the disposal of
high-level waste and long-lived radioactive waste in deep
geological formations," he said. 
<P>
The symposium brought together experts from countries with
varying degrees of experience in the field. Participants
addressed topics related to organizational issues (including the
regulatory framework, planning, licensing, and identification of
inventories); siting (criteria and approaches, including
socio-economic considerations); site investigation and
evaluation); design (criteria and approaches; performance of
engineered barrier; design of repository); construction;
operation (commissioning; waste acceptance; waste emplacement;
control of operation; monitoring); closure (criteria and
approaches; capping system and performance); post-closure
approaches (institutional control issues; monitoring and
corrective action; recordkeeping); safety assessment
(methodology; use of case studies); quality assurance; research
and development; and international and regional co-operation.

<P>
<B>FAO/IAEA International Symposium on the Use of Nuclear and
Related Techniques for Studying Environmental Behaviour of Crop
Protection Chemicals, 1-5 July 1996, Vienna.</B> Pesticides are
an
integral component of agricultural systems throughout the world.
It is generally accepted that this will continue for the
foreseeable future in many circumstances if the production of
food of acceptable quality is to increase. However, pesticide use
has costs as well as benefits. As far as the environment is
concerned, information must be provided before a product is
registered to provide assurance that it can be used without
unacceptable hazard to non-target organisms. In addition,
post-registration surveillance and monitoring studies are
necessary to check that the fate and environmental effects of
pesticides under field conditions are consistent with
predictions. Much of the data is generated with the use of
radioisotopes and other nuclear or related methods which can be
applied in studies related to the fate and effects of pesticides
in the various environmental compartments (soil, water, and air)
and in terrestrial (agricultural and non-agricultural) and marine
ecosystems. 
<P>
For a variety of reasons, developing countries often have to rely
on data generated elsewhere in order to assess the acceptability
of a compound, particularly if it is off-patent. This symposium
was organized to examine the circumstances under which
extrapolation from one environment to another is valid on the
basis of data generated under comparable conditions. It also
considered ways in which relatively simple methods can be used to
verify the field applicability of data obtained in sophisticated
experimental conditions. Symposium proceedings are being
published by the IAEA.

Nuclear Power as an Energy Source</H3></A>
Speaking at a nuclear
conference in Kalmar in June 1996, IAEA Director General Hans
Blix reviewed the actual and potential role of nuclear power as
an energy source in the context of safety, environmental, and
other issues. He addressed the Conference on Accelerator-Driven
Transmutation Technologies and Applications, which the Agency
co-sponsored.
<P>
"Nuclear power is a demanding technology," he said, "but it is
the technology that for the foreseeable time has the greatest
potential to give significant amounts of energy with minimal
contribution of greenhouse gases. As it is economically viable,
it does provide a `no regret' option. Even a drastic expansion of
nuclear power might not, alone, give the response we need to the
greenhouse threat, but it could go a rather long way."
<P>
In noting that nuclear power development has stagnated in many
countries, while growing modestly in others, Dr. Blix pointed out
that all sources of electricity generation will be needed in
years ahead to meet the world's rising demands. He cautioned,
however, against an over-reliance on coal, oil, and gas which now
dominate the energy picture, or on the potential role of
renewable energy sources, which can be expected to contribute
marginally to production. Regarding nuclear development, he urged
that all efforts should continue to further reduce the risk of
accidents, to develop solutions which already exist for the
disposal of nuclear wastes, to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons and illicit trafficking in nuclear material, to
develop new types of nuclear reactors that are safer, simpler,
and even more economic than present ones, and to find broader use
of nuclear power than just electricity generation. - <I>The full

<H3>Nuclear Electricity Generation in OECD Countries</H3></A>
Electricity produced from nuclear power stations in Member
countries of the
Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) should continue to grow, from
1902 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1995 to 2171 TWh in 2010. However,
the nuclear share of total OECD  electricity production, which
stood at 24.6% in 1995, is projected to stabilize at 24% in the
year 2000, and to decline slightly to 21.7% by 2010. Electricity
demand should continue to grow at about 1.7% annually beyond the
year 2000. This information is published in the annual survey,
Nuclear Energy Data, which is based on official statistics and
projections to 2010 submitted by OECD/NEA countries. The survey
shows that nuclear energy currently represents about 76% of total
electricity production in France; 55% in Belgium; 46% in Sweden,
39% in Switzerland; 36% in the Republic of Korea; 33% in Spain;
32% in Japan; 30% in Finland; 30% in Germany; 26% in the United

<H3>Radioactive Waste Safety</H3></A>
Agreement has been reached in Paris
between the United States Department of Energy (DOE), the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), and the IAEA to organize an
international peer review of the long-term safety analysis of the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a US disposal facility
expected to receive long-lived radioactive waste in the near
future. 
<P>
This peer review, requested by the US DOE's Carlsbad Area Office,
will be organized jointly by the NEA and IAEA as part of the
services offered by the two agencies in the field of radioactive
waste management to their Member States. The WIPP is designed to
permanently dispose of transuranic radioactive waste generated by
defense-related activities. Transuranic waste consists primarily
of clothing, tools, rags, and other disposal items contaminated
with radioactive elements, mostly plutonium. Located in the State
of New Mexico, 42 km (26 miles) east of Carlsbad, WIPP facilities
include disposal rooms excavated in an ancient, stable rock salt
formation, 654 meters (2150 feet) underground. As in most
countries with nuclear programmes, the preferred method for the
disposal of long-lived radioactive waste, such as transuranic
waste, is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple
barriers located in deep and stable geological formations. The
WIPP site was selected and constructed to meet criteria
established by the responsible US regulatory authority, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for the safe long-term
disposal of transuranic waste. A formal license application for
the disposal of transuranic waste at this site is to be submitted
by the DOE to the EPA. This application, called the Compliance
Certification Application, will include an assessment of the
long-term safety of the repository after its closure. 
<P>
The objective of the joint NEA/IAEA peer review will be to
examine whether the post-closure assessment of the WIPP is
appropriate, technically sound, and in conformity with
international standards and practices. For the purpose of the
review, the NEA and IAEA will constitute a joint secretariat and
appoint a group of independent international experts in the
various disciplines involved in long-term safety assessments,
such as geology, geochemistry, material sciences, radiation and
environmental protection, and nuclear safety. The expert group
will include representatives from nuclear regulatory bodies,
radioactive waste management agencies, universities, and research
institutions.
<P>
The review will start in October 1996 and be conducted over a
6-month period, on the basis of detailed documentation provided
by the US Department of Energy and discussions with the
specialists involved in this project during a visit to the WIPP.
A report containing the international expert group's findings
will be transmitted to the Department of Energy. Through such
reviews, it is possible to benefit from the experience of the
world's leading experts in nuclear waste disposal and
radiological safety assessments and to take into account the
approaches followed by other advanced countries towards the safe
disposal of long-lived radioactive waste. These reviews are in
line with the NEA and IAEA common objective of promoting the
adoption of safe policies and practices for the disposal of
radioactive waste in their respective member countries.

<H3>Summit Meeting</H3></A>
<P>Leaders of the Group of Seven countries and the
Russian Federation singled out efforts of the IAEA in key areas
of nuclear development at the Moscow Summit hosted by President
Yeltsin in Moscow 19-20 April 1996.
<P>
Specifically, official documents issued after the Summit
expressed strong support for the Agency's safeguards inspection
regime, which plays a critical role in providing assurance
against diversion of nuclear materials. They also called for
efforts to stimulate work already in hand for the strengthening
of the safeguards regime and at the same time called upon States
to provide adequate funding for this purpose.
<P>
The IAEA further noted that the reported intention of the Russian
Federation to place sensitive nuclear material surplus to weapon
requirements under Agency inspection in the future would
reinforce a trend already initiated by the United States.
However, such inspection would obviously entail a significant
increase in the Agency's inspection responsibilities over time.
<P>
With respect to the subject of the "safe and effective management
of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for
defense purposes", the G-7 stated its intention to convene an
international meeting of experts, preferably by the end of this
year, to examine available options and possible development of
international co-operation in the implementation of national
strategies. In the IAEA's view, this meeting could usefully
complement the Agency Symposium on fuel cycle and reactor
strategies planned in 1997.
<P>
The Summit further addressed the issue of the liability regime,
which seeks to ensure adequate compensation for damages arising
from nuclear accidents. Leaders expressed desire to see progress
in this area, which could lend new impetus to work currently
under way in the framework of the IAEA.
<P>
Physical protection of nuclear materials was another area of
increasing importance discussed at the Summit. The G-7 encouraged
ratification of the relevant Convention by all States and
application of recommendations developed within the IAEA in this
regard. The Agency's Secretariat is doing everything it can,
within existing overall resource constraints, to provide
assistance in this domain to Member States wishing it.
<P>
The Summit also called upon States to fully support international
safety conventions under IAEA auspices. Specifically, leaders
urged countries to sign the Convention on Nuclear Safety so that
it can be brought into force, and they called for the effective
finalization and prompt adoption of the Convention on the Safety
of Radioactive Waste Management, which is being drafted under
aegis of the IAEA. - <I>The full text of the Moscow Nuclear
Safety and Security Summit Declaration has been issued by the

<H3>Mururoa Radiological Study</H3></A>
<P>Starting in July for about one
month, international teams of scientists are collecting
terrestrial and marine samples at the Pacific atolls of Mururoa
and Fangataufa in the context of the radiological study requested
from the IAEA by the Government of France. Teams are visiting the
atolls in relays, to collect samples including plankton, fish,
seawater, lagoon sediment, coral, soil, coconuts, and vegetation.
The samples will be shared subsequently for analysis with a grid
of laboratories worldwide, including the Pacific region. Results
will be forwarded to the IAEA in Vienna, whose own laboratories
in Seibersdorf, Austria and in Monaco will also be participating
both in the sample-taking and the analytical work. Data from
French studies already undertaken will be available for
comparative purposes in the scientific work to determine the
radiological situation at the atolls. This part of the overall
study is expected to take up to six months to complete. 
<P>
Separately, geological specialists will be examining the
situation regarding possible future scenarios, including the very
long term, using modelling techniques taking as their starting
point <I>inter alia</I> the geological characteristics of the
atolls, experience gained at other nuclear test sites, and
information provided by the French authorities regarding their
own series of tests. The results of this work will then be
consolidated with other parts of the study and made publicly
available. The final report is expected to be published in early
1998.  
<P>
The study is being conducted under the guidance and direction of
an International Advisory Committee of distinguished scientists
from ten countries, chaired by Dr. E. Gail de Planque of the
United States, and including ex officio representatives of the
South Pacific Forum, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects
of Atomic Radiation, the World Health Organization, and the
European Commission. The Committee itself intends to visit French
Polynesia at a later date, at which time a press conference is
foreseen on the study's progress.

  <H3>Chernobyl Conference sums up Scientific
Understanding</H3></A>
An International Conference in Vienna has summed up the
scientific understanding of the major health and environmental
consequences attributed to the Chernobyl accident that occurred
in Ukraine a decade ago. More than 800 scientists and government
officials in fields of nuclear energy and radiation safety
attended the meeting, which was jointly sponsored by the IAEA,
European Commission (EC), and World Health Organization (WHO).
Participants included high-level governmental representatives
from the accident's three most heavily affected countries - 
Belarus, Russian Federation, and Ukraine - plus delegates from
more than 70 other States and inter-governmental organizations.
The Conference carefully reviewed the scientific, medical,
environmental, social, and political issues involved in assessing
Chernobyl's impact, in the context of major changes over the past
decade in countries of the former Soviet Union. 
<P>
"The Chernobyl reactor accident covers a dimension which goes far
beyond the boundaries of nuclear safety and radiation
protection",
said Dr. Angela Merkel, Germany's Environment Minister and
President of the Conference.  "The actual effects of this
disaster
have social and economic aspects which are possibly far more
significant than radiation exposure itself."
<P>
While the Conference ( 8-12 April 1996) did not expect to reach
scientific consensus on all issues involved, its Joint
Secretariat did issue conclusions and recommendations that place
the Chernobyl consequences into perspective and can serve as the
factual basis for decisions about future work and collaboration.
Highlights of the findings include those related to:
<P>
<B><I>Accident Initial Fatalities and Injuries.</I></B> The
explosion on 26 April 1986 and early release of radionuclides
resulted in 30 deaths, including 28 deaths attributed to acute
radiation sickness. These fatalities occurred among the 134 plant
staff, firefighters, and emergency workers ("liquidators") who 
initially responded to the accident and who suffered from severe
radiation sickness that was treated in hospitals. Since then,
over the past decade, while 14 additional patients have died,
only some of these might be directly attributable to radiation
exposure.
<P>
<B><I>Incidence of Thyroid Cancer.</I></B> There has been a
substantial increase in reported cases of thyroid cancer in
Belarus, Ukraine, and some parts of Russia, especially in young
children, generally attributed to exposure to radioiodine during
the early phases of the accident in 1986. Up to the end of 1995,
a total of about 800 cases (including 400 in Belarus alone) have
been reported in children who were under age 15 at the time of
diagnosis. To date, three children have died from thyroid cancer.
Over the next decades, there will most probably be an increase in
the incidence of thyroid cancer among those who were children in
1986; the estimated number of cases is in the range of a few
thousand but there is considerable uncertainty about this. The
group at risk should be closely monitored throughout their
lives, since treatment should be successful in most cases that
are diagnosed early.
<P>
<B><I>Long-Term Radiation Health Effects.</I></B> Apart from
increases in thyroid cancer, there has been no statistically
significant deviation in the incidence rates of other cancers
that can be attributed to radiation exposure due to the accident.
Based on predictive models, it is estimated that the number of
future deaths from leukaemia is of the order of 200 among the 3.7
million residents of the contaminated territories and 200 among
the 200,000 front-line liquidators who worked at Chernobyl in
1986-87. Leukaemia is an early indicator of radiation health
impact. The fact that it has not been seen to date provides
reassurance that early predictions are not severely in error.
<P>
<B><I>Other Health-Related Factors.</I></B> Many changes in
health have been seen in the exposed population that are not the
result of radiation exposure. There are significant health
disorders and symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and various
psychosomatic disorders attributable to mental stress among the
population in the region. The psychological impact cannot be
completely dissociated from that of the breakup of the Soviet
Union, and any forecast should therefore take into account the
economic, social, and political circumstances of the three
countries.
<P>
<B><I>Environmental Consequences.</I></B> No dramatically obvious
long-term impacts on populations or ecosystems have been
observed. Effective countermeasures can be taken at specific
sites to achieve significant reduction in the uptake of
radiocaesium into food. In general, no food produced by the
collective farm system exceeds established international
radiation levels, although some foods produced by private farmers
does.
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear Safety Remedial Measures.</I></B> The technical
causes of the Chernobyl accident are well known and the safety
levels of the 15 RBMK plants operating in Lithuania, Russia, and
Ukraine have been raised to practically prevent the same type of
accident from occurring again. More RBMK safety improvements are
required, however, and further steps are needed to stabilize the
sarcophagus built to confine the destroyed Chernobyl Unit-4. RBMK
safety issues were examined at an international forum in early
April in Vienna and were reported to the subsequent Chernobyl
Conference <I>(see following item.)</I>
<P> 
The Conference featured various sessions at which experts
reviewed the findings of work done to date, including the outcome
of two major international conferences, one hosted in November
1995 by WHO and the another in March 1996 under EC auspices in
Minsk. Opening addresses were made by IAEA Director General Hans
Blix; WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima; H. Tent, Director
General for Science, Research and Development of the EC; and M.
Griffiths, Director of the United Nations Department for
Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA). The Conference further featured
national statements by Alyaksandr Lukashenko, President of
Belarus; A. Shoigu, Minister for Emergencies, Russian Federation;
and Yevgeni Marchuk, Prime Minister of Ukraine; and seven keynote
presentations by representatives of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); 
United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
Radiation (UNSCEAR); Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of
the United Nations; Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; and of
organizations in Germany, Japan, and the United States on the
results of major bilateral post-Chernobyl assistance projects
with Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.
<P>
The technical symposium featured eight separate topical sessions
on the range of social, health, and environmental subjects.
Topics included clinically observed heath effects; thyroid
effects; longer term health effects; other health-related
effects, including psychological effects, stress and anxiety;
consequences for the environment; the social, economic,
institutional and political impact; nuclear safety remedial
measures; and the consequences in perspective, a prognosis for
the future. A panel discussion further explored the public's
perception of the Chernobyl accident. Proceedings of the
Conference are being published by the IAEA. <B><I>Highlights of
the Conference are available through the IAEA's World Atom
Internet Services at the address <A HREF="/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl/">

<H3>International Forum on the Safety of RBMK Reactors.</A></H3>
Safety specialists meeting at an international forum have
recommended that further improvements, and associated financial
support, are needed to upgrade the safety of RBMK reactors,
fifteen of which are operating in three countries - Lithuania,
Russia, and Ukraine. They further recommended that action
be taken to reinforce the stability of the sarcophagus built
around the Chernobyl RBMK reactor destroyed in the 1986 accident.

The forum was organized by the IAEA and UN Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) to examine remedial measures and
actions taken since the Chernobyl accident to improve the safety
of RBMK reactors and to review issues concerning the sarcophagus.
<P>
Over the past decade, a considerable amount of work has been
carried out by Russian designers and operators to improve RBMK
safety and to eliminate the causes that led to the Chernobyl
accident. As a result, major design and operational modifications
have been implemented. In addition to these actions, the IAEA
initiated in 1992 a safety programme for RBMKs with the aim of
consolidating results of various national, bilateral, and
multilateral activities and to establish international consensus
on required safety improvements and related priorities. Through
this programme, international assistance is provided to both
regulatory and operating organizations involved in technical and
financial decisions. The IAEA's activities are co-ordinated with
those of an international consortium on the  "Safety of Design
Solutions and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants with RBMK 
Reactors"  established under auspices of the European Commission.
The IAEA has prepared a consolidated list of design and
operational safety issues for RBMKs. The list suggests safety
upgradings in a number of areas: core design and core monitoring;
instrumentation and control; pressure boundary integrity;
incident and accident analysis; safety and support systems; fire
protection; and operational safety. 
<P>
In reviewing the safety of RBMKs, the forum concluded that
important safety improvements had been made in the design and
operation of the units, and that in some respects the RBMK design
exhibits some favourable safety features. However, safety
concerns remain, particularly regarding the older, or 
"first-generation", units which were designed to early safety
standards and whose backfitting may not be feasible or cost
effective. It was recognized, however, that the existing
upgrading programmes for these units address most of the safety
concerns. With the second and third generations of RBMK plants,
the design of safety systems and the protection against hazards
have been considerably improved. After the backfits immediately
related to the causes of the Chernobyl accident, these
generations of RBMKs basically meet most of the defense-in-depth
safety objectives applied to modern nuclear power plants. For
other safety issues, safety upgrading is under way or planned.
The realization of this stage of upgrading has encountered and
still encounters large difficulties, which are seen as a major if
not the main current problem for RBMK safety. The forum found
that international co-operation can essentially contribute to a
more extensive technical co-operation on plant-specific safety
evaluations to strengthen the dynamic approach to safety
improvements, and to help assure financial resources for
improving quality, documentation, safety design, and the conduct
of operation.
<P>
Regarding the sarcophagus, the forum concluded that the
structure's stability is a significant problem and that there are
a number of other site-specific problems, including radioactive
waste issues, that must be addressed. Although the sarcophagus
has largely prevented the release of radioactive substances since
it was built 10 years ago, greater research efforts are need to
develop and implement a design for a permanent and ecologically
safe enclosure. The forum called for an integrated step-by-step
approach to stabilize the sarcophagus and to address other
site-specific problems, and it emphasized that substantial human
and financial resources will be needed to achieve results. -

<H3>IAEA Board of Governors</A></H3>
At its meetings in March 1996, the IAEA Board of Governors
continued its discussion of the second part of proposed measures
for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency
of safeguards. It further considered reports by IAEA Director
General Hans Blix on the implementation of safeguards in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and on the
implementation of UN Security Council resolutions relating to
nuclear inspections in Iraq. Other matters before the Board
included items related to nuclear safety.
<P>
<B><I>Safeguards Development Programme.</I></B> The Board resumed
its consideration of the second part of proposed measures for
strengthening the IAEA's safeguards system. The proposals under
discussion (Part 2 measures) are those requiring complementary
legal authority. The Board commended the Agency for responding
positively to several concerns that had been previously raised by
some Member States. While it raised a number of points about
certain of the Part 2 measures, the Board emphasized the need to
maintain the present momentum and encouraged Member States to
co-operate in the interests of finalizing the measures. 
<P>
In his statement to the Board, Dr. Blix said that considerable
progress had been made towards achieving consensus on Part 2
measures, and that the IAEA is continuing to make progress on the
implementation of Part 1 measures, which the Board already has
approved. Concerning these measures, he said that consultations
with States have been initiated to discuss the implementation of
specific measures, such as increased co-operation, no-notice
inspections, and the collection of environmental samples. He
further noted that the Agency's newly inaugurated Clean
Laboratory for safeguards analysis at Seibersdorf will soon be in
full operation and able to receive and process samples.  
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK.</B> Dr. Blix informed the Board that
only limited progress had resulted from technical discussions
that took place in the DPRK in late January 1996, and that a
further round of technical talks is being scheduled. An important
issue to be resolved concerns the preservation of information
required for the Agency to verify the correctness and
completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration of its nuclear
material subject to safeguards. The issue of monitoring of
nuclear waste also remains to be resolved, he said. While the
DPRK's full co-operation has not been forthcoming, he said that
the Agency is now able to resume ad-hoc and routine inspections
at facilities not subject to the freeze of the DPRK's nuclear
programme foreseen in the US/DPRK Agreed Framework, and that it
has received relevant accounting reports for these facilities. 
<P>
In expressing its support of the Agency's efforts, the Board
renewed its call for the DPRK to co-operate fully with the IAEA;
reaffirmed that the safeguards agreement is still in force and
binding on the DPRK; and particularly emphasized the need to
preserve intact all relevant information required in order to
verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial
declaration.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq.</B> The Board received a report
on IAEA implementation of nuclear verification activities in Iraq
under terms of UN Security Council resolutions. A major component
of current work relates to assessing the documentation that was
provided to the IAEA in 1995 following the departure from Iraq of
a high-level Iraqi official and to following up leads from that
documentation. The work is proceeding in parallel with ongoing
monitoring and verification activities. In his Board statement,
Dr. Blix pointed out the continuing challenge of the work,
particularly citing recent developments in Iraq and the problems
encountered by inspectors of the UN Special Commission.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety.</B> A number of matters were considered. The
Board approved the revised <I>Code on Quality Assurance for
Safety in Nuclear Power Plants and Other Nuclear
Installations</I> for publication as a Safety Standards document
of the Agency. The Code sets out requirements for establishing
and implementing a quality assurance programme, and for its
assessment. The Board also commented upon the Overview of the
IAEA's <I>Nuclear Safety Review</I>, which is issued annually as
part of the <I>IAEA Yearbook</I>. The <I>Review</I> discusses
elements of the global nuclear safety culture, notably legally
binding international agreements, non-binding safety standards,
and review and advisory services. It also focuses on the
importance of information-sharing from intergovernmental safety
conferences and other meetings, and examines topical safety
issues of particular relevance to the Agency's activities and the
global community.

<H3>Radiological Study of the Mururoa and Fangataufa
Atolls</A></H3>
The <A HREF="/worldatom/program/safety/mururoa/iac.html">International Advisory Committee (IAC)</A> heading a radiological
study of the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia
held its first formal planning meeting at IAEA headquarters 13-14
April 1996. Among other items, the Committee discussed the
proposed terms of reference and action plans of its <A HREF="/worldatom/program/safety/mururoa/management.html">task groups
and working groups</A>, whose chairpersons met at the IAEA 11-12
April before the IAC meeting. 
<P>
In March 1996, a four-member IAEA technical team completed a
reconnaissance mission to the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls to
help lay the groundwork for the radiological study. The team
checked equipment and facilities for future measurement and
sampling work. It also surveyed the lagoon's marine environment,
and the soil, bedrock, vegetation, and biota in the terrestrial
strips of the atolls.
<P>
Requested by the French authorities, the study covers the current
radiological situation at the atolls and an evaluation of the
long-term radiological situation. The French authorities have
agreed to provide the IAEA with information and data required for
performing the study. The taking of terrestrial and marine
  samples is scheduled over the next several months. Analysis of
the collected samples will be done by the IAEA's laboratories in
Seibersdorf, Austria, and in Monaco, as well as by a network of
laboratories worldwide. The study, funded through a voluntary
contribution from France of US $1.8 million, is expected to take
approximately 18 months.
<P>
The IAC was established by IAEA Director General Hans Blix and is
chaired by Dr. Gail de Planque, a radiation specialist and former
member of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Other
members include experts from Argentina, Australia, Germany,
Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, Sweden,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. There are also <I>ex
officio</I> experts selected by intergovernmental bodies - the
South Pacific Forum, the United Nations Scientific Committee on
the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the World Health Organization,
and the European Commission. The IAC's work is supported by two
task groups and a number of working groups with a total of about
40 experts. Project management and co-ordination are being
undertaken by the IAEA. - <I>More information may be obtained

<H3>Safeguards Support</A></H3> 
An ultraviolet-sensitive telephoto lens for the Cerenkov Viewing
Device (CVD) has been developed for IAEA safeguards through the
Swedish and Canadian Safeguards Support Programmes. The lens will
improve the unintrusive verification of light-water reactor fuel
by providing a larger image and more detailed Cerenkov
characteristics. The lens has advanced light-gathering
capabilities and high resolution, thus enabling more effective
verification of fuel having a long cooling time and low burnup.
The CVD is a Canadian-developed instrument routinely used by
safeguards inspectors. The hand-held device provides
inspectors with an image displaying the ultraviolet light
resulting from the Cerenkov effect that occurs when spent fuel is
submerged in water. Inspectors are trained to search for specific
light patterns during their verification of the fuel.
<P>
The new 250-mm lens was developed at the IAEA's request to meet
demanding verification requirements. While the standard CVD lens
works well for fuel from pressurized-water reactors, the Cerenkov
characteristics of a particular fuel assembly from boiling-water
reactors or WWERs are more difficult to distinguish and required
an advanced lens. When fitted with the new telephoto lens, the
CVD provides inspectors with a much larger image of the spent
fuel and more Cerenkov characteristics upon which to base
conclusions. Laboratory and field testing has confirmed the
improved performance of the new lens. Field testing of the
prototype has been done in Finland and Sweden with the assistance
of the Finnish Safeguards Support Programme. The Agency has
placed an order for the new lenses that inspectors would begin
using for verification of spent fuel. On 22 March 1996, a
prototype lens was presented to Mr. Bruno Pellaud, IAEA Deputy
Director General for Safeguards, by co-ordinators of the Canadian
and Swedish Safeguards Support Programmes.

<H3>Workshop on Modelling Methods for Water Systems</A></H3> 
A group of hydrologists, geologists, and geochemists from
water-scarce regions of West Asia recently participated in an
IAEA workshop focusing on the methodology of modelling
groundwater systems. The workshop was organized by the IAEA's
Isotope Hydrology Section within the framework of a regional
technical co-operation project. Scientists from Iran, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and Yemen attended
the workshop. Training was provided by experts from the United
States Geological Survey, which has developed modelling methods
and relevant computer codes.
<P>
Assessments of the availability and quality of groundwater
resources increasingly apply the tools of computer technology.
The workshop is among Agency activities that seek to accelerate
the application of software for modelling groundwater systems for
quantitative evaluation of isotope and chemical data. The
training provided hands-on experience in applying computer codes
developed primarily to understand the dynamics of groundwater
flow. The tools also are useful for predicting the condition of
groundwater systems at certain time periods, and movements of
pollutants. Future training courses are expected to be organized
in association with participating countries in the IAEA's
regional technical co-operation project. They are expected to
assist institutes responsible for water resources in improving 
their quantitative understanding of aquifers and to develop
predictive models of pollutant movements, thereby fostering
better water management strategies and policies. - <I>More

<H3>Uranium Market Trends</A></H3>
Given recent market trends in the price and inventories of
uranium, world uranium production will have to increase
significantly from current levels to meet future reactor
requirements. As foreseen by the IAEA in the early 1990s, both 
the price and production of uranium have recovered dramatically
over recent years following a lengthy market decline. 
<P>
Since October 1994, the spot price of uranium that most utilities
must pay increased 33% by January 1996, and by another 40% by
March 1996. The spot price of uranium produced in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has also more than
doubled since October 1994. Before the increase, uranium spot
prices had been declining in the 1990s because of low-priced
uranium sales of excess inventories and supplies from the CIS.
Consequently, since 1990, world production has been below 
reactor requirements, as the cumulative drawdown of world uranium
inventories reached about 113,000 tonnes uranium. Annual
inventory drawdowns during 1993 and 1994 supplied about 45% of
the world's reactor requirements. In 1996, the total production
shortfall is estimated to be about 25,000 tonnes uranium.
<P>
While recent upward price trends have brightened the picture, the
imbalance between production and demand remains, and projections
are that more uranium will have to be produced to stabilize the
market. Starting around the turn of the century, part of the
supply is expected to come from uranium fuel made from highly
enriched uranium recovered from nuclear warheads. This fuel will
probably enter the market at a rate that meets less than 10% of
annual world requirements through 2010. Reprocessed uranium may
meet another 5%. This leaves about 85% of the reactor
requirements through 2010 that will have to be met from new
production. As a result, world uranium production will have to
increase by about 70% from current levels. It is unclear whether
this level of production can be met. While there are ample known
uranium resources to supply reactor requirements well into the
next century, the long depressed uranium market has caused a
severe shortage of mines and mills. Developing new facilities
will take time, as well as a large investment. Currently the
market price of uranium is moving up to a level at which such
investments would become attractive and restore a balance between
uranium production and demand. - <I>More information may be

<H3>Security Council Resolution on Iraq</A></H3> 
The UN Security Council on 27 March 1996 unanimously adopted a
resolution to bring into force a mechanism for monitoring sales
or supplies to Iraq of certain items or technologies that could
be used for the production or acquisition of banned biological,
chemical, and nuclear weapons.  The mechanism - developed by the
Sanctions Committee, the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM), and the IAEA as part of previously adopted Security
Council resolutions - will be operated by a joint unit of UNSCOM
and the IAEA.
<P>
Under the resolution (SC Resolution 1051), the Security Council
decided that all States shall transmit to the joint unit the
notifications, with the data from potential exporters and all
other relevant information available to the States, on the
intended sale or supply to Iraq from their territories of any
items or technologies that are subject to monitoring. It further
decided that all States shall report to the joint unit any
information they may have at their disposal or may receive from
suppliers in their territories of attempts to circumvent the
mechanism or to supply Iraq with items prohibited to Iraq under
the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification. Notifications
to the joint unit by Iraq of its intended imports of monitored
items are to begin 60 days from the adoption of the resolution.
All other States are required to provide notification of intended
supplies at a date to be decided following consultations with
members of the Security Council.
<P>
The resolution notes that the monitoring mechanism is not a
regime for international licensing, but rather for timely
provision of information by States in which companies are located
which are contemplating sales or supplies to Iraq of items
covered by the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification.
Within 45 days of the resolution's adoption,  UNSCOM and the IAEA
are required to provide all States with information necessary to
make preparatory arrangements for implementing the mechanism's
provisions. - <I>The <A

<H3>South East Asian NWFZ</A></H3> 
Thailand and the IAEA have opened preliminary discussions
concerning relevant provisions of the South East Asian
Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone (NWFZ) Treaty. The Treaty, for which
Thailand is the Depositary Government, was signed in Bangkok 15
December 1995 by 10 States: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam (all members of the
Association of South East Asian Nations or ASEAN) and Cambodia,
Laos, and Myanmar.
<P>
In addressing the IAEA Board of Governors in March 1996, Director
General Hans Blix noted that the Treaty, similar to other NWFZ
treaties, requires its parties to conclude safeguards agreements
with the IAEA. It also contains other provisions. These include
the requirement that peaceful nuclear activities in the NWFZ be
subject to safety assessments conforming to IAEA standards. The
Treaty, with respect to its control system, also makes provision
for fact-finding missions conducted by inspectors of the IAEA.

<H3>Radioactive Waste Management</A></H3> 
An expert group established by the IAEA on ways to enhance
international co-operation with the Russian Federation in areas
of radioactive waste management met in Moscow in early 1996.
Participating in the meeting were representatives from 12
countries - Belgium Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan,
Republic of Korea, Norway, Russian Federation, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, and the United States - and from four international
organizations, including the European Commission. Among items
discussed were proposed co-operative activities and the possible
role of the IAEA in supporting the work.
<P>
The meeting is part of activities following an international
seminar that the Agency convened in May 1995. The seminar was
organized in response to a request of the Joint Council of the
Nordic countries and with the approval of the Russian Federation.
The seminar included presentations on co-operative programmes in
areas of radioactive waste management with Russia, and reports on
Russia's waste management programme, structure, and problems. One
aim was to identify priority areas where enhanced international
co-operation would be useful for strengthening radioactive waste
management in the Russian Federation.

<H3>Nuclear Seminar in Poland</A></H3> 
Safety and economic features of advanced nuclear power plants
will be presented at an international seminar in Warsaw 25-27
September 1996. Participating will be representatives from the
world's leading nuclear plant suppliers and governmental experts
involved in decisions about Poland's energy future. Entitled "New
Generation Nuclear Power Plants `96", the seminar is being
organized by the Polish Nuclear Society and the Association of
Polish Electrical Engineers under the patronage of the Ministry
of Industry and Trade, National Atomic Energy Agency, and the
Polish Power Grid Company. Co-sponsors of the meeting, which is
being convened in co-operation with the IAEA, include the
European Nuclear Society, Convention of National Societies of
Electrical Engineers of Europe, the American Nuclear Society, and
the IEE Power Engineering Society.
<P>
The seminar is intended to update participants about the types of
new nuclear plants that are being developed, and to provide
status reports on their safety features and related regulatory
matters. Additionally, papers will be presented on technical
aspects of radioactive waste management and nuclear power plant
decommissioning. 
<P>
In Poland, which in the early 1990s decided to discontinue its
nuclear power programme, rising demand for electricity, as well
as replacement of ageing plants, will require construction of new
electric power plants in years ahead. More than 60% of the
country's existing power plants, predominately coal and
gas-fired, have been operating for 20 years or more. - <I>More

<H3>Board Examining Second Part of Safeguards Proposals</H3></A>
The second part of proposals for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system is set for
further consideration by the Agency's 35-member Board of Governors at their next meetings in March 1996. The proposals are
a product of the safeguards development programme known as  93+2, which includes provisions that would broaden the Agency's access
to relevant information and sites. 
<P>
During 1995, the Board approved the implementation of certain measures (Part 1) and began its discussion of those requiring
complementary authority (Part 2 measures). At its meetings in December 1995, the Board discussed Part 2 measures in more detail
and welcomed the Agency's efforts in consultation with Member States towards finalizing them. Discussions focused on a 
Secretariat draft paper explaining the various measures and showing how the necessary complementary authority could
be defined in a protocol to existing comprehensive safeguards agreements. In his remarks to the Board, IAEA Director General
Hans Blix said that efforts are continuing toward working out details of the proposals and noted that a good deal of progress
had been achieved to date. He said the challenge has been one of striking a balance between measures that would strengthen
safeguards and the technical, legal, and administrative constraints facing governments. 
<P> 
In his Board statement, Dr. Blix addressed a number of other matters. They included the Agency's implementation of safeguards
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which remains in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement; possible
roles for the IAEA under a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is being negotiated at the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva; and the study to assess the radiological situation at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls, which France has requested the
Agency to co-ordinate, starting in the spring. 
<P>
<B><I>Safeguards in the DPRK.</I></B> In reviewing developments concerning the DPRK over the past months, the Director General
said that while limited progress had been made on some issues, others must still be resolved so as to enable the Agency to
verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration of its nuclear material subject to safeguards. These
issues remain on the agenda of technical talks with DPRK authorities, he said. In expressing its concern over the
situation, the Board welcomed the Agency's further efforts and expressed its desire to see agreement reached on outstanding issues.
<P>
<B><I>Test Ban Treaty.</I></B> Regarding the CTBT, Dr. Blix said that at the request of governmental delegates in Geneva the
Agency had provided factual information and assessment concerning legal, organizational, and financial matters relative to the
role, if any, it could play in the implementation of the Treaty. He pointed out that if and when the Agency is asked to perform
certain tasks within the framework of a CTBT, any substantive functions to be undertaken by the IAEA would require prior
approval by the Agency's policy-making organs.

<P>
<B><I>Radiological Study.</I></B> Concerning a Mururoa study, Dr. Blix said the Agency has informed the French Foreign Ministry
that it is ready in principle to conduct a <I>post-facto</I> study but has yet to agree formally. It would assess the full
radiological situation at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls and evaluate any potential long-term radiological impact. He said
implementation was envisaged under the guidance of an International Advisory Committee of highly qualified experts
after the end of nuclear testing in the atolls and formalization of an agreement on the study with French authorities.
<P>
<B><I>Technical Co-operation.</I></B> The Board approved modifications to previously approved projects in the Agency's
technical co-operation programme for 1996; the implementation of model projects; the evaluation of technical co-operation; and the
forecast of training courses. 
<P>
In its report, the Board's Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee, which met in late November 1995,  had recommended the
implementation of projects funded in 1996 at a level of US $62.5 million. In welcoming initiatives the Agency has taken to
strengthen the technical co-operation programme by increasing the impact of projects on national development, the Committee
emphasized the need for adequate resources to implement the programme and urged Member States to make their full and timely
contributions.

<H3>International Conference on Chernobyl</H3></A>
More than 400 governmental delegates are expected to review the radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident at an
international conference in Vienna 8-12 April 1996. 
<P>
The conference - One Decade After Chernobyl: Summing up the Radiological Consequences - will provide an overall opportunity
to take stock of  the consequences of the 1986 accident, taking particular account of the findings of two prior conferences.
These meetings are the International Conference on the Health Consequences of the Chernobyl and other Radiological Accidents,
which was convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) 20-23 November 1995 in Geneva, and the First International Conference
of the European Union, Belarus, Russian Federation, and Ukraine on the Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident, which is being
held in Minsk 18-23 March 1996. 
<P>
The April conference in Vienna is being organized jointly by the IAEA, European Commission, and WHO, and in co-operation with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNDHA), and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Important objectives will be to clearly separate the scientific
facts of the accident's consequences from  myths  and speculation; to clarify and quantify its radiological and
other effects on health; and to review its social, economic, and political consequences.
<P>
The health and environmental effects attributed to the 1986 Chernobyl accident have been subject to extensive scientific
examination. Although few accidents have been so thoroughly investigated, there still remain widely differing opinions on the
accident's actual consequences. The Vienna conference is intended to seek better understanding of the nature and magnitude of these
consequences.
<P>
<B>Chernobyl Nuclear Safety Forum.</B> Before the conference, the IAEA will be convening in Vienna a nuclear safety forum 1-3 April
1996 in co-operation with UNDHA. It will review the remedial measures for improving the safety of Chernobyl-type (RBMK)
reactors and the Chernobyl containment structure, known as the sarcophagus. The forum's conclusions and recommendations will be
presented at the Chernobyl conference.-- <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety.</I>

<H3>New Laboratory in Seibersdorf</H3></A>
 With the objective of enhancing capabilities for analyzing environmental samples, the IAEA in December 1995 inaugurated a
new  clean  laboratory near its existing Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) facilities at Seibersdorf in Austria. 
<P>
Scientists at the new laboratory - constructed over the past year and funded by extrabudgetary contributions - will analyze soil,
water, vegetation, and other samples collected by Agency safeguards inspectors in the course of their work. Operating
under extremely stringent conditions, the new facility houses instrumentation capable of detecting minute quantities of
radioactive materials in samples which might be indicative of undeclared nuclear activities.
<P>
Present for the inauguration were Ambassador John B. Ritch III of the United States; IAEA Director General Hans Blix; Mr. Bruno
Pellaud, Deputy Director General for Safeguards; and Mr. Pier Roberto Danesi, Director of the IAEA Seibersdorf Laboratories.
The United States contributed more than US $1 million for the construction of the new laboratory. The new facility augments
analytical services being provided by SAL, which the IAEA set up in the 1970s at its Seibersdorf Laboratories. SAL handles more
than 1000 samples of uranium, plutonium, and other types of nuclear material each year.--<I>More information may be obtained

<H3>Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation</H3></A>
A new framework is being designed for the operation of a global network providing key data for hydrological studiesrelated to
assessing the availability of water resources and studying climate conditions.
<P>
In late 1995, the IAEA Section of Isotope Hydrology convened a meeting on the operational aspects of the Global Network of
Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP). The meeting, 7-10 November 1995, was attended by representatives of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme-Past Global Changes (IGBP/PAGES), World Health
Organization (WHO), Austria, Canada, Chile, Germany, Republic of Korea, Israel, Portugal, Russian Federation and the United
States.
<P>
The GNIP database contains isotope data (oxygen-18, deuterium and tritium) in precipitation from more than 500 meteorological
stations worldwide. Long used for hydrological assessments, the data also have been found highly useful to link present climatic
conditions to paleoclimate archives, to validate atmospheric circulation patterns, and to study water balance in the
continents. During the last 15 years, GNIP has gained international recognition as a key resource for studies of global
changes related to the water cycle and climate. GNIP data is distributed through diskettes and IAEA publications. It can also
be globally accessed through the IAEA's Internet site at <A HREF="programs/ri/gnip.htm">http://www.iaea.or.at/programs/ri/gnip.</A>
<P>
The meeting aimed to design a new framework for the operation of the network, which has been a joint activity of the IAEA and WMO
for more than 30 years. All participants reaffirmed the need to continue the IAEA/WMO-operated stations and national networks
which measure isotopes in precipitation. Since other organizations have expressed interest in participating in this
activity, the meeting resolved to strengthen the progrmme through a Steering Committee, to be composed of representatives
from interested organizations. The Steering Committee, of which the IAEA is a member, will be responsible for the design,
operation, support, and maintenance of the networks. The Committee will also ensure the collaboration of the different
organizations involved.--<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Department of Research and Isotopes.</I>

<H3>Radiation Safety</H3></A>
At the request of the Marshall Islands, the IAEA convened an advisory group meeting in Vienna 11-14 December 1995 on the
radiological situation in the Bikini atoll, once the site of nuclear tests. Attending were experts from Australia, France,
Japan, New Zealand, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, the World Health Organization, and the IAEA. The meeting
examined scientific studies on the atoll's radiological condition and discussed possible remedial actions that would enable people
to live there again. The Bikinians evacuated the atoll in 1946, when it became a US nuclear test site until 1958. They have not
returned permanently because of concerns over radioactive contamination of their homelands and crops.
<P>
The advisory group examined data obtained from studies of Bikini radiological conditions that were conducted by United States
laboratories and the Marshall Islands government. Close agreement of both sets of data was noted. Guided by the <I>International
Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources (BSS)</I>, the group
concluded that if people were to return to live on the isles, current annual dose levels were sufficiently high - up to about
15 millisievert per year for a diet drawn from local foods only - to justify taking intervention measures to reduce them. Two
remediation strategies were examined from a radiation protection perspective. One is the removal and replacement of contaminated
soil, which the group considered undesirable because of adverse environmental and social consequences. The second
strategy, which US scientists have tested on Bikini through extensive field trials, is the application of potassium to the
soil, preferably through fertilizers, to greatly reduce the uptake of radioactive caesium-137 by tree fruits and other crops.
The plants would take up the potassium in preference to caesium, whose levels would fall most rapidly over the first 4 years and
steadily thereafter through repeated applications. This strategy additionally could entail removal of surface soil in villages and
around housing sites and its replacement with a layer of crushed coral. This would minimize the possibility of human exposure to
radioactive contaminants in the soil.
<P>
No definite recommendations on a single course of action were made to the Marshall Islands; rather, several alternatives were
presented with their specific advantages and disadvantages. The group pointed out the need to ensure that remedial measures are
carried out adequately and that the radiological condition of the atoll remains satisfactory after remediation. Toward this end,
experts suggested establishing post-remediation monitoring programmes with the IAEA's technical assistance and support.--

<H3>Seminars on nuclear information</H3></A> Viet Nam and Japan recently hosted seminars to broaden awareness and understanding
of nuclear energy. The meetings were organized under an extra-budgetary IAEA public information programme funded by
Japan. 
<P>
In Viet Nam, topics covered related to national energy strategies, nuclear power development, and the peaceful
applications of nuclear energy. The seminar, held 4-6 October 1995, was co-organized in Hanoi by the IAEA and Viet Nam Atomic
Energy Commission (VINATOM). In addition to experts from the Agency and Viet Nam, participants included invited specialists,
journalists, and government and industry officials from Austria, China, France, Japan, and Republic of Korea. Sessions featured
presentations on national nuclear power development strategies and approaches, nuclear safety and radiological protection,
public information about nuclear energy, and nuclear applications and technical co-operation activities.
<P>
In Japan, the seminar was held 29 November to 1 December in Kyoto, in co-operation with Japan's Ministry of Trade and
Industry and the Science and Technology Agency.  Its focus was on the symbiosis between nuclear facilities and local communities.
Sessions featured presentations from local Japanese officials, as well as invited officials from the Netherlands, United Kingdom,
Germany, Sweden, and Republic of Korea. Additionally, technical tours were arranged, including one to the Spring-8 synchrotron
radiation facility.--<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</I>

<H3>Food irradiation workshop in France</H3></A> Emerging developments in food trade could greatly influence the use of
irradiation for health-related reasons. At a workshop in Marseilles in November 1995, governmental delegates from 23
countries examined the picture. The meeting was organized by the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI), a
body under the aegis of the IAEA, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and the World Health
Organization (WHO). 
<P>
The workshop particularly looked at changing developments tied to new trade agreements which have been ratified by governments for
establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). Specifically, trade in food and agricultural commodities is expected to be
liberalized through the agreements on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and technical barriers to trade
(TBT) adopted during the Uruguay Round. The SPS recognizes relevant international standards, guidelines, and recommendations
of international organizations such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), the International Plant Protection Convention
(IPPC), and the International Office of Epizootics that would assist the WTO in settling disputes that might arise. Governments
having regulations that do not conform with the standards, guidelines, and recommendations of these organizations may be
asked to justify their position to the WTO. With respect to food irradiation, the CAC adopted a General Standard for Irradiated
Foods in 1983, and regional plant protection organizations within the framework of the IPPC endorsed irradiation as an effective
quarantine treatment of fresh agricultural commodities in 1991. 
<P>
Delegates noted that irradiation already is accepted for processing food in some 40 countries, with 28 of these countries
using the technology for commercial purposes. In 1994, the use of irradiation as a replacement for fumigation of food and food
ingredients, especially spices and dried vegetable seasonings, increased to more than 40,000 tonnes, double the amount in 1992.
With the global phase-out of methyl bromide as a food fumigant because of its ozone-depleting properties, the role of
irradiation to control insect infestation in traded foods is likely to expand greatly. In the United States, the Department of
Agriculture has announced its intention to approve irradiation's broad use as a quarantine treatment for fresh fruits and
vegetables.--<I>More information may be obtained from the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and

<H3>IAEA Director General Addresses United Nations</H3></A>
Addressing the 50th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, IAEA Director General 
Hans Blix emphasized the importance of international efforts to secure the safe and peaceful development 
of nuclear energy. He specifically reviewed areas of nuclear safeguards and verification; nuclear safety; 
nuclear power development; and technical co-operation. Dr. Blix addressed the General Assembly 1 
November 1995.
<P>
In reviewing global nuclear developments, Dr. Blix stressed the Agency's response to new challenges in the 
field of safeguards and verification. "Governments and the public now demand that the system should have 
the capacity to detect any secret, undeclared nuclear material and installations," he said, citing lessons from 
the Agency's ongoing nuclear inspections in Iraq under mandate of the UN Security Council. The stronger 
safeguards system now being developed, he said, focuses on a number of essential elements: increased 
access to information about a State's nuclear activities; broader access to sites and locations within a State; 
short-notice inspections; and the maximum use of new and available technologies to increase detection 
capacity. He further pointed out that IAEA verification of States' compliance with their nuclear arms-control 
pledges is becoming an increasingly important factor in global security and nuclear disarmament. He noted 
the Agency's expanded efforts in verifying nuclear material released from the military programmes of 
nuclear-weapon States, and he cited possible new verification roles, including those related to the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which States seek to conclude in 1996. He noted that the IAEA 
already verifies such a ban in more than 170 States which have accepted comprehensive Agency safeguards 
on all their nuclear activities. "Entrusting the IAEA with the verification function of a CTBT would 
undoubtedly save resources," he said, "which would seem natural at a time when efforts are urged to avoid 
duplication, overlap and unnecessary cost in the UN family. It would also permit more rapid 
implementation."
<P>
The Director General also addressed Agency efforts against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. "It is 
clear that greater efforts are needed and that States must pay increased attention to the physical protection of 
all radioactive material, and especially weapons useable nuclear material, whether in use, transport, or 
storage," he said. While the States concerned carry the primary responsibility in combatting illegal 
trafficking, Dr. Blix said that steps are being taken to improve international co-ordination of efforts. The 
Agency's actions, he noted, include establishing a database of trafficking incidents in support of factual 
analyses and technically assisting States in areas of nuclear material accountancy and control, and in 
physical protection methods and technology.
<P>
<B>Nuclear and Radiation Safety.</B> Also commanding greater attention are issues of nuclear and radiation safety, he said. Building on the IAEA's long-standing work in the field, States have developed binding international safety standards, he noted, notably in adopting the Convention on Nuclear Safety that is nearing entry into force, and in moving to finalize preparation of a Convention on Radioactive Waste 
Safety. "There is a clear manifestation of the increased interest of the international community that nuclear 
safety be at a high level everywhere," he said. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power.</B> The Director General further called for an expansion of nuclear power for electricity generation to help meet the world's growing needs for environmentally clean and economically proven energy sources. He noted the Agency's co-operative work with inter-governmental organizations for 
comparatively assessing the benefits and risks of different options for electricity production. "Only an 
analysis of different options side by side can tell us which energy policy is economically and ecologically 
least burdensome", he said. 
<P>
<B>Technical Assistance.</B> In underlining the high interest of States, particularly developing countries, in peaceful nuclear applications, Dr. Blix reviewed initiatives to strengthen the IAEA's technical co-operation programme. Emphasis is being placed on nuclear techniques and targeted projects that will contribute to sustainable development, food production and preservation, the harnessing of fresh water resources, industrial applications, and the promotion of human health, he said. 
<P>
<B>Factors for Effectiveness.</B> The Director General concluded by stressing key ingredients of effective global co-operation. "Effectiveness depends largely upon the availability of adequate and predictable resources, co-operation of States that may be affected, and, last but not least, the competence and skill of management and staff. We stand or fall on the quality of our management and staff."-- <I>Copies of the statement may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Public Information.

<H3>Oceanographic Investigations of Radioactive Pollution</H3></A>
<P>
Following their participation in recent expeditions, experts at the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) in Monaco are investigating the effects of radioactive pollution in the Kara Sea in the Arctic and the Far Eastern Seas in Asia. 
<P>
<B>Kara Sea Expedition.</B> In August and September 1995, an IAEA-MEL expert participated in a month-long Kara Sea expedition known as EPOCA 95 (Environmental Pollution and Oceanography in the Arctic Seas), a joint Russian/American/Norwegian investigation. It marked the fifth expedition to the region involving IAEA-MEL's participation as part of the IAEA's <A HREF="/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull372/sjoeblom.html">International Arctic Seas Assessment Programme (IASAP).</A> 
<P>
Initiated in 1992, IASAP was established to evaluate the risks posed by dumped nuclear wastes in the Kara Sea, a shallow Arctic sea located adjacent to the former Soviet Union. The latest expedition departed Hammerfest, Norway, on the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment ship <I>H.U. Sverdrup II </I>25 August and returned 25 September 1995 after travelling more than 3000 nautical miles along cruise tracks 
within the Kara Sea.
<P>
During the expedition, water and sediment samples were retrieved from as many as 40 locations, including 
samples close to sites of the fuelled reactors dumped by the former Soviet Union. Instrumentation was also 
deployed to understand circulation patterns and predict the primary transport pathways of pollutants. During 
the expedition, the IAEA-MEL expert conducted a novel investigation to determine, <I>in situ,</I> the 
uptake potential of radioactive contaminants to sediments. The results of the investigation will be used in 
models evaluating the dispersion of radionuclides released from nuclear waste sites. 
<P>
<B>Far Eastern Seas.</B> IAEA-MEL also participated in the second stage of the Japanese/Korean/Russian joint expedition aboard the R/V <I>Ocean </I>to investigate dumping sites in the Far Eastern Seas from 12 August to 12 September 1995. The extensive investigations  supported by the Government of Japanwere conducted to assess the level of radioactive contamination in sea areas at which radioactive wastes were disposed of by the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. 
<P>
During the expedition, samples of seawater, seabed sediment, zooplankton, and benthos were collected; 
preliminary spectrometric measurements of seawater and seabed sediments were done aboard ship; and 
intercomparison of analytical techniques used by participating countries was organized and performed with 
satisfactory results. 
<P>
Preliminary results of onboard measurements showed that concentrations of caesium-137 in seawater and 
seabed sediments were low  24 Bq/cubic meter and below 10 Bq/kg dry weight, respectively  values which do not differ significantly from levels elsewhere in the northwest Pacific Ocean arising from global fallout. Detailed analyses of all samples will be performed on land and the evaluated data will be exchanged and published in 1996. Some 3.6 tonnes of seawater and 20 kg of sediments collected at 13 stations have been sent to IAEA-MEL in Monaco for radionuclide analysis.  <I>More information may be obtained from

<H3>Cancer Radiotherapy using Heavy Charged Particles</H3></A>
<P>
Medical experts from 10 countries recently met at the IAEA to review the status and potential of a new phase in the evolution of radiotherapy for improved treatment of cancer. The radiation treatment involves the use of beams of heavy charged particles, namely protons and heavy ions, targeted to control the growth of many types of localized malignant tumours. The experts represented countries participating in a newly organized Agency Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) on the subject. Participating countries include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, the Russian Federation, and the United States.
<P>
Over the past decade, considerable advances in cancer treatment have occurred and a cancer cure now can 
be regarded as a realistic therapeutic objective. Yet cancer still claims the lives of 5.4 million people a year 
worldwide, and the number of new cancer cases is rising at the rate of 3% annually. Radiotherapy, alongside 
surgery, has become one of the two most successful cancer treatment modalities. Current treatment methods 
in any combination, however, fail to control cancer in more than half of all patients.  Additionally, 
morbidity from current treatment methods remains a very serious clinical problem. The main cause for 
failure in cancer treatment is insufficient local control of tumour growth.
<P>
Heavy charged particles offer the chance of improving this picture because of their physical properties and 
biological advantages for the localized control of tumour growth while reducing the morbidity of the 
treatment process. They thus offer doctors and patients a chance for achieving a therapeutic gain superior to 
that offered by conventional radiotherapy. More than 14,000 cancer patients have been treated with heavy 
charged particles to date, with encouraging results achieved in treatment of tumours of the eye, salivary 
glands, brain, liver, and prostate.
<P>
The IAEA's CRP aims to promote co-operative efforts in the radiotherapeutic application of heavy charged 
particles by evaluating their potential benefit and by identifying the mechanisms through which benefits can 
be achieved. It is further expected that the programme can provide a needed forum for reviewing and co-
ordinating different national programmes at the global level. A co-operative effort is considered essential 
for exploiting the clinical benefits from applications of heavy charged particles and for avoiding decades of 
unsatisfactory trial and error.<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA's Division of

<H3>Highlights of the 1995 IAEA General Conference </H3></A>
<P>
Member States meeting at the IAEA General Conference 18-22 September 1995 adopted resolutions in key 
areas of global nuclear development. Resolutions addressed topics including the implementation of 
safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); IAEA nuclear inspections in Iraq; 
nuclear testing; application of safeguards in the Middle East; illicit trafficking in nuclear materials; and 
measures for strengthening areas of safeguards, nuclear safety, and technical co-operation. 
<P>
Delegates elected as President of the Conference Mr. Chuchai Kasemsarn, Ambassador of the Kingdom of 
Thailand to the IAEA and the Republic of Austria. Delegates also elected Ms. Roberta Lajous Vargas, 
Ambassador of  Mexico to the IAEA and the Republic of Austria, as Chairwoman of the Committee of the 
Whole.
<P>
The adopted resolutions include those related to:
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK.</B> The resolution commends the IAEA for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as requested by the UN Security Council, and to implement the IAEA-
DPRK safeguards agreement. In calling upon the DPRK to comply fully with the IAEA-DPRK safeguards 
agreement, the resolution urges the DPRK to take all steps the Agency may deem necessary to preserve, 
intact, all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on 
the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with its 
safeguards agreement.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq. </B>The resolution condemns Iraq for having, since 1991, withheld from the Agency information about its nuclear-weapon programme in violation of its obligations under Security 
Council resolutions, and it demands that Iraq hand over to the Agency without further delay any currently 
undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material or information, as called for in Security Council 
resolutions. The resolution stresses that the Agency will continue to exercise its right to investigate further 
any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards the new information obtained 
by the Agency in August 1995 and any further relevant information that Iraq may still be withholding from 
the Agency.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Testing. </B>The resolution expresses grave concern at the resumption and the continuation of nuclear testing and calls upon those States which have active nuclear testing programmes in place to desist from testing until a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty CTBT) enters into force. In the resolution, the 
Conference states its expectation that the negotiations for a CTBT will be completed and the Treaty signed 
in 1996 as may be further specified by the Fiftieth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and it 
urges all participants in the negotiations to further intensify their efforts to this end.
<P>
<B>Strengthening the Safeguards System.</B> Expressing the conviction that the Agency's safeguards can 
promote greater confidence among States and thus contribute to strengthening collective security, the 
resolution addresses measures proposed under the IAEA Programme 93+2 for strengthening the 
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. The resolution requests the IAEA to 
continue to develop the measures proposed under Programme 93+2 in order to bring about a more effective 
and efficient system covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of a 
State which has concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement, and to make the necessary arrangements 
to implement the first part of the proposed measures after consulting individual States. It further requests 
the IAEA, taking account of views expressed in the Board of Governors and the General Conference and 
the outcome of consultations with Member States individually or collectively, to put before its Board 
of Governors as soon as possible clear proposals for the second part of the proposed measures.
<P>
<B>IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East.</B> The resolution requests the IAEA's Director General to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking.</B> The resolution welcomes the measures taken by the IAEA in support of efforts to 
prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, and invites the Agency to continue working in accordance 
with the conclusions of its Board of Governors. 
<P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ).</B> Noting the adoption in June 1995 of the text of the Treaty on an African NWFZ, the resolution commends the African States for their united efforts toward the 
establishment of an NWFZ and requests the IAEA to continue to assist them in this regard. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety.</B> Noting that 61 States have signed and 12 have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the resolution expresses the hope for the widest possible adherence to the Convention. It appeals to all Member States which have not yet done so to sign the Convention, and it appeals to signatory States which have not yet done so to ratify, accept or approve the Convention so that it may enter into force as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Technical Co-operation. </B>The resolution requests the IAEA to pursue, in consultation with Member States, efforts to strengthen the Agency's technical co-operation activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries in fields of peaceful nuclear applications, and achieving sustainable development. The resolution defined these fields as including both applications of nuclear methods and techniques and the production of electricity, and it noted that account should be taken of the infrastructure and the level of technology of the countries concerned. It further requests the IAEA to take account of the view of the General Conference on this question when requesting Member States to pledge their respective shares of the Technical Co-operation Fund targets and to make timely payments to the Fund. 
<P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically. </B>In emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in Member States, the resolution stresses the vital importance of producing potable water and urges the IAEA to secure sufficient funding, through appeals to international organizations and prospective donor countries, to ensure completion in 1996 of the second phase of a programme in this area. It further requests the IAEA to include the nuclear desalination of seawater in future programmes of the Agency, with appropriate priority.
<P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management. </B>Citing the importance of clean drinking water to human health and the optimum use of economic resources, the resolution requests the IAEA to continue to integrate the available resources of the Agency and its Member States and to direct them towards concrete programmes for producing a visible impact by improving the quality and availability of water.
<P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1996 and Target for Technical Co-operation Fund. </B>The adopted budget resolution allocates expenditures of US $219 million in 1996 (at an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the US dollar). The Conference further approved the target amount of US $64.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund in 1996.
<P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat. </B>Two resolutions were adopted. One resolution requests the IAEA to intensify efforts to increase, particularly at the senior and policymaking levels, the number of staff members from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented. The second resolution requests the IAEA to continue efforts to increase substantially, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, as well as for scientific and technical posts, the number of female staff members, particularly from developing countries and from those other Member States which are under-represented. It further calls upon the IAEA to examine the Platform for Action developed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and to integrate, where applicable, the elements of this platform into the Agency's relevant policies and programmes.

<P>
<H3>Director General's statement to 1995 IAEA General Conference</H3></A>
<P>
Global nuclear developments are accelerating the evolution of IAEA roles and responsibilities to meet new 
needs of States in areas of nuclear verification, safety, and technology transfer, IAEA Director General 
Hans Blix said in his opening statement to the 39th regular session of the IAEA General Conference 18 
September 1995. 
<P>
In reviewing the Agency's programmes and plans, Dr. Blix highlighted a number of specific areas. In many 
cases, he pointed out, measures being taken at the IAEA are moving forward in spite of continuing budget 
constraints, and he attributed progress to extra-budgetary resources provided by some Member States, 
ongoing improvements in programme management and implementation, and the efficiency and skills of 
IAEA staff. "The machinery of the IAEA has been working at full steam, even with some overpressure," he 
said, "and we can register considerable movement forward in many areas." Selected highlights of the Director General's address follow.
<P>
<B>French Nuclear Tests. </B>The Director General noted a letter he received from the French Foreign Minister, making reference to the irreversible commitment of France to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban in 1996 and its intention to undertake a final series of nuclear tests before that time, and inviting the Agency to conduct an assessment of the radiological situation in the Muroroa and Fangataufa atolls. Dr. Blix said that the IAEA is considering the request. Agency officials are consulting French authorities, he said, on matters pertaining to the objectives, scope, modalities, and required expertise for such a scientific mission. He pointed out that the Agency has some "first hand experience" in this field, in light of scientific studies it has previously done at the French Pacific test sites, as well as at sites connected with the former Soviet Union's military nuclear programme at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK. </B>IAEA technical discussions continue to be held with authorities in the DPRK as part of the Agency's ongoing verification efforts, Dr. Blix said. "To come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement," he said, "the DPRK will have to do something it has not yet been willing to do, namely enable the Agency effectively to verify the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report of nuclear material subject to the agreement." Discussions have resulted in limited progress on some issues, Dr. Blix said. A substantial paper of technical proposals transmitted by the Agency has been accepted "only for study, not for discussion" he said.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq.</B> The Agency is verifying new information and data it has received concerning Iraq's thwarted plans in 1990-91 to develop a nuclear weapon, Dr. Blix said. He said that so far in its review of the new information, "nothing suggests that a change is warranted" in the Agency's conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear-weapon programme have been identified and destroyed, removed, or rendered harmless. He noted that the new Iraqi statements, and all the documents and materials that the Agency has received, are being carefully examined for new data. "That they have been withheld for so long is clearly a breach of Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolutions," he said. 
<P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA Safeguards.</B> Dr. Blix reviewed key components of Agency measures to develop and implement a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards system. He noted in particular steps to ensure increased access to information about nuclear programmes and broader inspector access to sites within a State. "By making their nuclear activities as transparent as possible to the Agency," he said, "States can help provide the basis for more effective and efficient safeguards."
<P>
<B>New and Emerging Verification Roles.</B> Citing developments in areas of nuclear non-proliferation, arms control, and disarmament, Dr. Blix said that some possible new verification roles for the Agency are in 
sight. "Far-reaching implications" for the IAEA's future work, he said, emanate from the outcome of the 
Review and Extension Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT) in May 1995.  Among other things, he noted that the Conference expressly recognized the IAEA as 
the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with safeguards agreements; 
recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under IAEA safeguards; 
envisaged the universal application of safeguards once the elimination of nuclear weapons had been 
achieved; set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; called for the 
early conclusion of a "cut-off" agreement to end the production of nuclear material for use in weapons; and 
endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs). Dr. Blix pointed out that IAEA 
safeguards are being considered as an "essential element" of the verification mechanism for a cut-off 
agreement; that the Agency would have a verification role in any new NWFZ, given existing models; and 
that the IAEA already carries out safeguards tasks of relevance to verification of a test ban treaty, although 
its possible roles under a specific test ban treaty remain to be determined.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety and Radioactive Waste Management.</B> The Director General cited a number of 
developments. He said that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, adopted in June 1994, could enter into force 
as early as next year, and that preparations for a Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety have been 
"encouraging", with a final draft possible by next year. Work also is continuing, he noted, for a Diplomatic 
Conference in 1996 to revise the Vienna convention on liability for nuclear damage. Regarding the 
Agency's work on the safety assessment of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet 
Union, he said that an international consensus now exists that identifies major safety issues and their 
significance for each of the various reactor types. The Director General also pointed towards a major 
international conference being organized in April 1996 by the IAEA, World Health Organization, and 
European Commission to sum up the knowledge about the nature and magnitude of the Chernobyl accident's 
consequences.
<P>
<B>Technical Co-operation.</B> The IAEA's technical co-operation programme delivery is the highest ever in the history of the Agency, Dr. Blix noted. He attributed the increase to improved management practices, better design and support of projects, and other initiatives. He emphasized that the success of programmes depends on the availability of predictable resources, and appealed for full contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund.

<H3>General Conference Scientific Programme</H3></A>
<P>
In conjunction with the IAEA General Conference, representatives from Member States attended a 
scientific programme on three topics: environmental restoration; application of accelerators in research, 
industry, and other fields; and new safeguards technologies.
<P>
<B>Environmental Restoration.</B> Participants examined the worldwide situation and experience with 
environmental restoration of radioactively contaminated sites. They focused on site characterization, waste 
management, and environmental cleanup/restoration technologies, and discussed workable policies and 
strategies. Topics included contamination resulting from accidents, defense and civilian nuclear activities, 
waste management/disposal/dumping practices, spills, airborne releases, and past practices at abandoned 
facilities where radioactive substances were used.
<P> 
<B>Accelerator Applications.</B> Participants reviewed current and emerging applications for particle 
accelerators, focusing on present and future crucial needs of many countries. Particularly discussed were 
selected industrial, medical, environmental and analytical applications of electron, proton and ion beams.
<P>
<B>New Safeguards Technologies.</B> Participants focused on new safeguards measurement and surveillance systems that can operate in an unattended mode and transmit safeguards-relevant data remotely. They also reviewed the IAEA's extensive series of field trials carried out over the past 2 years which show that the analyses of environmental samples from a nuclear site provide a powerful tool for gaining additional assurance regarding the absence of undeclared activities at and near such sites.<I>More information about the IAEA General Conference and scientific programme is available <A HREF="/GC">here.</I></A>

<H3>Countries Invited to More Widely Apply International Nuclear Event Scale</H3></A>
<P>
Already being successfully used to classify events at reactors, the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) should now be applied for non-reactor installations, national INES representatives have recommended. The recommendation was made at a meeting of INES National Officers at the IAEA in October attended by representatives from 59 countries now applying the scale.
<P>
"This recommendation, when adopted, means that INES will apply to nearly all civil nuclear installations 
around the world," Dr. Dick Taylor, Chairman of the meeting, said.  "Development and acceptance of a 
simple scale has been a remarkable achievement and it will allow the public and media to understand the 
significance of any events within a short time of their occurrence. This should provide considerable 
reassurance in simple and intelligible terms about the safety of nuclear installations."
<P>
The meeting reviewed progress in the scale's use worldwide, agreeing that it is working well technically and 
gaining increased media and public acceptance. In reviewing global experience, no events were registered 
above level 2 (on the 7-level scale) during 1994-95.
<P>
Representatives at the meeting decided to initiate work to further improve the scale's use. They 
recommended that new publicity material explaining the scale be developed, and they emphasized that even 
though no changes to INES would be made, efforts to simplify some technical procedures underlying the 
rating of events would continue.<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety. </I>

<H3>Safety Meeting on Kozloduy in Bulgaria</H3></A>
<P>
In early October, the IAEA convened a meeting of technical experts in Sofia to discuss safety-related information relevant to the Bulgarian Government's decision on restarting the Kozloduy-1 nuclear power plant, a WWER-440/230 type reactor. The meeting was called at the suggestion of IAEA Director General Hans Blix and co-organized by the IAEA and the Government of Bulgaria. Co-chairing the meeting were Mr. Morris Rosen, IAEA Assistant Director General for Nuclear Safety, and Mr. Yanko Yanev, Chairman of the Bulgarian Committee on the Use of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes. Participants included officials and specialists of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Inspectorate and the operating utility; Gidropress, the Russian reactor design organization; the Gesellschaft fuer Reaktor- und Anlagensicherheit (GRS) in Germany and the Institut de Protection et Surete Nucleaire (ISPN) in France, two institutes from a consortium of European safety institutes advising the Bulgarian regulatory body. 
<P>
The technical discussions centered on the condition of the reactor pressure vessel, and recent information 
from Bulgarian and Russian institutes was reviewed. The European institutes recognized the information's 
value, but maintained that further analysis and examination was necessary before restarting the unit to 
provide confidence that sufficient safety margins would exist during operation. The Bulgarian nuclear safety 
authorities described licensing-related requirements for the reactor's restart, which essentially consisted of a 
three-step programme of operation: a reduced operating cycle of about six months duration; a special 
operating regime to include constant power operation to avoid system transients, revised operating 
procedures, special operator training, and increased supervisory control; and a comprehensive programme 
to prepare for the taking of samples and/or annealing of the reactor pressure vessel after the shortened 
operating cycle. The meeting recognized that the proposed programme of operation includes technical steps 
to improve the current situation. It further recognized that the regulatory authority is requiring the utility to 
carry out a programme of investigation during the proposed operation, and to provide important additional 
information for subsequent actions, including the taking of samples and/or annealing, a technical process 
designed to combat embrittlement of the reactor vessel.
<P>
As part of IAEA safety services, a team of experts under the Agency's Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) programme is planning a follow-up OSART mission to Kozloduy early in 1996.<I>More

<H3>Selection of Dry Storage Technologies for Spent Fuel</H3></A>
<P>
Japan recently hosted a technical commitee meeting and workshop for global experts involved in the handling and safe storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The meeting, held 23-27 October at the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Tokyo, focused on storage options and selection principles of dry storage technologies for WWER and RBMK reactors, within the framework of the IAEA's extra-budgetary programme on the safety of such reactors being supported by Japan and other countries. Participating experts represented nuclear organizations and utilities in Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Slovak Republic, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.
<P>
From both financial and technical perspectives, experts at the meeting presented and discussed case studies 
of the selection process and principles applied in various countries for spent fuel storage. Technical visits 
further were arranged to Japan's Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry and to the Tokyo 
Electric Power Company's Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power station.<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management.</I>

<H3>India Presents Sculpture to the IAEA</H3></A>
<P>
India has presented the IAEA with a sculpture of Dr. Homi Jenegir Bhaba, the first Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and a member of the first IAEA Board of Governors until his untimely death in 1966. The sculpture, a bust of Dr. Bhaba, was presented to IAEA Director General Hans Blix <I>(below, second from left)</I> by Dr. R. Chidambaram, India's AEC Chairman and the 1994-95 Chairman of the IAEA Board, at a ceremony at IAEA headquarters in Vienna 25 September 1995. Also attending was Dr. Sigvard Eklund <I>(below at left)</I>, Dr. Blix's predecessor and Director General emeritus of the IAEA.
<P>
"The IAEA started moving through the initiative of a group of nuclear pioneers who saw in nuclear energy 
the great hope for satisfying the energy needs of mankind even when all other conventional sources are 
exhausted," Dr. Chidambaram said. "Dr. Bhaba was one such pioneer." Dr. Bhaba started the Indian 
programme in 1944 with the establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and, soon 
thereafter, the atomic research centre in Bombay, which is now named after him. He, along with India's 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, saw science and technology as the only route to growth in developing 
countries and especially emphasized contributions of nuclear science and technology, Dr. Chidambaram 
said, a vision Dr. Bhaba's service carried to the IAEA and international community.

<H3>IAEA Seminars and Symposia</H3></A>
<P>
<B>International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment.</B> Sustainable energy production and electricity generation were in the forefront at the IAEA's International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment, convened in Vienna 16-19 October 1995. International experts focused on the ways and means of comparatively assessing the health and environmental impacts of different energy sources for electricity generation, specifically reviewing results of an inter-agency global project called Decades on databases and methodologies for such assessments. The symposium was co-organized by the IAEA, the European Commission, the Economic and Social Commission of Asia and the Pacific, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the World Meteorological Organization.
<P>
In opening the symposium, IAEA Director General Hans Blix stressed the need for examining electricity 
options in the context of growing energy demand and environmental concerns. He noted that since the Earth 
Summit in 1992, only small progress had been made worldwide in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
that reliance on fossil fuels had not been minimized. He called for a rational assessment and comparison of 
all available energy supply options, renewable, fossil, and nuclear, to help guide energy planners and 
decision-makers in choices they must make. Nuclear power by itself, he said, cannot solve all problems 
involved in achieving a secure and sustainable energy supply worldwide, but it can play a significant role, 
along with renewable sources and energy conservation, in strategies toward this goal.<I>More 
information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Power.</I>
<P>
<B>Advances in the Operational Safety of Nuclear Power Plants.</B> The best international safety practices were examined at the IAEA's International Conference on Advances in the Operational Safety of Nuclear Power Plants, convened 4-8 September 1995 at the IAEA. Presentations from nuclear plant operators and safety officials addressed recent advances and new methods for improving the safe operation of nuclear plants, which worldwide supply about 17% of total electricity. In particular, case studies reviewed recent achievements in national nuclear programmes, as well as through international co-operative projects and services, and a panel discussion addressed ways to monitor plant performance and operational safety, and how to communicate the findings to the public. Invited papers focused on three major topics: the regulatory role in operational safety advances; the utility perspective and experience in areas of operational safety; and public understanding of nuclear plant operational safety issues.<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety.</I>
<P>
<B>Requirements for Safe Management of Radioactive Waste.</B> More than 150 national and international experts reviewed requirements for safely managing radioactive wastes at an IAEA seminar 28-31 August 1995. The meeting provided a timely forum for discussions of waste management issues in light of steps to finalize preparation of a convention on radioactive waste safety. Twenty-four papers were presented by invited speakers that covered acquired experience and major issues in the field from national and international perspectives. Three panel discussions also were held on the implications of treating spent fuel as high-level waste; residues from past waste management activities; and the exclusion, exemption, and 
clearance of materials from nuclear regulatory control.<I>More information may be obtained from the 
Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management.</I>
<P>
<B>Seminar on Nuclear Power Introduction and Public Information.</B> Topics related to national energy 
strategies, nuclear power development, and the peaceful applications of nuclear energy were highlighted at 
a seminar 4-6 October 1995 co-organized in Hanoi by the IAEA and Viet Nam Atomic Energy Commission 
(VINATOM). In addition to experts from the Agency and Viet Nam, participants included invited 
specialists, journalists, and government and industry officials from Austria, China, France, Japan, and 
Republic of Korea. Sessions featured presentations on national nuclear power development strategies and 
approaches, nuclear safety and radiological protection, public information about nuclear energy, and 
nuclear applications and technical co-operation activities. The seminar was organized under an extra
-budgetary IAEA public information programme funded by Japan. Upcoming seminars include one 
scheduled 29 November to 1 December in Kyoto, in co-operation with Japan's Ministry of Trade and 
Industry and the Science and Technology Agency.<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA

<H2>IAEA Board of Governors' June Meetings</H2>
</A>
<P>
At its meetings 12-16 June 1995 in Vienna, the IAEA Board of Governors <I>inter alia</I> examined specific proposals for achieving a strengthened and  more cost-effective safeguards system. The Board noted the Agency's plan to start implementing certain measures under its existing authority on the understanding that the IAEA would, for the benefit of Member States, elaborate implementation arrangements and hold further consultations with States to clarify some concerns that they had expressed.
<P>
<A NAME="A2.2">
<STRONG>Safeguards proposals.</STRONG></A> The proposals -developed at the Board's request and which pertain to IAEA verification in States having comprehensive safeguards agreements - were presented in two parts: Part 1 covers measures that the Agency could implement under existing authority and which would be both practical and useful to implement at an early date; Part 2 measures would need complementary legal authority. Board action in June focused only on Part 1 measures. They include, for example, broader access to information regarding sites and activities relevant to States' nuclear programmes, and environmental sampling at locations to which the IAEA has access. Part 2 measures are scheduled to be considered by the Board later this year.
<P>
In his statement to the Board, IAEA Director General Hans Blix highlighted the considerable efforts involved in the IAEA's ongoing safeguards development programme, known as "93+2", and commended Member States for their cooperation and support in developing specific proposals. "There is considerable international interest in the Agency's moves to strengthen its safeguards performance," he said, "and an expectation that the Board will maintain the momentum which it has created towards achieving a more credible and cost-effective safeguards system."
<P>
Other safeguards-related items discussed by the Board in June included the IAEA's Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 1994, and the implementation of the safeguards agreement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Regarding safeguards in the DPRK, where the IAEA maintains a continuous inspector presence in Nyongbyon,  Dr. Blix briefed the Board on developments since March and noted that the IAEA was continuing its efforts to schedule a further round of technical discussions regarding certain outstanding issues. The Board took note of the information and expressed its desire to see the technical talks take place soon.
<P>
A number of other items were before the Board in June. They included those related to:
<P>
<A NAME="A2.3">
<STRONG>Technical cooperation.</STRONG></A> The Board received a report on technical cooperation activities in 1994, and commended the IAEA for the record rate of implementation and the effective introduction of model projects. It noted with regret, however, the low level of pledges to the Technical Cooperation Fund, and highlighed the need for adequate, predictable, and assured resources for the Agency's technical cooperation activities.  In regard to the proposed Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Cooperation, the Board welcomed the steps that the Director General had taken to establish it.  The Group will provide advice on the direction of the IAEA's technical cooperation programme and on measures for increasing its effectiveness and efficiency.
<P>
The Board further took note of a report describing the IAEA's intensified efforts to assist countries in the management of water resources.  The work includes technical cooperation projects on the use of isotope techniques in hydrology;  inter-agency activities designed to help countries tackle water-related problems; and research involving industrialized and developing countries under the Agency's coordinated research programme.
<P>
<A NAME="A2.4">
<STRONG>Radiation safety.</STRONG></A> The Board approved a document on Safety Fundamentals  covering radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources, and authorized its publication in the IAEA's Safety Series.  The document follows the Board's approval of similar documents covering the safety of nuclear installations (in 1992) and radioactive waste management (in March 1995).
<P>
<A NAME="A2.5">
<STRONG>Radioactive waste management.</STRONG></A> The Board authorized the submission to the General Conference of a report describing  recent initiatives to resolve international radioactive waste management issues. The Director General also informed the Board that a group of technical and legal experts is scheduled to hold its first meeting 3-7 July 1995 concerning preparatory work for the Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive Waste. The Group is expected to address the objectives, principles, and scope of the convention, as well as the obligations of the contracting parties and any institutional arrangements.
<P>
<A NAME="A2.6">
<STRONG>Liability for Nuclear Damage.</STRONG></A> The Board received a progress report on the work of the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage, which has been examining the issue over the past several years. The Committee recently concluded that a diplomatic conference could be convened in 1996 to amend the Vienna Convention and to adopt a system of supplementary compensation. No date will be set until the completion of the preparatory work and the finalization of the Committee's report.
<P>
<A NAME="A2.7">
<STRONG>IAEA regular budget for 1996.</STRONG></A> The Board adopted the report of its  Administrative and Budget Committee, which <I>inter alia</I> recommended a regular budget for 1996 that calls for expenditures of US $219 million, at an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the dollar.

<H2>NPT Conference reaffirms support for IAEA roles</H2>
</A>
<P>
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) decided in May 1995 to extend the Treaty indefinitely and reaffirmed their support of the IAEA's roles in areas of verification and technology transfer. In his statement to the IAEA Board of Governors in June, IAEA Director General Hans Blix made the following points:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Conference reconfirmed that the ultimate objective of the Treaty is a nuclear-weapon-free world. Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon States commit themselves not to acquire such weapons and nuclear-weapon States commit themselves to nuclear disarmament. These commitments imply the increasing importance of verification and, in particular, that which is or may be carried out by the IAEA.
<P>
<LI>The Conference expressed support for the use and transfer of peaceful nuclear technology consistent with provisions of the NPT. The Atoms for Peace approach was thus maintained. For the IAEA, this points to the continued importance of its roles in areas of nuclear safety, waste disposal, transfer of nuclear technology, and technical assistance.
<P>
<LI>The Conference adopted a number of principles and objectives, some of which are directly relevant to the role and work of the IAEA. The IAEA was expressly recognized as the competent authority responsible to verify and assure compliance with safeguards agreements. The Conference stated that Parties to the NPT which have concerns regarding non-compliance with the safeguards agreements concluded pursuant to the Treaty should direct such concerns, along with supporting evidence and information, to the IAEA to consider, investigate, draw conclusions, and decide on necessary actions in accordance with its mandate. Also, the Conference called in particular for support of  IAEA Board actions to strengthen safeguards, including the Agency's capability to detect any undeclared nuclear activities. It further recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under IAEA safeguards as soon as practicable.
<P>
<LI>The Conference set 1996 as the target date for the 
conclusion of a comprehensive test ban agreement. It called for an early 
conclusion of a cut-off agreement (on the production of fissile materials for 
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices), and endorsed the creation 
of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones. The IAEA's specific role in relation 
to any of these measures has yet to be determined. The assumption remains 
that the proposed cut-off agreement would make use of IAEA safeguards as an 
essential element of the verification mechanism. In any new 
nuclear-weapon-free zone it could also be assumed - if existing models are an 
indication - that the IAEA will have some verification role. For a 
comprehensive test ban, it is relevant to note that the IAEA's comprehensive 
safeguards agreements already require verification by Agency inspectors of 
the commitment of  non-nuclear-weapon States not to divert nuclear material 
for weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. What specific function  the 
IAEA might be asked to assume under a comprehensive test ban are yet to be 
determined by the States negotiating this treaty.
<P>
<LI>The Conference called for every effort to be made to 
ensure that the IAEA has the financial and human resources necessary to meet 
effectively its responsibilities in the areas of technical cooperation, 
safeguards, and nuclear safety.
</UL>
<P>
The NPT Conference was convened at the United Nations in New York 17 
April to 12 May 1995. Altogether 175 States Parties to the NPT participated.  
Dr. Blix addressed the Conference on its opening day <I>(see the 
following item)</I> and a team of IAEA senior officials attended continuously. 
The IAEA further contributed background reports on its activities relevant to 
the Treaty, particularly on matters related to safeguards and technical 
cooperation.

<H2>Director General addresses NPT Conference</H2>
</A>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Review and Extension 
Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), 
IAEA Director General Hans Blix underscored the key responsibilities that have 
been entrusted to the Agency under the Treaty, and the need for sufficient 
resources to reliably carry them out.
<P>
"The Agency must be enabled, through adequate resources, and strengthened 
and streamlined safeguards, effectively to verify that non-proliferation 
pledges are respected and, thereby, to create confidence among the Parties," 
he said. He noted that the IAEA has a central, statutory role both in 
supporting the peaceful development of nuclear energy and in helping to 
prevent its military use, thus serving as a vital instrument for the NPT's 
implementation. In this context, he pointed to proposals before the IAEA Board 
of Governors for a major safeguards development programme. These proposals 
would significantly increase the level of assurance about the absence of 
undeclared facilities, he said. In parallel, he noted, the IAEA would continue 
to serve as a main intergovernmental channel for the transfer of peaceful 
nuclear technologies to countries in various fields.<I> - Copies of the address

</A>
<P>
An international seminar convened by the IAEA in May 1995 could 
lay the groundwork for strengthening global cooperation with the Russian 
Federation in areas of radioactive waste management and environmental 
restoration. Attending were more than 30 representives from Russian ministries 
and organizations involved in waste management, as well as representatives of 
15 other countries and one international organization. The meeting's main 
objectives were to review the existing situation and future plans of the 
Russian Federation in the field of radioactive waste management, to identify 
concerns, and to examine priorities for potential future cooperation. Toward 
this end, a comprehensive account was presented of Russia's waste management 
programmes, their structures, and problems. Detailed presentations also were 
made on programmes of bilateral cooperation with Russia in this field. The 
seminar was convened in response to a request of the Joint Council of the 
Nordic countries and with the approval of Russian authorities.
<P>
In addressing the seminar, IAEA Director General Hans Blix commended the 
Nordic initiative and the Russian Federation's positive response. He pointed 
out that "formidable tasks" are being faced regarding the treatment, storage, 
and disposal of radioactive waste, as well as in areas of environmental 
restoration, and he noted that the IAEA and its Member States appropriately 
could provide cooperation and assistance. The IAEA is preparing a report and a 
consolidation of the data presented at the seminar. Also planned is a 
follow-up experts' meeting later this year to establish and further elaborate 
proposed cooperative activities and to specify the role that the IAEA might 
play in facilitating cooperation.<I> - More information may be obtained from the

The IAEA has reaffirmed its readiness to assist the Armenian 
regulatory body in efforts to resolve issues that might have implications 
for the safety of the Medzamor-2 nuclear power plant, which the 
Government plans to restart following its shutdown since 1989.
<P>
Over the past months, Agency specialists have visited Armenia to review 
technical, seismic, and staff-related issues at the plant. In briefing the 
IAEA Board of Governors about the matter in June 1995, Director General Hans 
Blix reported that he has conveyed major findings of the expert reviews to 
Prime Minister Bagratian, who has extended his appreciation of the Agency's 
efforts. Dr. Blix noted that although any decision to resume the plant's 
operation is entirely the responsibility of the Armenian Government, it would 
be essential in the event of such a decision that identified outstanding 
safety issues be resolved and that a competent and well-trained operating 
staff be available. 
<P>
Based on their reviews, experts have emphasized the importance of making 
safety modifications at the plant that were previously approved by the 
regulatory body; comprehensively testing the safety systems before restarting 
the plant; ensuring availability of  sufficient numbers of qualified and 
licensed staff; resolving issues related to the integrity of the unannealed 
reactor pressure vessel; assessing and upgrading the seismic safety of the

Worldwide a total of 432 nuclear power reactors are 
operating for the production of electricity and another 48 are being built.  
In 1994, four new nuclear power plants were connected to electricity grids in 
China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Mexico, based on information reported to 
the IAEA's Power Reactor Information System.  Total installed nuclear capacity 
in 1994 rose to more than 340 thousand megawatts-electric.

Over the next 15 years, nuclear power is expected to grow 
at a modest but steady pace under prevailing restrictive conditions, based on 
recent estimates prepared by the IAEA's Planning and Economic Studies Section, 
Division of Nuclear Power.  Growth could be  more robust if some present 
obstacles - including financial constraints, low electricity demand in 
industrialized countries, and negative public attitudes in some countries - 
evolve in a positive direction.

<a name="A1.1"><h2>IAEA Board to consider proposal on safeguards</h2></a>
At its meetings beginning on 27 March 1995, the IAEA Board of Governors 
is scheduled to consider items related to safety and radiological 
protection; the strengthening of IAEA safeguards; safeguards implementation 
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); measures against 
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and radioactive sources; 
and radioactive waste management.
<p>
<B>Safeguards.</B> Among scheduled items before the Board is a major 
and comprehensive set of proposals for strengthening the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the IAEA's safeguards system, together with an evaluation 
of their technical, legal, and financial implications. This is 
the first opportunity for the Board to discuss this safeguards development 
effort, known as "Programme 93+2", and a further discussion 
is likely at its June meetings.
<p>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>. The Board is set to receive a report 
from IAEA Director General Hans Blix on the Agency's  inspection work 
in the DPRK, and the verification measures with respect to monitoring 
the freeze of the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and other facilities. 
The IAEA has confirmed that facilities subject to the freeze are not 
in operation and that construction has stopped. In mid-January 1995, 
an IAEA team visited the DPRK for further technical discussions with 
DPRK officials concerning the IAEA's verification measures.
<p>
<B>Illicit trafficking.</B> As follow-up to its initial discussions 
on this subject in December 1994, the Board is scheduled to consider 
proposals for intensifying the IAEA's activities related to illicit 
trafficking in nuclear materials and radioactive sources. The actions 
are in response to a General Conference resolution in September 1994 
on the subject, and the subsequent outcome of a meeting of experts 
convened by Dr. Blix in November 1994. The proposals, which 
cover both assistance in prevention of illicit trafficking and compilation/analysis 
of  cases that do occur, include the development of a reliable database 
of reported incidents; strengthening assistance to States 
related to physical protection measures, the accounting and control 
of nuclear material, and analysis of confiscated nuclear materials.
<p>
<B>Nuclear safety, radiological protection, and radioactive waste 
management.</B> The Board is due to receive a summary of the IAEA's 
Nuclear Safety Review (a report on recent developments in nuclear 
safety and radiological protection) and documents of the IAEA's Radioactive 
Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) programme, specifically the Safety 
Fundamentals document entitled "The Principles of Radioactive 
Waste Management" and the Safety Standard S-1 document entitled 
"Establishing a National System for Radioactive Waste Management". 
It further is to receive a progress report on preparatory work for 
drafting a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management 
that takes into account views expressed at an informal pre-meeting 
of governmental representatives at the IAEA in late February.
<p>
<B>Technical co-operation.</B> At its meetings in December 1994, the 
Board <I>inter alia</I> endorsed a report by its Technical Assistance 
and Co-operation Committee (TACC) on the IAEA's technical co-operation 
programme for 1995-96. The TACC had recommended the approval of projects 
in 1995-96 calling for funds of US $64.4 million, and the approval 
of the use of US $6.6 million for training courses. In its report, 
the TACC expressed strong concern over the decline of pledges and 
payments for technical co-operation programmes and urged IAEA Member 
States to meet the target that had been set for the Technical Assistance 
and Co-operation Fund. It further noted increasing demands for higher 
quality and larger scale projects, and expressed strong support for 
the concept of model projects, which are part of IAEA efforts to more 
closely orient its technical assistance to the long-term sustainable 
development goals of countries.

<a name="A1.2><h2>IAEA Director General to address NPT Conference in mid-April</h2></A>
IAEA Director General Hans Blix is scheduled to address the Review and Extension Conference 
of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT), which opens at the United Nations in New York on 17 April.  The 
Conference is required to decide on how, and for how long, the Treaty 
will be extended; a decision to extend the Treaty requires the consent 
of a majority of the Parties. As of 1 March 1995, the NPT had 172 
States Parties.
<p>
The NPT entered into force on 5 March 1970 for an initial period 
of 25 years. During 1993-95, four Preparatory Committee meetings were 
held to discuss organizational arrangements and prepare for the Conference 
itself. President of the NPT Conference, which is scheduled to conclude 
on 12 May,  is Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka. 
<p>
The IAEA has key responsibilities in connection with the NPT, and 
background papers have been prepared concerning them. They include 
papers related to Article III of the Treaty, which grants the IAEA 
specific responsibilities with respect to the implementation of safeguards, 
and Article IV, in which Parties encourage technical assistance for 
the transfer of technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <I>See 
the March edition of the IAEA Bulletin for fuller reports on the IAEA 
and its relationship to the NPT.</I>

<a name="A1.3"><h2>IAEA hosts UN systemwide meeting</h2></a>
IAEA Director General Hans Blix hosted the February 1995 meeting of the United Nations Administrative 
Committee on Co-ordination (ACC), which was chaired by UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The ACC includes the heads of UN organizations 
and specialized agencies within the UN system. The meeting, which 
was held at IAEA headquarters, included discussions of issues related 
to international drug abuse control, population and development, the 
environment, and the status of women in the UN system. The Secretary-General 
also directed an ACC Forum on the Future of the United Nations System 
convened at the Hofburg in Vienna 1 March. In addition to Dr. Blix 
and other ACC members, the Forum's participants included Austrian 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and leaders of international and regional 
commissions and groups. Discussions focused on the institutional and 
managerial strengths and limitations of the UN system, in the face 
of changing requirements arising from global political and economic 
developments. The United Nations officially marks its 50th anniversary 
this year.
<hr>
<a name="A1.4"><h2>Joint IAEA/EC/WHO conference on Chernobyl announced</h2></A>
The IAEA, the European Commission (EC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have announced 
their joint sponsorship of an international conference on the radiological 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Entitled "One Decade After 
Chernobyl: Summing up the Radiological Consequences of the Accident", 
the conference is planned in Vienna, Austria, from 8-12 April 1996. 
It will aim at consolidating an international consensus on the consequences 
of the accident, taking particular account of the findings of conferences 
being convened by WHO in November 1995 and by the European Union, 
Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine in March 1996. An important objective 
of the Vienna conference will be to clearly separate the scientific 
facts of the accident's consequences from "myths" and speculation, 
and to clarify and quantify its radiological health effects, as well 
as other related health, social, economic, and political consequences.
<p>
The health and environmental effects attributed to the 1986 Chernobyl 
accident have been subject to extensive scientific examination. Although 
few accidents have been so thoroughly investigated, there still remain 
widely differing opinions on the accident's real consequences. The 
Vienna conference is intended to seek a common and conclusive understanding 
of the nature and magnitude of these consequences. It will precede 
the International Congress on Radiation Protection, which opens in 
Vienna on 15 April 1996. <I>More information may be obtained 
from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety.</I>
<hr>
<a name="A1.5"><h2>IAEA concludes post-Chernobyl research project</h2></A>
The IAEA has concluded a post-Chernobyl research project related to the transfer 
of radionuclides through terrestrial, aquatic, and urban environments. 
Known as VAMP, for Validation of Environmental Model Predictions, 
the project was launched as an IAEA Co-ordinated Research Programme 
in 1988 and took advantage of data on the transfer of radionuclides 
resulting from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in 1986. A significant 
amount of data has been gathered by authorities in countries of the 
former USSR and throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Previously, 
the main source of information on the biospheric transfer of radionuclides 
was the fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing.
<p>
VAMP's specific objectives were to provide a mechanism for the validation 
of assessment models using environmental data on radionuclide transfer 
which resulted from the Chernobyl accident; to acquire data from affected 
countries for that purpose; and to produce reports on the current 
status of environmental modelling and the improvements achieved as 
a result of post-Chernobyl validation efforts. The programme at various 
stages  involved the participation of more than 100 experts representing 
altogether 25 countries.
<p>
VAMP was able to register a number of technical and administrative 
achievements. On the technical side, data sets have been acquired 
on a variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Studies further 
were done to test models using these data sets, which led to new insights 
on the strengths and weaknesses of currently used models. They also 
revealed areas where knowledge and information is lacking. On the 
administrative side, one clear benefit was in providing a mechanism 
for developing and maintaining national capabilities in the area of 
radiological assessment, as well as a focal point for the exchange 
of information and resources between scientists. As the programme 
developed, for example, an ever-increasing number of scientists from 
countries of the former Soviet Union participated in the work, providing 
valuable approaches.
<p>
Overall, a special feature of the VAMP programme was the 
examination of important transfer processes by means of expert review 
by modellers and experimenters attending the research co-ordination 
and working group meetings. In light of the programme's results and 
the needs it identified, the IAEA is planning to organize a follow-up 
project starting in 1996. Also being prepared is a technical document 
on the final VAMP results. It will supplement reports that the IAEA 
previously has issued on the programme. <I>More information may 
be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste
Management.</I>

<a name="A1.6"><h2>Uranium data in environmental monitoring</h2></A>
Countries are showing increasing interest in mapping their natural radiation environments, 
often turning to the IAEA for technical assistance and support. In 
particular, they seek to use uranium exploration data and techniques 
in environmental studies, one aspect of the IAEA's activities related 
to the nuclear fuel cycle.
<p>
During the uranium exploration boom of the late 1970s, hundreds of 
millions of dollars were expended in the development of geochemical 
and geophysical techniques and in carrying out surveys to locate uranium 
deposits. This investment in technology and the data collected are 
now being employed to prepare maps, provide environmental baseline 
data, and define relative health risks over large areas.
<p>
As part of its activities, the IAEA is preparing a report on a technical 
committee meeting on the use of uranium data and techniques for environmental 
studies; specialists from more than 20 countries participated. A range 
of IAEA technical reports issued over the years on gamma radiation 
surveys in uranium exploration and related subjects already are providing 
a valuable base of information. A number of these reports, for example, 
recently were cited in a project document by the European Union, which 
is carrying out a study of regional gamma-ray data in Central and 
Eastern Europe.  The studied region includes Poland,  Czech Republic, 
Slovak Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and 
Slovenia. <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division 
of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management.</I>

<a name="A1.7"><H2>Director General address in Chile</h2></a>
As the world moves to commemorate 
the 50th anniversaries of both the founding of the United Nations 
and the birth of the nuclear arms race, IAEA Director General Hans 
Blix has urged governmental leaders to take stock of recent radical 
changes that have seen the economic strength of nations grow and the 
possession of nuclear weapons decline in political importance. Dr. 
Blix made the remarks in a speech delivered at the Foreign Ministry 
in Santiago, Chile, on 15 December 1994.
<p>
Reviewing developments in the nuclear field, Dr. Blix noted that the 
rationale for nuclear weapons was less strong and their relevance 
to current world conflicts was nil. At the same time, he said, the 
atom's peaceful uses were steadily expanding. In areas of non-proliferation, 
he noted that significant progress had been, and continues to be, 
made, with both the Latin American and African regions helping to 
set the pace. In Latin America, he observed that the Treaty of Tlatelolco 
was expected to come into force shortly for the region. He further 
noted developments in areas of nuclear verification, arms control, 
and disarmament of importance to the outcome of the Review and Extension 
Conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT) in April 1995.
<p>
Commenting on challenges to the United Nations system, Dr. Blix 
said that the pendulum had swung from expectations of a new international 
order to moral indignation over the lack of effective action in national 
and regional conflicts around the world. He suggested that there
was a need for more nuanced judgment about the performance of 
the United Nations, and about the ways and means for strengthening 
the system. <i>The full text of the Director General's 
speech may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</i>

<a name="A1.8"><h2>South Africa, the Philippines host nuclear information seminars </h2></A>
South Africa and the Philippines 
separately hosted recent seminars organized in co-operation with the 
IAEA. In Johannesburg, from 24-26 January 1995, about 150 nuclear 
communicators, journalists, and government officials from six African 
countries, as well as South Africa, attended a regional nuclear information 
conference. The conference, which was officially opened by Mr. R.F. 
(Pik) Botha, South African Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs, 
featured sessions on South Africa's nuclear programme; public information 
and nuclear energy issues; nuclear safety and radiological protection; 
regulatory controls; and nuclear non-proliferation.
<p>
In Manila, from 29 November to 1 December 1994, more than 100 participants 
from the Philippines and six other Asian countries attended a regional 
seminar on peaceful applications of nuclear energy for Asia and the 
Pacific. Topics included nuclear power development policies; risks 
and benefits of nuclear power; public information on nuclear energy; 
and radiation facts and practical nuclear applications.
<p>
The seminars were the latest in a series being organized by the IAEA 
Division of Public Information within the framework of an extrabudgetary 
programme being financed by Japan. Upcoming seminars are being planned 
for May in Cuba and in Brazil. <i>More information may be obtained 
from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</i>

<a name="A1.9"><h2>Upcoming IAEA conferences, symposia, & seminars</h2></A>
<a name="A1.10"><B>ISOTOPES IN WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT.</B></A> How environmental changes 
are affecting the world's water resources will draw the close attention 
of more than 250 scientists at an international symposium organized 
by the IAEA and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO). The Symposium on Isotopes in Water Resources 
Management is being convened in Vienna 20-24 March 1995 and includes 
the participation of hydrologists, hydrogeologists, geochemists, and 
other scientists from nearly 70 countries and international organizations.
<p>
Growing exploitation of available water resources and renewed concerns 
over the conservation of water quality and pollution are heavily influencing 
the work of hydrologists. Isotope techniques are recognized as a valuable, 
and in some cases indispensable, tool for practical hydrological investigations 
when properly integrated with other methods. Through a number of technical 
co-operation and research programmes, the IAEA is assisting environmental 
and water authorities in its Member States interested in applying 
isotope and related techniques for water studies. Symposium sessions 
cover a range of research activities and isotope applications in the 
development of water resources and related environmental disciplines. 
They include studies of surface waters, sedimentology, groundwater, 
and geothermal waters; the impact of environmental change on global, 
regional, and local hydrological processes and water resources; mathematical 
models of hydrological systems; and the progress and development of 
isotope methods, including isotope analyses. Proceedings of the symposium 
will be published by the IAEA. <I>More information may be obtained 
from the IAEA Department of Research and Isotopes.</I>
<p>
<a name="A1.11"><B>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RADIOACTIVE RELEASES</B>.</a> Experts from 
more than 18 countries and international organizations will be presenting 
scientific papers at the IAEA's upcoming International Symposium on 
Environmental Impacts of Radioactive Releases. Being convened at the 
IAEA from 8-12 May, the meeting aims to review the impacts of radioactive 
releases that have caused environmental contamination, and the progress 
in developing, applying, and validating methodologies for assessing 
environmental impacts, as well as the methods and criteria for environmental 
restoration.
<p>
In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the environmental 
contamination that resulted from the early years of nuclear power 
development and also from nuclear weapons programmes. Also recognized 
is that releases from certain industrial facilities can contain enhanced 
concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, and can cause 
environmental contamination. Efforts are under way to assess the impact 
of these releases on humans and their environment. Examples include 
national and international programmes for the assessment of radiation 
doses in the environments of nuclear facilities, weapons testing areas, 
and marine waste disposal sites. At the symposium, papers are being 
presented by experts from Denmark, France, United Kingdom, Finland, 
Poland, Ukraine, Russia, India, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Japan, Spain, 
Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Belarus, and Belgium, as well as from 
the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, 
the IAEA, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations. <I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA Division 
of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management.</I>

<a name="A1.12"><B>JOINT FAO/IAEA SYMPOSIUM ON CROP IMPROVEMENT</B>.</A> Technological 
advances increasingly are influencing the work of researchers dedicated 
to the improvement of crops and plants. Many of the leading professionals 
in the field will be meeting in Vienna 19-23 June 1995 at the International 
Symposium on the Use of Induced Mutations and Molecular Techniques 
for Crop Improvement, jointly organized by the IAEA and Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Major objectives are to 
help bridge the gap between practical plant breeding and state-of-the-art 
laboratory techniques, and to stimulate discussion on crop-related 
problems worldwide and their possible solutions. Although advanced 
plant breeding techniques are being used in some developing countries, 
the transfer of technology has been slow. <I>More information

<a name="A1.14"><h2>Safeguards and non-proliferation developments</h2></A>
<a name="A1.15"><b>IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENTS</B></A>. Comprehensive IAEA safeguards agreements 
with Bolivia and Croatia have entered into force. The Bolivia agreement 
took effect on 6 February 1995, and the Croatia agreement on 19 January 
1995. Bolivia's agreement was  concluded in connection with the Treaty 
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Tlatelolco 
Treaty) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT). Croatia's agreement was pursuant to the NPT.
<p>
Two other States -- Myanmar and Zimbabwe -- have negotiated 
NPT safeguards agreements with the IAEA recently. The agreements are 
being submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors for approval.
<p>
<a name="A1.16"><B>NEW NPT MEMBERS.</B></A> Algeria, Argentina, and the Marshall Islands 
are among the newest members of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Algeria informed the IAEA earlier this 
year that it had deposited its instrument of accession to the NPT 
with the Depositary Governments on 12 January 1995. In welcoming the 
announcement, IAEA Director General Hans Blix described Algeria's 
decision as a "significant and positive" development that 
would also add impetus to efforts to declare the whole of Africa as 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Normal procedure foresees the conclusion 
by States joining the NPT of a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
with the IAEA covering all nuclear materials. IAEA safeguards already 
are being applied at Algeria's two nuclear research reactors under 
procedures agreed with Algerian authorities.
<p>
Also in January 1995, Argentina (on 10 January) and the Marshall Islands 
(on 30 January) acceded to the NPT. Argentina also is party to the 
Treaty of Tlatelolco, which establishes a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, and to the Quadripartite Agreement, 
under which the IAEA applies comprehensive safeguards in Brazil and 
Argentina, which have established a common system for nuclear verification 
(ABACC).

the energy needs of the Asia and Pacific region, and suggests what 
courses Australia should pursue. Among other timely points, the monograph 
notes that international safeguards supply the framework for the export 
of Australian uranium and a secure legal basis for the growth of nuclear 
electricity generation in several Asian countries. <I>More information

<a name="A1.19"><h2>SIT campaign in Zanzibar</h2></A>
In support of an IAEA technical co-operation project in Zanzibar, the Chinese government recently donated a minibus 
for transporting project staff, and the research services of a veterinarian 
and entomologist.  The project -- being carried out with Tanzania, 
the assistance of the IAEA and Food and Agriculture Organzation (FAO) 
of the United Nations, and the United States -- aims to eradicate 
the tsetse fly from Zanzibar using the radiation-based Sterile Insect 
Technique (SIT). The tsetse fly is a vector for human sleeping sickness 
and for a fatal condition in cattle known as Ngana. SIT is an insect 
population-control technique involving the use of gamma radiation 
to sterilize male flies reared under laboratory conditions that are 
then released in infested areas to mate with females, which then produce 
no offspring. In Zanzibar, aerial releases of SIT flies conducted 
since August 1994 have led to encouraging results so far. The Chinese 
contributions will be used to transport project personnel, and to 
support field surveys in which entomological and veterinary monitoring 
play essential roles. At a ceremony in Vienna, China's Counsellor 
Mr. Zunqi Liu presented the official papers for the minibus to Mr. 
Paulo Barretto, Director of the Department's Division of Technical 
Co-operation Programmes. <I>Readers interested in receiving regular 
updates on this project, through the newsletter Tanzanian TseTse Brief,

<H2><A NAME = "A1.1">IAEA analyzing effect of US-DPRK agreed framework</H2></A>

At an informal briefing of the IAEA Board of Governors on 25 October 
1994, Director General Hans Blix said that the existing safeguards 
agreement between the IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) "is and will remain" valid, and that the agreed 
framework signed between the United States and the DPRK in Geneva 
on 21 October does not supercede or replace or detract from the safeguards 
agreement.<P>
Dr. Blix informed the Board that the IAEA, in anticipation of receiving 
a multilateral mandate to take account of the agreed framework, now 
is analyzing the effect that it could be expected to have on the IAEA's 
safeguards work in the DPRK. He said that the DPRK's commitment under 
the agreed framework to freeze its present nuclear programme 
could be seen as consistent with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the safeguards agreement, and that safeguards 
activities under the safeguards agreement will be capable of verifying 
the implementation of the freeze. He  said that he foresees a 
continuing presence of IAEA inspectors at the Nyongbyon nuclear centre, 
and that the IAEA will be assessing the full extent of needed safeguards 
efforts.<P>
The Director General further underscored the importance of the DPRK's 
full co-operation with the IAEA. He noted that the DPRK's disagreement 
with the IAEA had been caused by its refusal to co-operate in its 
verification of the correctness and completeness of the initially 
declared inventory of nuclear material. Under the Geneva agreed framework, 
the DPRK will commit itself to accepting such verification once a 
significant portion of the light-water reactor project agreed with 
the US has been completed. This commitment is to be welcomed, he said, 
but there could be a further significant delay before the required 
full compliance with the safeguards agreement would be attained. It 
would be in the interest of all concerned, he said, that a prolonged 
delay be avoided and that the DPRK accept early verification of its 
inventory of nuclear material as required by the safeguards agreement.<P>
<HR>


<H2><A NAME = "A1.2">Statement to general assembly in New York</H2></A>
 In addressing the 
49th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York on 17 October, 
IAEA Director General Hans Blix said that new expectations and demands 
for both verification and safety-related services are being placed 
upon the Agency in response to global nuclear developments.<P>
Dr. Blix noted that, in the context of the conference next spring 
to review and extend the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT), the IAEA would present detailed reports about the way 
in which it is strengthening its safeguards verification system. He 
said the IAEA will also report to the NPT Conference on its activities 
in support of the transfer of nuclear science and technology for peaceful 
purposes. In the safeguards field, the Director General cited several 
important developments which call for expansion of IAEA activities, 
including the successful negotiation of comprehensive safeguards agreements 
with States of the former Soviet Union. NPT-type safeguards agreements 
have been concluded with eight of these States, he said, and a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement also has been signed between the IAEA and Ukraine. 
Among the new verification activities for the IAEA, Dr. Blix noted 
that the United States has begun a process for the eventual submission 
to IAEA inspection of all US fissile material no longer needed for 
defense purposes. He also said the IAEA has set up a working group 
to examine relevant issues related to the proposed cut-off agreement 
for the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons 
purposes. He further pointed out the IAEA's technical advisory role 
regarding future verification arrangements for a Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty. New expectations in the international community further 
are leading toward a stronger global legal framework for the safe 
development of nuclear energy, Dr. Blix said. He noted that governments 
recently have adopted the International Convention on Nuclear Safety; 
that the IAEA Board of Governors earlier this month adopted new international 
basic radiation safety standards; and that consensus exists for a 
convention on the safe management and disposal of radioactive waste. 
The Director General also described a number of significant changes 
in the orientation of the IAEA's programmes for transferring nuclear 
science and technology.<P>

In addition to his statement at the United Nations, Dr. Blix addressed 
a number of distinguished audiences in September and October: the 
Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, DC; the Congress of the 
European Nuclear Society in Lyon, France; and the 38th regular session 
of the IAEA General Conference in Vienna, Austria.<P>

Highlights from these statements follow:<BR>

<B><A NAME = "A1.3">Council on Foreign Relations, 19 October 1994</B></A>: Addressing current 
non-proliferation problems, Dr. Blix outlined a number of issues influencing 
the global picture, particularly those affecting the outcome of the 
NPT Conference in 1995. The issues include those related to progress 
in areas of arms control and disarmament; security assurances; 
regional non-proliferation arrangements; the impact of the cases of 
Iraq and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and questions 
of technology transfer, among others. He expressed the hope that these 
issues would be addressed in a coherent and constructive
manner so as to strengthen prospects for a successful outcome of the 
NPT Conference.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.4">Congress of the European Nuclear Society, 4 October 1994.</B></A><P>
 Prospects 
for nuclear power generation may brighten in years ahead for several 
reasons, Dr. Blix said. One is the receding shadow of the military 
atom, which has long obscured the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy and now is starting to fade as the number of nuclear warheads 
is cut back by the two major nuclear-weapon States. Another reason 
is the inevitable rise in energy and electricity demand, and the need 
for countries to compare and assess their energy options. Countries 
having the necessary economic and technological advancement may well 
favour nuclear power, Dr. Blix said, not least on environmental grounds. 
He noted that nuclear power has built solid records of performance 
and economics in countries having established programmes, and that 
future power reactor designs can be expected to be even more reliable 
and economical.As importantly, Dr. Blix said, an international 
nuclear safety regime is emerging to complement national measures, 
and this development may facilitate future acceptance and growth 
of nuclear power. At the Congress,Dr. Blix was presented 
with the 1994 Foratom Award.<I>(See the item on page 3.)</I><P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.5">IAEA General Conference, 19 September 1994.</B></A><P>
 In his remarks 
to the IAEA General Conference, Dr. Blix called for a new understanding 
among governments to secure sufficient funds to enable the Agency 
to carry out increasing responsibilities for the safe and peaceful 
development of nuclear energy. For the Agency to successfully 
meet the current and expected demands... a new understanding among 
governments is needed to secure adequate and timely funding for the 
full range of present and new activities which the Agency is called 
on to undertake, he said. Dr. Blix reviewed a number of areas 
in which governments are entrusting the IAEA with a greater role. 
They are related to the development of international rules and services 
in the fields of nuclear safety, radiation protection, and waste management; 
the transfer of nuclear technologies for electricity generation, food 
production, health care, and environmental protection; the implementation 
of nuclear safeguards under a growing number of agreements; and the 
performance of verification tasks requested by the UN Security Council 
or under bilateral and multilateral agreements in the field of nuclear 
arms control and disarmament.<I>Copies of the Director General's 
statements are available from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</I><P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.6">Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.</H2></A> 
The IAEA has scheduled 
a meeting of governmental experts in early November to identify additional 
ways in which the Agency might contribute to international efforts 
against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. The meeting was 
scheduled 2-3 November at IAEA headquarters in Vienna.<P>

In September, at the IAEA General Conference, Member States expressed 
their deep concern over recent increases in reports of illicit trafficking 
and their support for greater preventive measures. They adopted a 
resolution that invited IAEA Director General Hans Blix to take a 
number of actions, namely to intensify the IAEA's activities that 
are already supporting Member States in this area, including those 
related to the establishment and upgrading of national systems of 
nuclear material accounting and control; to examine additional options 
available in the field of collecting, verifying, and analyzing data 
relating to incidents of illicit trafficking and the field of physical 
protection in conformity with the Agency's Statute; and to prepare 
proposals in consultation with a group of experts designated by Member 
States and competent international organizations for submission to 
the IAEA Board of Governors if possible at its session in December 
1994 but no later than its March 1995 session.<P>

In confirming that national governments and authorities carry the 
main responsibility in this field, the resolution also calls upon 
IAEA Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent illicit 
trafficking in nuclear material. At the same time, it stresses the 
importance of close co-operation at bilateral and multilateral levels 
for overcoming problems.<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.7">IAEA Director Blix honoured.</H2></A>
 The European Atomic Forum 
has presented its 1994 Foratom Award to IAEA Director General Hans 
Blix. The Award, which was established in 1978, is presented every 
4 years to individuals who have made major contributions to peaceful 
uses of atomic energy in Europe and the world at large.<P>

The Award was presented to Dr. Blix on 4 October 1994 at the Congress 
of the European Nuclear Society in Lyon, France, by Dr. Bill Wilkinson, 
President of the European Atomic Forum. In presenting the Award, Dr. 
Wilkinson paid tribute to Dr. Blix's courageous and effective 
advocacy of nuclear power as an environmentally benign source of electricity.
He also commended him for the political impartiality, administrative 
and diplomatic skills, team player spirit, and ability to 
secure trust among national leaders which he had consistently displayed 
throughout his terms of office at the IAEA since 1981.<P>

In his acceptance remarks, Dr. Blix thanked Dr. Wilkinson warmly for 
the honour represented by the Award, which he accepted not just personally 
but on behalf of the <P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.8">Ukraine and IAEA sign safeguards agreement. </H2></A>
A comprehensive 
safeguards agreement between the IAEA and Ukraine was signed at the 
Agency's headquarters on 28 September 1994. The agreement was signed 
on behalf of the IAEA by Director General Hans Blix and on behalf 
of Ukraine by Mr. Nikolai A. Shteinberg, Chairman of the Ukrainian 
State Committee on Nuclear and Radiation Safety.<P>

The safeguards agreement was approved by the IAEA Board of Governors 
in September 1994. It covers all nuclear material in all peaceful 
nuclear activities within the territory of Ukraine, under its jurisdiction 
or carried out under its control anywhere. The agreement will enter 
into force upon the IAEA's receipt of written notification by Ukraine 
that Ukraine's statutory and constitutional requirements have been 
completed. The agreement would remain in force until superseded by 
an agreement between Ukraine and the Agency for the application of 
safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).<P>

Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs had informed the IAEA in September 
1992 of Ukraine's intention to adhere to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon 
State. Since that time, the IAEA has taken a number of measures necessary 
for the application of NPT safeguards in Ukraine, including technical 
visits conducted with a view to performing verification activities 
similar to those provided in NPT-type safeguards agreements.<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.9">International convention on nuclear safety</H2></A>
Forty-nine countries 
have signed the International Convention on Nuclear Safety since it 
opened for signature in September, with one, Norway,  already depositing 
its instrument of ratification with the IAEA. The Convention 
the first legal instrument that directly addresses the issue of safety 
of nuclear power plants worldwide was first opened for signature 
on 20 September at the IAEA General Conference in Vienna. <P>

The Convention applies to land-based civil nuclear power plants 
and obliges Contracting Parties to establish and maintain proper legislative 
and regulatory frameworks to govern safety. Through the Convention, 
States commit themselves to the application of fundamental safety 
principles for nuclear installations, and agree to participate 
in periodic peer review meetings to submit national reports on implementation
of their obligations.<P>

The Convention will remain open for signature at IAEA headquarters 
until its entry into force.  This will be on the 90th day after the 
twenty-second instrument of ratification is deposited with the IAEA, 
which is the Depositary of the Convention, including the instruments 
of 17 States that each have at least one nuclear installation which 
has achieved criticality in a reactor core. Signatories as of 24 October 
are Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, 
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, 
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nigeria, 
Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, 
Romania, Russian Federation, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, 
Sudan, Syria, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and

<H2><A NAME = "A1.10">Highlights of the 1994 IAEA General Conference.</H2></A>
 High-level
governmental representatives, including 20 ministers from 100 Member 
States of the IAEA, attended the 38th regular session of the IAEA 
General Conference 19-23 September 1994 in Vienna. Delegates elected 
as President of the Conference Professor Alec Jean Baer of Switzerland. <P>

Actions were taken in a number of key areas of global nuclear development. 
Topics addressed included those related to:<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.11">IAEA safeguards in the DPRK. </B></A> Expressing their "continuing 
concern" over the DPRK's non-compliance with its safeguards agreement 
with the IAEA, Member States adopted a resolution urging the DPRK 
to co-operate immediately with the Agency in the full implementation 
of the agreement and to allow the IAEA to have access to all safeguards-relevant 
information and locations. It further strongly endorsed actions taken 
by the IAEA Board of Governors and IAEA Director General Hans Blix 
for their impartial efforts to implement the safeguards agreement. <P>


<B><A NAME = "A1.12">Monitoring and verification in Iraq.</B></A> The Conference adopted 
a resolution that stresses the need for Iraq to co-operate fully with 
the IAEA in achieving complete and long-term implementation of UN 
Security Council Resolutions relating to Iraq. It notes that the IAEA, 
having completed the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear weapons capability, 
is now in a position to implement its ongoing monitoring and verification 
plan, and that the IAEA retains the right to investigate further any 
aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons programme, in particular as 
regards any new information obtained by the IAEA and assessed as warranting 
further investigations.  

<B> <A NAME = "A1.13">IAEA safeguards system.</B></A> Pointing towards the 1995 Conference 
on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 
the IAEA's essential role in applying safeguards under that Treaty 
and under regional nuclear-weapon-free zones (in Latin America and 
the South Pacific), Member States adopted a resolution on strengthening 
the IAEA's safeguards system. It expresses the conviction that IAEA 
safeguards can promote further confidence among States and thereby 
help to strengthen their collective security, and it underlines the 
central importance of effective safeguards for the prevention of nuclear 
energy's misuse for non-peaceful purposes and for the promotion of 
co-operation in its peaceful uses. It specifically requests the IAEA 
Director General to continue with the assessment, development, and, 
on a voluntary basis, the testing of measures for achieving a strengthened 
and more cost-efficient safeguards system, and to present to the IAEA 
Board of Governors in March 1995 proposals toward that end, together 
with an evaluation of their technical, legal, and financial implications.

<B><A NAME = "A1.14">Measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.</B></A>
 IAEA staff who worked with him in pursuit of 
the Agency's goals. He said he remained profoundly convinced of the 
many benefits for humanity of nuclear energy's versatile peaceful 
applications, including power generation. He stressed the increasing 
relevance of the international dimensions of the use of nuclear energy 
the need for international verification of the peaceful nature 
of nuclear installations and the need for international rules and 
services to complement national measures to ensure safety in the use 
of nuclear power.  In expressing confidence about nuclear power's 
future, he said  that the advantages of nuclear power as a valuable 
part of the overall energy mix would become increasingly apparent.<P>
<HR>


<B><A NAME = "A1.15">African nuclear-weapon-free zone.</B></A> Welcoming the progress made 
towards the conclusion of a treaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone, 
the Conference adopted a resolution commending the African States 
for their efforts and requesting the IAEA Director General to continue 
to assist them in this regard.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.16">South Africa's participation in IAEA activities.</B></A> Member States 
adopted a resolution that invites South Africa to resume participation 
in all activities of the IAEA and specifically requests the IAEA Board 
of Governors to review the designation of South Africa to the Board. 
(As of 1977, South Africa was no longer the designated Member of the 
Board of Governors for the African Region). In taking the action, 
the General Conference particularly noted South Africa's dismantlement 
of its nuclear-weapons programme and its contribution to the evolution 
of an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone, and welcomed with deep satisfaction 
the new Government of National Unity as representative of all peoples 
in the country.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.17">Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East</B></A>.
 The Conference 
adopted a resolution that calls upon all parties concerned to consider 
seriously taking the practical and appropriate steps required for 
the implementation of the proposal to establish a mutually and effectively 
verifiable nuclear-weapon-free-zone (NWFZ) in the region, and invites 
all countries concerned to adhere to international non-proliferation 
regimes, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, as a means of complementing participation in a zone free 
of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and of strengthening 
peace and security in the region. It requests the IAEA's Director 
General to continue consultations with States of the Middle East to 
facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to 
all nuclear activities in the region as relevant to the preparation 
of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment 
of a NWFZ in the Middle East. <P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.18">IAEA technical co-operation activities.</B></A> The Conference adopted 
two resolutions in this area, one directed at strengthening technical 
co-operation activities and the other at financing technical assistance. 
The first resolution <I>inter alia </I>requests the Agency's Director 
General, in consultation with Member States, to present new initiatives 
to strengthen IAEA technical co-operation activities through the development 
of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological 
capabilities of developing countries in the fields of peaceful applications 
of nuclear energy and achieving sustainable development. The second 
resolution expresses concern about the decline in pledges and payments 
to the Agency's Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund and requests 
the IAEA Board of Governors to re-establish an informal working group 
open to all Member States on the financing of technical assistance.<P>
<HR>



<B><A NAME = "A1.19">Technical assistance in the Middle East.</B></A> The Conference decided 
to restore technical assistance to Israel and expressed its wish for 
closer co-operation between the IAEA and Israel in Agency activities 
in accordance with the Agency's Statute and objectives. (The provision 
of technical assistance to Israel by the Agency has been suspended 
since 1981 pursuant to a General Conference resolution.)  Additionally, 
the General Conference, consistent with the Cairo Agreement of 4 May 
1994 between the PLO and Israel, mandated the Agency's Board of Governors 
to identify, through its Technical Assistance Committee, technical 
assistance projects that could be implemented in the territories under 
the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority through appropriate 
international organizations.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.20">Radioactive waste management.</B></A>Member States adopted a resolution 
that stresses the vital necessity for the IAEA to continue to promote, 
co-ordinate, and strengthen international co-operation in the field 
of radioactive waste management. It specifically invites the IAEA 
Board of Governors and the Director General to start preparations 
for an international convention on the safety of waste management, 
and to continue the process of collecting relevant background information 
that would be useful in drafting the convention. It further calls 
for increased IAEA activities that assist Member States, particularly 
developing countries, in strengthening waste management infrastructures 
and to consider further measures for enhancing global co-operation, 
including assessment of the impact of land and sea disposal of wastes.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.21">Water resources and production.</B></A>Two resolutions were adopted 
relating to this general subject. One resolution is directed at a 
plan for producing potable water economically. Noting the interest 
of a number of States in activities relating to seawater desalination 
using nuclear energy, and the conclusion of an advisory group on the 
need to establish a programme for identifying options and selecting 
demonstration facilities, the resolution calls upon Member States 
in a position to do so to provide expert services and extrabudgetary 
resources in support of these activities. It further requests the 
Director General to consult with interested States, and relevant international 
organizations in and outside the United Nations family, concerning 
desalination. The second resolution addresses the extensive use of 
isotope hydrology for water resources management, especially recognizing 
its valuable role in studying processes related to groundwater recharge, 
water salination, seepage, and water pollution, for example. It requests 
the Director General to direct the IAEA's available expertise and 
resources to a few concrete and cogent projects that would result 
in a visible impact in improved water resources management through 
isotope techniques, and urges the IAEA to work in conjunction with 
other concerned international organizations and solicit their co-operation 
in such projects. <P>
<HR>


<B><A NAME = "A1.22">IAEA budget and extrabudgetary resources for 1995.</B></A> The adopted 
budget resolution approves expenditures for 1995 of US $211.5 million. 
This represents zero growth in real terms. The Conference further 
approved the target amount of US $61.5 million for the IAEA Technical 
Assistance and Co-operation Fund for 1995.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.23">Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat.</B></A> Two resolutions were adopted. 
One resolution, in taking note of ongoing efforts, requests the Director 
General with the assistance of Member States to increase the number 
of staff members from developing countries, particularly at the senior 
and policy-making levels. The other requests the Director General 
to continue efforts to rectify the existing imbalance in the representation 
of women in the professional and higher categories, particularly at 
the senior and policy-making levels, as well as in posts requiring 
scientific and technical qualifications, and from developing countries.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.24">Nuclear safety and radiological protection. </B></A> The General Conference 
also took note of a number of reports on IAEA activities for strengthening 
nuclear safety and radiological protection. The measures include those 
related to the implementation of international conventions, including 
the International Convention on Nuclear Safety which opened for signature 
during the General Conference; provision of safety services; preparation 
of safety standards, including the newly adopted Basic Safety Standards 
for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation 
Sources; promotion of education and training; provision of technical 
assistance relating specifically to the safety of nuclear power plants 
in countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; and safety 
principles for future nuclear power plants. Additionally, the work 
includes consideration by a Standing Committee of matters related 
to liability for nuclear damage.<P>

<B><strong><A NAME = "A1.25">SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE</B></strong>.<P></A>
 In conjunction 
with the IAEA General Conference in September, representatives from 
Member States attended a scientific programme on three topics: new 
directions in environmental monitoring; the use of high-energy accelerators 
for transmutation of actinides and power production; and the role 
of nuclear techniques in global food security and sustainability.<P>
<I><B><A NAME = "A1.26">Environmental monitoring.</I></B></A>The programme included presentations 
on the status and trends in the use of atmospheric radioactivity monitoring 
to detect nuclear events; the environmental sampling network of the 
Environmental Measurements Laboratory in the United States; a review 
of significant IAEA activities in environmental monitoring and radiation 
protection; and the application of environmental monitoring to IAEA 
safeguards. A number of new areas for application of environmental 
monitoring were highlighted, as well as global networks for detecting, 
tracing, and characterizing releases of radioactivity to the environment.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.27">High-energy accelerators and radioactive waste management.</B></A> 
Presentations addressed the potential of this technology for reducing 
the volume of high-level radioactive waste by converting radio-toxic 
actinides and fission products into short-lived or stable isotopes 
and for generating electricity in the process. Participants discussed 
the advantages and disadvantages of the system and prospects for its 
technical and economic viability.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.28">Global food security and sustainability.</B></A> Presentations emphasized 
how nuclear techniques can serve as powerful research and developmental 
tools alone or in combination with other technologies in food and 
agricultural areas. The session was held as part of activities in 
commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division 
of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture.<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.29">Other meetings.</B></A> Additionally, during the General Conference, 
a traditional meeting of senior national and international officials 
in areas of nuclear safety and radiation protection was convened, 
as were meetings for representatives from Member States participating 
in regional technical co-operation arrangements for Africa, Latin 
America, and Asia and the Pacific.<P>
<HR>


<H2><A NAME = "A1.30">Air transport of radioactive materials</H2></A>. Experts from 17 IAEA 
Member States and three international organizations recently met in 
Vienna on proposed regulatory provisions for certain types of radioactive 
materials in air transport. They specifically reviewed a draft technical 
document for use in developing regulatory provisions for a new type 
of package which will be required for air transport of radioactive 
materials in excess of certain threshold quantities. The provisions 
are intended for inclusion in the 1996 revised edition of the IAEA 
Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.<P>

The meeting reached consensus on most of the proposed test requirements 
for the new  packages, to be known as Type C. These tests include 
an impact test with an impact velocity of not less than 85 meters 
per second (most aircraft crashes have generally lower impact speeds 
than the proposed test criterion); a fire test at a temperature of 
800 degrees Celsius for a period of one hour; a 200-metre immersion 
test designed to enable retrieval of the package from coastal waters 
or continental shelves; a puncture/tearing test; and a crush test. 
The proposed test criteria are partly supplementary and in every case 
more stringent than those of other existing package designs, taking 
into account the different and more severe environment of mechanical 
and thermal forces in aircraft crashes.<P>

The IAEA's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials 
have long been the basis for regulating national and international 
road, rail, air, and water shipments of radioactive material. They 
are subject to a continuous review and revision process to identify 
areas that can be further improved. In the case of air transport, 
the review process is designed to limit the probability of serious 
radiological consequences of accidents involving aircraft carrying 
packages of radioactive materials; to facilitate planning; and to 
ensure package recovery. <I>More information may be obtained

<H2><A NAME = "A1.31">Accelerators for research.</H2></A>
 The IAEA has inaugurated the Laboratory 
for Nuclear Microanalysis at the Institute Ruder Boskovic in Croatia 
as one of its collaborating laboratories in the field of accelerator-based 
analytical techniques. This enables the IAEA to provide advanced analytical 
services and training, particularly in connection with a number of 
its programmes. In Croatia, a beamline analytical facility has been 
constructed and installed on the existing Van de Graaf accelerator. 
The collaboration provides for the IAEA's cost-free use of the machine, 
together with supporting facilities such as sample preparation and 
an electronic laboratory. It further covers the proton microprobe, 
installed on the same accelerator and used for elemental concentration 
mapping on a micrometer scale.
The beamline facility can also be used to provide advanced analytical 
services to scientists from IAEA Member States and their institutions. 
In addition, training and maintenance of accelerator equipment can 
be provided for developing countries possessing accelerator facilities. 
Applications include air pollution analysis and multi-elemental analysis 
of environmental samples; medical and biological applications; solid 
state and material analysis; and agriculture studies.<I>More

<H2><A NAME = "A1.32">Water resources</H2></A>
 Some 70 scientists and researchers from more 
than 20 countries recently participated in an IAEA interregional seminar 
on isotope techniques in arid and semi-arid land hydrology. The seminar 
was held in conjunction with a symposium on the application of tracers 
in arid zone hydrology organized by the IAEA in co-operation with 
the International Committee on Tracers of the International Association 
of Hydrological Sciences. Participating countries were Albania, Algeria, 
Australia, Austria, Cote D'Ivoire, Egypt, Germany, Iran, Israel, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, 
South Africa, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, and United States.<P>


Experts addressed the applications of isotope techniques in the unsaturated 
zone to understand the origin, flow, and availability of groundwater 
resources in the arid environment; and the use of numerical flow and 
transport modelling for quantitative evaluation of isotope data in 
groundwater systems. Scientific papers were also presented to discuss 
case studies in the exploration and pollution problems encountered 
in the development of the water resources. <I>More information 
may be obtained from the Isotope Hydrology Section of the IAEA Department 
of Research and Isotopes. The IAEA is organizing a Symposium on Isotopes 
in Water Resources in Vienna, 20-25 March 1995.</I><P>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.33">Radiation technologies in health care</H2></A>
 As more countries benefit 
from the use of ionizing radiation for sterilizing tissues, blood, 
and other medical products, the need to pool international knowledge 
about the technology is becoming increasingly clear. At the 3rd European 
Conference on Tissue Banking and Clinical Application of Grafts, specialists 
in the field explored legal and ethical  aspects, as well as questions 
of standardization and quality assurance. The conference was organized 
in Vienna 4-7 October 1994 by the European Association of Tissue Banks 
(EATB) in co-operation with the IAEA, and with the American Association 
of Tissue Banks and Asia-Pacific Association of Surgical Tissue Banking.<P>

Scientific sessions focused on a range of technical topics, including 
reports of the latest developments and practices in the field of tissue 
banking and surgical use of grafts. Also presented were general standards 
for tissue banking and ethical rules that have been proposed by EATB 
in the interests of harmonization within Europe, and an overview of 
the IAEA's programme on radiation sterilization of tissues. The programme 
has led to the establishment of tissue banks in 13 countries in Asia 
and the Pacific region, and other banks now are emerging in Africa 
and South America. To further promote progress, the IAEA has 
harnessed the support of major world associations involved with the 
technology.<P>
Other applications reviewed at the conference included the use of 
radiation technologies for sterilizing packaged medical supplies and 
related products. Worldwide, more than  40% of these products presently 
are being sterilized using radiation technology, it was reported, 
with 180 gamma irradiators and about 20 electron beam accelerators 
in service around the world. Radiation sterilization is now a major 
technology for the manufacture of sterile health care products.

<H2><A NAME = "A1.34">Spent fuel storage</H2></A>
 Safety, engineering, and environmental aspects 
of spent fuel storage were reviewed at an IAEA international symposium 
10-14 October 1994 in Vienna. The symposium included reviews of national 
approaches to the safe storage of spent fuel; selection of different 
spent fuel storage technologies; design, planning, and siting of storage 
facilities; and methods for increasing storage capacities, for example. 
The total amount of spent fuel accumulated worldwide at the end of 
1993 was 140 thousand tonnes heavy metals (tHM) and projections indicate 
the amount may reach 330 thousand tHM by the year 2010. Considering 
that part of it will be reprocessed, the amount of spent fuel to be 
stored by 2010 would be about 215 thousand tHM, or more than twice 
as much as is now in storage worldwide.<P>

Storage problems necessarily are taking on greater urgency in a number 
of countries. The first geological repositories for the final disposal 
of spent fuel are not expected to be in operation before 2010, and 
the use of interim storage will be the main option for spent fuel 
management in the near- to mid-term. It has been demonstrated that 
spent fuel can be safely stored for long time periods, and some spent 
fuel now has been in safe storage for more than 30 years in some countries. 
The symposium reaffirmed the scientific consensus that the present 
technologies for spent fuel storage give adequate protection to the 
population and the environment, and the continuing interest in studying 
whether further reductions in risk and greater radiological safety 
can be achieved. Over 120 participants from 34 countries and four 
international organizations attended the symposium.<I>More

 Scientists engaged in agricultural 
and environmental research around the world met in Vienna 17-21 October 
1994 at the International Symposium on Nuclear and Related Techniques 
in Soil Studies on Sustainable Agriculture and Environmental Preservation. 
The symposium was jointly organized by the IAEA and Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and took place at a time 
when the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and 
Agriculture marked its 30th anniversary of service.<P>
The symposium featured studies on soil/plant relationships in sustainable 
agricultural systems and research associated with environmental pollution 
problems. Specific technical topics included soil fertility, plant 
nutrition, water management, crop production, and environmental aspects 
related to nutrient and water management in crop production studies.

<H2><A NAME = "A1.36">Comprehending radiation risks</H2></A>
 A major international conference 
on radiation and society opened in Paris 24 October 1994. The week-long 
conference was organized by the IAEA at the invitation of France and 
with support from the French Institute for Protection and Nuclear 
Safety (IPSN). Sessions took place at the newly established conference 
facility at the Louvre.<P>
The conference drew the interest and participation of some 400 policy 
makers, nuclear experts, and the media from 51 countries and nine 
international organizations. Participants examined a number of case 
studies including the nuclear weapons legacy, cancer and leukaemia 
clusters, radioactive waste disposal and the environment, and Chernobyl 
health effects. They further examined various aspects of the interplay 
between experts advice, public and media perceptions, and the decision-making 
process.<P>

Technical sessions covered various topics, including assessment of 
radiation exposure levels; assessment of radiation health effects; 
impact of radiation on the environment; perception of radiation risk; 
and managing radiation risk. Fora for the media and policy makers 
particularly looked at communication aspects of radiation risk, including 
discussions of controversial case studies. <I>More information

<H2><A NAME = "A1.37">Environmental impact of radioactive releases.</H2></A>
 From 8-12 May 
1995 in Vienna, Austria, the IAEA is convening an international Symposium 
on the Environmental Impact of Radioactive Releases. This symposium 
aims to review the radiological and environmental impacts of radioactive 
releases which have caused contamination of terrestrial and aquatic 
environments. Additionally, it will review the progress in developing, 
applying, and validating methodologies for assessing environmental 
impacts, as well as the methods and criteria for environmental restoration.<P>
There is increasing concern in Member States over the environmental 
contamination that resulted from the early years of nuclear power 
development and also from nuclear weapons programmes. It is also recognized 
that releases from certain industrial facilities can contain enhanced 
concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, and can cause 
environmental contamination. Efforts are now under way to assess the 
impact of these releases on humans and their environment. Examples 
include the radiation dose assessment and reconstruction programmes 
in the environments of nuclear facilities, weapons testing areas, 
and marine waste dump sites. <I>More information may be obtained

<H2><A NAME = "A1.38">Strengthning radiation protection infrastructures</H2></A>
. Representatives 
from IAEA Member States were recently briefed on the status of the 
programme for strengthening radiation protection, nuclear safety, 
and radioactive waste management infrastructures in countries of the 
former USSR. The programme was launched last year as a joint phased 
initiative between the IAEA and the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) for information exchange, preparation of country assistance 
packages, and their implementation. <P>


The programme is now in its second phase and the briefing focused 
on assistance packages which have been developed for eight countries 
of the former USSR, namely Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and Uzbekistan. The country assistance 
packages are based on information gathered to date from the forum 
held from 4-7 May 1993 in Vienna and from expert missions and input 
from local experts. They are aimed at strengthening these countries' 
legislative and regulatory frameworks; enhancing their regulatory 
and operational performance; strengthening their capacity for the 
mobilization and management of external resources; and fostering public 
awareness and confidence. Additional financial resources are now being 
sought to bring the programme into the implementation phase.

<H2><A NAME="A1.1"> 38TH IAEA General Conference to convene in Vienna</H2></A>

The 38th regular session of the IAEA's General Conference is taking 
place at the Austria Center in Vienna from 19-23 September 1994. High-level 
governmental delegates from more than 100 countries are participating.<P>

The provisional agenda includes more than 20 items related to various 
aspects of the IAEA's work. They include items related to nuclear 
safety, radiological protection, and radioactive waste management; 
strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the 
safeguards system; implementation of safeguards in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea; application of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle East; an African nuclear-weapon-free zone; strengthening the 
IAEA's main activities; and the IAEA's programme and budget for 1995 
and 1996.<P>

In conjunction with the Conference, a number of events are being 
organized. These include a special scientific programme,
as well as traditional meetings of senior officials in areas 
of nuclear safety and group meetings in respect of IAEA 
regional co-operative programmes in Latin America, Asia and the 
Pacific, and Africa.<P>

During the Conference, the International Convention on Nuclear Safety 
will be opened for signature. The Convention was adopted in June 1994 
by governmental delegates from 84 countries. (See related item.)<P>

Preceding the Conference, the 35-member IAEA Board of Governors is 
scheduled to consider various matters related to safeguards and other 
subjects at meetings beginning on 12 September.<P>
<HR>

<B><A NAME="A1.2">At its meetings from 6-10 June 1994, the Board </B></A><I> inter alia</I> discussed a number of 
safeguards-related matters, including the conduct of safeguards inspections 
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; technical co-operation; 
nuclear safety and radiological protection; and the Agency's programme 
and budget.<P>

<I><B><A NAME="A1.3">Safeguards-related matters</I></B></A>. The Board took note of the IAEA's 
Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 1993. SIR  reported that, 
on the basis of all the information available to the Agency, it is 
considered reasonable to conclude that, with one exception, the nuclear 
material and other items which had been placed under Agency safeguards 
remained in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise adequately 
accounted for. The Board also commended efforts to evaluate measures 
for the strengthening and cost-efficiency of IAEA safeguards being 
carried out through a 2-year development programme, and looked forward 
to receiving proposals for the Board's consideration in time for its 
first session of 1995. The Board reiterated the importance of maintaining 
an appropriate balance between strengthening and cost-efficiency measures 
in the programme.<P>

<I><B><A NAME="A1.4">Technical assistance and co-operation</I></B></A>. The Board received 
a report on the IAEA's programme during 1993 and welcomed improvements 
in the provision of technical assistance. Altogether 1373 technical 
co-operation projects were operational in 1993, which included the 
organization of 2798 expert assignments and 172 national, 
regional, and interegional training courses for some 1450 participants.<P>

<I><B><A NAME="A1.5">Nuclear safety and radiological protection.</I></B></A> The Board took 
note of the IAEA's<I> Nuclear Safety Review for 1994</I>, which will 
be distributed at the General Conference. It further discussed measures 
to resolve international waste management issues and considered matters 
related to liability for nuclear damage. <P>

<I><B><A NAME="A1.6">Programme and budget for 1995</I></B></A>. The Board approved the report 
of its Administrative and Budget Committee which, among other things, 
recommended an IAEA regular budget in 1995 of US $211.56 million at 
an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the US dollar, and 
a target of US $61.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Technical 
Assistance and Co-operation Fund for 1995.<P>

<H2><A NAME="A1.7"> G-7 Summit statement on nuclear-related issues</H2></A>
Meeting in Naples, Italy the weekend of 8 July 1994, leaders of the 
seven major industrialized countries, known as the Group of Seven, 
reinforced their commitments to nuclear non-proliferation and safety. 
As reported by the Associated Press and Reuter, they:<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>pledged an additional amount of 
US $200 million toward the cost of shutting down the Chernobyl nuclear 
plant in Ukraine.<P>
<P>
<LI>urged the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to provide total transparency in its 
nuclear programme through full and unconditional compliance with its 
non-proliferation obligations and to remove, once and for all, the 
suspicions surrounding its nuclear activitiee.  They stressed 
the importance of the DPRK ensuring the continuity of IAEA safeguards 
and maintaining the freeze on its nuclear programme.<P>
<P>
<LI>underscored their commitments against 
the spread of weapons of mass destruction. They called upon all States 
that have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as non-nuclear weapon States, and they declared 
their unequivocal support for the indefinite extension of the NPT 
in 1995. They underlined the imporance of continuing nuclear arms 
reduction, and confirmed their commitment to achieve universal, verifiable 
and comprehensive treaties to ban nuclear tests and the production 
of fissile material for nuclear weapons. They further agreed to co-operate 
to prevent nuclear smuggling, and reaffirmed their work for effective 
export controls. <P>
</UL>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="A1.9"> Conference on the nuclear power option</H2></A>. As the world's population 
grows, the demand for electric power will accelerate, requiring governmental 
decisions on energy production and related issues. To help governments 
assess their energy futures, the IAEA is convening a Conference on 
the Nuclear Power Option from 4-8 September 1994. It is intended to 
provide a forum for discussion on nuclear power's present and future 
role for electricity generation. It will give an extensive overview 
of  plans for global electricity production involving nuclear power 
in IAEA Member States, as well as regional overviews. 
A second part of the conference will review the experience gained 
over the past 40 years of operation of the world's 430 existing nuclear 
power plants, an experience exceeding 7000 accumulated years of operation. 
Papers will deal with experience in operations and maintenance, as 
well as construction, quality assurance, and decommissioning. Other 
papers will focus on issues affecting the nuclear power option, such 
as public acceptance, irradiated fuel and waste management, safety, 
economics, environmental protection, and legal liability. In a concluding 
session, papers will be presented on the prerequisites for a good 
nuclear power programme, including human resources, training, research, 
government oversight, and clear energy strategies. The conference 
brings together senior decision-makers in energy planning, environmental 
agencies, regulatory authorities, and representatives from industry.

<H2><A NAME="A1.10"> Radiation and society</H2></A>. At the invitation of France and with 
support from the French Institute for Protection and Nuclear Safety 
(IPSN), the IAEA is organizing a major International Conference on 
Radiation and Society: Comprehending Radiation Risk. It is taking 
place 24-28 October 1994 in the recently established conference facility 
at the Louvre in Paris. The conference is expected to draw the interest 
and participation of policy makers, nuclear experts, and the media 
from a number of countries. Participants will examine a number of 
case studies including the nuclear weapons legacy, cancer and leukaemia 
clusters, radioactive waste disposal and the environment, and Chernobyl 
health effects. It will then go on to examine various aspects of the 
interplay between expert advice, public and media perceptions, and 
the decision-making process.<P>
The programme's technical sessions will cover various topics, including 
assessment of radiation exposure levels; assessment of radiation health 
effects; impact of radiation on the environment; perception of radiation 
risk; and managing radiation risk. Fora for the media and policymakers 
particularly will examine communication aspects of radiation risk, 
including discussions of controversial case studies.<I>More 
information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety 
or from the communication service of IPSN in Paris, France (telephone 
33-1-46-5486-38 or facsimile 33-1-46-5484-51).</I>

<H2><A NAME="A1.11"> Spent fuel storage</H2></A>. From 10-14 October in Vienna, the IAEA is 
organizing an international symposium on spent fuel storage. The symposium 
is intended to provide a forum for the exchange of information on 
the state-of-the-art and prospects for spent fuel storage with emphasis 
on safety, engineering and environmental aspects. Among topics to 
be discussed are national approaches to the safe storage of spent 
fuel, selection of different spent fuel storage technologies, design, 
planning, and siting of storage facilities, methods for increasing 
storage capacities and others. 

The total amount of spent fuel cumulated worldwide at the end of 1993 
was 140 thousand tonnes heavy metal (t HM) and projections until the 
end of the century indicate the amount may reach 225 thousand tHM. 
The first geological repositories for the final disposal of spent 
fuel are not expected to be in operation before 2010 so the use of 
interim storage  at-reactor (AR) or away-from-reactor (AFR) 
will be the primary spent fuel management option for the next 20 years 
in many countries. It has been demonstrated that spent fuel can be 
safely stored for long periods of time, and some spent fuel has now 
been stored for more than 30 years. There is also scientific consensus 
that the present technologies of spent fuel storage give adequate 
protection to the population and the environment, but there is also 
strong interest in seeing whether further reductions in risk and additional 
radiological safety can be achieved.<I>More information about 
the symposium may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Fuel 
Cycle and Waste Management. </I>

<H2><A NAME="A1.12"> Isotope techniques in waste disposal</H2></A>. Experts from Australia, 
Austria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, 
Poland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States 
met in Vienna from 27-30 June 1994 on the use of isotope techniques 
in the hydrological appraisal of radioactive waste disposal sites. 
The advisory group meeting was organized by the IAEA's Isotope Hydrology 
Section. <P>

Specific issues that were discussed included investigations of residence 
times in low permeability rocks; identification of origin of waters 
and recharge conditions; fluid rock interactions and transport of 
radionuclides in groundwater. Scientific papers were presented to 
illustrate various experiences of the participating countries. Participants 
also addressed the assessment of the performance of potential geologic 
repositories for nuclear waste from the standpoint of the understanding 
it requires of groundwater flow and radionuclide migration under low 
permeability conditions. 

Emphasis was also placed on the influence on water and pollutant movements 
of climatic changes, sea level rise, recharge and discharge fluctuations, 
and water density. Isotope geochemistry and hydrology were considered 
to be important tools to investigate these parameters. Discussions 
on these topics need to be intensified among hydrologists and scientists 
responsible for waste management and disposal.<I>More information 
may be obtained from the Isotope Hydrology Section in the IAEA Division 
of Physical and Chemical Sciences. </I>

<H2><A NAME="A1.13"> Safety of Soviet-Designed nuclear plants</H2></A>. An update on the safety 
of Soviet-designed nuclear power plants was recently presented at 
the British Nuclear Industry Forum held in London on 6 July 1994. 
The presentation was made by IAEA Assistant Director General for Nuclear 
Safety, Dr. Morris Rosen. <P>

In reviewing the overall situation, Dr. Rosen said that generic safety 
issues common to the three principal Soviet reactor types  the 
440-MWe WWER pressurized water reactor, the 1000-MWe WWER, and the 
graphite-moderated RBMK cannot be entirely resolved. However, 
he said that many issues can be dealt with through international assistance 
projects. He noted that the IAEA's role has been to identify and prioritize 
the issues, and to provide the necessary backup technical documentation. 
The efforts are aimed at bringing about an international consensus 
on what is necessary for an acceptable safety level,  he said. 
In the final analysis, it is the national governments who will 
decide on what is required.<P>

In noting the complexity of the situation, he said there are a number 
of major issues associated with each of the three reactor types which 
are difficult to manage. Additionally, there are unique plant-specific 
features which must be individually considered, as well as problems 
specific to each country's political, economic, and social conditions.<P>

The first generation 440-MWe WWER plants do not have low leakage containment 
and many experts believe these reactors should be shutdown, he said. 
The second generation of this reactor type have significantly improved 
safety features but still suffer from the common generic deficiences; 
these reactors are expected to continue operation as improvements 
are gradually introduced. He noted that reactors of the 1000-MWe WWER-type 
have many features common to Western designs. These plants will continue 
to operate while some under construction may incorporate improved 
core designs and instrumentation and control systems. The third type, 
the RBMK, has unresolved safety issues such as the lack of containment 
and a single shut-down system, he said. For the more modern RBMKs, 
the identified major issues appear to be solvable. At older RBMKs, 
however, the situation is more uncertain, he said, and any improvements 
that are made will need to be evaluated to determine whether they 
have resulted in higher safety levels.<P>

Dr. Rosen also noted that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which 
will be open for signature at the IAEA General Conference in September, 
contains a number of items relevant to the current situation with 
Soviet-designed reactors. He pointed out that it calls for existing 
reactors with deficiences to be urgently upgraded or shut down. The 
Convention also obliges States to prepare a report to be discussed 
at periodic review meetings, which will include in-depth studies of 
all national reports to identify problems, concerns, and uncertainties 
or omissions.  <I>Copies of Dr. Rosen's address are available

<H3> Director General addresses technical conference in Obninsk,  Russia</H3>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="A1.14"> Arms control and disarmament</H2></A>. Speaking at the Fifth Annual Scientific 
and Technical Conference of the Nuclear Society in Obninsk, Russia 
on 27 June, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said nuclear scientists, 
engineers, and administrators have an important role to play in making 
the world safer. Dr. Blix said the most obvious task is to devise 
ways in which nuclear weapons can safely be reduced and eventually 
eliminated. He particularly appealed to the nuclear community to accelerate 
its study and discussion on the best ways to take care of the large 
volumes of plutonium and highly enriched uranium being recovered through 
the dismantlement of nuclear warheads. He pointed out, however, that 
before the excess nuclear material is peacefully used or disposed 
of, its storage and management must be such that it does not go back 
into new and possibly more modern nuclear weapons. In this connection, 
he welcomed President Yeltsin's and President Clinton's agreement 
and noted that the United States has declared that it will place nuclear 
material recovered from weapons under IAEA safeguards. The IAEA could 
perform the same safeguards service for nuclear material recovered 
from weapons in Russia, if requested, he said. <P>

Dr. Blix added that in a situation where tens of thousands of nuclear 
warheads are waiting to be dismantled, a prohibition of the production 
of further nuclear material for weapons seems natural. He said if 
a cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons were made 
universal, it would also put a cap on any further production of such 
material in the so-called threshold States. He said another measure 
that the world nuclear community must now help to bring about is a 
ban on all nuclear testing. The conclusion and universal acceptance 
of a complete test ban would be a powerful signal that the the era 
of nuclear weapons development is over, he said, and it would give 
a powerful boost to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons, which will be up for prolongation next year.  <I>The 
full text of the Director General's address is available upon request 
from the IAEA Division of Public Information.</I><P>

<H2><A NAME="A1.15"> Safeguards agreements</H2></A>. The Government of Ukraine 
and the IAEA have agreed <I>ad referendum</I> to a draft comprehensive 
safeguards agreement during negotiations held from 27-28 June 1994 
in Vienna. Under the draft safeguards agreement, Ukraine undertakes 
to use the nuclear material and facilities under its jurisdiction 
or control exclusively for peaceful purposes. It also provides for 
the application of safeguards by the IAEA to all nuclear material 
in all peaceful nuclear activities of Ukraine. It is expected that 
the  agreement will be submitted for consideration by the IAEA Board 
of Governors at its meetings in September 1994.<P>

 Earlier in June, the IAEA Board of Governors authorized 
the IAEA to conclude safeguards agreements with Croatia, Kazakhstan, 
Slovenia, and Zambia. All four agreements are being concluded pursuant 
to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). As 
of December 1993, IAEA safeguards agreements pursuant to the NPT were 
in force with 100 States. All told, the IAEA had 194 safeguards agreements 
in force with 116 States at the end of 1993.<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="A1.16"> Nuclear plant safety review</H2></A>. An IAEA team of international 
experts recently completed a three-week review of the Ulchin nuclear 
power plant in the Republic of Korea under the Operational Safety 
Review Team (OSART) programme. Major results of the mission were presented 
to officials from the Ulchin plant, the Korean Electric Power Corporation 
(KEPCO), the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Korea Institute 
of Nuclear Safety. The OSART mission included experts from Belgium, 
Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, 
plus IAEA safety officials and observers from Brazil, Pakistan, and 
the Slovak Republic.<P>

Overall results showed that the Ulchin management team is committed 
to further improving the plant's existing good performance and to 
assuring acceptable levels of safety. The OSART team made a number 
of recommendations whose implementation will further contribute to 
management's intention to maintain and enhance the plant's safe operation. 
Eight areas were subjected to review: management; organization and 
administration; training and qualifications of staff; operations; 
maintenance; technical support; radiation protection; and emergency 
planning and preparedness. The mission was conducted 6-24 June 1994.<P>

<B><A NAME="A1.17">Future OSART missions. </B></A>Remaining OSART missions and follow-up 
visits in 1994 include those to the Leibstadt plant in Switzerland 
(21 November to 10 December 1994); Cernavoda in Romania (September 
1994); Krsko in Slovenia (24-28 October 1994); and Gravelines in France 
(7-10 November 1994.<I>More information may be obtained

<H2><A NAME="A1.18"> Feedback on asset safety services.</H2></A>The IAEA has received positive 
feedback from users of its nuclear plant safety service known as ASSET, 
which stands for Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team. At 
a meeting of ASSET users in May 1994, participants recognized the 
direct and positive contribution of ASSET missions and seminars to 
the improvement of nuclear safety. The services were welcomed by the 
plants and were seen as being beneficial to both external safety experts 
and plant personnel. They further noted that the co-ordination of 
ASSET and other IAEA safety services is essential to ensure that countries 
were offered a comprehensive and efficient service. Existing ASSET 
options should be extended by adding other specialized missions, in 
keeping with the needs of participating countries, they said. 
<I>More information about ASSET is available upon request from the 
Safety Assessment Section in the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety.</I><P>

<H2><A NAME="A1.19"> New and upcoming IAEA publications</H2></A>


A new report on radioactive waste management in 
Central and Eastern European countries has been issued by the IAEA 
Division of Public Information. The booklet includes basic background 
information on radioactive waste management and presents status reports 
of programmes in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, 
Slovak Republic,Slovenia, and Croatia. It further reviews initiatives 
of the IAEA under its radioactive waste management programme.  Copies 
of the booklet may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Public Information.<P>


Global developments in the fields of nuclear safety and 
the verification of nuclear energy's peaceful uses are among topics 
featured in the 1994 edition of the IAEA Yearbook, a cmprehensive 
overview of nuclear power's global development. The latest edition, 
which will be published shortly, reviews the status and trends of 
the world's nuclear power programmes, the nuclear fuel cycle, and 
waste management. Additionally featured is a global overview of programmes 
and projects in key areas of nuclear safety and radiological protection; 
nuclear safeguards statistics for 1993; and reports on the IAEA's 
safeguards system and on its activities related to the transfer of 
nuclear technologies and applications. Among special topics explored 
is the impact of nuclear appplication in food and agriculture over 
the past 30 years, in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the 
Joint Division of the IAEA and Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations.
<I> The Yearbook's </I>specialized sections, some of which are 
available separately, provide information and data on the nuclear 
fuel cycle, from uranium resources to the management of radioactive 
waste; the safety and operation of nuclear power plants; the application 
of safeguards, particularly from the standpoint of measures being 
taken to strengthen the system; and applications of nuclear techniques 
and research in medicine, industry, agriculture, and other fields. 
The IAEA Yearbook is available for purchase from the IAEA or its sales 
outlets in Member States. <P>


 Recent changes to the IAEA's membership include the 
withdrawal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and 
the new official membership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
The DPRK's withdrawal took effect 13 June 1994. The withdrawal 
does not affect the validity of the DPRK's safeguards agreement with 
the IAEA, which was concluded pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons. The membership of the  Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia which was approved in September 1993 by the IAEA 
General Conference took effect on 25 February 1994, when it 
deposited its instrument of acceptance of the IAEA's Statute. 
The UN General Assembly will hold a special commemorative meeting 
on the occasion of the 50th anniverary of the entry into force of 
the UN Charter. The meeting will be held 22-24 October 1995 at 
the level of Head of State or Government. The meeting proposal was 
recently adopted by the Preparatory Committee for the anniversary. 
Events are being planned and co-ordinated with the help of 44 national 
committees, with 26 more expected to be formed. Plans include a global 
teach-in on the United Nations through which educational 
institutions are being urged to hold seminars on UN history and activities. 
Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, chemist and Nobel Prize Winner, 
has become the first living scientist to have an element named after 
him, notes the US Health Physics Society. Dr. Kenneth Hulet, a 
co-discoverer, announced the name of element-106 as seaborgium (Sg) 
earlier this year. Seaborgium is the tenth element for which Dr. Seaborg 
is a co-discoverer and has chemical properties similar to tungsten. 
It is a trans<->uranium element produced by bombarding californium-249 
with oxygen-18 to create seaborgium-263, which has a half-life of 
0.9 seconds. Another isotope, seaborgium-266, also has been produced 
which has a half-life of about 30 seconds. Chemists expect to use 
the isotope in research. More information may be obtained from HPS, 
800 Westpark Drive, Suite 130, McLean, Virginia 22102, USA.

<H2><A NAME = "A1.1">IAEA Board of governors' meetings in early June</H2>

The conduct of safeguards inspections in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) is among matters before the Agency's Board of
Governors at its meetings starting on 6 June 1994 in Vienna. Other subjects
on the Board's provisional agenda include items related to the IAEA's
overall implementation of safeguards in 1993; measures to strengthen
the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system; the IAEA's
technical assistance and co-operation activities; the draft
<I>International Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and
for the Safety of Radiation Sources;</I> global developments in nuclear
safety and radiation protection; international radioactive waste
management issues; the use of isotope hydrology for groundwater management; and
matters related to the 38th regular session of the IAEA General
Conference, which convenes in Vienna 19-23 September 1994. In addition, the Board
will receive a report from its Administrative and Budgetary Committee,
which met in mid-May, on the Agency's programme and budget
performance.<P>

Concerning DPRK safeguards, IAEA Director General Hans Blix informed
the UN Security Council and the Agency's Board of Governors on 20
May about recent safeguards developments and he is expected to report
further to the Board in June. The IAEA inter alia has been
discussing with DPRK authorities technical matters related to
inspections
at the reprocessing plant and to the core discharge at the 5-megawatt
nuclear power plant. In mid-May, an IAEA inspection team, which went
to the DPRK to carry out inspection activities that the IAEA was not
enabled to implement during its inspections in March 1994, confirmed
that the DPRK had started the core discharge. A team of senior IAEA
safeguards officials subsequently visited the DPRK in late May for
talks to clarify means of implementing the requisite safeguards
measures at the 5-megawatt plant.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME = "A1.2">Nuclear safety convention.</H2></A>
 High-level governmental delegates
are meeting in Vienna, 14-17 June, at a Diplomatic Conference for
the adoption of an international nuclear safety convention. The
draft convention, which had been drawn up in a series of experts'
meetings since 1991, covers land-based civil nuclear power plants.
By setting international benchmarks to which States could subscribe,
the convention is seen as a significant step forward in helping to
maximize safety at nuclear power plants, of which 430 are currently
in operation worldwide. (See table on last page.)
The convention's objectives are to achieve and maintain a high level
of nuclear safety worldwide through national measures and
international
co-operation; to establish and maintain effective defenses in nuclear
installations against potential radiological hazards in order to
protect individuals, society, and the environment from harmful effects of
ionizing radiation from such installations; and to prevent accidents
with radiological consequences and to mitigate such consequences
should they occur.

The obligations placed upon Contracting Parties are based on
fundamental nuclear safety principles that reflect an international consensus.
They cover, for instance,  siting, design, construction, operation,
the availability of adequate financial and human resources, the
assessment and verification of safety, quality assurance, and emergency 
preparedness.
There is also an obligation for Contracting Parties to submit reports
on implementation for "peer review" consideration at regular
meetings of the Contracting Parties to be held at the IAEA.--<I>More
information may be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Safety
and the Legal Division.</I><P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME = "A1.3">Monitoring and verification in Iraq.</H2></A>

  High-level technical talks between the IAEA and Iraq took place in Vienna, 9-10 May 1994, on
implementation of the plan of the IAEA for ongoing monitoring and
verification in Iraq. Mr. Tariq Aziz, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq,
met with IAEA Director General Hans Blix and Prof. Maurizio Zifferero,
Leader of the IAEA Action Team. The talks were a continuation of the
process begun in July 1993 during the visit to Baghdad of the
Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission.<P>

In a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the talks, the two
sides made the following points:<P>

"The actions taken to date in phasing in many elements of the
IAEA's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification were reviewed.
During the past several months, Iraq had provided to the IAEA
extensive
co-operation and both sides agreed that this had contributed
significantly
to the phasing in of these elements. Confidence was expressed that
continued co-operation would contribute as well to the implementation
of the remaining elements within the schedule envisaged during the
March 1994 talks.<P>

"The importance of the establishment in the Middle East of a zone
free from weapons of mass destruction, as referred to in paragraph
14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) was stressed by both
sides. The Director General stated that the IAEA was doing its very
best to advise States which may negotiate such an agreement about
the Agency's expertise in the field of verification and about the
modes of verification which might be employed.<P>

"Discussions took place on the status of technical co-operation
in the areas of medical and agricultural applications of radioisotopes
and radiation, and the IAEA undertook to re-evaluate the extent of
such technical co-operation that would be appropriate in the context
of the relevant Security Council resolutions.<P>

"More detailed follow-up discussions also were held with a view
to resolving specific outstanding issues. The Iraqi side reiterated
its readiness to assist the IAEA in such matters."<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.4">Nuclear power regulation in China.</H2></A>
 The national regulatory process governing nuclear power activities in China was reviewed in May under
the IAEA's International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) programme.
The 7-member team of safety experts from the IAEA and five countries
found a regulatory system corresponding to those in use worldwide,
with an independent regulatory body divorced from nuclear power
promotional activities. The basis for China's national regulations are safety
codes and guides developed by the IAEA, thus assuring consistency
with commonly accepted international practices. The review team
conducted its mission at the request of the Chinese government and its National
Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA), an indication of the importance
the country is giving to international co-operation in matters of
nuclear safety. China has three nuclear power plants in operation,
two of French design at Daya Bay near Hong Kong and one of indigenous
design at Qinshan near Shanghai.  Additional plants are planned at
both sites.<P>

The team made a number of observations and recommendations at the
conclusion of its mission, which was carried out from 23 April to
10 May. It  was impressed by the overall competence of the NNSA staff,
which although lacking extensive practical experience, displayed the
desire to learn and implement international practices. Headquarters
staff are supported by the affiliated technical support organization,
the Beijing Nuclear Safety Center. There are regional offices in
Shanghai and Guangdong, as well as one in Chengdu which deals with research
reactors and fuel cycle facilities. The team noted that the licensing
and review process employed for the Daya Bay unit conforms with good
international practices.<P>

The team's recommendations were directed at improving the
effectiveness of the regulatory process.  An area which has not yet received
sufficient attention by the NNSA is the analysis of feedback from operational
experience for accident prevention. The use of it, now common
worldwide, identifies precursors to operational events and allows preventive
measures to be taken. A number of important recommendations were
made concerning emergency planning and response, and inspection and
safety analysis procedures during nuclear plant operation and
refuelling outages. Another important area in need of development
is a strong safety culture at the NNSA and throughout the Chinese
nuclear community.<P>

Speaking at the conclusion of the mission, Dr. Morris Rosen, IAEA
Assistant Director General for Nuclear Safety, cited the participation
of China in major international safety agreements and systems
developed at the IAEA, including the forthcoming International Nuclear Safety
Convention. China has been instrumental in the convention's
development and the review team's findings show that it is ready to fulfill all
obligations.--<I>More information may be obtained from the IAEA

<H2><A NAME = "A1.5">Scientific award for marine environment programme.</H2></A>
 A research
programme being supported by the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory
(IAEA-MEL) in Monaco has been awarded the 1994 Philip Morris
Scientific
Prize for biogeochemistry. Known as DYFAMED, the programme focuses
on the biogeochemical cycle of carbon and associated elements in the
Mediterranean Sea. The Philip Morris prize is awarded annually for
research projects with applications to daily life.<P>

The research programme began in 1986 and is part of the French
contribution to a major international effort in marine sciences known as Joint
Global Ocean Flux Studies.  IAEA-MEL has contributed to the programme
through its continuous measurement of the sedimenting flux of
particles and carbon through the water column in the northwestern Mediterranean
and by assessing the role marine organisms play in the carbon
transport.  It further has contributed to the assessment of natural and anthropogenic
radionuclide fluxes and provided, in 1986, the first measurements
of post-Chernobyl radioactivity in Mediterranean waters.<P>

Knowledge of the carbon cycle is a key to comprehending the biosphere.
Carbon dioxide makes up between 50% and 60% of the greenhouse gases,
which trap solar energy and warm the global atmosphere.  Because of
the ocean's ability to serve as a potential sink of anthropogenic
carbon dioxide, it may play an important role in modulating global
climate. One major objective of DYFAMED is to see whether the
variations
observed in the environment (increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide)
may be regulated by changes in oceanic primary production (called
the "biological pump"). The Scientific Prize for the programme
was awarded at a ceremony on 16 May in Paris.--<I>More information

<H2><A NAME = "A1.6">Assessing radioactivity levels at sea.</H2></A>
 Scientists at the IAEA's
Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) in Monaco will be analyzing
large samples of seawater from areas near the Republic of Korea and
Japan where nuclear-related waste has been dumped by the former Soviet
Union and the Russian Federation. The work is among follow-up
analytical
activities to the recently concluded joint sea expedition to assess
radioactivity levels in these international waters. The mission, which
took place from 18 March to 16 April 1994, was composed of scientists
from Japan, Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and IAEA-MEL.
Samples of seawater, sediment, and biota were taken, and preliminary
spectrometric measurements were carried out aboard the R/V "Okean",
the vessel used for the mission.<P>

During the expedition, intercomparison of techniques used by
participating
parties was performed. The results of these intercomparisons were
satisfactory. Concentrations of caesium -137, one of the most
important
radionuclides in seawater and sediments, were found to be very low
and do not differ from the global fallout background levels in the
northwest Pacific Ocean. However, results of on board measurements
are only preliminary. Detailed analysis of samples of seawater, bottom
sediments, zooplankton, and benthos will be performed on land in the
laboratories of Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, and
the IAEA, with subsequent data exchange, evaluation, and publication
over the next year. About three tonnes of water samples are being
shipped to the IAEA-MEL for detailed analysis. Further collaborative
studies are planned for other sea areas where such dumping is known
to have occurred.--<I>More information may be obtained from IAEA-MEL,

<H2><A NAME = "A1.7">Safety at Chernobyl.</H2></A>
 International experts meeting at the IAEA
in April  have described the safety situation at the Chernobyl nuclear
power station in Ukraine as complex and difficult to solve in light
of prevailing energy and economic conditions. The meeting was attended
by representatives from the Ukraine and a dozen other countries to
consider actions that could be taken to alleviate the current
situation.
It was convened following an IAEA expert mission in March 1994 that
found serious safety deficiencies at the station, where two units
remain operational and the reactor destroyed in the 1986 accident
(unit-4) is enclosed in a deteriorating shelter. IAEA Director General
Hans Blix subsequently informed the President of Ukraine that
international
levels of safety were not being met at the Chernobyl site.<P>
In opening the meeting, Dr. Blix reminded the participants that
national governments carry the responsibility for safety in nuclear
installations in their territory. Yet, he said,  there is legitimate international
concern about maintaining safety of nuclear installations anywhere.
Technical safety issues and actions would need to be considered in
the context of other factors that influence the current situation,
such as the overall energy and economic circumstances in the Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister, Mr. Valeri Shmarov, and the
Chairman of the State Committee on the Utilization of Nuclear Power, Mr. M.P.
Umanets, discussed the energy and economic conditions and the current
safety situation at Chernobyl. The meeting also heard views of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and was briefed on
results of the IAEA safety mission.<P>

Ukrainian officials made a number of points: energy use had dropped
lately due to the temporary economic depression, but should rise
substantially as the economy improves; per capita energy consumption is inordinately
high, but reducing it would require complete overhaul of the
infrastructure, lasting decades; the country is already heavily dependent on expensive
external and potentially unreliable sources for gas and oil; coal
is becoming harder to extract and, in any event, greater use depends
on introducing, at high cost, modern combustion technology; and
Ukraine must look to nuclear energy as a continuing major source to meet its
energy requirements. In their view, the Chernobyl station could be
upgraded to a level no less safe than other currently operating
reactors of the same type (RBMKs). While Chernobyl is now behind in
implementing the safety improvements undertaken at other RBMKs, they said the pace
of implementation could be accelerated if sufficient resources were
available. To date, however, no international financial assistance
directed at improving the safety situation at Chernobyl has been
provided by the international community.
<P>
There was consensus at the meeting that the many factors involved
make the situation at Chernobyl complex and that there was no simple
one-step solution. Some participants suggested continued technical
assessment which could be undertaken in the framework of IAEA
activities.
A clear majority wished to see operation at Chernobyl discontinued
as soon as conditions allow. In concluding remarks, IAEA Assistant
Director General for Nuclear Safety, Dr. Morris Rosen, characterized
the situation at Chernobyl as unique and serious. The loss of many
highly qualified staff, coupled with the scope of required safety
improvements, mean that the Chernobyl plants would continue to operate
at lower levels of safety than similar plants for several years to
come. In addition, the shelter encasing the destroyed reactor is
currently
deteriorating and the remaining units would be operating in an
environment
of elevated radiation levels, he said.--<I>More information may

<H2><A NAME = "A1.8">An "Energy-Ecology Dilemma".</H2></A>
 Speaking at the annual conference of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum in Hiroshima on 13
April, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said that even the most
optimistic global energy projections up to 2020 show an increase in the use of
fossil fuels with consequent increases in carbon dioxide emissions.
By relying today on the burning of fossil fuels to provide over three-
quarters of our energy needs, we are, he said, interfering with the earth's
ecological balance.
<P>
Dr. Blix noted  that the comparisons between different energy sources,
including nuclear power, must take their respective health and
environmental
impacts into account. He said that in his view the global climate
change that is presently foreseen as a result of the excessive
emissions
of so-called greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane,
would appear to make an early revival of nuclear power crucially
important.
He said it was curious that few of the many governments, international
authorities, and non-governmental groups who are deeply engaged in
the question of global warming have highlighted this point.--<I>Copies

<H2><A NAME = "A1.9">Safeguards at nuclear fuel plant.</H2></A>
 In response to misleading
media reports about safeguards in Japan, the IAEA issued the following
statement on 25 May 1994:<P>

"Recent reports have stated, incorrectly, that a sizable amount
of nuclear material is unaccounted for in the Tokai Nuclear Fuel
Fabrication
Plant in Japan. The plant is a highly automated facility with the
most advanced nuclear material accountancy system in existence. This
system provides information to the IAEA on the movement and quantities
of nuclear material on a near real-time basis. In addition, and as
is the case with all nuclear facilities subject to IAEA safeguards,
all nuclear material entering and leaving the facility is measured
and verified.<P>

"Since the beginning of operations of the plant 5 years ago, material
in dust form has been accumulating on exposed surfaces of several
areas of the glove boxes in which the nuclear fuel is processed. To
minimize radiation exposure to its maintenance personnel, the operator
has until now elected to leave the deposited material, referred to
as 'hold-up', in place. The IAEA has been well aware of the presence
of this material throughout, which has been fully declared as hold-up
by the operator and measured by the IAEA on a monthly basis, using
a specially designed system (glove box assay system). With a view
to improving the quality of the assay measurement, the IAEA has on
previous occasions pointed out to the operator the necessity of
cleaning
up the glove boxes and collecting the hold-up material. In this
connection, a schedule for the recovery of  hold-up has been proposed by the
Japanese operator and is being discussed between the Japanese authorities and
the IAEA.<P>

"It will be clear from the above that the nuclear material hold-up
in the glove boxes of the Tokai Nuclear Fuel Fabrication Plant is
not missing and remains under full safeguards and is declared."<P>

<H2><A NAME = "A1.10">Uranium ressources, production, and demand. </H2></A>
The IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (NEA/OECD) have issued their new 2-year joint study,
<I>World Uranium Resources, Production and Demand.</I> Commonly known
as the Red Book, the study points out that the most significant aspect
of uranium supply and demand in the 1991-92 period was an over-
saturated market, with a clear shortfall between fresh uranium production and
uranium consumption.<P>

 The study's assessments are made from official data, maps of deposits,
expert analyses, and forecasts of uranium supply and demand in over
50 countries, including new information presented on the Czech
Republic, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mongolia, Russia, the Slovak Republic,
Slovenia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.<P>
<HR>

Uranium demand over the short term is fairly predictable, the report
states, while on the supply side uncertainties are chiefly related
to where these supplies will come from and the amount of military
uranium that may enter the commercial market. Continued downward
pressure
on prices, the expiration of high-priced long-term contracts, and
the availability of new sources of supply are expected to continue
through the mid-1990s, restricting the prospects for market recovery
in the short term. For the longer term, it is generally believed that
reactor requirements and uranium production will reach closer balance
when inventories have been drawn down to desired levels. Beyond the
turn of the century, the three factors that will have the greatest
impact on the supply/demand balance are expected to be the rate of
orders for new nuclear capacity, the rate of erosion of the existing
base of reactors, and certain technological developments. --<I> More

<H2><A NAME = "A1.11">Radioactive waste management.</H2></A>
 Experts from  Belgium, Canada,
Germany, Switzerland, and the IAEA have concluded a year-long review
of Finland's radioactive waste management programme. The review
was conducted under the Agency's radioactive waste management
assessment and technical review programme (WATRP) in response to a request
of the Finnish Government. It covered work being done toward siting
and building a conditioning facility for spent nuclear fuel; siting
and construction of a repository; and the plans and activities for
the conditioning and disposal of waste from decommissioning Finland's
reactors when that becomes necessary in the future.<P>

The review team noted that although the Finnish nuclear power
programme is quite young, in comparison with that of many countries, Finland
has had notable success in developing its radioactive waste management
technologies and its capabilities to achieve a complete and sound
storage and disposal programme. It pointed out that Finnish scientists
participate in many international working groups and committees, both
contributing to the international understanding of the subject and
obtaining knowledge that they can apply to their own national
programme. Overall, the experts were impressed with the high standard of work
being done. Their recommendations addressed a number of technical
areas: the manufacture and testing of full-scale copper canisters
for use in the repository for spent fuel, so that any potential
difficulties can be identified as early as possible in the programme; full-scale
testing of the proposed microbiological method of treatment of organic
waste at the Loviisa nuclear plant; maintaining and possibly
increasing the resources of the regulatory body; and continued work to produce
detailed guidance on the criteria  that would be applied for granting
approvals of spent fuel disposal.<P>

The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic also have requested WATRP
services; the Czech review is almost finished and the Slovak review
has been initiated. WATRP is a peer review service on radioactive
waste management offered by the IAEA in response to specific requests
from Member States. Such peer reviews provide the requesting Member
State or organization with independent opinions and advice from
recognized international experts, thus enhancing confidence in the system planned
or in operation. --<I> More information may be obtained from the

<H2><A NAME = "A1.12">Global climate change studies.</H2></A>
  Representatives of 14 scientific
teams from 13 countries participating in a new IAEA research project
recently reviewed the key role that isotope methodologies can play
in deciphering historical patterns of global climate change. The IAEA
project, within the framework of its Co-ordinated Research Programme
(CRP), focuses on  the use of isotope and nuclear techniques
in palaeoclimatology, specifically  for reconstructions of climatic
changes occurring on the continents over the last thousands of years.
<P>
The project's first meeting took place at the IAEA 19-22 April. In
addition to members of participating scientific teams, the meeting
was attended by observers from Canada, Germany, Israel, Poland,
Russia, Spain, and Switzerland. In an address to the meeting, Prof. Hans
Oeschger, director of a project called PAGES ( past global changes) of the
International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, emphasized the scientific contribution
that the IAEA could provide to PAGES through its Department of Research
and Isotopes.  The IAEA possesses a wide range of expertise in the
application of isotope methodologies.  In the field of climate change
studies, for example, high-resolution reconstruction of past climatic
and environmental conditions can be obtained through isotope
investigations of palaeowaters, lacustrine sediments, freshwater carbonates, ancient
organic matter, continental glaciers, permafrost, and other continental
archives. Such studies are seen as prerequisites to any meaningful
prediction of future global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions.

 The major thrust of this conference -- from 5-9 September in Vienna, Austria -- is on
national nuclear power policies and programmes, in preparation for
an expected renewed demand for nuclear-generated electricity.
Worldwide electricity demand is expected to increase in the long term as
populations grow and industrialization expands. Both fossil-fired and nuclear
plants are expected to be built depending on local conditions. For
its part, the nuclear industry has to be prepared to meet this demand
when the right economic, technical, and political conditions come
together. The conference aims to prevent problems which will occur
in the absence of proper preparation. It will also review collective

presentation was made to IAEA Director General Hans Blix on 7 April in Vienna by
then South African Foreign Minister, Mr. R.F. Pik Botha.
<P>
The sculpture is a miniature metal ploughshare crafted from non-
radioactive material belonging to one of South Africa's former nuclear devices.
Its inscription reads: "This sculpture, made of non-nuclear material
from a dismantled nuclear device, symbolizes the commitment of the
Republic of South Africa to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
" It ends with the words: "And they shall beat their swords
into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any

the number of countries committed to non-proliferation and accepting
comprehensive verification of that commitment continues to grow. In
singling out positive developments in South Africa, the Director
General said that the "road should soon be open" for an early conclusion
of an African nuclear-weapon-free zone treaty, in light of South
Africa's membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its termination

<H2><A NAME = "A1.1">IAEA Safeguards inspections resume in the DPRK</H2></A>

        A team of IAEA safeguards inspectors began inspection activities in early March at seven
declared nuclear facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  Team
members received entry visas from the DPRK on 26 February 1994 and arrived in Pyongyang
on Tuesday, 1 March.<P>
        The mission follows a series of developments since late 1993 concerning inter alia the
resumption of IAEA safeguards inspections in the DPRK. They include an agreement reached
by the IAEA and DPRK on 15 February 1994 on the scope of the inspection now under way, and
the IAEA Board of Governors' consideration of DPRK safeguards implementation at its meeting
21-23 February. The aim of the inspection is to verify that nuclear material in the seven declared
facilities has not been diverted since the IAEA's earlier inspections. Inspectors additionally were
to take certain measures, such as reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future
verification.<P>
        At its February meetings, the IAEA Board, following its consideration of a report by Director
General Hans Blix, expressed its "continuing, deep concern at the seriousness of the
situation" and urged the DPRK to co-operate fully with the IAEA. In reaffirming its support
of the IAEA's continuing efforts, the Board particularly noted that the agreement on inspection
of seven declared sites was "only a first step toward resolution of all the nuclear
issues", including the DPRK's full compliance with its obligations under the comprehensive
safeguards agreement that entered into force in April 1992.<P>
        The report to the Board reviewed and placed into context the Agency's extensive contacts over
the past two months with DPRK authorities, since the Board last considered the matter at its
meeting in December 1993.  As he had informed the Board in December,  Dr. Blix in his
February Board statement once again noted that the absence of periodic inspections and related
activities had damaged the "continuity of knowledge" about the DPRK's declared
nuclear activities, and that the safeguards system now in place "can no longer be said to
provide any meaningful assurance of non-diversion of nuclear material and of the peaceful use
of the declared installations in the DPRK". <P>
        Results from the forthcoming inspection (which started in March) can "at least partly
compensate for the loss of knowledge that has occurred", he told the Board in February. He
underlined, however, that the agreed inspection activities deal only with material in declared
facilities which the IAEA has visited before. They do not include visits to additional sites for
purposes of clarifying inconsistencies which exist between the DPRK's initial declaration of
nuclear material and IAEA findings. "Without visits to additional sites and access to
additional information, there would be no way to verify the correctness and assess the
completeness of the initial declaration," he said. He expressed the hope that consultations
on the resolution of this matter would be possible following the inspection activities at declared
facilities.<P>

<H2><A NAME ="A1.2">Nuclear safety convention.</H2></A>
 A working group of legal and technical experts has
finalized a draft international nuclear safety convention for adoption at a diplomatic conference
being convened in mid-June 1994 under IAEA auspices in Vienna.<P>
        The draft text reflects the broad agreement reached by the experts and has the overall support of
the group, which was formed in February 1992. The group's seventh and final meeting took place
31 January to 4 February 1994 at IAEA headquarters. The experts represented more than 50
countries, and the Commission of the European Communities,
Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the International Labour
Organization.<P>
        As finalized, the draft convention's scope of application applies to nuclear installations defined
as land-based civil nuclear power plants. The safety-related obligations it places upon parties are
based to a large extent on fundamental principles. They include in particular the obligation to
establish and maintain a legislative and regulatory framework for nuclear installations; to
implement a number of measures based on general safety considerations regarding, for example,
the availability of financial and human resources; the assessment and verification of safety,
quality assurance, and emergency preparedness. Other obligations pertain to technical aspects of
nuclear plant safety, including siting, design, construction, and operation. Additionally, parties
are required to provide reports on the implementation of the Convention. The IAEA is identified
as the Secretariat of the Convention and the Director General its Depositary.<P>
        The convention is an outgrowth of recommendations issued in early September 1991 by an
international conference on the safety of nuclear power organized by the IAEA. That conference
urged consideration of an integrated international approach to all aspects of safety, referring to
the potential value of a step-by-step approach to a framework convention on nuclear safety. The
recommendation subsequently was embodied in a resolution of the IAEA General Conference,
which requested additional preparations toward a possible convention. In February 1992, the
IAEA Board of Governors authorized the formation of the group of experts who prepared and
finalized the draft nuclear safety convention.-- <I>More information may be obtained from the

<H2><A NAME = "A1.3">Nuclear inspections Iraq.</H2></A>
 Under the close supervision of IAEA inspectors, the
second and final consignment of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the form of irradiated nuclear
fuel has been removed from Iraq. The action completed the removal of declared stocks of
nuclear-weapons-grade material from Iraq.<P>
        The irradiated fuel was removed under a contract with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy
and a United States subcontractor which supplied specially designed transport casks capable of
withstanding extreme accident conditions. The Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission provided all
necessary assistance. Substantial technical problems had to be overcome to remove the irradiated
fuel, some of which was buried under the rubble of a research reactor destroyed during the Gulf
War.<P>
        The irradiated fuel was removed in two shipments under the IAEA's close supervision; the first
shipment took place on 4 December 1993 and the second on 12 February 1994. In both cases,
the material was transported from the Iraqi nuclear centre at Tuwaitha by road to Habbaniya
airfield west of Baghdad, and then flown out of Iraq in an Antonov 124 directly to Yekaterinburg
in Russia for onward transport to a reprocessing facility at Chelyabinsk. After the dilution to
lower enrichment at the Chelyabinsk facility, the residual material will be available for sale under
IAEA supervision for use in peaceful nuclear activities. Reprocessing of the fuel is expected to
take six months.<P>
        The removal of Iraq's nuclear-weapons-usable material, namely HEU and plutonium, is among
the operations undertaken by the IAEA since 1991 with the co-operation and assistance of the
United Nations Special Commission on Iraq under terms of UN Security Council resolutions. In
1991, following inspections in Iraq, IAEA inspection teams removed gram quantities of
plutonium that Iraq was found to have separated, and they supervised the removal of nuclear
material, including fresh nuclear fuel, that was part of Iraq's declared inventory under IAEA
safeguards.<P>
        Ongoing activities in Iraq include the verification of information provided by Iraqi authorities
about foreign technical advice in the centrifuge enrichment area and about suppliers, quantities,
and locations of materials and equipment. High-level technical talks also continue with Iraqi
authorities regarding the satisfactory implementation of the IAEA's ongoing monitoring and
verification plan which now is gradually being put into effect. The plan includes, inter alia,
periodic radiometric surveys of Iraqi surface waters to provide added assurance about the
country's nuclear activities.<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME = "A1.4">Strengthening the safeguards system.</H2></A>
 The IAEA is evaluating a number of
measures and recommendations for improving the cost effectiveness of its safeguards system. The
measures under evaluation, through a 2-year development programme known as
"93+2", were recommended by the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards
Implementation (SAGSI). SAGSI is comprised of experts appointed in consultation with
governments to advise the Director General on effectiveness and efficiency in the safeguards
system.<P>
        The IAEA programme is designed to further assess, develop, and test SAGSI's recommendations
and related measures, including evaluations of their technical, legal, and financial implications.
Six specific areas are being evaluated: cost analysis of present safeguards implementation;
assessment of potential cost-saving measures; environmental monitoring techniques for safeguards
application; increased co-operation with State Systems of Accounting and Control (SSACs) and
other measures for improving the cost-effectiveness of safeguards; improved analysis of
information on a State's nuclear activities; and enhanced safeguards training. The results from
these evaluations will be integrated into proposals for more effective and efficient safeguards that
are expected to be made to the IAEA Board of Governors in early 1995.<P>
        An integral part of the programme is the active participation of a number of countries in technical
areas, including environmental monitoring field trials. Countries that have offered assistance
include Argentina, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Russia,
South Africa, and Sweden. Two field trials of environmental monitoring already have taken place,
one in Sweden which collected samples at 35 locations around five nuclear facilites, and the other
in Hungary, which sampled the Danube River near the Paks power station and in the vicinity of
Budapest.<P>
        Overall, the programme builds upon actions already taken to strengthen the IAEA's safeguards
system. These include Board decisions in late 1991 and early 1992 regarding the early provision
and use of design information, and a voluntary reporting scheme on imports and exports of
nuclear material, as well as exports of specified equipment and non-nuclear material. <P>

<H2><A NAME ="A1.5">Nuclear Non-Proliferation and verification.</H2></A>
 A number of significant
developments over recent months in fields of nuclear non-proliferation and verification already
have, or may have, a bearing on the IAEA's work. Examples are:
Safeguards in Uzbekistan. In February, the IAEA Board of Governors approved a comprehensive
safeguards agreement with Uzbekistan concluded pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).<P>
        Algeria's non-proliferation undertakings. On 21 December 1993, Algeria's Minister of Foreign
Affairs declared that his country "resolves to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty".
The Minister also said Algeria was "absolutely dedicated to the peaceful use of

the atom" and "confidently and unequivocally affirms its commitment to the
non-proliferation regime". The statement, which was welcomed by IAEA Director General
Hans Blix and communicated to the February meeting of the Agency's Board of Governors, was
made on the occasion of the inauguration of the Es Salam research reactor, which is under IAEA
safeguards.<P>
      <strong> Non-proliferation in Latin America.</strong> Further steps have been taken to bring closer the full entry
into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, thereby establishing a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in Latin
America. On 18 January 1994, the Treaty entered into force for Argentina, which deposited the
necessary legal instruments with Mexico, the Treaty's Depositary. Additionally, at the Chilean
government's request, the IAEA is preparing a proposed comprehensive safeguards agreement
with Chile, which also has become a Contracting Party to the Treaty. The implementation of
IAEA safeguards also may take place soon in Argentina and Brazil. The expectation follows,
inter alia, constructive discussions at the IAEA last December, and the Brazilian Senate's
approval on 9 February 1994 of the quadripartite agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the IAEA,
and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC).<P>
<strong>Possible new verification tasks</strong>. Steps are being taken under the auspices of the Conference on
Disarmament to negotiate a comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Also in prospect is
negotiation of a convention on the cut-off of the production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. The Conference on Disarmament recently invited
the IAEA to present its views on matters related to verification arrangements and to the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. Consultations also are continuing between the United States and the IAEA
concerning the US initiative to place under IAEA safeguards some of the excess nuclear material
released from weapon programmes. Separately, as announced recently by the Presidents of the
United States and Russia, a joint US-Russian working group is to be established to consider
"steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reduction of nuclear
weapons, including the possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under IAEA
safeguards".<P>

<B><A NAME = "A1.6">Ban on Sea dumping of radiatioactive waste .</B></A> A ban on the dumping of low-level
radioactive wastes at sea took effect in late February, in the process modifying the IAEA's
technical advisory role under the governing international convention. The ban was imposed in
November 1993 when Contracting Parties to the London Convention -- officially called the
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
-- adopted an amendment to the Convention. The amendment entered into force as of 20
February 1994, according to the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO), which
administers the Convention. The IMO noted that the Russian Federation has announced it will
not accept the amendment although it will "endeavour to avoid pollution of the sea by
dumping of wastes and other matter".
        As amended, the London Convention effectively prohibits the dumping of all types of radioactive
wastes at sea. Previously only sea dumping of high-level wastes was prohibited, while sea
disposal of low-level radioactive wastes was temporarily suspended under a voluntary
moratorium. The IAEA was charged with defining high-level wastes and other high-level
radioactive matter unsuitable for dumping at sea, and with providing guidance to national
authorities in issuing special permits for sea disposal of low-level radioactive wastes.
Now that a total ban has taken effect, the IAEA's new technical role will be to define
radioactivity levels below which material may be considered "non-radioactive" (known
as "de-minimis" or "exempt" levels) for purposes of the Convention. The
IAEA also will continue to consider requests from countries for assistance with special problems
relating to the safe disposal of radioactive wastes, so as to help them meet their international
obligations under the Convention. Toward this end, the IAEA is expected to participate in an
expert group formed under the Convention to evaluate the need for supporting Russia 
to complete facilities for safely managing low-level liquid radioactive wastes so as to avoid future sea
dumping. The IAEA also will continue to administer the International Arctic Seas Assessment
Project (IASAP). Its aim is to evaluate the health and environmental risks posed by the dumping
of radioactive wastes in the Arctic Seas, and in developing and maintaining an inventory of
radioactive materials entering the marine environment.<P>
        The London Convention has been adopted by more than 70 countries. It generally bans the
dumping into the sea of certain substances and permits the dumping of other materials only if
certain criteria are met. <I>-- More information on the IAEA's role under the Convention may
be obtained from the IAEA Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management. Information
about the Convention itself is available from the IMO, 4 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7SR,

<H2><A NAME = "A1.7">The decades project.</H2></A>
 As countries define their energy programmes over the coming
decades, interest is growing in the application of improved data, analytical tools, and methods
for comparatively assessing different options for the generation of electricity, particularly their
health, environmental, and economic aspects. As a means to address the issues, the IAEA and
eight other organizations are carrying out an inter-agency joint project on databases and
methodologies for comparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity generation.
Called DECADES, the project was initiated in 1992. Participating organizations are the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization; Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; Commission of the European Communities;
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific; International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (World Bank); Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development; and World Meteorological Organization.<P>
        DECADES  is part of the global response to energy and environmental concerns of the 1990s.
Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June
1992 particularly notes the role of energy in sustainable development and the importance of
global co-operation to help developing countries build environmentally benign energy strategies.
Since there is no single worldwide intergovernmental organization that comprehensively covers
these and other global issues of energy and electricity generation, the DECADES project provides
a useful means to combine the expertise of various international and regional organizations.<P>
As part of the DECADES project, the IAEA launched a co-ordinated research programme (CRP)
in December 1993.  It focuses on cases studies to assess and compare the potential role of
nuclear power and other options reducing the emissions and residuals from electricity generation.
The purpose of the case studies is to demonstrate the use of available databases and computer
tools, including some being developed by DECADES, in studies to support decision-making in
the electricity sector. Some 15 countries already have submitted proposals for their participation
in the CRP, which will run through 1995.  Results from the CRP, as well as from additional case
studies being done by organizations participating in DECADES-related activities, are scheduled
for presentation in September 1995 at an international symposium on electricity, health, and the
environment being planned in Vienna. --<I> More information may be obtained from the IAEA

<H2><A NAME = "A1.8">Food irradiation's pratical utilization.</H2></A>
 Twelve countries from Asia, Africa, the
Middle East, and Latin America recently have submitted requests under the IAEA's technical
co-operation programme for assistance in the practical use of food irradiation technology. The
countries are Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, and Uganda. Assistance is being requested for the 1995-96 time
period.<P>


        Some countries, including China and Mexico, already have completed feasibility studies for
installing irradiation facilities.The studies were done in connection with a project on the
introduction of commercial-scale practical applications of food irradiation in developing countries,
which was initiated in response to the request of the IAEA General Conference in 1992.<P>
The project is being carried out by the Joint Division of the IAEA and Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in co-operation with other organizations including the
World Health Organization and International Trade Centre. Interest in food irradiation among
developing countries largely is tied to the technology's practical applications for reducing
post-harvest food losses and the incidence of food-borne diseases, as well as for treating various
food commodities that must meet strict quarantine requirements for international trade.<P>
China's feasibility study examined the installation of a semi-commercial scale irradiation facility
in Beijing for treating rice and other foodstuffs. The government has allocated 6 million Yuan
(about US $1.1 million) to build the facility. IAEA assistance amounting to just over US $260
000 has been approved to support the cost of necessary services and equipment, including the
cobalt-60 radiation source for the irradiator.<I> -- More information may be obtained from

<H2><A NAME = "A1.9">International nuclear event scale.</H2></A>
 Already being applied by 53 countries for
classifying events at nuclear power reactors, the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) is
being further developed for use at other types of nuclear facilities. National INES officers, who
met at the IAEA in late 1993, have found the scale increasingly effective in serving its primary
purpose of communicating to the public the significance of nuclear events and putting them into
perspective. In light of the favourable experience, they supported efforts to provide detailed
guidance for the scale's wider application for installations other than power reactors.<P>
        INES was developed by an international group of experts convened jointly by the IAEA and
Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Events
are classified at seven levels, either as incidents (levels 1-3) or accidents (levels 4-7), depending
on their severity. The scale has been in worldwide use since early 1992.<I>-- More information

 More than 80 experts from IAEA Member
States and international organizations recently attended a seminar on the transport of radioactive
waste. Held in Vienna 21-25 February 1994, the meeting provided information for the revision
of the IAEA's<I> Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Waste (IAEA Safety Series No.
6)</I> and promoted dialogue between operators and regulators in both the transportation and waste
management fields.<P>
        Papers presented during the seven scientific sessions covered the following areas: IAEA activities
in radioactive waste transport; national experiences and recommendations for international
transport regulations; waste transport and handling; waste generation volumes, characteristics, and
disposal requirements; risk assessment; and transport and waste packages. Participants discussed
proposed amendments related to the transport of materials having a low specific activity and
surface-contaminated objects. They expressed support for efforts to ensure compatibility between
requirements for waste management and those for transportation, especially with regard to the
packaging of materials. <P>
        Presently, the IAEA is heavily involved in the review and revision process of its transport
regulations for radioactive waste. In 1996, it plans to issue a new revised edition reflecting the
latest scientific and technological developments, taking into account factors such as the new
regulations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection;   more stringent
packaging requirements for the shipment of large quantities of radioactive material by air; and
other changes approved for adoption under the IAEA's continuous review and revision process.
Information presented during the seminar will be used for the next meeting of the revision panel

For 1996, the IAEA General Conference has approved a regular budget of US $219 million at an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the dollar. It also set a target of US $64.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund for 1996.

The General Conference meets once a year to consider, among other things, the Board of Governors' report for
the previous year, to approve the accounts and programme and budget and to approve any applications for
membership. It has the authority to request from the Board of Governors reports on any questions relating
to the functions of the IAEA.During its regular annual session, the Conference conducts a wide ranging general 
debate on the IAEA's policies and programme and examines a variety of matters brought to its attention by the 
Board of Governors, the Director General and individual Member States. Delegates from Member States annually
address the General Conference in brief statements.

<H2>The IAEA and the UN family:<BR>
Networks of nuclear co-operation</H2>
<P>
<I>
A range of formal agreements and arrangements support the global foundation for peaceful nuclear development in many fields
</I>
<P>
<B>by Sheel Kant Sharma</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
While its Charter makes no specific mention of the nuclear age, the United Nations moved quickly after its formation in 1945 to lay the basis of global co-operation in the nuclear field. At its first session in January 1946, the General Assembly adopted a resolution that, inter alia, established the UN Atomic Energy Commission, which was formed to make specific proposals related to the international control and peaceful development of nuclear energy. Before it was dissolved in January 1952, the Commission issued a number of reports to the Security Council.  New impetus came in December 1953, when US President Eisenhower addressed the General Assembly and dramatically proposed the creation of an international atomic energy agency.
<P>
In 1954, the General Assembly adopted the resolution [810A (IX)] that set in motion the process to establish the IAEA. During that same session, the Assembly also favourably considered a draft resolution to convene in 1955 what would later become the first of four International Conferences on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and it established the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. Three years later, in 1957, this Committee formally negotiated on the UN's behalf the relationship agreement with the IAEA Preparatory Commission, both of which had been envisaged in the Agency's Statute.  Since that time, the UN and the IAEA have built an extensive network of global nuclear co-operation in fields related to international security, economic and social development, and the environment. This article presents an overview of agreements that have been put in place with the UN and its specialized agencies.  It also reviews formalized co-operative arrangements that the IAEA has with other national, regional, and global organizations whose work is of interest to Agency activities.
<P>
<H3>Relationship agreement with the UN</H3>
<P>
The IAEA's relationship agreement with the UN was, in fact, the result of many years of deliberation. The work was guided by the experience gained over a decade by specialized agencies that had concluded agreements with the UN.  The lengthy deliberations on the IAEA agreement reflected the special position that the IAEA has under the UN's aegis, namely to be responsible for  international activities concerned with the peaceful uses of atomic energy . The agreement was fashioned to accommodate the unique nature of the IAEA's planned activities and the terms of its Statute. It thus brought the IAEA into a category different from the specialized agencies within the UN system. The agreement recognized the Agency as an autonomous international organization (under its Statute) in  working relations  with the UN.
<P>
Some basic principles underpin the relationship, as stated in the agreement's first Article:  The Agency undertakes to conduct its activities in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter to promote peace and international co-operation, and in conformity with policies of the United Nations furthering the establishment of safeguarded world-wide disarmament and in conformity with any international agreements entered into pursuant to such policies . 
<P>
Other important features are that the IAEA is:
<UL>
<LI>
required to submit its annual report to the UN General Assembly;
<LI>
called upon to submit reports, when appropriate, to the Security Council and notify the Council whenever, in connection with the activities of the Agency, questions within the competence of the Council arise. The IAEA is also called upon to cooperate with the Security Council by furnishing to it, at its request such information and assistance as may be required in the exercise of the Council's responsibility for maintenance or restoration of international peace and security. The agreement further provides that the Agency shall report to the Security Council and the General Assembly any case of non-compliance with safeguards undertakings, within the meaning of relevant provisions in the IAEA Statute.
<LI>
called upon to undertake consideration of any resolution related to the Agency, adopted by the General Assembly or by a Council of the UN. Effective co-operation and co-ordination are also stipulated between the IAEA and other UN-established bodies concerning the provision of technical assistance in the field of atomic energy. Other provisions address co-operation with the UN's Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC), as well as with UN specialized agencies. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Agreements with inter-governmental organizations and  specialized agencies</H3>
<P>
The IAEA Statute envisaged co-operation with specialized agencies within the UN family. The specific terms for collaboration were subsequently fleshed out in individual formal agreements. These <I>co-operation agreements</I> reflect the particular interface between the wide range of nuclear applications and the specialized fields of these agencies. They further provide for inter-agency consultations and co-operation in various forms. 
<P> 
Apart from this formal framework, informal working contacts have been set up over the years based on shared interests and knowledge that can be brought to bear on specific issues. Participation by the Agency in the meetings of the ACC and its subsidiary organs also has broadened bilateral or trilateral consultations.
<P>
In some cases, <I>standing arrangements</I> have been put into place. First and foremost among these is the one between the IAEA and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which operate the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. Located at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, the Joint Division  marked 30 years of service in 1994 under an arrangement whereby all of its programmes and activities are approved by the governing bodies of the two autonomous organizations. Notable achievements have been recorded. A prime example is the work related to mutation breeding, through which nearly 2000 new beneficial varieties of crops have been developed using radiation-based technology. 
<P>
Another valuable form of co-operation is through <I>standing inter-agency forums.</I> An example here is the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI), the coordinating group for global work in this field. It has been in operation since 1984 with participation by the IAEA, FAO, and World Health Organization (WHO). 
<P>
Other cases of such arrangements are evident from the work of IAEA research laboratories and centres. The IAEA and United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO), for instance, jointly operate the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. The IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco (IAEA-MEL)   unique in the UN system  has long-standing arrangements in place with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and with UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Links have especially been strengthened since the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) on matters related to the measurement and control of global marine pollution, and protection of ocean and coastal waters. In the context of the Earthwatch initiative, UNEP also has designated the IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratories as an inter-agency collaborating centre, specifically to serve as the laboratory for reference environmental materials and methods.
<P>
Less institutional but effective co-operation is maintained with WHO. By mutual agreement, areas of interest have been defined to avoid duplication; this is the case, for instance, in the field of hormone radioimmunoassay. WHO takes part in IAEA radiation protection services and the two organizations operate an international network of Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories and a dose intercomparison programme for cobalt-60, widely used in medical treatment.
<P>
The IAEA additionally undertakes joint projects with other members of the UN family, pooling expertise and resources whenever appropriate. In areas of nuclear and radiation safety, a practice has evolved whereby manuals, standards, regulations, and recommendations are issued under the joint sponsorship of IAEA, FAO, WHO, and the International Labour Office (ILO). In the 1990s, the International Chernobyl Project involved co-operation with FAO, ILO, WHO, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), as well as the Commission of the European Communities. Similarly, WHO's International Programme on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident (IPHECA) is coordinated with the IAEA, FAO, ILO, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic co-operation and Development (OECD/NEA). 
<P>
In many cases, the joint organization of scientific meetings has become a common practice. A case in point is the upcoming international conference on Chernobyl's radiological consequences in April 1996. It is being co-sponsored by the European Commission, the IAEA, and WHO, in co-operation with the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA), UNESCO, UNEP, UNSCEAR, FAO, and OECD/NEA.
<P>
On energy-related matters, the IAEA has joined forces with a number of organizations within and outside the UN family. One particular focus is on the comparative assessment of energy sources for electricity production. In 1991 at a symposium organized by the IAEA and nine partners, senior experts examined the environmental and health effects of different energy systems for electricity generation and the prospects of increasing efficiency in energy use. The conclusions were submitted to the Preparatory Committee of the Rio Conference (UNCED). Subsequently, the Agency initiated a joint inter-agency project on databases and methodologies for comparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity generation, called DECADES. Databases cover technical and economic parameters as well as emission levels and problems at different steps of the electricity generation chain. The work includes a review of the various approaches to comparative assessment that may be used in the planning and decision-making processes. Project results will be considered in October 1995, at a major international symposium on electricity, health, and the environment.  It is being co-sponsored by the IAEA, WMO, World Bank, OECD/NEA, EC, International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
<P>
Another cooperative venture, involving the IAEA and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was launched in 1993 to assist Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union to improve their infrastructures for radiation protection and nuclear safety. 
<P>
<H3>Technical co-operation links</H3>
<P>
Technical co-operation activities of the IAEA have grown considerably over the last two decades, significantly expanding their scope. In general, the cooperative network can be described broadly under three relationship levels:
<P>
<B><I>Participation in the coordinating machinery of the UN system for operational activities.</I></B> The IAEA participates in the work of the ACC, which is at the apex of UN system-wide co-ordination. The link extends to various subsidiary bodies within the ACC framework that deal with specific matters; for example, statistical activities; information management; groundwater resources; oceans and coastal areas; and women's concerns. 
<P>
The Agency also takes part in other inter-agency mechanisms, including the IACSD (Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development), CCPOQ (Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions), and the CCAQ (Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions). The IACSD co-ordinates follow-up work to the UNCED on activities related to the environment and sustainable development. The CCPOQ holds discussions on technical co-operation in order to arrive at a common understanding of the problems involved and to establish, wherever possible, a common approach in dealing with them. One of the main issues currently under review is the implementation of General Assembly Resolution 47/199 regarding UN operational activities for development. Other issues include African development, field level co-ordination mechanisms, and support costs.
<P>
The IAEA additionally supports work of the UN's Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) by regularly contributing to its draft reports and evaluations. 
<P>
Other mechanisms for coordinating inter-agency activities have been created in response to specific issues and needs involving the IAEA's support. They include the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environment Protection (GESAMP), which is under the co-sponsorship of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), FAO, WMO, WHO, IAEA, UN, UNESCO, and UNEP. 
<P>
<B><I>Relations at the headquarters level.</B></I> The IAEA maintains close links with UNDP headquarters on Agency projects, its activities related to its regional programmes, and other related matters.
<P>
For projects related to mineral exploration, there is an understanding on delineation of tasks with the UN Department of Development Support and Management Services. General mining exploration activities are carried out by the UN Department, but exploration for uranium-bearing minerals is the IAEA's responsibility. The IAEA has carried out mineral exploration projects involving uranium resources financed by UNDP. Under a UNDP-initiated energy project, the Agency also has co-operated closely with the World Bank through provision of technical advice on the development of energy policies and strategies. 
<P>
In other areas of technical co-operation, common interests were identified with UNIDO in a 1987 agreement. UNIDO is currently working with the Agency to ascertain the viability of mass-rearing insects on an industrial scale using radiation technology in support of pest control projects in Africa. UNEP is working with the IAEA on environmental monitoring of non-radioactive pollutants in areas where IAEA activities complement activities under its Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS).
<P>
<B><I>Co-operation at the national level with UN agencies, in particular UNDP.</I></B> Since it has no technical officers permanently in the field, the IAEA draws upon the UN resident co-ordinator system, working closely with UNDP field offices. Delivery of IAEA technical assistance is channeled through the local UNDP office. UNDP-financed projects often serve as focal points around which IAEA technical assistance can be designed and thereby more deeply anchored in the development priorities of recipient countries. Co-ordination with UNDP also ensures better awareness, through resident planning authorities, of nuclear applications and their potential contributions in fields such as plant breeding, hydrology, medicine, industry, and pest control.
<P>
<H3>Relationships with non-UN organizations</H3>
<P>
To put the global nuclear network into true perspective, it is useful to look at the IAEA's relationships with organizations outside the UN system. Their activities in many cases are directly related to the IAEA's work in specific areas.
<P>
Nineteen non-governmental organizations have <I>consultative status</I> with the Agency, which enables close working contacts. <A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_1>(See box). </A>Formal <I>co-operation agreements</I> have been concluded with seven inter-governmental organizations: the OECD/NEA, the Inter-American Nuclear Energy Commission of the Organization of American States (IANEC); the Organization of African Unity (OAU); the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM); the League of Arab States (LAS); the Organization for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL); and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency (AAEA). 
<P>
By virtue of these agreements, these organizations are entitled to be represented at the sessions of the General Conference. An additional seven inter-governmental organizations are normally invited to send observers to the General Conference every year by virtue of their concern with developing uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or with research in the nuclear services. These are the: Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC); International Bureau of Weights and Measures (IBWM); International Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/IEA); Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR); Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE); Middle Eastern Regional Radioisotope Centre for the Arab Countries (MERRCAC); and OPEC.
<P>
The IAEA's co-operation with the NEA is particularly close in several key areas. It includes joint preparation of specialized publications, such as <I>Uranium Resources Production and Demand,</I> and the joint operation of the Incident Reporting System for nuclear power plants. High-level meetings are held annually to review and discuss co-operation in these and other areas, including training programmes, scientific conferences, and research in fields related to health and safety, waste disposal, transport of radioactive materials, and nuclear law.
<P>
<H3>Strengthening the foundation</H3>
<P>
The IAEA's relationships with the UN and other organizations have been established carefully and steadily over the years. The agreements with the UN and some of its specialized agencies have been founded on the provisions of the Agency's Statute as well as the UN Charter. Major changes could not be envisaged without corresponding  amendments to these instruments.
<P>
Overall, the relationships have served to augment the global foundation for nuclear co-operation in important ways. It has been relatively easy to tailor or expand the cooperative network to meet the demands of important new priorities of the UN and IAEA. Such has been the case regarding the range of Agency activities contributing to Agenda 21 and sustainable development. Even closer and broader co-operation is required as this agenda moves ahead.  
<P> 
In the IAEA's experience, co-operation and co-ordination among many organizations generally has been most effective on administrative and financial matters where the problems are rather clearly spelled out and the solutions, accordingly, easier to find. More difficult, because of the complexities and different technologies involved, is co-ordination on matters relating to technical programmes. Owing to differing mandates and administrative procedures, practical problems and delays can frequently arise.
<P>
For greater effectiveness, relationships between organizations, as those between individuals, must be kept alive and active. Rigid adherence to the letter of the law, or to precedent and formal procedure, may not achieve the needed results. Overall experience has shown that it is generally possible to reach flexible, workable arrangements to overcome difficulties, prevent unnecessary duplication, and ensure coordinated international action. 
<P> 
As more emphasis is placed on global co-operation involving organizations within and outside the UN family, more unified approaches will be demanded.  The co-operative network established in the nuclear field over the past half century offers a solid basis for more concerted and effective action.

<H2>The IAEA and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)</H2></A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
In keeping with the IAEA's Statute - which authorizes it to establish appropriate relations with "any organization the work of which is related to that of the Agency" - 19 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have formal consultative status with the Agency.  Seven others have been invited by the IAEA Board of Governors as observers to the Agency's general Conference or to undertake specific tasks.
<P>
Those with consultative status are the European Atomic Forum; European Confederation of Agriculture; International Air Transport Association; International Cargo Handling Co-ordination Association; International Chamber of Commerce; International Commission on Radiological Protection; International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements; International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; International Co-operative Alliance; International Council of Scientific Unions; International Federation of Documentation; International Federation of Industrial Producers of Electricity for Own Consumption; International Organization for Standardization; International Union for Inland Navigation; International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electrical Energy; Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, Inc.; World Confederation of Labour; World Energy Council; and World Federation of United Nations Associations.
<P>
In addition, certain NGOs with no formal consultative status but having concern with developing uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes are invited to send observers to the regular session of the Agency's General Conference. These include: the American Nuclear Society; Canadian Nuclear Society; European Nuclear Society; European Physical Society; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; International Nuclear Societies Council; International Radiation Protection Association; Nuclear Energy Institute; the Uranium Institute, and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).  The Director General may request NGOs having special competence in a particular field to under take specific studies or investigations, or to prepare papers for the Agency.
<P>
NGOs with consultative status are allowed certain privileges and facilities in connection with meetings of the General Conference and the Board. These include the right to receive the provisional agendas of the Conference; the right to send observers to all public meetings of the General Conference and of the Board; the right to submit written statements to any organ of the Agency, subject to censorship by the Director General; the right to submit oral statements to Committees of the General Conference or before public meetings of the Board, subject to various restrictions; the right to be invited by the Director General to other meetings convened by the Agency; the right to consult with n embers of the Secretariat the right to have access to any document services established for the press and to the Agency's library.
<P>
Arrangements have also been made with NGOs active in the field of electric power and energy economics for the exchange of statistics and documents and for attendance at each other's meetings. Thus, representatives of the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electrical Energy and of the World Energy Council have participated in the Agency activities and are in close collaboration with the IAEA on matters of mutual interest.

<I>Report to the Board of Governors by the Chairman of the 
Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving 
the Efficiency of the Safeguards System</I>

<OL>
<LI>The first session of the Committee was held from 2 to 4 July 1996. Representatives of 69 Member States of the Agency and of two intergovernmental organisations participated. There was no participation, at this first session, by non-members of the Agency who had concluded or were obliged to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI>After dealing with some organisational matters and a general exchange of views, the Committee concentrated on a first reading of the Draft Protocol contained in Annex III to document GOV/2863.
<P>
<LI>During the discussion which was frank, some written and oral proposals for changes to the Protocol were made.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>The issues which generated most discussion among participants were:
<P>
<DD>(i)	confidentiality of information obtained by the Agency;
<P>
<DD>(ii)	the widest possible application of the proposed measures;
<P>
<DD>(iii)	the relationship between national constitutions and possibly also national legislation and the Protocol;
<P>
<DD>(iv)	reporting on imports; and
<P>
<DD>(v)	the Preamble.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Some expressed their satisfaction with the draft Protocol and stated their readiness to accept it as it stands. 
<P>
<LI>The exercise was useful because it enabled participants both from Member States and the Secretariat to engage in a discussion of the principal issues involved in the context of the specific legal language of the draft Protocol. This was indeed the first occasion on which the draft Protocol was considered.
<P>
<LI>At the end of the discussion, the Committee invited participants to submit, not later than 1 August 1996, proposals for changes to the draft Protocol. Also, it requested the Secretariat to prepare and circulate, by 2 September 1996, a compendium of all proposals received. I am pleased to say that the Secretariat has already complied with this request and has, on 2 September, circulated the compendium containing both proposals made orally and in writing during the Committee's July session and proposals submitted subsequently in writing.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat was commended for its work over many months in the preparation of the draft Protocol.
<P>
<LI>The next session of the Committee has been fixed to begin on 1 October when, under the chairmanship of my successor, a second reading of the draft Protocol will be undertaken. The basic working document for that session will of course be the compendium (GOV/COM.24/3).

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency safeguards system has, as its cornerstone, nuclear material accountancy. 
Since its inception over 30 years ago, the system has evolved and been strengthened
through the continuing introduction of new methods and techniques.  As a result, there have
been improvements in both its effectiveness and its efficiency in detecting diversion of
nuclear material placed under safeguards.  The discoveries of undeclared nuclear material
and facilities in Iraq and the problems associated with the Agency s efforts to verify the
nuclear inventory in the Democratic People s Republic of Korea highlighted the importance
of assurance regarding the absence of any undeclared nuclear material and activities in
States with comprehensive safeguards agreements and the need to update the safeguards
system by integrating into it measures that will give the Agency an improved capability to
detect undeclared nuclear material and activities.  Further, the Agency s positive experience
in verifying the nuclear inventory in South Africa has demonstrated the benefits that can
                          flow from increased transparency and co-operation.
                                                                         <P>
<LI>The measures envisaged in this respect, which include those such as no-notice
inspection, unrestricted access to sites with nuclear facilities and direct communications
between the field and Headquarters, are not only of vital importance to the strengthening
of the effectiveness of safeguards, they also relate directly to the public s perception of
safeguards. The potential relevance of a strengthened and more efficient safeguards system
   to universal and regional arms control measures should not be overlooked.
                                                                         <P>
<LI>Beginning in 1992, a number of decisions (relating to  Special Inspections , to  Design
Information  and to a  Reporting Scheme for nuclear material and specified equipment and
non-nuclear material ) were adopted by the Board of Governors.  These re-affirmed the
requirement that Agency safeguards provide assurance regarding both the correctness and
the completeness of nuclear material declarations by States with comprehensive safeguards
agreements, endorsed individual measures for increasing the Agency s capabilities in this
respect and requested the Director General to submit to it concrete proposals for the
assessment, development and testing of measures for strengthening safeguards and
improving their cost effectiveness.  In response to this request the Secretariat presented in
December 1993 a proposal entitled  Programme 93+2,  which aimed, within two years, to
evaluate the technical, financial and legal aspects of a comprehensive set of measures,
including those recommended by the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation
(SAGSI), and to present, early in 1995, proposals for a strengthened and more efficient
                                                          safeguards system.
                                                                         <P>
<LI>In December 1994, the Board of Governors was presented with a comprehensive review
of the work that had been done under each of the seven tasks comprising  Programme
93+2  and a description of the various measures being examined under the programme
(GOV/INF/759).  While no action on  Programme 93+2  was recommended to that Board, the
discussion which took place provided further guidance to the Secretariat for its work under
the programme and for its preparation of specific proposals for the March 1995 Board of
                                                                  Governors.
                                                                         <P>
<LI>The Director General's report to the March 1995 Board, GOV/2784<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1/</SUP></A>, provided an
overview of the proposed measures for strengthening the present safeguards system in a
systematic, integrated manner.  The report discussed how the various measures interrelated
and how their synergistic effect would increase the level of assurance that could be attained. 
Each measure was described in detail in terms of its cost or effort, technical and legal
aspects, i.e., whether the Secretariat would implement the measure on the basis of existing
legal authority or whether complementary authority would be sought.  Although some
Governors expressed reservations about some of the measures, the Board endorsed the
general direction of  Programme 93+2 .  It reiterated its support for a safeguards system for
implementing comprehensive safeguards agreements designed to provide credible assurance
of the non-diversion of nuclear material from declared activities and of the absence of any
undeclared nuclear activities.  This support was also reflected in the strong endorsement in
April 1995 by the NPT Review and Extension Conference of the work of the Agency to
strengthen further the effectiveness of safeguards.
<P>
<LI>As requested by the Board at its March 1995 meeting, and taking into account the many
helpful comments received from Member States on  Programme 93+2  and the advice of
SAGSI on the programme, the Secretariat submitted for the Board s consideration in June
1995 document GOV/2807, containing a comprehensive set of strengthening and efficiency
measures.  The measures were arranged in two parts:  Part 1 consisted of those which could,
in the Secretariat s view, be implemented under existing legal authority and which would
be practical and useful to implement at an early date; Part 2 consisted of those which the
Secretariat proposed for implementation on the basis of complementary authority.  While it
was recommended that the Board take action on those measures falling within the Agency s
existing legal authority (Part 1), the Director General recommended that action by the Board
on the remaining measures await his next report, allowing the Secretariat the benefit of
discussions at the General Conference and of further informal consultations with Member
States.
<P>
<LI>Following extensive discussion of GOV/2807, the Board took note of the Director
General's plan to implement at an early date the measures described in Part 1 and urged
States party to comprehensive safeguards agreements to co-operate with the Secretariat to
facilitate such implementation, on the understanding that elaboration of the implementing
arrangements and the clarification of State s concerns would be required.  The many
comments and suggestions made during the discussion have been taken into account in
planning the implementation of the Part 1 measures.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is proceeding with the implementation of Part 1 measures as rapidly as
time and resources allow.  Following the June 1995 Board of Governors  meeting a detailed
implementation plan was developed, and communications were sent to State parties to
comprehensive safeguards agreements describing the actions the Secretariat had identified
as necessary to proceed.  The letter indicated that the Secretariat would undertake
implementation of Part 1 measures in 1996 as broadly and extensively as possible, subject
to operational and budgetary constraints.
<P>
<LI>The following provides a summary of the activities undertaken in implementation of the
Part I measures through the end of March 1996:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)   <I>broader access to information</I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      The SSAC questionnaire was finalized and sent to all States with operative
          comprehensive safeguards agreements (an information letter was sent to States
          with comprehensive safeguards agreements where the suspension protocol is
          in force) during December 1995 with a request that the responses be returned
          to the Agency by end of February 1996.  The questionnaire was sent to 59
          States and two regional systems and 17 responses had been received by the
          end of March 1996.  A methodology for the analysis of the information is being
          tested using the responses received.
<P>
<LI>      A letter requesting information on certain closed-down or decommissioned
          nuclear facilities and LOFs and on nuclear facilities which were built but where
          nuclear material was never introduced was sent to all States with
          comprehensive safeguards agreements at the end of March 1996 with
          responses requested by the end of April 1996.  A letter requesting the
          additional information regarding the nuclear fuel cycle that can be sought
          under existing legal authority is being prepared.
<P>
<LI>
               Initial implementation of environmental sampling is being focused on
               enrichment and certain hot-cell facilities.  General guidelines for these
               applications have been developed and approved, candidate facilities
               have been identified, facility-specific sampling objectives, plans and
               procedures are being developed and consultations with Member States
               regarding implementation have been initiated.  Analytical equipment for
               the clean laboratory has been installed.  The laboratory will be able to
               receive and handle samples by mid-May 1996 with full operation
               scheduled for 1 July 1996.  Base-line sample collections were carried
               out at two facilities in late February and early March.
<P>
<LI>
               An organizational plan for improved information analysis is in place. 
               The plan identifies where the work will be done, how it will be
               supported and reviewed and the management process for confirming
               the need for and nature of follow-up actions with States.  The general
               conceptual framework or methodology for improved information analysis
               described to the Board of Governors in March 1995 has been further
               developed and a number of software tools to aid its implementation are
               in place.  The work of a group of Member States experts on the
               development of the physical model of the nuclear fuel cycle is complete. 
               Arrangements to effect a peer review of the model (possibly through
               Member State Support Programmes) are under consideration.
<P>
<LI>
               The procedures for protecting safeguards confidential information are
               being reviewed to ensure that protective measures are up-to-date and
               adequate.  Particular attention is being paid to the means of controlling
               access to safeguards confidential information in computer data files.  A
               Consultants Group of Member State experts met in Vienna in early
               December 1995 and, inter alia, reviewed the Secretariat's procedures
               for the distribution of environmental samples and for reporting results,
               intended to protect the anonymity of samples and the confidentiality of
               results.  The Group agreed that implementation of the procedures would
               meet the objectives of the Agency and of Member States.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>(b)   <I>increased physical access</I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      Work is underway to identify how no-notice inspections (unannounced routine
          inspections), particularly in combination with additional operational data and
          advanced technology, could lead to more effective and efficient safeguards for
          a number of facility types.  An approach is currently being tested in a low
          enriched uranium fuel fabrication facility in Sweden, and detailed consultations
          are underway in an attempt to define an approach for a similar facility in
          Japan.  Administrative procedures necessary to support no-notice inspections
          as part of the routine implementation of safeguards have been developed.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>(c)   <I>optimal use of the present system</I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      A wide variety of advanced technology for remote monitoring and transmission,
          and unattended measurements with remote transmission is being examined
          and demonstrated.  This includes digital surveillance, electronic seals and
          motion and radiation detectors, with remote transmission by satellite and
          phone lines.  Two digital surveillance cameras and an electronic seal using
          remote transmission through a satellite uplink to Vienna have been operational
          from a facility in Switzerland since mid-January 1996.  The specific location
          in the facility is a room with a vault containing a semi-static store of direct-use
          material.  A variety of query and transmission strategies is being evaluated. 
          The plan is to expand this capability to a network involving five facilities in
          Switzerland by the end of November 1996.  The objective is the development
          of new safeguards approaches for these locations which combine the new
          technology with no-notice inspections thereby permitting reductions in
          inspection frequency and effort.  Similar applications of advanced technology
          are being demonstrated at a facility in the US and another in South Africa.  In
          all cases the demonstrations include the authentication requirements of the
          Agency and the encryption requirements of the State.
<P>
<LI>      The development of, and States responses to, the SSAC questionnaire provide
          a mechanism for a systematic exploration of areas of increased co-operation
          which could benefit both the Agency and the SSAC.  At the same time the
          process of increasing co-operation between the Agency and regional systems
          and a large single State SSAC are continuing.  Implementation of the New
          Partnership Approach (NPA) continues with EURATOM, areas of increased co-
          operation will feature in the consultations with ABACC and a modified NPA
          safeguards approach to LWRs will be tried at ten LWR facilities in Japan in the
          near future.  There is an impression that increased co-operation will result in
          a transfer of costs from the Agency to the State.  However, the experience with
          the NPA and that gained from the Programme 93+2 field trials is that, after an
          initial investment in consultations and training, both sides save resources.  For
          example, the Agency saves resources through a reduction in the interim
          inspections it must carry out, and the SSAC saves by being able to plan the
          interim inspections it carries out by itself in a cost-effective manner (subject,
          of course, to timeliness requirements) rather than responding to a schedule
          developed and communicated by the Agency.
<P>
<LI>      A number of training courses necessary for the implementation of Part  1
          measures are in various stages of development, pilot testing and
          implementation.  A training course on environmental sample collection and
          handling is in place and by the end of September 1996 approximately 100
          inspectors will have received this training.  Training courses on the physical
          model and enhanced observational skills are being pilot-tested and other
          courses dealing with the conduct of no-notice inspections and design
          verification of closed-down and decommissioned facilities are under
          development.  Courses for the training of SSAC personnel are also under
          development.

<P>
<LI>The informal consultations which took place between the June and December 1995
meetings of the Board of Governors enabled the Secretariat to make progress in developing
the proposals for strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards to be implemented under
complementary legal authority.  The proposals were presented to the December Board in the
form of a  Discussion Draft  of 21 November 1995.  The detailed discussions on this draft
with Member States before, during and after the December Board enabled the Secretariat to
progress further in developing the proposals.  A  Discussion Draft II  was distributed on 27
February 1996 and discussed by the Board during its March 1996 meeting.
<P>
<LI>The Chairman's conclusion drawn from the Board's discussion of  Discussion Draft II 
during their March 1996 meeting included a request that the Secretariat take into account
all comments made and continue consultations with Member States with a view to
submitting a formal text for the Board's consideration in June.  The present document has
been drafted following additional comments by and extensive consultations with Member
States.  SAGSI met mid-April 1996 and made a number of recommendations to the
Secretariat on how to deal with some of the comments made by Governors during the March
Board.  The table set out in <A HREF="bg2863a1.html">Annex I</A> to this report has been retained, with corrections, from
Discussion Draft II.  It provides a compendium of the Part 1 and Part 2 measures of
 Programme 93+2  and includes references, as requested by a number of Board members,
to the relevant parts of the Secretariat s legal analysis first put forward in GOV/2784 and to
the specific paragraphs of INFCIRC/153<A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2/</SUP></A>.  The Annotated Outline of the Expanded Declaration, provided in <A HREF="bg2863a2.html">Annex II</A>, has also been revised and expanded to serve as a
reference and guide for States in submitting their Expanded Declarations.  The draft protocol
additional to comprehensive safeguards agreements (hereinafter referred to as the  protocol ),
first presented to the Board in the November Discussion Draft and proposed by the
Secretariat as the mechanism through which States with such agreements could grant the
Agency the additional authority to implement the measures discussed in this report, has been
revised and is included as <A HREF="bg2863a3.html">Annex III</A>.

PROPOSED MEASURES FOR  A STRENGTHENED AND COST-EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS
SYSTEM
UNDER COMPLEMENTARY LEGAL AUTHORITY</B>
</CENTER>
<P>                                  
<LI>This document presents those measures which the Secretariat proposes for
implementation under complementary legal authority.  The structure of the presentation in
this document follows closely that of the Discussion Drafts and consists of three sections. 
The first describes the broader access to information, including that which would be
provided by States through an Expanded Declaration and that obtained by the Agency
through environmental sampling at locations to which access would be granted under
complementary legal authority.  The Annotated Outline of the Expanded Declaration (Annex
II), revised following Board discussions and comments received, retains as closely as possible
the structure and content of the draft presented in GOV/2807.  The second section describes
the increased physical access which would be sought for Agency inspectors.  The third
section presents measures for optimizing the use of the present safeguards system which
would require complementary authority.
<P>
<LI>The mechanism for granting this authority would be a protocol additional to
comprehensive safeguards agreements between the Agency and the State or States
concerned.  This would provide a uniform and transparent mechanism through which all
States with comprehensive safeguards agreements may confer upon the Agency the
additional legal authority.  A draft protocol is set out in Annex III.  When endorsed by the
Board, the protocol will be submitted to individual States for their consent.  As is the case
with safeguards agreements, each protocol would be submitted to the Board for its approval,
and would enter into force either upon signature or subsequent notification by the State,
following which formal implementation would begin, with the integration of the Part 2
measures into the safeguards system.  In the view of the Secretariat, this process would be
facilitated considerably, if the proposed measures were to be implemented, to the extent
possible, on a voluntary basis, pending entry into force of their respective protocols.
<P>
<LI>Full implementation of the  Programme 93+2  measures, both Part 1 and Part 2, will
require consultations, training and experience with the evolving system.  It is expected that
the measures, taken together, will lead to more effective and efficient safeguards on nuclear
material resulting from increased co-operation with SSACs, greater use of no-notice
inspections -- particularly in conjunction with advanced technology (e.g., unattended
measurements and remote transmission of data) -- and certain administrative arrangements
(e.g., improved inspector designation procedures and expanded use of regional offices). 
These -- in combination with increased access to information through the Expanded
Declaration, increased physical access, the implementation of new technical measures (e.g, 
environmental sampling) and the new approach to information analysis -- provide the basis
for a greatly strengthened and more efficient safeguards system, the maximum benefit from
which is strongly dependent upon implementation of all of the measures.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has further considered the points raised during the March meeting of 
the Board of Governors related to the need for clear identification of the role of EURATOM
and ABACC in the implementation of the proposed measures.  The importance of early
consultations between the Agency, EURATOM and ABACC and the States concerned on how
 Programme 93+2  measures will be implemented in the context of the relevant safeguards
agreements is recognized.  The role and responsibilities of these regional systems in
connection with  Programme 93+2  measures are a matter for decision by those systems and
the States concerned. Early consultations with EURATOM and ABACC on the implementation
of Part 1 measures have been initiated.
<P>
<LI> Programme 93+2  is intended to strengthen safeguards in States with comprehensive
safeguards agreements, but participation of other States can enhance the effectiveness and
efficiency of the implementation of the programme in several ways.  First, and most
importantly, implementation of certain measures in the programme in other States can
enhance the implementation of the programme in States with a comprehensive safeguards
agreement.  The primary example of an effective contribution would be the provision of
information on export licenses and, where available, on actual exports and imports.  There
are other instances, particularly where the nuclear fuel cycle of a State with a
comprehensive safeguards agreement is interrelated with that of another State, in which
additional information about specific facility operations would be useful. In addition, States
without comprehensive safeguards agreements have not provided information to the Agency
on nuclear material which may be in peaceful use in activities which are under their
jurisdiction or control but which are carried out on the territory of States with comprehensive
safeguards agreements.  In the view of the Secretariat safeguards would benefit if States
without comprehensive safeguards agreements were to provide information to the Agency
on any such material, as well as information on any other nuclear material in non-explosive
uses.  Some measures, if adopted by States without comprehensive safeguards agreements,
would also increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the application of safeguards in those
States.  Examples are simplified arrangements for inspector designation and measures
relevant to individual facilities and nuclear material under safeguards in those States.  For
these reasons the overall safeguards system would be further enhanced if, in addition to
acceptance of the protocol by States with comprehensive safeguards agreements, other
States would be prepared to undertake legally binding commitments with regard to the
application of  Programme 93+2  measures relevant to strengthening safeguards in those
States.  The Secretariat would, if directed by the Board, develop a draft legal instrument for
this purpose.
<P>
<I>Implementation Costs</I>
<P>
<LI>Of particular interest to States is the possibility of reducing inspection effort and
safeguards costs as  Programme 93+2  comes to fruition.  The Secretariat considers that
implementation of the programme will necessarily proceed step by step beginning with an
expected increase in effort and costs to implement the Part 1 measures (primarily the costs
to implement environmental sampling and the capital costs of advanced safeguards
technology), followed by the costs of initiation of the Part 2 strengthening measures.  It will
be only after a period of time, as the measures for optimizing the use of the present system
and measures for increasing assurance of the absence of undeclared activities become
established in practice and confidence gained in their use, that cost-saving reductions in
some safeguards measures can safely be made.
<P>
<LI>Thus, the introductory phase of implementation will, for some years, involve a temporary
net increase in cost which will not be immediately offset by reduced effort on inspection
activities.  However, savings are expected later to lead to cost neutrality.  The pace with
which the implementation process proceeds will dictate the duration of the cost increase and
depends upon actions taken by Member States including the conclusion of protocols and the
necessary arrangements for implementation of both Part 1 and Part 2 measures.
<P>
<LI>Initially, reductions in inspection effort at nuclear facilities and the resulting cost savings
will come about primarily from the use of advanced safeguards technology (unattended
instrumentation and remote transmission of data), no-notice inspections and, it is hoped,
from increased cooperation with State and regional systems of accounting and control.  In
the longer term, it is possible that an improved capability to provide assurance of the
absence of certain undeclared nuclear activities (for example, reprocessing) may permit a
reduction in the intensity of safeguards on declared nuclear material (for example, the
frequency of inspection of spent fuel), but the timing of the consequential impact on costs
of reducing safeguards measures on declared nuclear material and of the use of advanced
safeguards technology cannot be established at this point.  In developing its April 1993
advice on improving the cost-effectiveness of safeguards, SAGSI considered this concept of
 tradeoffs  in some detail and concluded that the principle was valid.  SAGSI did not,
however, advise on what level of assurance could justify such tradeoffs.  This relationship
cannot be quantified and must remain a matter of judgment as to the degree of confidence
being gained from the strengthening measures.
<P>
<LI>For planning purposes, the Secretariat has based its estimates of the initial cost to the
Agency of these measures on their initiation during 1997, with the costs to be
accommodated within the proposed budget or covered by any extra budgetary funds made
available for that purpose.  However, it is the Secretariat s strong view that, as the
 Programme 93+2  costs relate to the Agency s statutory safeguards function, the necessary
funds should be included in the assessed budget and be subject to the normal budget
development, review and approval process.  Therefore, beginning with 1997, it is the
intention of the Secretariat to include most  Programme 93+2  implementation costs in the
regular budget proposal.
<P>
<LI>The effort anticipated for the complementary activities described in this document
during 1997 amounts to approximately 200 person-days.  The purposes of these activities
would be to refine the procedures developed during the 1994 field trials, begin the process
of establishing confidence in the procedures and resolve any non-trivial inconsistencies and
questions arising from the analysis and evaluation of information available to the Agency. 
The 200 person-days to carry out these activities foreseen for 1997 are based on the
assumption that implementation would take place in a number of States, either under
protocols or under voluntary arrangements as proposed in paragraph 13, and would include
some sites on which nuclear facilities and LOFs currently under safeguards are located and
some nuclear-related locations identified in the Expanded Declaration or other locations of
interest to the Agency.
<P>
<LI>These activities would normally be carried out in conjunction with ad hoc and routine
inspections and design information verification visits to nuclear facilities and LOFs, as
appropriate.  Few additional trips from Vienna would be required.  In subsequent years the
level of this effort would be adjusted to take into account the initial implementation
experiences.  The cost to the State would be largely dependent upon its own requirements
with respect to SSAC.
<P>
<LI>The effort needed for analysis and evaluation, using the sophisticated methods
developed under  Programme 93+2,  of the increasing volume and complexity of information
expected to become available to the Agency under complementary authority will grow
gradually as the information flow increases and the evaluation methodology is established. 
Initially, the evaluation will rely heavily on existing resources in the Safeguards Department,
with additional experts added only as required.  For 1997 one additional person year is
planned.  The 1997 cost of this additional person year, the 200 person-days in connection
with the implementation of these measures and the associated local travel and some
additional costs for negotiation is estimated to be  650,000 US dollars.  It is anticipated that
one additional person-year of effort to accommodate information analysis will be needed in
each Operations Division by 1997.  During the 1997/98 budget cycle, the estimated cost for
the implementation of  Programme 93+2  measures (Part 1 and Part 2) is 4.2 million US
dollars per year in the regular budget, and 1.1 million US dollars and 2.3 million US dollars
from extra-budgetary contributions for 1997 and 1998, respectively, for a total of 5.3 million
US dollars in 1997 and 6.5 million US dollars in 1998.  This includes costs associated with
environmental sample analyses, additional inspection and negotiation efforts, improved
information analysis and the implementation of advanced technology.
<P>
<LI>In an attempt to provide a more concrete picture of how the costs associated with the
implementation of strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards might develop, two
implementation scenarios are presented in Figure 1.  The implementation costs shown for
1996 and 1997 are as budgeted and previously communicated.  The total costs assumed for
1998 and 1999 ($6.5 and 6.3 millions, respectively) are somewhat higher than in 1997 due
to anticipated equipment requirements, and, from the year 2000 forward, the costs are
assumed constant at 1997 levels.  The first cost savings scenario (depicted as the solid black
areas in Figure 1) assumes that through advanced technology, no-notice inspections and
increased co-operation with SSACs, direct inspection effort for interim inspections at light
water reactors (LWRs) can be reduced by two-thirds.  This, in turn, results in a one-third
reduction in total costs attributable to these activities ($8.7 million in 1994).  The rate of
introduction of these cost-saving measures is assumed constant with implementation
beginning in 1999 and concluding with full implementation in 2002.  The net costs for
strengthening safeguards with the assumed reduction in inspection effort for interim
inspections at LWRs are shown by the dotted line in Figure 1.  The second cost savings
scenario (depicted as the light shaded areas in Figure 1) is derived through similar
assumptions regarding direct inspection effort for interim inspections at on-load reactors
(OLRs) (total costs attributable to these activities in 1994 were $8.9 million).  The net costs
for strengthening safeguards in combination with both scenarios are depicted as a solid line
with cost neutrality achieved in 2002.

<P>
<LI>Both scenarios are constructed on the basis that current timeliness criteria with respect
to spent fuel remain in place.  That is, the required interim inspection activities would still
be carried out, but they would be accomplished by use of advanced technology and by the
SSAC under appropriate arrangements with the Agency.  Thus, some portion of the cost
savings in the Agency s budget might result in additional costs for the State.  This would
depend on whether the State requires an inspector from the SSAC to accompany the IAEA
inspector.  If the Agency, through implementation of the full set of measures, is able to
provide a sufficient level of assurance regarding the absence of undeclared reprocessing in
a State, then there would be no need to carry out interim inspections of spent fuel for
timeliness purposes (i.e., a trade-off).  Under these circumstances the cost savings for the
Agency would be about the same as shown in Figure 1 and there would be corresponding
cost savings for the State and operators.
<P>
<I>Safeguards conclusions and the objectives of strengthened safeguards</I>
<P>
<LI>Nuclear material safeguards as currently applied is a complex verification system based
on nuclear material accountancy.  The system requires the concerted action of nuclear facility
operators, State authorities and the IAEA inspectorate.  In general terms, assurances that
declared material is accounted for derive from a series of time-dependent and technically
interrelated verifications.  These are verifications that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i)   nuclear material flows and inventories are as declared;
<P>
<DD>(ii)  facility design is in accordance with the declared design and consistent with
          the corresponding safeguards approach; 
<P>
<DD>(iii) facility operations are as declared (e.g., through surveillance records review);
<P>
<DD>(iv)  facility material accountancy systems conform to prescribed standards;
<P>
<DD>(v)   facility operator s measurement systems perform according to international
          standards; and
<P>
<DD>(vi)  verification measurement performance, the performance of individual facility
          accountancy systems and the accumulated performance of accountancy
          systems across facilities within States are in good statistical control over time,
          i.e., the systems are providing the required measurement and other data with
          the requisite accuracy and precision.
</DL>
<P>
The safeguards conclusions, and their corresponding levels of assurance for a given period
of time, derive from an integration of the results obtained through the various verifications
and analyses.  An analogous but simpler process is involved for locations outside facilities
(LOFs) containing nuclear material.
<P>
<LI>The Expanded Declaration and increased physical access provide the basis for a wider
range of activities, a range that would include not only nuclear material, but the nuclear fuel
cycle, nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development and related activities.  The
ultimate aim, nevertheless, remains to enable the Agency to fulfill its rights and obligations
under the safeguards agreement, namely, to ensure that declared nuclear material is not
diverted to non-peaceful purposes and to provide assurance of the absence of undeclared
nuclear material and activities.  This increased assurance would derive from determinations
that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) the declared present and planned nuclear programme is internally consistent;
<P>
<DD>(ii)     the nuclear activities and types of nuclear material at declared locations are
             consistent with those declared (e.g., through the collection and analysis of
             environmental samples);
<P>
<DD>(iii)    overall production, imports and inventories of nuclear material are consistent
             with the utilization inferred from the declared nuclear programme;
<P>
<DD>(iv)     imports of specified equipment and non-nuclear materials are consistent with
             the declared programme;
<P>
<DD>(v) the status of closed-down or decommissioned facilities and LOFs is in
        conformity with the State s declaration; and 
<P>
<DD>(vi)     nuclear fuel-cycle related research and development activities are generally
             consistent with declared plans for future development of the declared nuclear
             programme.
</DL>
<P>
Clarification would be sought from the State to resolve any questions or apparent
inconsistencies in connection with information provided by the State through the Expanded
Declaration.  Assurances regarding the correctness and completeness of States  declarations
under their safeguards agreements as regards nuclear material and nuclear facilities would
derive from an integration of results obtained across this broad range of evaluations and
associated verifications.
<P>
<LI>For some time Member States have asked about the logical connection between
inspection goal attainment and the safeguards conclusion contained in paragraph 1 of the
yearly Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR).  That conclusion currently reads  on the basis
of all information available to the Agency, it is considered reasonable to conclude that the
nuclear material and other items which had been placed under Agency safeguards remained
in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise adequately accounted for .  Any specific
instances where the Agency is unable to reach a safeguards conclusion are, of course,
identified.  The questions from Member States have been along the line of: how is it possible
for this conclusion to remain unchanged when not all inspection goals are attained or, as has
been the case in recent years, there has been a decline in the rate of goal attainment for
some types of facilities?

<P>
<LI>The nature of the safeguards conclusion can only be understood through an
understanding of what kind of assurances the current system provides.  Through safeguards
the hypothesis (implicit in the State s commitment to non-proliferation) is tested that  no
diversion has taken place .  However, the occurrence of  no diversion  cannot be detected. 
It can only be inferred from the absence of any evidence to the contrary.  This absence does
not prove that there has been no diversion.  It only says that (i) from all information
available and examined, none has been observed and (ii) in the absence of such an
observation, there is no reason to reject the hypothesis of no diversion.
<P>
<LI>The inspection activities that the implementation criteria specify as constituting
inspection goal attainment for a type of facility, in combination with information required
from the State, establish a kind of  observational vantage point .  These  observational
vantage points  are designed such that if diversion activities were to have taken place, there
would be a good chance they would have been detected.  The failure to attain fully an
inspection goal means that the corresponding  observational vantage points  have been
weakened in some fashion.  Thus, in most cases, the failure to attain inspection goals for all
facilities implies a reduction in the chance of detecting diversion activities had they taken
place.  However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the hypothesis of  no diversion 
remains unrebutted.  As a consequence, the conclusion of  no diversion  is still correct, but
the level of confidence or assurance in the conclusion is reduced.  It goes without saying that
if insufficient activities had been carried out, no safeguards conclusion should be drawn. 
There has, in fact, been such a case in the Agency s practice.
<P>
<LI>The concept of strengthened safeguards and the idea of transparency or levels of
transparency can be addressed in a similar way.  The combination of inspection activities
and new technical measures, requirements for additional information from States and
elements of the current system (appropriately adjusted) proposed by the Secretariat under
 Programme 93+2  constitutes, in effect, a new kind of  observational vantage point , a
vantage point that aims to provide credible assurance regarding no diversion of declared
nuclear material and the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities.  However,
the nature of the conclusions are the same as for the current system.  The occurrence of  no
diversion  and the occurrence of  no undeclared nuclear activities  cannot be detected.  As
before, they can only be inferred by the absence of any evidence to the contrary.
<P>
<LI>Appropriately implemented, the measures proposed by the Secretariat provide high
assurance regarding the non-diversion of safeguarded nuclear material and the absence of
undeclared nuclear activities at sites where safeguarded material is present and some lower
levels of assurance regarding: (i) the absence of undeclared activities at other locations
where the State has indicated nuclear material (exempted and pre-safeguards) is present;
(ii) the absence of undeclared activities at locations the State has identified with specified
activities, not involving nuclear material, that are directly related to the operation of the
current or future fuel cycle; and (iii) the absence of undeclared activities for the State as a
whole.  Each of these levels can be thought of as levels of transparency.  As with the current
system, the emphasis is on those activities (enrichment and reprocessing) that would need
to be carried out if weapons useable nuclear material were to be produced.  Again, the
absence of undeclared activities cannot be proved.  It can only reasonably be inferred when
the range of activities undertaken has produced no indications or evidence to the contrary.

<P>
<LI>While it is vital that information provided by the State through the Expanded Declaration
be subject to confirmation, the Agency has no intention of proceeding with a mechanistic
verification of that information.  The information will be systematically analyzed for internal
consistency and for consistency with other information (e.g., information from open sources
or reports on exports of certain equipment).  Thus, if a particular process were identified by
a State as constituting part of its fuel cycle, then the presence of certain closely associated
processes and specialized equipment would be expected.  Conversely, if a particular process
were not identified by a State as part of its fuel cycle, then the presence of associated
processes and equipment would not be expected.  Indications (e.g., specialized equipment
and environmental signatures) of the existence of certain activities or processes which have
not been identified in the State s Expanded Declaration would be one example of an
inconsistency in the information available to the Agency in response to which the Agency
would seek clarification.  Still other examples could include factual inconsistencies between
export and import reports and quantitative inconsistencies involving a gross mismatch
between a State's production and/or import of nuclear material and the utilization of nuclear
material described in the Expanded Declaration.
<P>
<LI>Clearly, considerable attention must, at all times, be given to how the quality of
information is to be assessed through a system of consistency checks and independent
corroborations.  The Agency does not draw conclusions based on information that it cannot
independently assess and corroborate.  Part of the lexicon of the current safeguards system
involves words like defect, discrepancy and anomaly.  The definitions of these words have
evolved over many years of experience and relate to kinds of inconsistencies (defects and
discrepancies) between operator statements and inspector observations or other information
available to the Agency and, from them, the unusual observable conditions (anomalies)
which might occur in the event of a diversion or misuse of nuclear material, equipment or
facilities subject to Agency safeguards.  The definitions are part of a management practice
that defines the requirement for follow-up activities, reporting requirements and
management review.  Most defects and discrepancies are resolved with the State and
operator when they are discovered.  An anomaly is officially established at a Secretariat
debriefing meeting on results of inspection and other relevant information.  Once an anomaly
has been declared and confirmed through management review, follow-up actions to resolve
the anomaly are initiated.  All anomalies and associated follow-up actions are reviewed by
the SIR Task Force (comprised of the Directors of the Department of Safeguards and the
Section Head for Safeguards Evaluation).  Any recommendation by the SIR Task Force that
an anomaly be closed is reviewed and approved by the Deputy Director General for
Safeguards.  All recommendations for closure must be accompanied by a description of the
actions taken, generally in concert with the State and operator, to prevent a re-occurrence. 
If an inconsistency involving expanded information were identified, the process of resolution
would be similar to that currently employed in resolving inconsistencies in nuclear material
declarations.  Obviously some inconsistencies or questions that could arise will be more
significant than others and the structure for management review and follow-up actions will
naturally reflect this.  As in the case with nuclear material declarations, the more accurate
and comprehensive the State s Expanded Declaration, the less frequently would
inconsistencies and questions arise.
<P>
<LI>Taking into account comments from Member States indicating that some proposed
measures would create major implementation difficulties for them, the Secretariat has made
every effort to limit the requirements for additional information and access to that deemed
necessary to provide  credible assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material from
declared activities and of the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities . 
However, in the final analysis it is up to Member States to decide what level of assurances
they want from the safeguards system -- whether the  observational vantage point  will be
on a high hill with strong glasses or on some lower hill with weak glasses.
<P>
<LI>Although the measures described below are categorized as those relating to information,
to physical access to locations and to administrative measures for optimizing the present
system, it may facilitate the Board s consideration of the various measures if they were to
be described from a different perspective, specifically, how they would contribute to the
credibility of assurances which Member States seek of the IAEA.
<P>
<LI>Of primary importance to increased assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material
are the proposed information and access measures relevant to the presence and use in the
State of nuclear material and of facilities and locations associated with such use.  In order
to achieve strengthened safeguards as requested by Member States, the Secretariat believes
that the Agency must have greater access to information concerning the location and use in
the State of all nuclear material and to information concerning the facilities and other
locations where such material is present.
<P>
<LI>A powerful tool for gaining greater assurance as to the absence of undeclared nuclear
activities and for detecting the presence of undeclared nuclear material is the analysis of
environmental samples, a technique which the Agency already has the authority to
implement at locations to which it has access.  The utility and practicality of environmental
sampling in and around nuclear facilities have been validated through the conduct of field
trials at the invitation of a number of Member States.  As described in paragraph 54 below,
some experience with other applications of environmental sampling has also been obtained
through the field trials.  Further investigation of the practicality and cost-effectiveness of
such applications in the context of comprehensive safeguards agreements is underway. 
Environmental sampling is just one example of the value to safeguards of new and improved
technology.  The way must be kept open to employ other such technology.  This was
recognized as early as 1970 by the Board in INFCIRC/153.
<P>
<LI>Without physical access by the Agency to verify a State s declarations with respect to
nuclear material, the value of such information cannot be realized.  While the Agency has
historically focused on declared material at declared facilities and locations, the possibility
of a clandestine nuclear programme in part co-located with a declared nuclear programme
points to the need to improve the Agency s ability to detect any undeclared use of nuclear
material at declared facilities and locations. Thus, a number of the measures related to
increased physical access have been proposed.  These measures would not only provide
additional assurance with respect to declared material at declared nuclear facilities and
locations, but would also permit the Agency to draw, with greater assurance, conclusions as
to the absence of undeclared material and activities at or near such locations.
<P>
<LI>Furthermore, the Agency's experience has demonstrated the need not only for activities
geared towards providing assurance as to the absence of undeclared nuclear material and
activities at declared nuclear facilities and locations, but also for activities directed at
providing a degree of assurance as to the absence of undeclared nuclear activities elsewhere
in the State.  This can be facilitated by access to certain additional information indicative of
a State's complete nuclear programme.  This would include the measures related to the
provision of information by a State on its imports and exports of certain equipment and non-
nuclear material, as well as information on specified elements of the infrastructure directly
related to the operation of the State's nuclear facilities, LOFs and nuclear research and
development activities, additional information on nuclear research and development activities
and plans for future development of the nuclear programme.  Access to locations which have
not been identified as locations where nuclear material is present, but which are identified
with specified equipment and non-nuclear material directly related to the operation of the
nuclear fuel cycle or to certain research and development work, would greatly facilitate the
clarification of inconsistencies and questions arising in the course of analysis of available
information without recourse to special inspections.
<P>
<LI>Finally, there are a number of other measures which would greatly facilitate the more
efficient deployment of Agency resources.  These include the acceptance of simplified
inspector designation procedures and agreement to the use and/or installation by the Agency
of satellite communication systems.
<P>
<LI>All of these measures must of course be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.  This
is not to ignore that the nuclear programmes of countries and the numbers and types of
nuclear installations differ considerably.  The clarity and quality of the information provided
by a State will influence the safeguards activities.  But in comparable circumstances,
comparable measures and criteria should be used.
<P>
<LI>As provided for in NPT Article III.3 and in paragraph 4 of INFCIRC/153, safeguards
should not hamper the development and use of nuclear technology, and in practice there
have not been problems.  The same must, and the Secretariat is convinced will, be the case
for strengthened safeguards.
<P>
<LI>From the beginning of  Programme 93+2,  the twin pillars of strengthened safeguards
have been increased access to information and to locations, and the whole concept is set in
a framework that assumes a much higher level of co-operation between the Agency and
States than that required by the current system.  This high level of co-operation which has
been so evident throughout the  Programme 93+2  development and field trials must carry
over into implementation.  The experience that is accumulating in the implementation of Part
1 clearly demonstrates the high volume of preparatory work that is needed.  Both the
Secretariat and States must be willing to address problems and find innovative solutions. 
The need for a high level of co-operation is not limited to States with Comprehensive
Safeguards Agreements.

<B>A.   MEASURES INVOLVING BROADER ACCESS TO INFORMATION<A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3/</SUP></A></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>1.   Expanded Declaration</I>
<P>
<LI>The Expanded Declaration includes three categories of information: information on the
State s System of Accounting and Control (SSAC), on present nuclear activities of the State
and on planned nuclear activities of the State.  All of the information concerning SSACs and
most of the information related to safeguarded facilities and LOFs are Part 1 measures and
are being requested under existing legal authority.  The remaining information in the
Expanded Declaration is addressed below for provision under complementary legal authority
and would involve information related to present and planned nuclear activities.  It is
intended that the Annotated Outline of the Expanded Declaration, provided as Annex II, serve
as guidance for Member States on the information to be submitted under the protocol.
<P>
<LI>The requested information would provide the Agency with a fuller and clearer
understanding of all nuclear activities in a State and would serve three important purposes. 
First, because of its scope and comprehensiveness, the information in the Expanded
Declaration would contribute to confidence that no undeclared nuclear activities are being
concealed within the declared programme or rely on or make use of elements of the declared
programme.  Second, by committing itself to a more extensive declaration about its nuclear
and nuclear-related activities, the State would provide a considerably improved data base
on its nuclear activities against which information obtained from other sources (e.g.,
procurement activities or environmental sampling) could be compared for consistency and
follow-up.  The more accurate and comprehensive the information, the less frequently would
inconsistencies and questions arise.  Third, the requested information would provide a basis
for the efficient planning and conduct of Agency activities relevant to providing greater
assurance about the absence of undeclared activities at declared locations as well as to
safeguarding declared nuclear material.
<P>
<LI>The approach taken in developing the Expanded Declaration was to be comprehensive
so that no relevant information is out of bounds while ensuring that States are not burdened
by excessive or irrelevant requests.  Further, States should not be required to provide
information which may not be within their reach.  For such situations, the requested
information is qualified with an expression such as  where available.  While this does not
eliminate the legal obligation to provide information, it makes it conditional in order not to
create unreasonable obligations.
<P>
<LI>The information provided in Expanded Declarations would be of greater scope than
currently provided to the Agency, and some elements of the information could be considered
by the State to be commercially or technically sensitive.  The obligation of the Agency to
protect information obtained in the course of safeguards in accordance with paragraph 5 of
INFCIRC/153 would apply to all information acquired under complementary legal authority. 
The procedures and practices of the Agency for meeting this obligation will continue to be
subject to review to ensure their appropriateness and effectiveness.

<P>
<LI>The overall result of an Expanded Declaration, and associated activities, will be the cost-
effective strengthening of the safeguards system through greater nuclear transparency.  The
resulting benefits to States are the political and security enhancements that can accrue from
the increased assurance.
<P>
<LI>Unlike nuclear material accountancy, whose quantification is well known, transparency
is not quantifiable.  Qualitative judgments can, however, be made as to the degree of
transparency which derives from various levels of information.  The information called for
in the Expanded Declaration is far from including all details of a State s nuclear activities, but
the range of information requested represents a reasonable balance between the expected
benefits of the additional information and the practicalities and costs of regularly providing
and using more information.  The additional information that will come from the Agency s
on-site and evaluation activities and from the clarifications and explanations provided by
States in response to specific Agency requests will be an essential contribution to
transparency.
<P>
<LI><I>Information related to present nuclear activities</I> consists of:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) Information (description, status and location) on nuclear fuel cycle-related
        research and development (referred to herein as nuclear R&D) activities in the
        State not involving nuclear material which are owned, funded or authorized by
        the State and which are specifically related to conversion, fuel fabrication,
        power or research reactors, critical assemblies or accelerators; and,
        additionally, <I>all</I> nuclear R&D activities in the State not involving
        nuclear material which are specifically related to enrichment, reprocessing of
        nuclear fuel and treatment of waste containing nuclear material.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c. (iii) of the Expanded Declaration.  It covers nuclear R&D activities of the
State, which do not currently involve the presence or use of nuclear material, that are
specifically related to any process development aspect of the named components of the
nuclear fuel cycle and have the capability to generate nuclear material.  For example, applied
research related to process development aspects of enrichment (uranium or plutonium) or
reprocessing would be reported where it is clear that the intended end-use is a nuclear
application (design features related to radiation protection or criticality control and
components  manufactured from materials resistant to UF6 are examples of where it is clear
that the intended end-use is a nuclear application).  Theoretical or basic scientific research
and R&D on medical or agricultural applications, health and environmental effects and
improved maintenance are not included.  The R&D to be reported involving accelerators is
limited to accelerators capable of producing  a continuous neutron source sufficient for
annual production of gram quantities of fissile isotopes.
<P>
In addition, the State is asked to provide information on any nuclear R&D specifically related
to enrichment, reprocessing of nuclear fuel and treatment of waste containing nuclear
material that may exist even though it is not owned, funded or authorized by the State.
<P>
This element, in conjunction with element 2.c.(ii) in Part 1 (nuclear R&D at facilities and LOFs
involving nuclear material), would cover all relevant nuclear R&D specifically related to
enrichment, reprocessing of nuclear fuel and the treatment of waste containing nuclear
material.  This information, together with information on the State's activities to develop
other parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, would increase transparency with respect to the
direction of the nuclear programme within the State and provide an enhanced basis for
confirming the overall consistency of the State's declared nuclear fuel cycle development
programme, nuclear-related activities and nuclear exports and imports.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b) Information, additional to that required under INFCIRC/153, as may be
        identified by the Agency on the basis of an expected gain in effectiveness or
        efficiency and, following consultations, agreed to by the State, on specific
        operational activities at nuclear facilities and LOFs.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(iv) of the Expanded Declaration and involves information on specific
operational activities at nuclear facilities and LOFs other than that referred to in paragraph
2.b.(iv) of the Expanded Declaration (i.e., that which is not already required to be provided
under paragraph 64(b) of INFCIRC/153) and not presently routinely provided.  The specific
information to be provided would be limited to that identified by the Agency as improving
the effectiveness or efficiency of safeguards and, depending on the nature of a facility or LOF,
may include, by way of example, more frequent and earlier information on nuclear material
receipts and inventories, reactor fuel production, crane movement records, isotope production
programmes and maintenance activities. Each such additional item of information would be
included in the Expanded Declaration following consultations and agreement with the State
or States concerned.
<P>
Such information, when provided in advance, could be used, through unannounced routine
inspections, to increase the inspection coverage and the cost-effectiveness of safeguards on
declared nuclear material.  These arrangements could be mutually beneficial in reducing
overall inspection effort and corresponding effort of operators.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(c)  Information (description, contents and use) on each of the buildings on the sites
on which are situated nuclear facilities or LOFs, including maps of sites.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(v) of the Expanded Declaration.  The Agency's Design Information
Questionnaire (DIQ) already provides for the required information on all buildings and
locations where nuclear material is or is expected to be.  The information requested here
pertains to the other buildings on the site.
<P>
The terms  site,   site perimeter  and  site layout  are commonly used in the Agency s DIQ. 
Site perimeter and site layout have the same meanings here as in the DIQ and refer to the
spatial location of a structure or set of structures that are part, or support part, of a State s
nuclear fuel cycle.  The site layout (i.e., a site plan showing in sufficient detail the location,
premises and perimeter of the facility, buildings, railways, roads, rivers, etc.) and the
geographic location for sites containing nuclear facilities are included in the information
presently routinely provided and are defined by the State in its preparation of the relevant
DIQ.  The term  site  as used in the Expanded Declaration includes all of the area covered
by current DIQs and must also include all installations co-located with the facility(ies) or
LOF(s) for the provision or use of essential services, including hot cells for processing 
irradiated materials not containing nuclear material, radioactive waste treatment, storage and
disposal facilities and buildings associated with the equipment and non-nuclear material
identified in element 2.c.(vi) of the Expanded Declaration.
<P>
In most cases this is straightforward; the site is treated as the area within a perimeter fence. 
As a rule, it should bear a close relationship to that area, taking into account natural terrain
features and man-made boundaries.  It should normally be, or run close to, the surrounding
security barrier if such a barrier exists.  The size and complexity of sites will vary
considerably.  Some will be quite large and include more than one nuclear facility together
with a full complement of support and related services.  Others may consist of a single
building, or even a single room in a building, and have no co-located services.
<P>
A primary objective of strengthened safeguards is to assure that undeclared nuclear material
and activities are not co-located with nuclear facilities and LOFs in order to utilize the
infrastructure of manpower, technology, equipment and services that is in place to support
declared operations.  That is the reason for this element of the Expanded Declaration and
the associated access provisions described in paragraph 61(a).  The Agency would consult
with the State should the Agency have information that suggests that installations outside
of the site as defined by the State, may be engaged in activities that are functionally related
to the nuclear activities or the associated infrastructure on the site.  In such cases, the
Agency would request the identity and a description of activities outside of the declared site
relevant to resolution of the matter.  Should the consultation process, including any
additional information or access that the State is able to provide using every reasonable
effort, fail to resolve the issue, then the Agency could, as a last resort, make use of existing
provisions for a special inspection.
<P>
During design information verification visits and during inspections, the nature of the
buildings identified by the State under this element of the Expanded Declaration may be
checked to confirm their declared use and the absence of undeclared nuclear and nuclear-
related activities there.  In some cases, depending on the configuration of the nuclear facility
or LOF, some of this information can be required under existing authority, for example, for
the purpose of ad hoc inspections where the presence of nuclear material has been
indicated.  However, as indicated in paragraph 39 of GOV/2784, for most cases this
requirement is proposed under complementary legal authority.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(d) The identity, location, description, status, present annual production and the
        approximate annual production capacity for the manufacture, assembly and
        maintenance of specified items directly related to the operation of nuclear
        facilities, LOFs or nuclear R&D activities.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(vi) of the Expanded Declaration and covers information on the
manufacture, assembly and maintenance of certain equipment and non-nuclear material
functionally related to the operation of nuclear facilities, LOFs or nuclear R&D activities. 
These would include, by way of example, uranium enrichment centrifuge assembly, heavy
water production and zircaloy tube production.  The reporting would be limited to equipment
and non-nuclear material related to fuel fabrication, reactor operations, enrichment and
reprocessing which are listed under element 2.c.(vi) in the Expanded Declaration in Annex
II.  The Board s approval would be sought for any changes to this list resulting from
technological developments or experience with the physical model of the nuclear fuel cycle
(i.e., the  proliferation critical path  described in previous Board documents) from which the
list is derived.
<P>
The physical model is a major component of the Agency s improved analysis of information
developed under Task 5 of  Programme 93+2  and describes each nuclear activity that
would be involved in the nuclear fuel cycle from source material acquisition to the production
of weapons useable nuclear material and then beyond the fuel cycle to weaponization.  A
brief outline of the improved analysis was provided to the Board in GOV/INF/759.  The
Technical Background Documentation on  Programme 93+2  which was made available to
Member States in March 1995 provides a more detailed description, including an example
of the physical model for gaseous diffusion enrichment.
<P>
The information under element 2.c.(vi) would provide the Agency with an overview of the
infrastructure directly supporting the State s nuclear fuel cycle and contribute to the
transparency of the State s nuclear and nuclear-related activities.  It would provide
indications of where an infrastructure exists that could support nuclear activities that are not
part of the nuclear programme.  This information is necessary if the Agency is to be able to
provide assurance that the declared manufacture, assembly and maintenance of these
equipment and non-nuclear materials support only the declared programme.  In some cases,
depending on the configuration of the nuclear facility or LOF, some of this information can
be required under existing authority, for example, for the purpose of ad hoc inspections
where the presence of nuclear material has been indicated.  However, as indicated in
paragraph 39 of GOV/2784, for most cases the provision of this category of information is
proposed under complementary legal authority.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(e) The location, operational status,  present annual production and the
        approximate annual production capacity of uranium and thorium mines.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(vii) of the Expanded Declaration.  The types of information requested are
no different from those provided to the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency for the biennial Red
Book on uranium resources, production and demand.  Information on uranium and thorium
mines would complement the State s declaration under element 2.c.(i) of its domestic
capability to produce nuclear material.  This element does not include requirements for 
measurement or any other aspects of nuclear material accountancy and, hence, would not
change the  starting point of safeguards  as described in paragraphs 33 and 34 of
INFCIRC/153.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(f) Information on the inventories, imports and exports of material containing
        uranium or thorium which has not yet reached the stage of the nuclear fuel
        cycle described in paragraph 34(c) of INFCIRC/153; information on nuclear
        material exempted from safeguards pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153;
        information on nuclear material that has been exempted from safeguards
        pursuant to paragraph 36(b) of INFCIRC/153 but which is not yet in end-use
        form and, in the event the information is not complete, with indications of the
        limitations on its completeness; and information on any planned changes in
        location or further processing of waste containing nuclear material (excepting
        waste released to the environment) on which safeguards have been terminated
        pursuant to paragraph 11 of INFCIRC/153.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(viii) of the Expanded Declaration.  It is included in recognition of the
need for the Agency to be cognizant of all nuclear material (quantities, composition and
locations) within the State relevant to actual or potential nuclear activities within the State. 
The required information is to be provided to the Agency yearly.  The reporting requirements
for pre-safeguards nuclear material (pre-paragraph 34(c)) are limited to locations with
inventories, whether in nuclear or non-nuclear use, involving quantities exceeding those
identified in paragraph 37(b) and (d) and to individual imports and exports (or intended
exports) for specifically non-nuclear purposes and involving quantities exceeding those
identified in paragraph 37(b) and (d).  For inventories the quantities may be approximate. 
The reporting of imports or exports of pre-safeguards nuclear material other than those for
specifically non-nuclear purposes is as specified in paragraph 34(a) and 34(b) of
INFCIRC/153.  The reporting of nuclear material exempted for non-nuclear use (paragraph
36(b)) is also limited to locations (inventories) involving quantities of material exceeding
those identified in paragraph 37. All nuclear material exempted pursuant to paragraph 37
of INFCIRC/153 and all planned location changes and further processing of nuclear material
on which safeguards are terminated pursuant to paragraph 11 thereof should be reported,
regardless of the amount involved.
<P>
Where measurements of quantities are not made, other estimates could be provided.  This
element does not include requirements for measurement, batch and source data, the taking
of physical inventories, inventory change reporting or the closing of material balances. 
Moreover, the proposed activities during access to this material (paragraph 66) are far short
of the current activities for safeguarding nuclear material.  Hence, this element would not
change the starting point of safeguards as set forth in INFCIRC/153.
<P>
The quantity reporting unit would be tonnes for material which has not yet reached the
stage of the nuclear fuel cycle described in paragraph 34(c) of INFCIRC/153 and for nuclear
material exempted for non-nuclear uses under paragraph 36(b) of INFCIRC/153.  The
reporting units for other material included in this element are as specified in paragraph 101
of INFCIRC/153.  The exemption of uranium for shielding radioactive sources can be made
under the provision of paragraph 36(b) for non-nuclear use, in which case the reporting
called for here would be limited to available information.  In all cases, when nuclear material
exempted for non-nuclear uses is in its end-use form, there is no requirement to continue
reporting on it.
<P>
The requested information, along with element 2.c.(vii), would provide a more complete
picture of all of the State s nuclear material useable for nuclear purposes.  It would also
provide a basis for confirmation by the Agency of the consistency between the State s
declared nuclear programme and its holdings of nuclear material.  As indicated in paragraph
36 of GOV/2784, aspects of this element may be required under paragraph 81(c) of
INFCIRC/153.  However, the Secretariat has concluded that, without prejudice to the
requirements of INFCIRC/153, the better approach is to include all of this element under
complementary legal authority.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(g) Information on the export and import of nuclear equipment and non-nuclear
        material specified in GOV/2629, as amended by the Board of Governors from
        time to time, and such other equipment and non-nuclear material as may be
        specified by the Board of Governors.
</DL>
<P>
This is element 2.c.(ix) of the Expanded Declaration.  This measure would provide the Agency
with information about export license approvals (identity of equipment or material,
destination and, if known, expected date) and, where available, about actual exports and
imports (identity of equipment or material, destination, origin of import and date of export
or import) of specified nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material especially designed or
prepared for nuclear uses, and commonly used in the nuclear industry.  This is an additional
measure for increasing transparency, which would also increase confidence that such items
were being used only for peaceful purposes.  As indicated in paragraph 40 of GOV/2784,
complementary legal authority is needed in order to make its provision obligatory rather than
voluntary.
<P>
A number of States, including States without comprehensive safeguards agreements, are
already providing this information on a voluntary basis.  The Secretariat appreciates the
benefits of even wider reporting and of legally binding undertakings by all States without
comprehensive safeguards agreements, including nuclear-weapon States.  The Secretariat
would be prepared to develop proposals to that effect.
<P>
Experience in the analysis and use of this information may demonstrate the benefit of
information on the export and import of other equipment and material that are not included
in GOV/2629, as amended. This provision would leave open the possibility, at some later
point in time, for the Secretariat to propose to the Board a limited number of such items
whose reporting would be beneficial as well as practical and for the Board to include such
items as it deems appropriate.
<P>
<LI><I>Information related to planned nuclear activities owned, funded or authorized by the
State</I> consists of:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) Plans for the further development of the nuclear fuel cycle, including their planned
locations when known, and
<P>
<DD>(b) a description of planned nuclear R&D activities, including their planned locations
when known.
</DL>
<P>
These are elements 3.b and 3.c of the Expanded Declaration.  The scope of the requested
information for paragraph 52(a) is that specified in element 2.c.(i) of the Expanded
Declaration; for paragraph 52(b), it is limited to those activities specified in paragraph 51(a)
planned by the State (i.e., to be owned, funded or authorized by the State).  Reporting details
regarding new facilities are covered under the early reporting of design information as
detailed in GOV/2554/Attachment 2/Rev.2 (element 3.a of the Expanded Declaration).  The
information requested here would be more general and relate to long-term plans for further
development of the fuel cycle within a State and how that development is supported through
current and planned activities.  The Secretariat recognizes that this information could be of
particular sensitivity to States and that its obligation to protect the information must be
scrupulously met.
<P>
The information would be useful to the Agency in its own long-term planning and would
provide the basis for increased assurance that the declared present nuclear programme and
nuclear fuel cycle related R&D are generally consistent with the declared plans for future
development of the fuel cycle.  Any limitations on the scope of the information reported,
including the planning horizon (e.g., 5 years, 10 years, etc.)  should also be reported.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>2.  <I>Environmental Sampling</I>
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat intends to use environmental sampling techniques at locations, identified
in Section B of this report ( Measures Involving Increased Physical Access ), to which access
is granted under complementary legal authority.  This would involve environmental sampling
at nuclear-related locations and at other locations to which the Agency is granted access for
the purpose of confirming the absence of nuclear activities at these locations or, where there
is such activity, to detect, identify and characterize it.  It would also involve the collection
of environmental samples at locations, other than nuclear and nuclear-related sites, to which
the State is able to provide access, taking into account its constitutional obligations with
regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures, for the purpose of contributing to
assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in these other areas within States. 
Except for possible wide-area sampling applications described in paragraph 54, the sampling
at locations other than nuclear and nuclear-related sites would be for resolving an
inconsistency or question.
<P>
<LI>The field trials of environmental sampling conducted over the past two years have
involved the collection of high volume water samples, vegetation and soil samples and
smears at various distances from targeted nuclear activities (e.g., 8 km from two types of
enrichment facilities, 20 km from power reactors and 30 km from a reprocessing facility). 
Clear evidence of the existence of the power reactors and the reprocessing facility was seen
as far away from the corresponding activity as samples were collected.  Evidence of
enrichment activities at a distance seems to depend upon the type of enrichment technology
employed but more experience is needed to be definitive.  The experience gained by the
Agency in the use of environmental sampling as part of its programme of ongoing monitoring
in Iraq has also demonstrated the significant value of such techniques in helping to assure
the absence, or detecting the presence, of undeclared nuclear activities in wider areas of a
State.  Although further investigation of the practicality and cost effectiveness of such
environmental sampling is planned, the already demonstrated value of that technique has
prompted the Secretariat to provide for such a measure in the draft protocol.  This would
avoid the need at some later time to modify protocols which had already entered into force. 
Should, at some point in the future, the Secretariat become convinced that wide area
environmental monitoring is a cost-effective safeguards measure, the Secretariat would
report its conclusions to the Board of Governors prior to such implementation.
<P>
<LI>Sampling points at nuclear-related locations and at other locations which the Agency
considers may be of relevance to safeguards would be selected to minimize intrusiveness,
and the experience of the Agency indicates that the collection of such samples is, in fact, not
intrusive.  Arrangements will be made with the State regarding sampling programmes and
locations, and the procedures will be such that the State, if it wishes, can obtain duplicate
samples and check the results itself.  The State will be informed of the Agency's findings and
conclusions from its sampling activities in the State.  As is the case for all safeguards results,
the Agency would consult with the State regarding results on which the Agency had
questions or concerns.
<P>
<LI>The Agency recognizes the potential sensitivity of the results of environmental sampling
and will give special attention to meeting its obligation to protect such information.  To allay
any concerns that the technique might reveal sensitive non-nuclear-related information, the
analyses organized by the Agency in its laboratories will be designed to obtain data of
safeguards relevance only.  Moreover, sample identity is protected, and the results would be
subject to the confidentiality and protection requirements of paragraph 5 of INFCIRC/153. 
In December 1995, the Agency convened a Consultants Meeting involving experts from
Member States to review the sample distribution and results reporting protocols developed
during the field trials.  The consultants endorsed the protocols as being practical and as
adequately protecting the anonymity of distributed samples and the confidentiality of
reported results.
<P>
<LI>The environmental sampling programme initiated under existing authority should be
well established by the end of 1996.  Environmental sampling at sites covered by
complementary authority would be integrated into this programme so that altogether, for
planning purposes, an estimated 1,000 samples would be collected and analyzed annually
by 1998.  It is further estimated, for planning purposes, that one-half of these samples (500
per year), would be collected at sites under complementary authority.  Efficient and effective
analysis of environmental samples requires a sample analysis strategy for each site based
on site features and sampling objectives.  All samples collected will be subjected to a
screening measurement using a low-level radiochemical measurement method, then, based
on the screening measurement result and the sampling objective, a sample may be archived
without further analysis at that time, submitted for an inexpensive bulk measurement or
subjected to a more costly and detailed particle analysis.  For efficiency reasons some
samples may be composited and further analyzed as a single sample.  The sample analysis
strategy will continue to evolve as experience is gained with the suite of analytical
possibilities available in the extended network of analytical laboratories.  Decisions regarding
the nature of analysis requested for each sample collected are based on objective criteria.
<P>
<LI>The incremental annual cost for this initial sampling programme under complementary
authority is estimated to be approximately 2.6 million US dollars per year.  This would
include the collection of replicate samples by the Agency for the State should the State so
desire.  The cost impact on the State and operators for the collection of environmental
samples would be negligible.  Some additional effort on their part may be required to help
resolve any inconsistencies.
<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>B.    MEASURES INVOLVING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACCESS
<A HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4/</SUP></A></B>
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Under current comprehensive safeguards agreements, the Agency has the right to select
as strategic points for routine inspections all locations at nuclear facilities and LOFs where,
under normal conditions, and when combined with the information from all strategic points
taken together, the information necessary and sufficient for the implementation of safeguards
measures is obtained and verified.  The IAEA may also conduct inspection activities at
locations beyond strategic points at nuclear facilities and LOFs during visits for design
information verification and during ad hoc inspections in accordance with the access
provisions in comprehensive safeguards agreements for such visits and inspections.  The
Agency may also require access to information or locations beyond that specified above
under conditions for making special inspections as described in paragraphs 73 and 77 of
INFCIRC/153.
<P>
<LI>Increased physical access for Agency inspectors under complementary legal authority
in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements is a key element of a strengthened,
more efficient safeguards system.  Increased access is being sought in connection with
increased information to be supplied in the Expanded Declaration and with implementation
of new technical measures.  As has been stated, there is no intention of proceeding with a
systematic verification of the additional information to be provided through an Expanded
Declaration, however, it is essential that the Agency have access rights so that the
information is subject to confirmation.  To the extent possible, the need to  manage  access
to certain identified areas due to safety, proprietary or other concerns should be identifiedin
the Expanded Declaration, or at any rate as soon as possible.  Any need for access to be
managed must be identified by the State, and the State's proposal for how access is to be
managed would need to be evaluated by the Agency in light of specific Agency objectives.
These arrangements should not preclude the Agency from conducting activities necessary
to determine the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities at the location or
otherwise resolve any inconsistency or question.  The following paragraphs provide details
of and the rationale for the increased access.  The complementary access measures described
in this chapter provide a mechanism for the early resolution of uncertainties which might
otherwise necessitate reliance on special inspections.
<P>
<LI>Increased physical access, together with increased information, is intended to provide
the Agency with a fuller understanding of the State s nuclear programme.  It is expected to
contribute significantly to the assurance provided by Agency safeguards of the absence of
undeclared nuclear activities at locations identified in the Expanded Declaration and at other
locations which are accessed by the Agency.  It is essential that access be sufficient to
assure that undeclared nuclear material and activities are not co-located with declared
nuclear facilities and LOFs in order to utilize the infrastructure of manpower, technology,
equipment and services that is in place to support declared operations.  This access, together
with access to other locations which may be sought in connection with the resolution of
inconsistencies or questions or to implement a new technical measure, are detailed below:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) access to any location on a site containing a nuclear facility or LOF, including
        closed-down facilities and LOFs; and access to decommissioned facilities and
        LOFs (per element 2.a.(i) of the Expanded Declaration) to the extent necessary
        to verify their decommissioned status;
<P>
<DD>(b) access to locations identified under elements 2.c.(vii) and 2.c.(viii) of the
        Expanded Declaration.  This consists of locations of uranium and thorium mines
        (regardless of their declared operational status), locations identified in the
        Expanded Declaration as containing nuclear material that is either not covered
        by paragraph 34(c) of INFCIRC/153 or has been exempted for non-nuclear use
        in accordance with paragraph 36(b) of INFCIRC/153, nuclear material exempted 
        pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153), and waste containing nuclear
        material on which safeguards has been terminated pursuant to paragraph 11
        of INFCIRC/153;
<P>
<DD>(c) upon request by the Agency and taking into account any constitutional
        obligations the State may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches
        and seizures, access to locations identified under elements 2.c.(iii) and 2.c.(vi)
        of the Expanded Declaration.  This consists of locations identified where
        particular types of nuclear R&D that is owned, funded or authorized by, or
        otherwise coming to the knowledge of, the State are carried out and locations
        where specified equipment and non-nuclear material directly related to the
        operation of nuclear facilities, LOFs or nuclear R&D activities are manufactured,
        assembled or maintained.  Should the State not be able to provide the
        requested access then it would undertake to work with the Agency to satisfy
        its requirements in some other way;
<P> 
<DD>(d) upon request by the Agency and taking into account any constitutional
        obligations the State may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches
        and seizures, access to locations in the State other than those specified in (a)-
        (c) above for the purpose of the collection of environmental samples; and,
        lastly,
<P>
<DD>(e) the State may choose to offer access to the Agency in addition to that
        described in (a)-(d) above, to any location in the State which the Agency
        considers might be of safeguards relevance.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The access identified in paragraph 61(a) to sites of nuclear facilities and LOFs is for the
purpose of assuring the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities on the sites
of operating and closed-down nuclear facilities and LOFs.  Access to sites with operating or
closed-down nuclear facilities or LOFs would entail unrestricted access to any location on
those sites, with allowances for managed access to protect sensitive information or for safety
reasons.  To the extent possible, the Agency should be informed in the Expanded Declaration
of the areas on a site where access restrictions may apply.  Comparable needs for restrictions
could also arise for the access identified in paragraphs 61(b)-(e).  Access to decommissioned
facilities and LOFs is that necessary to confirm the declared decommissioned status.  In many
cases this would be a one-time activity depending on the type of facility and how much of
the remaining infrastructure could be used in connection with a nuclear activity.  The right
to verify that a facility or LOF has been decommissioned exists under current comprehensive
safeguards agreements.  However, there may be circumstances under which the Agency
would need to revisit such a facility or LOF, and complementary authority is being sought to
provide for this eventuality.
<P>
<LI>For sites of operating facilities and LOFs such access normally would be sought in
conjunction with ad hoc or routine inspections or design information verification visits.  In
such cases the advance notice for the inspection or visit to the facility or LOF would be in
accordance with the provisions of the existing safeguards agreement, including the provision
for unannounced inspections.  No additional advance notice would be provided with respect
to the complementary access to other locations on the site.  That is to say, upon arrival at
the site for the inspection or visit the Agency inspector would inform the State of the
locations for the increased physical access under complementary legal authority and of the
associated activities which would be carried out.  Complementary access would only be
sought during regular working hours unless otherwise agreed to by the State.  There are a
large number of sites with nuclear facilities (e.g., LWRs) where it is anticipated that most
interim inspections will be carried out as unannounced routine inspection which provides
the basis for more efficient and effective safeguards on declared nuclear material.  The
savings gained through this mechanism would be lost if there was a requirement for
advance notification when complementary access is to be sought.  At least 24 hours prior
notice would be provided by the Agency for access to such locations not carried out in
conjunction with a design information verification visit or an ad hoc or routine inspection.
<P>
<LI>The activities at sites of closed-down, and at decommissioned nuclear facilities and LOFs
would be those defined in the corresponding design information verification procedures.  The
activities that will be carried out at locations on sites where access is provided under
complementary authority would be visual observation, collection of environmental samples
and the use of other objective methods which have been demonstrated to be technically
feasible.  The frequency with which these activities would be carried out depends upon the
nature of a particular site, but most of the time this work would be carried out in conjunction
with the presence of an inspector in the State for ad hoc or routine inspections or design
information verification.
<P>
<LI>As indicated earlier, the Agency expects that the definition of the geographical area
constituting the site of a nuclear facility or LOF is straightforward.  Similarly, through the
field trial experiences, the Agency expects that provisions for complementary access to any
location on these sites are also straightforward.  However, there could be a few instances
where complementary access may be complicated by a variety of factors such as the nature
of existing access for the SSAC and the presence of private owners engaged in activities not 
involving nuclear material at locations on the site.  For these sites, practical difficulties with
access arrangements may have to be dealt with on a site-specific basis through Subsidiary
Arrangements.
<P>
<LI>Access to locations identified in paragraph 61(b) with mines or certain other nuclear
material is necessary for ensuring access to all of the State s nuclear material useable for
nuclear purposes and for confirming the consistency between the State s declared nuclear
programme and its holdings of and capacity to produce nuclear material.  Access would be
sought to resolve an inconsistency or question as well as to confirm the general quantities,
enrichment levels and utilization of the material as described in the Expanded Declaration
and to assure the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in connection with such material. 
The activities could include item counting, NDA measurements or sampling to confirm
enrichment, records examination as regards the material itself when substantial quantities
have been consumed or shipped on to other users, and visual observation, collection of
environmental samples and possibly other objective technical measures to help assure the
absence of undeclared nuclear activities involving such material.
<P>
<LI>Elements 2.c.(vii) and 2.c.(viii) of the Expanded Declaration do not contain any
requirement that nuclear material accountancy (e.g., periodic physical inventory takings or
closing of a material balance), as set forth in INFCIRC/153, be applied to the material in
these categories.  Moreover, the activities involving this material in the draft protocol are far
short of the measures for safeguarding nuclear material under existing legal authority. 
Hence, these information elements and the associated access do not constitute a change in
the starting point of safeguards.  In the absence of the need for access to resolve
inconsistencies or questions, use of such access would be infrequent and the likelihood of
a location being selected would normally be low during any given year.  Access to these
locations under complementary authority would normally be sought when an inspector(s) is
in the State for an ad hoc or routine inspection or a design information verification visit.  In
any case, at least 24-hour notification would be provided to the State and access would be
sought only during regular working hours unless otherwise agreed to by the State.
<P>
<LI>Access to locations identified in paragraph 61(c) with particular types of  nuclear R&D
or where specified equipment and non-nuclear material directly related to the operation of
the fuel cycle are manufactured, assembled or maintained (elements 2.c.(iii) and 2.c.(vi) of
the Expanded Declaration) is to assure that they support the declared programme and only
the declared programme and would be sought in connection with a need to resolve an
inconsistency or a question which has arisen.  In the event of an inconsistency or question,
the process would be similar to the well established process for resolving discrepancies and
anomalies arising in safeguarding declared nuclear material, including consultations, which
in most cases may resolve the matter.  As has been said previously, the Agency has no
intention to proceed with systematic or mechanistic verification of the additional information
supplied under the Expanded Declaration.  However, in any cases of inconsistencies or when
questions arise, the Agency must have the opportunity to confirm the explanation or other
response from the State.  It is in the interest of both the Agency and the State to provide
means to deal with plain mistakes and errors (the most common origin of inconsistencies
and questions) and to dispel unfounded suspicions.
<P>
<LI>The frequency of such requests is not known, but they should not arise very often.  The
activities to be carried out would depend upon the circumstances, but they would likely
include visual observation, collection of environmental samples, records examination and the
use of other objective methods which have been demonstrated to be technically feasible. 
At least 24 hours notification would be provided to the State and access would be sought
only during regular working hours unless otherwise agreed to by the State.  Should the State
not be able to provide the requested access because of constitutional obligations it may have
with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures, the State would undertake to
satisfy the Agency s concerns in some other way.
<P>
<LI>As described in paragraph 61(d), access to locations other than those described in
paragraph 61(a)-(c) would be for the collection of environmental samples.  In the absence
of routine implementation of environmental sampling for wide-area application (which is not
being implemented now), such access would be requested to resolve an inconsistency or
question (the arrangements for collection of samples are described in Section A2).  As before,
at least 24-hour notification would be provided to the State and access would only be sought
during regular working hours unless otherwise agreed to by the State.
<P>
<LI>As described in paragraph 61(e), States may wish to offer the Agency access in addition
to that described in paragraph 61(a)-(d).  Such an offer could be made at the time of
signature of the protocol, at any time thereafter or on a case-by-case basis.  The State may
find it in its interest to offer this access, possibly with arrangements for managed access to
protect commercial, proprietary or national security interests, in order to dispel any
unfounded allegations and to assist in resolving any inconsistencies or questions regarding
locations which the Agency considers may be of safeguards relevance.
<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>C.    MEASURES FOR OPTIMIZING THE USE OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM: INCREASED
             CO-OPERATION WITH STATES AND SSACs</B>
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Most of the measures for increased co-operation between the Agency and States and
SSACs are addressed in Part 1 of GOV/2807 for implementation under existing legal
authority.  Proposals for additional co-operation under complementary legal authority include
the adoption of simplified inspector designation procedures and the use of systems (including
satellite systems) that are not available in the State, for independent direct communications
between the field and Headquarters.
<P>
<LI>The benefits of simplified inspector designation procedures have been discussed by the
Board of Governors on numerous occasions and apply to all kinds of safeguards agreements. 
Direct communications between Headquarters and inspectors and installations in the field
would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards under all types of safeguards
agreements through the more timely exchange of information, data and instructions.  Readily
available public communications systems will be used when they meet timeliness,
authentication and encryption requirements.
<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>D.    RECOMMENDED ACTION</B>
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The measures contained in this document are the culmination of the Secretariat's and
the Policy Making Organs' efforts to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system, in particular
by increasing the Agency's capability to detect possible undeclared nuclear material through
the detection of undeclared nuclear activities both at declared locations and country-wide.
<P>
<LI>The measures already adopted by the Board clarifying the Agency's authority under
comprehensive safeguards agreements were important parts of these efforts.  Particularly
noteworthy were those relevant to the Agency's authority to verify declared, and to detect
possible undeclared nuclear material; to receive more information relevant to its safeguards
mandate; to make use of new technology; and to resort to special inspections for access to
additional information and locations.
<P>
<LI>Together with the measures already adopted, those proposed in this document are
important as they will complete the envisaged package.  Together, these measures will
provide the Agency with a more complete picture of the State's nuclear programme, would
secure Agency access to corroborate this information should the need arise, and would
enable the Agency to rely on the increased assurances provided by the new measures to
manage the system in a more cost-efficient manner by foregoing some of the routine
verification activities currently carried out.
<P>
<LI>The measures already adopted, along with these proposed measures, constitute a
package the full implementation of which will go a long way towards enhancing the
effectiveness of the system and rendering it more efficient. The package seeks to strike a
proper balance between the Agency's need for information and access and the State's need
to protect its legitimate interests and to respect its constitutional obligations.  It has been
arrived at through an intensive process of consultation with Member States and the conduct
of field trials over the last two years.  It is, however, for Member States to translate these
measures into new rights and obligations through finalization of the draft protocol.
<P>
<LI>In the light of the above, it is recommended that the Board, through an appropriate
mechanism, finalize the required legal instrument taking as a basis the draft protocol
proposed by the Secretariat and the explanation of the measures contained in this document.

<H3>STATEMENT REGARDING "STRENGTHENING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM:  	PROGRAMME 93+2" MADE BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL IN HIS INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT AT THE JUNE 1996 SESSION OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS</H3>
<P>
<B><I>EXCERPT FROM THE RECORD OF THE BOARD'S 891ST MEETING</I>
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>46.	Safeguards were being strengthened and made more efficient with the implementation of the Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2.  The progress in that area was described in paragraph 9 of document GOV/2863.  Those and other measures described and proposed in that document were the culmination of several years of work by the Board and the Secretariat to strengthen further the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards.  The Secretariat had endeavoured to define in the document a set of measures which, together with actions already taken by the Board, would further improve the safeguards system, while leading neither to discrimination in application nor to unacceptably burdensome or intrusive measures.
<P>
<DD>47.	Through consultations, briefings, discussion documents and regular Board meetings, the Secretariat had sought to reach the point where Governments' desire for more effective and reliable safeguards was backed up by a willingness on their part to provide the necessary information about, and access to, their nuclear activities.  That point was now close.  In pursuing the general direction endorsed earlier by the Board and the General Conference, the specific proposals had been refined and an extensive explanation of the purpose and scope of each measure had been provided.  The time had now come for point-by-point discussions between Government representatives - safeguards experts, lawyers and diplomats.  Consultations with the Secretariat, which had an important responsibility for the operation of the system, would no doubt be necessary during those discussions and the Secretariat would be ready to provide assistance.
<P>
<DD>48.	Since the protocol additional to comprehensive safeguards agreements would define the obligations to be assumed by States, it was recommended that arrangements be made to examine, adjust and finalize the draft protocol so that it met with broad support.  The explanatory document would provide a useful rationale for the proposed provisions of the protocol and an insight into how the measures would operate in practice.
<P>
<DD>49.	Some related issues still required further consideration by the Board.  Paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863 described some measures that States without comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency could take in order to strengthen safeguards in States that did have comprehensive agreements and in their own State as well.  The Secretariat would be ready, if instructed, to develop appropriate legal instruments for consideration by the Board.
<P>
<DD>50.	For several years the Board had maintained a steady momentum leading to the current proposals and that momentum should not be lost.  A committee established by the Board to refine the protocol, meeting perhaps for two weeks early in July, would help to move the full Programme 93+2 towards a timely conclusion.
<P>
<DD>51.	For a long time the Secretariat and Governments had focused on the difficulties and burdens introduced by new measures and weighed them against the better verification they were designed to bring.  The final aim of better verification and greater transparency was a higher degree of confidence between States - locally, regionally and globally - and facilitation of the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology, equipment and material.

<H3>DISCUSSION INCLUDING DECISION ON "STRENGTHENING 
THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY 
OF THE SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM: PROGRAMME 93 + 2" 
AT THE JUNE 1996 SESSION OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS</H3>
<P>
<B><I>EXCERPT FROM THE SUMMARY RECORD OF THE BOARD'S 892nd
MEETING</I>
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>58. <I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco), speaking on behalf of the African Group,
noted that he would be commenting on items 3, 4 and 5 of the agenda together, since
those items were inextricably linked to one another in the view of the African Group. 
Although the position he was about to put forward did represent the consensus
opinion of the African Group, it was, of necessity, a compromise between the differing
stances of the Group's members, who would no doubt take the opportunity of putting
forward their individual views in their own statements.
<P>
<DD>59. To begin with item 4(b) of the agenda, dealing with the strengthening of
safeguards and Programme 93+2, the African Group commended the Secretariat's
continuous efforts in conducting consultations with Member States and in preparing
high-quality documentation which promoted more constructive discussion on the
subject.  In that connection, the African continent had recently witnessed a historic
event:  the signing of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, the so-called
Pelindaba Treaty, on 11 April 1996 in Cairo, in the presence of the Agency's Director
General.  Africa was now the only nuclear-weapon-free continent where all IAEA
members were parties to the NPT, which had recently been indefinitely extended.  The
African Group thus continued to be firmly committed to the non-proliferation regime
and was happy to reiterate its general support for a reinforcement of the Agency's
safeguards that would ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and
activities.
<P>
<DD>60. That being understood, the African Group wished, first of all, to express the
strong belief that safeguards measures had to be judged from the point of view of their
acceptability as well as from that of their effectiveness.  Comprehensive safeguards
measures should therefore be applied without discrimination to all, including Member
States with voluntary and item-specific safeguards agreements based on the
INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 model.  Universality of the nuclear non-proliferation regime was the
key to enhanced compliance and to the strengthening of its political and legal
foundation.  The African Group would like to see comprehensive safeguards being
applied equally to all States in the Middle East in order to reinforce the credibility of
the safeguards system and its sustainability within a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the
region.  The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would
undoubtedly enhance the security of Africa and reinforce the viability of the African
nuclear-weapon free zone.
<P>
<DD>61. Secondly, paragraphs 4 and 5 of document INFCIRC/153 must apply
integrally and effectively to any Part 2 measures introduced under Programme 93+2. 
That meant that the Agency must do its utmost to avoid hampering the economic and
technological development of the State concerned.  It must also avoid discouraging
international co-operation in peaceful nuclear and nuclear-related activities, including
in particular the international exchange of nuclear materials.  It must further avoid
hindering peaceful nuclear and nuclear-related R&D activities, and the operation of
facilities in the inspected State.  In addition, everything possible must be done to
protect commercial and industrial secrecy and any other confidential information. 
Finally, the Agency must take due account of national security interests and limit itself
to its field of competence.  If those specific concerns were met, the African Group
would be able to adopt a positive attitude to the proposed measures for the
strengthening of safeguards and its verification regime. 
<P>
<DD>62. The African Group appreciated the work of the Department of Technical
Co-Operation and, in particular, the Africa Section.  It was also strongly committed to
the principle of equal treatment of the Agency's main activities and therefore urged the
Secretariat to take all necessary measures to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear
technology for sustainable development in Africa, bearing in mind the special need for
increased assistance to LDCs.  He stressed the importance of technical co-operation
activities in such areas as water resources and seawater desalination, measures
against desertification, rehabilitation of arid and semi-arid zones, the sterile insect
technique, food irradiation and radiation safety.  
<P>
<DD>63. All of those concerns were in full conformity with the provisions of Articles IV
and VI of the NPT.  Article IV provided that the Treaty should not affect the inalienable
right of all Parties to it to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes.  It also provided that all Parties to the Treaty should facilitate, and
had the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials
and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
Thus, the strengthening of safeguards and the enhancement of promotional activities
were closely linked. 
<P>
<DD>64. The African Group was also fully committed to the provisions of Article VI of
the Treaty, which enjoined the Parties to pursue negotiations on effective measures
relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and
effective international control.  He urged all States to comply with that injunction.
<P>
<DD>65. It was still difficult for most States to reconcile the concept of strict national
sovereignty with the idea of international monitoring.  Therefore, with a view to
enhancing the acceptability of the new safeguards system, the Director General should
be authorized to convene, two years after the adoption of the protocol additional to
comprehensive safeguards agreements and regularly thereafter, a special meeting, with
the participation of national experts and SAGSI, to assess actual implementation and
investigate possible abuses of the Programme 93+2 measures.
<P>
<DD>66. The African Group was ready to take an active and constructive part in
adapting and amending the draft protocol contained in Annex III to document
GOV/2863.  It was willing to contribute to the establishment of a new world security
order which would ban both horizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation and enhance
the prospects of a systematic and progressive programme of general and
comprehensive nuclear disarmament, while maintaining progress in the peaceful uses
of nuclear energy for socio-economic growth and sustainable development.
<P>
<DD>67. With regard to the draft programme and budget for 1997 and 1998, the
African Group was prepared to accept that, for planning reasons, it was necessary to
include appropriations for the implementation of the Part 2 measures of Programme
93+2, on the understanding that there would be no impact on assessed contributions. 
However, the Agency should strive to maintain a balance between its main activities. 
Moreover, any decision which the Board took on the budgets for 1997 and 1998
should not be allowed to prejudice its decision on Programme 93+2.  Finally, the
African Group would also adopt a flexible position with regard to the proposed
increase in the Working Capital Fund.

<B>EXCERPT FROM THE SUMMARY RECORD OF THE BOARD'S 894th
MEETING</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>27. The <I>CHAIRMAN</I> recalled that the subject had last been discussed at
the Board's series of meetings in March, when it had had before it a discussion draft
dated 27 February 1996 containing revised proposals for the implementation of
measures under complementary legal authority.  At that series of meetings, the Board,
while welcoming the revised draft and commending the Secretariat for responding
positively to several concerns expressed by Member States, had noted that some
concerns still persisted and had requested the Secretariat to take account of all
comments, and to continue consultations with Member States with a view to
submitting a formal text to the current series of meetings.
<P>
<DD>28. Since then, further extensive consultations had been held, as well as two
briefing meetings in April and May, at which the Secretariat had informed Governors
and representatives of Member States about the proposed measures contained in
document GOV/2863.  The Director General had also made additional remarks on the
item during his introductory statement.  
<P>
<DD>29. Over the past two to three years, the Secretariat and Member States had
been engaged in an extensive effort to develop measures to strengthen the safeguards
system and to make it more cost-effective.  While broad consultations and debate were
legitimate when a radical revision to a system which had been in place for over 20
years was being envisaged, it was equally true that the search for perfection could be
both elusive and time-consuming.  As the Director General had pointed out at a recent
briefing meeting, the Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Board, had probably gone as
far as it could and, in view of the frequent occasions on which the urgency of the
matter had been stressed - the most recent being at the Moscow Nuclear Safety and
Security Summit in April - the time had come for Member States to move from a
general discussion and focus on the protocol additional to comprehensive safeguards
agreements which would ultimately be the legally binding instrument.  He hoped that,
at the conclusion of its discussions, the Board would be able to take a step in that
direction.
<P>
<DD>30. <I>Mr. SIEVERING</I> (United States of America) said that the action taken -
or not taken - by the Board on the sub-item under discussion would have a lasting
impact on all States.  The real issue before the Board was not so much the
strengthening of safeguards as the strengthening of international security.
<P>
<DD>31. Ironically, it was a war which had generated the events leading to the
present discussion.  Shortly after the adoption of Security Council resolution 687
setting out the terms of the cease-fire for the Persian Gulf war, the Agency's Action
Team had found evidence that Iraq had been making consistent efforts to produce
nuclear weapons, and subsequently it had emerged that Iraq was engaged in a major
clandestine nuclear weapons programme.  In August 1995, it had been confirmed that
Iraq was at an advanced stage in its programmes for the development and deployment
of chemical and biological weapons.
<P>
<DD>32. Iraq had thus developed an almost unimaginable destructive capability.  In
the years prior to the detection of its nuclear weapons programme, Iraqi officials had
led Agency safeguards inspectors - who had been acting in accordance with the
provisions and restrictions of the safeguards system - past the Tuwaitha complex
where elements of an aggressive nuclear weapons programme had been in the
process of being actively developed.  In that same period the Agency had issued
assurances each year that all nuclear material under safeguards had been adequately
accounted for.
<P>
<DD>33. Strictly speaking, that annual assessment had been correct.  At the time, the
safeguards system had not been concerned with the possible existence of clandestine
nuclear weapons programmes.  The question now was whether the Board would take
steps to reduce the prospect of another clandestine nuclear weapons programme
catching the world unawares.  Iraq had proved that it was possible to create an
enormously destructive arsenal and a similar situation could happen again in some
country at any time.
<P>
<DD>34. The adoption and implementation of the safeguards measures proposed in
document GOV/2863 could play a central role in minimizing the possibility of a
clandestine nuclear weapons programme being pursued successfully in the future. 
There were no perfect solutions, but the proposals in question would make an
important contribution to future global security.
<P>
<DD>35. At the recent Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit, the assembled
leaders had clearly recognized the importance of the decision before the Board by
underlining the urgent need to strengthen the Agency's capabilities to detect
undeclared nuclear activities and by agreeing to work vigorously to that end.  They
had also reaffirmed their support for a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards
system along the lines proposed in Programme 93+2.  In particular, they had
recognized the need to implement comprehensive safeguards agreements designed to
provide credible assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear materials from declared
activities and of the absence of undeclared activities, in accordance with obligations
assumed under the NPT.
<P>
<DD>36. The Board had been discussing the task of strengthening the Agency's
safeguards system in response to the challenge posed by Iraq's clandestine programme
for five years.  It was over three years since SAGSI had recommended measures that it
deemed appropriate and already over a year since the Board had first approved the
general direction of Programme 93+2.  The measures proposed under Part 2 of the
Programme had already been discussed by the Board three times and had been the
subject of intensive consultations with Member States both in Vienna and in capitals. 
His delegation agreed with the Secretariat that it was now time for Member States to
discuss the matter with each other and agree on a protocol.
<P>
<DD>37. In producing document GOV/2863, the Secretariat had clearly sought to
respond as far as possible to the comments and changes put forward by Member
States, without seriously weakening the proposed measures.  His delegation
considered it an excellent document and commended the Secretariat on the quality
and breadth of the informal briefings it had recently given the Board, at which the
high quality of the background work involved in producing document GOV/2863 had
been very evident.  His delegation believed that the current package of measures was
the right one for the task at hand, and that any efforts to pare them back would only
undermine the level of assurance the package would provide.
<P>
<DD>38. The United States believed that the protocol contained in Annex III of
document GOV/2863 could be approved by the Board as a basis for negotiation.  It
reflected the measures contained in the main text and Annex II, which, together with
the Chairman's summing-up, would provide a basis for an authoritative interpretation
and additional clarification of the measures outlined in the protocol.
<P>
<DD>39. Turning to the concern of some States that the Agency should maintain a
balance in its programmes, particularly between technical co-operation and
safeguards, he said that without a broadly acceptable, effective, and adequately funded
safeguards system, the basis for all nuclear co-operation would be lost and the
Agency's technical co-operation activities would not be able to proceed with their
current ease, predictability and assurance.
<P>
<DD>40. In 1967, when the conclusion of the NPT was still in question over the issue
of universality, President Johnson had stated that the United States would not ask any
other country to accept safeguards that the United States would not accept.  That
pledge had been implemented in 1980 when the safeguards agreement concluded
between the United States and the Agency made all nuclear facilities in the United
States eligible for safeguards except those of direct national security significance.  The
Agency was currently entitled to apply safeguards to nearly 240 facilities in the United
States, and the United States was obliged to accept the same safeguards procedures at
its facilities as those that the Agency applied to similar material in similar facilities in
non-nuclear-weapon States under safeguards agreements in connection with the NPT.
<P>
<DD>41. During the current discussions, the Board should focus its attention on
strengthening comprehensive safeguards agreements, rather than addressing the issue
of whether the Programme 93+2 measures should be applied to nuclear-weapon
States party to the NPT.  However, within the framework of the non-proliferation
commitment reaffirmed at the NPT Review and Extension Conference by 175 countries,
the United States was ready to contribute actively to the strengthening of the Agency's
capacity to detect clandestine nuclear activities and willing to apply the measures
needed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards applied by the
Agency under the 1977 voluntary-offer safeguards agreement between the United
States and the Agency set out in document INFCIRC/288.  In that regard, paragraph 16
of document GOV/2863 constituted a good basis for agreement.
<P>
<DD>42. In the light of consultations it had held and would continue to hold with the
other four nuclear-weapon States on ways and means of strengthening Agency
safeguards, the United States was ready to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)   Provide the Agency with information on imports and exports of nuclear
material for peaceful purposes;  on export licences for equipment and non-nuclear
material as specified in document GOV/2863; and on such additional selected items of
nuclear-related equipment and non-nuclear material as might be determined by the
Board;
<P>
<DD>(b)   Accept the application, consistent with the obligations and objectives of
the safeguards agreement contained in document INFCIRC/288, at nuclear facilities in
the United States selected by the Agency, of measures contained in document
GOV/2863 that would enhance the effectiveness or efficiency with which the Agency
discharged its obligations under that agreement; and
<P>
<DD>(c)   Discuss with the Agency the provision of additional information that
would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of Programme
93+2, as approved by the Board, in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>43. The United States was prepared to introduce new legislation to achieve those
ends as required and hoped that the non-nuclear-weapon States without
comprehensive safeguards agreements would also be prepared to contribute to the
efficient and effective implementation of Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>44. Furthermore, his country pledged its support for the efforts to ensure that all
separated plutonium and highly-enriched uranium designated as not intended for use
in meeting defence requirements was safely stored, protected and placed under
Agency safeguards as soon as it was practical to do so.  The application of safeguards
to that and other material under the terms of the United States voluntary-offer
safeguards agreement would, in some instances, need to take account of the United
States obligation under Article I of the NPT not in any way to assist, encourage, or
induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
<P>
<DD>45. Furthermore, the United States would continue its practice of providing the
Agency with additional information it felt to be of safeguards significance, and urged
other States to do likewise.
<P>
<DD>46. <I>Mr. BENATTALLAH</I> (Algeria) said his delegation endorsed the position
taken by the Group of 77 with regard to Programme 93+2, but completely
disassociated itself from the statement made on behalf of the African Group concerning
Programme 93+2 at the previous afternoon's meeting.   He had informed the President
of the African Group in writing the previous week of his delegation's opposition to the
very principle of a joint statement as there was no consensus within the Group on
Programme 93+2.  He had expected that consultations would have continued pending
the Board's discussion of the relevant agenda item and had been astonished to hear a
statement on Programme 93+2 made on behalf of the African Group during the
discussion of the agenda item on technical co-operation - a point of procedure on
which his delegation had also not been consulted.
<P>
<DD>47. Commending the Secretariat on the high quality of document GOV/2863, he
said that he was pleased to note that the comments of Member States had been taken
into account in producing it and was grateful to the Secretariat for the efforts it had
made to promote agreement among Member States.  Further open-ended discussions
were still necessary since, despite the many assurances which had been given, it
seemed that the developing countries in particular were being asked to hand over
certain exclusive national attributes to the Agency.
<P>
<DD>48. His delegation still had difficulty in accepting Part 2 of Programme 93+2 and
the new legal instrument.  It had always believed that the Part 1 measures should be
implemented first, and their efficiency evaluated, before discussions on Part 2 were
undertaken.  The very fact that it had been suggested that Member States depart from
the sacrosanct principle of zero real growth at a later stage of the discussions of
Programme 93+2 gave a clear indication of the inherent weaknesses of any new
undertaking.  
<P>
<DD>49. Some of the technical aspects of the Programme still did not seem to allow
the developing countries enough leeway to ensure that their technological
development proceeded without undue constraints.  His delegation still had the
impression that the Secretariat wished to convert measures appropriate to exceptional
situations into regular obligations.  Furthermore, such measures would clearly not be
applied uniformly, since the nuclear-weapon States would be exempt from them.  The
principles of universality and non-discrimination would thus be called into question -
contrary to the objectives of the NPT.
<P>
<DD>50. His delegation continued to consider that the provision of information on
specific operational activities at nuclear facilities and LOFs was unjustified.  As to the
measures covering R&D activities in the industrial and technological field that did not
involve any nuclear material, they constituted an excessive expansion of the Agency's
powers and the measures covering isotope production and maintenance activities were
tantamount to interference in programmes being carried out for purely peaceful
purposes.  As for the measures dealing with information on the import and export of
specified equipment and material, the reasons for their introduction needed to be
explained further.   Algeria would also have difficulty in accepting the planned
measures dealing with the locations of disused mines or natural deposits.  It had
similar problems with unlimited no-notice access for Agency inspectors and was still
not convinced of the justification for the taking of samples at locations which had not
been designated under the protocol.
<P>
<DD>51. It was important to look at the 93+2 process in the wider context of the
international political environment in which the Agency found itself.  Firstly,
Programme 93+2 had been linked to the indefinite extension of the NPT.  That
extension was associated with a commitment to the cessation of nuclear testing within
the context of general and total disarmament negotiated in Geneva.  The prospects of
achieving that seemed limited, despite the fact that the work of the Conference on
Disarmament had recently been intensified. It was thus difficult to avoid contrasting
the ever stricter obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the developing
countries with the unfulfilled obligations on the part of the nuclear-weapon States
party to the NPT.  
<P>
<DD>52. Secondly, there was a parallel between the intrinsic imbalances in the NPT
and in  Programme 93+2 with regard to nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon
States.  Algeria had the feeling that Programme 93+2 would reproduce at Agency level
the well-known discriminatory character of the NPT - in other words, the developing
countries would once again bear the brunt of the new constrains, without receiving
any return in terms of technological development, whereas the nuclear-weapon States
party to the NPT would not be assuming any new commitments.  The difficulties in
funding technical co-operation and the wish to remove the ceiling on resources
allocated to safeguards were clear indications of the continuing existence of
discrimination.  The nuclear-weapon States which supported Programme 93+2 should
therefore set an example by announcing voluntary measures on their part in order to
improve the Programme's credibility.  Appropriate commitments by them would
constitute important confidence-building measures.  In that regard, his delegation
welcomed the offer of co-operation with the Agency that had just been made by the
Governor from the United States.
<P>
<DD>53. Thirdly, the refusal of one country in the region of the Middle East to accede
to the NPT and to associate itself with the international community's efforts to establish
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region, could not be dissociated from its eloquent
silence with respect to Programme 93+2.  There was clearly a source of nuclear
proliferation in that region which needed to be dealt with in the context of the
strengthening of the non-proliferation regime.  All the evidence suggested that the
country in question had a clandestine nuclear programme that threatened regional and
international security.  Algeria would have liked to see the same energy devoted to
uncovering that clandestine programme as had been applied in the case of Iraq.
<P>
<DD>54. Lastly, with regard to the role played by international public opinion when it
came to matters as important as Programme 93+2, he said that whatever the views of
the public might be in other countries, public opinion in Arab States was certainly not
in favour of a regime which promoted double standards.
<P>
<DD>55. In conclusion, his delegation reiterated its willingness to take part in a
responsible effort to achieve a consensus and endorsed the mechanism recommended
in paragraph 78 of document GOV/2863.  He pointed out however that that acceptance
was without prejudice to his delegation's subsequent position and that it would be
necessary to ensure the mechanism's universality and to define its objectives.  As to
the committee established to review the protocol, its mandate should be to agree on
the broad outline of the protocol and its composition should be based on the principle
of universality.   
<P>
<DD>56. <I>Mr. WALKER</I> (Canada) said that the proposals contained in document
GOV/2863 represented the culmination of an intensive, time-consuming and difficult
process.  The Board had undertaken such a process because it had recognized that,
after the events in Iraq and the DPRK, the Agency's safeguards system was not
sufficient to enable the detection of clandestine nuclear weapons programmes in States
with comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<DD>57. Equally important, the Board had recognized that there was the possibility of
achieving very significant reductions in the number of nuclear weapons for the first
time since the beginning of the nuclear age.  Further development of the Agency's
safeguards system was essential to achieving significant nuclear disarmament.  The
current system, which focused on States with comprehensive agreements, was
designed to coexist with a regime in which the nuclear-weapon States counted upon
very large numbers of nuclear weapons in order to maintain their security.  However,
in order to bring about significant reductions in the nuclear arsenal, it was necessary
to develop not only the scope - in other words ultimately to include the
nuclear-weapon States - but also the very nature of safeguards.  They would have to
be able to provide much more assurance about the non-existence of clandestine
nuclear weapons programmes than they did at present.
<P>
<DD>58. That larger picture needed to be kept in mind in taking decisions on the
proposals outlined in document GOV/2863, particularly when the discussion shifted
from the political to the industrial arena.
<P>
<DD>59. Canada, like other States with large nuclear sectors, needed to keep its
nuclear industry fully apprised of the significance of Programme 93+2 and to allay any
concerns that might arise.  The Government and the nuclear industry needed to work
together in those countries in order to determine how Programme 93+2 could, through
its reduced emphasis on material accounting as the sole touchstone of Agency
safeguards, help lighten the load on the nuclear industry.
<P>
<DD>60. The broader picture should not be incompatible with the interests of the
nuclear industry, which could only benefit from a programme that enhanced both the
efficiency and the effectiveness of safeguards.  Furthermore, particularly in the long
term, it could only benefit if, on the basis of expanded information and increased
access appropriately designed to maintain commercial confidentiality, the Agency was
able to offer much more categorical assurance regarding the non-existence of a
clandestine nuclear weapons programme and if an approach were adopted that placed
less emphasis on simple material accountancy and was less tied to the size of a
country's peaceful nuclear programme.
<P>
<DD>61. The measures outlined in document GOV/2863 represented a solid basis for
consensus and it was time to move to the negotiation of the protocol.  The draft
protocol proposed by the Secretariat and the proposed measures for implementation
under complementary legal authority contained in document GOV/2863 should be
taken as the basis for those negotiations.
<P>
<DD>62. In recent months, Canada had largely resolved the problems it had been
experiencing with certain measures.  However, it still had difficulties with the Agency's
request for access to information on research related to the nuclear fuel cycle that did
not involve nuclear material, on which Canada did not currently collect information.  It
also had difficulty with the Agency's requirement for data on imports of nuclear
equipment or material, since Canada considered that it already provided sufficient
export data.  It should be possible to resolve those issues without a loss of the
information required to give credible assurances of the absence of relevant undeclared
activities.  A number of other features of the proposals relating to broader access to
information and to increased physical access would require fine tuning during
discussions on the protocol.
<P>
<DD>63. His delegation was convinced of the need to address such concerns within
the framework of document GOV/2863 and within the spirit of the decision taken by
the Board in 1992 when it reaffirmed the requirement that Agency safeguards should
provide assurance as to the correctness and completeness of nuclear material
declarations made by States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.  The
negotiations on the protocol should be used to fine tune the proposals and find an
appropriate legal formulation for them.
<P>
<DD>64. <I>Mr. INDELICATO</I> (Italy)<A HREF="#note_1">*</A>, speaking on behalf of the European Union,
Cyprus, Malta, and the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, noted that
in the year that had elapsed since the Agency had submitted to the Board the first
draft of a comprehensive programme for strengthening the effectiveness and improving
the efficiency of the safeguards system, both the Agency and Member States had
continued to work actively on Part 2 of the Programme and the European Union had
begun implementing the measures contained in Part 1.
<P>
<DD>65. The European Union and associated countries acknowledged that in order to
strengthen the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities it was necessary
to provide it with broader access to information and increased physical access to sites
of concern, when that was necessary to resolve questions and inconsistencies, and
also to provide for environmental monitoring outside declared sites.  They therefore
reaffirmed their strong support for the Agency's general approach and considered that
the adoption of the Part 2 measures would grant the Agency the necessary powers to
perform the role envisaged for it in the conclusions of the 1995 NPT Review and
Extension Conference and its decision on the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear
Non-proliferation and Disarmament.  They also believed that the Agency was the only
institution which could fulfil the task in a non-discriminatory manner and in the
interests of all concerned.
<P>
<DD>66. In that regard, it was important to strike the right balance between the
necessary strengthening of the effectiveness of the safeguards system and the
domestic impact of the new measures in the Agency's Member States, taking full
account of all the constitutional and legal implications of those measures.  
<P>
<DD>67. The process of preparing Programme 93+2 had shown that it was impossible
for the safeguards system to treat each State as a self-contained entity.  The time had
therefore come for all Member States to provide active support for the safeguards
system in accordance with their various international commitments.  Countries not
having comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency should play their part
in the Programme 93+2 exercise and the current consultations among the
nuclear-weapon States were therefore very welcome.  Other States without
comprehensive safeguards agreements should also consider how they too might
contribute to the effective implementation of Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>68. As a general principle, the Agency should be allowed appropriate access in
order to follow up questions and inconsistencies in connection with the information
provided in a State's Expanded Declaration.  In cases where national security, safety
and commercial sensitivity were involved, there should be provision for the State to
offer alternative means of resolving such questions and inconsistencies.  In that regard,
it was to be hoped that the Agency would make a thorough evaluation of the situation
in the State concerned and only resort to complementary access if a question or
inconsistency identified and then confirmed by the Agency's internal assessment
procedures could not be resolved through direct contacts with the authorities of that
State.  Such internal consideration by the Agency, which should not delay the
activities in question, would help to ensure that complementary access was not
granted on the basis of mistaken information or a false alarm.  Moreover, it would
avoid unnecessary extra work for the Agency and the risk of the inappropriate use of
increased access.  Such internal consideration should never lead to mechanical and
systematic verification of information provided in the Expanded Declaration.  The
occurrence of false alarms should be acknowledged by the Agency and reported to all
the parties to the safeguards agreement, so as to avoid uncontrolled consequences.
<P>
<DD>69. He noted the Secretariat's proposal not to include dual-use items in the
protocol as a category on which information relating to transfers was required, and
also the comments in paragraph 51(g) of document GOV/2863.  The addition of the
words "where available" in connection with information on imports and exports
provided States with the necessary flexibility by not requiring them to provide
information that they were unable to obtain. 
<P>
<DD>70. It was understandable that the Agency would need to update the lists of
items contained in the proposals.  Those lists should be selective, the criteria for the
inclusion of new items in the lists should be clearly stated, and, after the approval of
such additions, a legal instrument should be concluded between the Agency and each
Member State in order to amend the additional protocol as far as the lists were
concerned.
<P>
<DD>71. Once it had decided that complementary access was necessary, the Agency
should inform the State concerned and provide the reasons why access was being
sought.  Twenty-four hours' notice of the intention to proceed to complementary access
was a reasonable time.  As to the definition of sites, the perimeter of any site should
be determined through collaboration between the State and the Agency, following a
proposal made by the State.
<P>
<DD>72. Reference to paragraphs 87-89 of document INFCIRC/153 should be included
in the protocol in order to ensure the harmonization of the modalities for conducting
inspections, in particular the provisions that inspections must not interfere with the
operation of facilities and that a State should have the right to have the inspectors
accompanied by its representatives, provided that the work of the Agency was not
delayed or impeded.  
<P>
<DD>73. It should be clearly stated that the activities that the Agency was entitled to
carry out during complementary access should be directly connected with the content
of the Expanded Declaration - in other words, limited to visual observation, the
interviewing of personnel, access to records, environmental sampling, and any other
mutually agreed objective measures for resolving the uncertainties that prompted the
need for complementary access.  The distinction between inspections carried out under
INFCIRC/153-type agreements and visits carried out under the additional protocol
should be emphasized.
<P>
<DD>74. The State concerned had the right to expect confidentiality with regard to
information and sensitive facilities.  The same confidentiality should apply to the
Agency's findings after complementary access inspections and those findings should be
reported to the State concerned in the interests of transparency.  The protection of
confidentiality should be considered together with the general concept of managed
access (Article 6 of the draft additional protocol) and paragraph 8 of document
INFCIRC/153.
<P>
<DD>75. The exact role of EURATOM in the implementation of the new measures
would have to be defined by the European Union once it became clear which Part 2
measures of Programme 93+2 had been accepted.
<P>
<DD>76. The provision in the additional protocol for subsidiary arrangements to be
concluded pursuant to paragraph 40 of document INFCIRC/153 was a valid one.  The
State should retain the right to require the Agency to negotiate subsidiary
arrangements and to specify in detail how the procedure for complementary access set
out in the protocol was to be applied, in particular so as to ensure the protection of
sensitive information.  
<P>
<DD>77. The European Union and associated countries took note of the fact that an
enlarged safeguards system would result, at least initially, in increased costs. 
However, it trusted that, as the measures became established, the savings that were
expected to accrue would lead to the envisaged cost neutrality as soon as possible.  
<P>
<DD>78. In the light of those comments, the European Union and associated countries
would welcome the establishment by the Board of an open-ended committee with the
mandate of drafting a model additional protocol which reflected the common
responsibility of all States for universal non-proliferation and for strengthening the
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system.  The basis for its
work should be the proposals contained in document GOV/2863 and the draft
additional protocol contained in Annex III of that document, with due account being
taken of the Board's discussions.  States without comprehensive safeguards agreements
should accept those measures of Programme 93+2 which were relevant to them in the
light of their respective non-proliferation commitments.  The open-ended committee
should report on its work to the Board's December meetings and, if possible, submit a
draft model protocol.
<P>
<DD>79. In conclusion, he said that the comments on behalf of the European Union
and associated countries had been made in a spirit of co-operation, with a view to
facilitating the finalization of a high-profile document, which they hoped would enable
the Agency to overcome the danger of nuclear proliferation.
<P>
<DD>80. <I>Mr. de OURO-PRETO</I> (Brazil) said that while his delegation welcomed
some of the changes made in document GOV/2863, it still had serious difficulties with
the text.
<P>
<DD>81. Firstly, he wondered how the Secretariat had arrived at the figure of
approximately 200 person-days given in paragraph 21 of document GOV/2863 as the
cost of implementing the complementary activities in 1997.  How could assumptions
be made regarding the number of States bound by the additional protocol in 1997, or
in any other year for that matter?  The additional protocol was a legally binding
instrument which had to pass through the national legislative processes of many
countries prior to entry into force.  Any predictions regarding the date of
implementation were thus mere speculation.
<P>
<DD>82. With regard to the entry into force of the protocol, his delegation was also
concerned to avoid a situation where the protocol was implemented with respect to a
few countries, while for the majority of States with full-scope safeguards agreements it
had not yet entered into force.  That would add - over and above the existing
discrimination between nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States - a further
discrimination among non-nuclear-weapon States that were parties to full-scope
safeguards agreements.  One solution might be to require that additional protocols
entered into force only after a certain number of States, perhaps 50 or 60, had become
parties to the protocol.   That was a widely used clause in international treaties and,
while not a perfect solution, it would greatly alleviate the additional discrimination
factor.  In view of the above, his delegation could not agree to the procedure outlined
in paragraph 13 of document GOV/2863.  
<P>
<DD>83. While document INFCIRC/153, the basis for present full-scope safeguards
agreements, did not follow any such implementation procedure, there were treaties,
notably the NPT, which enjoined States Party to conclude safeguards agreements with
the Agency.  Any party to the NPT which did not enter into such an agreement was in
violation of the Treaty.

<P>
<DD>84. There was at present no international legal instrument requiring States to
conclude a protocol additional to comprehensive safeguards agreements with the
Agency in order to provide the Agency with the means to detect undeclared activities. 
Indeed, from a strictly legal point of view, it was questionable whether Programme
93+2 could be incorporated as a protocol to a safeguards agreement in connection
with the NPT, Article III of which stated, inter alia, "The safeguards required by this
Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful
nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out
under its control anywhere."   No reference was made to any of the items or activities
listed in Article 16 of the proposed draft additional protocol.  Legal experts would have
to find a way out of that apparent legal inconsistency.
<P>
<DD>85. While welcoming the useful information provided by the Secretariat in
paragraph 34 of document GOV/2863 on the Agency's procedure for dealing internally
with inconsistencies and anomalies, his delegation objected to the use of the word
"questions" in addition to "inconsistencies".  His delegation was not opposed, in
principle, to the idea of requesting expanded access in order to resolve significant
inconsistencies, provided that was clearly stated in the final legal instrument. 
"Inconsistency" was a meaningful concept - perhaps in need of some further definition
- but "question" was too vague and would create rather than solve problems.
<P>
<DD>86. It was clear that implementation of Programme 93+2 would increase the
discrimination inherent in the NPT between nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon
States.  It was extremely difficult for many of the latter to accept such a state of affairs
and significant steps would have to be taken to compensate for that discrimination. 
His delegation therefore welcomed the last paragraph on page 26 of document
GOV/2863, in which the Secretariat stated that it was prepared to develop proposals
imposing legal obligations on nuclear-weapon States and on States with
INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type agreements.  The Secretariat should not confine its proposals to
information on the export and import of nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material
specified in document GOV/2629 and should seek innovative solutions in other areas
to reduce the imbalance.  His delegation would like the Secretariat to present those
proposals to the next series of Board meetings.
<P>
<DD>87. Paragraph 48 of document GOV/2863 touched on the question of
confidentiality.  As a result of the implementation of Part 2 of Programme 93+2, the
Agency would have access to extremely sensitive technological and commercial
information.  In that regard, his delegation welcomed the Secretariat's commitment to
continue reviewing the Agency's procedures and practices for meeting the obligation
contained in paragraph 5 of document INFCIRC/153.  The Secretariat should put
forward proposals arising from that review. Any such proposals should contemplate
measures for new and more rigid criteria for the selection of inspectors, as well as
ways and means of imposing administrative and penal sanctions against an inspector,
or other member of staff, in the event of a leak of sensitive information.  It was
therefore extremely difficult for his delegation to agree to at least some of the
procedures outlined in paragraph 72, although it had no objection to independent
direct communications between the field and Headquarters, provided the relevant laws
and regulations were respected.
<P>
<DD>88. His delegation still felt that the wording of the proposed additional protocol
was extremely vague compared with the rest of the document.  He hoped that, in
preparing the protocol, account would be taken of the need to ensure a proper balance
between the rights and obligations of the Agency and those of States.
<P>
<DD>89. Brazil also still harboured serious misgivings with respect to certain technical
issues.  With regard to the Expanded Declaration, the level and degree of information
to be provided as defined in paragraph 51(a) of document GOV/2863 were not
sufficiently precise.  It should not be forgotten that information was being requested on
such commercially sensitive items as Zircaloy, carbon fibres, material resistant to
uranium hexafluoride and power lasers.
<P>
<DD>90. With regard to paragraph 51(c) the term "site" should be defined more
clearly. It had to be recognized that a site to be reported to the Agency might not
conform to the perimeter of the entire installation.  For example, a laboratory with
nuclear material might be surrounded by a vast industrial complex not engaged - even
remotely - in nuclear-related activities.
<P>
<DD>91. In connection with paragraph 51(d) on the provision of data on specified
equipment, the question arose as to the degree of detail and order of magnitude. 
Given the sensitivity of the data, information which was too precise would cause great
difficulties.  General information of a high order of magnitude might provide a possible
solution.  The provision of extremely sensitive commercial and technological
information was one of the most important issues for many countries, including his
own.
<P>
<DD>92. As to paragraph 51(f), he reiterated his delegation's view that the measures
proposed represented a change in the starting point of safeguards.  The fact that the
existing accounting and control measures would presumably not be applied in full did
not alter the basic question, which should be appropriately addressed.
<P>
<DD>93. Paragraph 52 also posed questions as to the degree of information required. 
Sometimes plans were shelved on account of budgetary constraints.  The provision
assumed that States had well-defined plans for the development of their nuclear
activities, which was not always the case.  He wondered whether it was more useful
for safeguards purposes to have information which changed periodically - sometimes
radically - or a very general description of a country's intentions, without any degree
of certainty.
<P>
<DD>94. Environmental sampling, if applied judiciously, could be a very effective and
non-intrusive technique in helping to detect non-declared nuclear activities.  However,
further elaboration on how such samples were to be collected and utilized was
required.  Criteria should be established for the application of environmental sampling
in the safeguards strategy for each type of installation and for the country as a whole. 
Criteria should also be defined for the selection of points where sampling was to take
place.  Another important point was that the country inspected should have within its
territory a laboratory for analysing samples under similar conditions to those of the
Agency's laboratory.  If that proved impossible, experts from the country concerned
should be able to follow the analysis.  While the results of environmental sampling
could give a good indication of the existence of undeclared activities, they did not
provide absolute proof.
<P>
<DD>95. With regard to increased access, it was clear that not all, if any, of the
information provided in the Expanded Declaration would be subject to verification. 
The activities listed in Article 16 of the draft additional protocol were extremely
sensitive from all - including the proliferation - points of view.  If granted, broader
access should be made conditional upon the need to resolve significant inconsistencies
which could not otherwise be resolved. In view of the sensitivity of the information
involved, his country was totally opposed to the examination of records and the use of
other objective methods that had been demonstrated to be technically feasible as they
provided no guarantee with respect to the legitimate rights of States regarding the
protection of commercial and industrial secrets.
<P>
<DD>96. Paragraph 61(d), which provided the Agency with access anywhere for the
purpose of environmental sampling, was unacceptable.  What was being proposed was
the trivialization of special inspections which should, as the name indicated, remain
special.
<P>
<DD>97. His delegation considered that the appropriate mechanism for finalizing the
required legal instrument would be a working group or committee with a broad
mandate enabling it to take into account all the views expressed at the present and at
previous meetings of the Board.  It should be capable of discussing in depth all the
relevant issues with no time restraint.  For its part, Brazil was prepared to contribute
constructively to the work of such a body.
<P>
<DD>98. <I>Mr. EL-FEKI</I> (Egypt) said his country continued to attach great importance to
non-proliferation issues and to the Agency's role in that regard.  Document GOV/2863
demonstrated the need to develop proposals which struck the desired balance
between strengthening of safeguards, on the one hand, and meeting the political and
technical requirements of Member States, on the other.  Egyptian experts had taken
part in the informal briefings held on 20 and 21 May 1996, at which they had
commented on the proposals contained in document GOV/2863.  Those comments and
the ones that he was about to make stemmed from the desire to attain a common
objective and he trusted that they would be taken into consideration.
<P>
<DD>99. Strengthening of the safeguards system should be non-discriminatory.  One
of the most important aims was expansion of the scope of application in order to
achieve universality.  The Agency's proposals should not focus solely on
comprehensive safeguards agreements, as that would lead to an imbalance between
the obligations of Member States that were party to the NPT and those that were not. 
Furthermore, increasing the commitments of States with comprehensive safeguards
agreements might discourage other States from concluding such agreements.
<P>
<DD>100. The proposals contained in document GOV/2863 involved important legal
and technical aspects.  The Board of Governors should therefore adopt a cautious
approach and not rush into making a final decision - sufficient time should be allowed
to attain maximum support from Member States for the proposals.   Once Board
approval had been given to Part 2 of Programme 93+2, implementation could begin on
an experimental and voluntary basis so that the practical difficulties encountered could
be evaluated.
<P>
<DD>101. Equal support should be given to all components of the non-proliferation
regime.  The NPT Review and Extension Conference had highlighted four other
avenues for enhancing nuclear non-proliferation:  conclusion of a comprehensive test
ban treaty, initiatives to stop the production of fissile material, progress in nuclear
disarmament and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
It was incumbent upon the parties to the NPT to make progress along those lines.  His
delegation trusted that appropriate international support would be given.
<P>
<DD>102. Egypt intended to make a positive contribution to the further study of the
details of the Part 2 proposals.  There was a need to minimize, or prevent, the
strengthened system from intruding into non-nuclear-related fields.  Some materials in
the nuclear fuel cycle were commonly used in non-nuclear industries, such as the
energy, petroleum and chemical industries.  In addition, dual-use equipment had
important applications in non-nuclear industries and research.  Expanding the scope of
safeguards to encompass R&D activities in nuclear and related fields would mean
extending State and Agency control to the programmes of universities and research
centres, thereby placing onerous financial, administrative and legislative burdens on
those institutions to the extent of possibly hampering R&D activities.
<P>
<DD>103. In conclusion, he said that the final text of Part 2 of Programme 93+2 should
include innovative solutions and additional assurances with regard to preserving
industrial, defence, commercial and technological confidentiality and certain ambiguous
terms should be clarified.
<P>
<DD>104. <I>Mr. LEE Seung Kon</I> (Republic of Korea), having acknowledged the efforts
made by the Secretariat in finalizing the proposals contained in document GOV/2863,
said that the inclusion in that document of a summary in paragraph 9 of the activities
undertaken in implementation of the Part 1 measures had been useful.  His country
had always supported the strengthening of the safeguards system in order to achieve a
safer and more peaceful security environment.  Thus, it had actively participated in the
preparation of the Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2 by making facilities available
in Korea for environmental monitoring field trials and had also participated in baseline
environmental sampling in 1996.  The Republic of Korea would be one of the few
countries affected to an appreciable extent by implementation of the Part 2 measures. 
It was, however, willing to accommodate that extra burden in the interests of global
non-proliferation.
<P>
<DD>105. Part 2 measures would take effect only after each individual Member State had
signed or ratified the additional protocol.  It was important to take into consideration
the concerns of individual Member States, provided they did not affect the main thrust
of the strengthening measures.  It was also essential to maintain a spirit of
co-operation and to avoid confrontation under all circumstances.  
<P>
<DD>106. Since the Part 2 measures aimed both to improve the efficiency of the
safeguards system and to strengthen its effectiveness, a balance between efficiency
and effectiveness was required.  The Secretariat should explore the concept of a
"trade-off" between intrusiveness and the frequency of inspections.  States which bore
an extra burden from Part 2 measures should be allowed to benefit from a
readjustment of inspection frequency at low proliferation risk facilities.
<P>
<DD>107. While he welcomed the fact that the information to be provided by Member
States under the Expanded Declaration had become more specific in its contents and
scope and that vagueness in the definition of site had also been clarified, he noted
that there was still room for further clarification in the draft proposals contained in
document GOV/2863. 
<P>
<DD>108. With regard to paragraphs 68 and 70, his delegation was in favour of granting
complementary access only when there was an inconsistency or a question in order to
avoid wasting the Secretariat's limited resources and causing unnecessary obstruction
to the normal functioning of the facilities concerned.  Similarly, environmental
sampling at locations other than nuclear and nuclear-related sites, as described in
paragraph 53, should be sought only when an inconsistency or a question arose.  
<P>
<DD>109. Information on the export and import of nuclear equipment, non-nuclear
material, and nuclear-related dual-use items would increase transparency and
confidence that those items were being used only for peaceful purposes.  Such
measures would, however, only be effective if States which did not have
comprehensive safeguards agreements - including nuclear-weapon States -
participated.  That would be a step towards a more universal non-proliferation system
and a move away from the present partial non-proliferation system.  The Secretariat
should develop a legally binding agreement to make that a formal obligation.
<P>
<DD>110. His delegation fully supported the idea, proposed in paragraph 78, of
establishing an appropriate mechanism to finalize the legal instrument and looked
forward to participating actively in that work.  It would, however, be important to
define carefully the work of that mechanism in order to avoid renewed discussion on
aspects on which agreement had already been reached.  A reasonable time frame
should also be allowed so as to avoid any unexpected prolongation.  
<P>
<DD>111. <I>Mr. WALKER</I> (Australia) said that much progress had been made to
strengthen the safeguards regime under Programme 93+2, and the extent of
agreement already reached should not be underestimated.  If international confidence
in the safeguards system was to be maintained, it needed to be continuously adapted
to meet contemporary proliferation concerns and updated to give it the capacity to
detect undeclared activities and to improve its efficiency.  There were at least four
reasons why that was essential:  firstly, Agency safeguards provided both a warning of
and a disincentive to the spread of nuclear weapons and were therefore nothing short
of vital to global security; secondly, strengthened safeguards were a prerequisite for
the climate of confidence needed for accelerated progress in reducing nuclear arsenals
and moving towards complete nuclear disarmament; thirdly, the safeguards system,
strengthened by measures to enhance the transparency to the Agency of States'
nuclear activities along the lines envisioned in Programme 93+2, could make a major
contribution to regional security and peace and it was no accident that regions of
endemic tension and insecurity were also those where full-scope Agency safeguards
were not applied in all countries; and fourthly, full-scope safeguards which were up to
date and as effective as possible were a necessary basis for international co-operation
and trade in nuclear materials and technology for the benefit of all countries.
<P>
<DD>112.  Australia was not alone in considering that strengthened safeguards were
absolutely essential to fundamental national, regional and international security
requirements - the strengthening of safeguards had almost universal support, as
expressed unambiguously at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.
<P>
<DD>113. Discussions of Programme 93+2 and related field trials had been in progress for
almost three years, and it was time for the Board to adopt the very reasonable package
of measures proposed.  Document GOV/2863 was a good basis for moving towards
implementation of strengthened safeguards.  Member States had had ample
opportunity to contribute to the substance of the measures and there was now
consensus on the vast majority of them.  Any remaining concerns could be addressed
by a drafting group of technical and legal experts mandated to finalize the protocol
giving effect to the measures.  Such a group could refine the measures further in
response to the legitimate concerns of States, but his country would have serious
difficulties with any significant weakening of the essential provisions related to
reporting and access contained in document GOV/2863, which in many instances
represented compromise positions reached after extensive consultations.
<P>
<DD>114. During the negotiations to draft the model safeguards agreement contained in
document INFCIRC/153, many States had expressed concern about the intrusive and
burdensome nature of its obligations, but most of those concerns had proved to be
greatly exaggerated.  He was confident that the Part 2 measures would not impose
excessive or unreasonable burdens on States, nor would they impede economic and
other development.  They represented an effective balance of the various elements
needed to enhance the safeguards regime, and the initial cost and inconvenience of
implementing the Part 2 measures would be small compared to the benefits in terms of
reliable assurances about undeclared activities.
<P>
<DD>115. Australia was conscious of the concern that the Part 2 measures should, as far
as possible, be universal in application and not impose a disproportionate burden on
non-nuclear-weapon States with significant nuclear industries.  That was an
understandable preoccupation and he agreed with the Governor from the United States
that States should accept for themselves the controls that they wished others to accept. 
The nuclear-weapon States should therefore accept as many of the measures in
Programme 93+2 as could be justified in their circumstances.  Their acceptance of
legal obligations in that regard would be a very helpful response to the concerns
raised.  States Party to the NPT all had a duty to ensure that their obligations under
the Treaty were given effect internationally and domestically.
<P>
<DD>116. Australia did not accept that the proposed measures for additional access were
appropriate only to resolve inconsistencies, since such an approach might make them
less effective in detecting undeclared nuclear materials or activities.
<P>
<DD>117. The issue of what standard to apply to the requirement to declare
nuclear-related research and development activities that were not owned, funded or
authorized by the State had also been raised as a concern.  His delegation believed
that, in line with the obligation in Article III.(2) of the NPT to exercise control over the
export of equipment especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or
production of special fissionable material, States should accept an obligation to use all
reasonable efforts to declare all research and development activities related to the
most sensitive parts of the fuel cycle, even where nuclear material was not present.  In
order to exercise effective control, States should also control the possession of
especially designed or prepared items and the associated technology.  Furthermore,
such control was plainly essential in order to ensure compliance with the obligation in
Article II of the NPT not to acquire nuclear weapons.
<P>
<DD>118. Failure to include an activity of which the State was unaware in the Expanded
Declaration should not be considered as a breach of the State's commitments if the
State had acted in good faith.  However, taking all reasonable measures to identify and
declare the activities concerned could not be limited to taking only measures that were
permitted by existing laws and regulations.  Such an approach would be unacceptable
as it could lead to an uneven and discriminatory implementation of Programme 93+2,
and could ultimately provide an avenue for abuse if a State were to pass very
restrictive legislation.
<P>
<DD>119. He was confident that those and other concerns could be accommodated,
particularly if States bore in mind their overriding interests in achieving a strengthened
safeguards system.  Document GOV/2863 set out the general objectives which the
Board should now move to adopt as the basis for the new safeguards system.  The
technical and legal drafting group would provide an opportunity to find precise
wording to achieve the balance between the legitimate commercial and constitutional
interests of individual States and the interest of the international community in
securing a strengthened safeguards system.
<P>
<DD>120. <I>Mr. MINTY</I> (South Africa), having noted that a great deal of time and
energy had been invested in the present issue, said that the whole question should be
viewed in the context of global disarmament and non-proliferation.  There had been
substantial progress in that area - the most significant event since the March Board
being the signing of the Pelindaba Treaty establishing an African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.  Four of the nuclear-weapon States had already signed
the Protocol to the Treaty, and the fifth would be signing shortly.  On behalf of the
South African Government, he thanked the Director General for his initiative in
arranging a special briefing for African Governments in Cairo on 12 April 1996, which
all had found very useful.
<P>
<DD>121. Turning to the measures proposed under Programme 93+2, he reminded
Member States that South Africa had already gone through a more intensive exercise
in terms of safeguards inspections than the measures currently proposed and that
paragraph 11 of the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and
Disarmament that had been agreed at the NPT Review and Extension Conference
expressed support for strengthening the effectiveness of Agency safeguards and
increasing its capability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  The Agency was in a
sense the trustee of the safeguards system and all Member States had an obligation to
help it discharge its responsibilities on behalf of the international community.  There
was no doubt about the commitment to strengthen safeguards and Member States
should now identify and address the remaining areas of disagreement so that
implementation of the Part 2 measures could begin.  The goal was to ensure that all
States concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements, and every effort should be
made to build the necessary confidence which would enable them to do so.
<P>
<DD>122. Document GOV/2863, which was a much-improved version of the previous
Discussion Draft II, showed the rationale behind the proposed measures much more
clearly and many of the concerns of Member States, including specific suggestions for
improvements, had been addressed, including the concerns of his own country.  The
remaining problems of some States included the degree of intrusion entailed, the
increased cost of implementation and the potential for leaks of commercially sensitive
information.  The briefing meeting organized by the Secretariat in May had also been
helpful in clarifying some outstanding issues.  However, his delegation still had some
comments for further refinements to the document, which could perhaps be considered
during the process of finalizing the protocol.
<P>
<DD>123. South Africa continued to recommend a system of site-specific arrangements at
sites with nuclear material where it was anticipated that complementary access would
often be requested.  Those arrangements could be on the basis of a standing
agreement introduced in the subsidiary arrangements or on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
<DD>124. It was not clear how the results and conclusions of complementary access
would be reported to the States concerned and whether that needed to be specified in
the protocol.  No provision was explicitly made in either the Expanded Declaration or
the protocol for the Agency to provide an explanation of the reasons for or purpose of
the request for complementary access.  As different types of complementary access
were foreseen, such provision would ensure a non-confrontational situation which
would facilitate the application of the new measures.
<P>
<DD>125. His delegation supported the recommendations in paragraphs 74-78 of
document GOV/2863 and the Director General's proposal that the appropriate
mechanism referred to should be a meeting of suitably qualified legal and technical
experts, as well as diplomats, to examine in detail how the draft protocol could be
shaped and adjusted so as to accommodate the remaining concerns as far as possible. 
His delegation hoped that the meeting of experts would be very specific in identifying
problematic wording and that it would make specific proposals for improvements
where there was disagreement.  A perfect document was not possible and the group of
experts should concentrate on building on what had been achieved so far.
<P>
<DD>126. Finally, he noted that his country's Foreign Minister had issued a statement
expressing regret at the recent nuclear test conducted by the People's Republic of
China.
<P>
<DD>127. <I>Mr. MAZILU</I> (Romania), having endorsed the statement made by the
representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union and associated countries, said
that his country had constantly supported the Director General's efforts to make the
safeguards system more effective and more efficient.  In particular, it had encouraged
the preparation and the implementation of the Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2
and was prepared to start implementation of the Part 2 measures.
<P>
<DD>128. The disclosure of clandestine nuclear programmes, the increasing number of
facilities and the growing amount of nuclear material placed under safeguards had
shown that it was necessary to take action to ensure accurate detection of any
undeclared nuclear material, facilities and activities.  An effective safeguards system
could also help to avoid inaccurate official or unofficial views and statements on very
sensitive issues such as violations of the NPT, on the basis of which unfounded
accusations might be spread.
<P>
<DD>129. His delegation believed that Programme 93+2 provided the basis for a
significantly strengthened and more efficient safeguards system.  Integrated
implementation of all the proposed measures was necessary in order to ensure
maximum effectiveness.  However, he noted that the additional costs required for
environmental sample analysis, implementation of advanced technology and the
application of safeguards to nuclear material removed from military programmes in
nuclear-weapon States might hamper efforts to introduce the proposed new safeguards
measures under Programme 93+2.  Some other issues were still causing concern to
various Member States.  As the ultimate success of the Programme was largely
dependent on the number of Member States participating in the system, increased
attention should be paid to the issues of universality, confidentiality, and broader
access to R&D facilities under private ownership.
<P>
<DD>130. To resolve those issues, it would be appropriate to set up an open-ended
committee under the efficient chairmanship of the Board's Chairman to identify
mutually acceptable solutions upon which consensus could be reached.
<P>
<DD>131. For its part, his Government had already embarked on new measures under the
Programme, including the modification of the general part of its subsidiary
arrangements for the early provision of design information; participation in the
reporting scheme; and the application of the simplified designation procedures for
safeguards inspectors.  Romania's commitment to the implementation of both parts of
Programme 93+2 as an integrated package demonstrated its full transparency and
determination to develop only the peaceful applications of nuclear science and
technology.
<P>
<DD>132. <I>Mr. KASEMSARN</I> (Thailand) having welcomed the Declaration of the
Nuclear Safety and Security Summit, which, inter alia, supported the strengthening of
the Agency's safeguards system, reiterated his country's support for Programme 93+2,
but noted that the Programme's success depended upon it being equitably applied to
all Member States.
<P>
<DD>133. With regard to the proposal for increased access at nuclear facilities and LOFs,
he said that requests for such access should provide clear justifications and the
mechanism and procedures for such access should be agreed upon by all Member
States.
<P>
<DD>134. Lastly, he endorsed the establishment of a drafting group of experts in order to
finalize the draft protocol.
<P>
<DD>135.  <I>Mr. AL-GHAIS</I> (Kuwait) praised the Agency's efforts to strengthen the
effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system and noted that the
Board now had a unique opportunity to fill in the gaps in the present system which
had allowed countries such as Iraq and the DPRK to build their clandestine nuclear
programmes.  In conformity with the recommendations of the 1995 NPT Review and
Extension Conference, which had called for the strengthening of the Agency's efforts to
improve safeguards and an increase in its capability to detect undeclared nuclear
activities, he hoped that the Board would be able to agree on the Part 2 measures.
<P>
<DD>136.  While appreciating the reference in paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863 to the
areas in which States without comprehensive safeguards agreements could make a
contribution, he pointed out that it was essential to ensure the comprehensive and
international nature of the system.  In that connection, he urged all those States which
had not yet acceded to the NPT to do so as soon as possible.  Such a move would also
promote the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones.
<P>
<DD>137.      With regard to the confidentiality of commercially or technically sensitive
information, he noted that paragraph 48 provided assurances in that respect and that
the Agency's procedures and practices for meeting that obligation would continue to be
subject to review in order to ensure their appropriateness and effectiveness.
<P>
<DD>138.   With reference to the expected increase in the costs of implementing the
Programme, although the Secretariat had indicated that the cost increases would even
out after some years, he urged it to reduce expenditure as soon and as much as
possible and to seek other ways of covering the increases without reducing the
Programme's impact.
<P>
<DD>139.      With those comments, his delegation supported the measures proposed in the
document.
<P>
<DD>140.  <I>Mr. AKAO</I> (Japan), noting that the measures contained in document
GOV/2863 had been much improved, said that the document would serve as a good
basis for future discussions to finalize a legal instrument and that the informal briefing
in May had provided a very useful clarification of the concepts proposed.
<P>
<DD>141.   It was important to establish a strengthened safeguards system to provide the
Agency with increased capabilities to detect undeclared nuclear activities, and also to
improve the efficiency of safeguards implementation in the light of the severe financial
constraints facing both the Agency and many Member States.  He therefore greatly
appreciated the progress made on Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>142.  With respect to the implementation of Part 1 measures, his delegation was
pleased with the progress of consultations between the Secretariat and the countries
concerned, as well as the progress in the implementation of certain new measures. 
For its part, Japan had made every effort to facilitate their early implementation - the
Agency had already collected environmental samples at certain facilities in Japan and
the demonstration test for remote monitoring of safeguards data would take place in
the very near future.  His Government would continue to co-operate fully with the
Agency in the implementation of those Part 1 measures.
<P>
<DD>143. With regard to the question of the universal application of the Part 2 measures,
he noted that the more complete the information available for that purpose was, the
greater the Agency's ability would be to detect undeclared activities.  The application
of some of the new measures could improve not only the implementation of
comprehensive safeguards agreements, but also the implementation of item-specific
and voluntary-offer safeguards agreements.  All States, including those without
comprehensive safeguards agreements, should therefore accept the new measures to
improve the efficiency of safeguards implementation and to strengthen the Agency's
capability to detect undeclared activities.  All the countries concerned should consider
seriously how they could share that responsibility with the countries that had
comprehensive safeguards agreements.  The Board should request the Secretariat to
develop a draft of a legal instrument for that purpose as soon as possible, as suggested
in paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863, and the negotiations on the two legal
instruments should be linked if possible.
<P>
<DD>144. The quantity of confidential information provided to the Agency would
significantly increase under the proposed new measures.  While appreciating the
Secretariat's efforts to provide protection, he said that it was necessary to establish a
viable mechanism and specific procedures and requested that the results of efforts in
that area be reported as soon as possible.
<P>
<DD>145. Turning to the issue of access to information, he said that the measures for
broader access to information on nuclear R&D did not clearly identify the scope of
activities which were owned, funded or authorized by the State.  States were not
usually in a position to obtain the relevant information from the private sector on
nuclear R&D not involving nuclear material, nor could they guarantee the credibility or
correctness of information acquired.  It would therefore be better if the scope and level
of information on nuclear R&D to be provided to the Agency were more clearly defined. 
A State's obligation in that area could be that a State should commit itself to make all
reasonable endeavours to supply all relevant information on nuclear R&D which it
could assemble and provide to the Agency within existing laws and regulations.  Japan
also believed that R&D on nuclear safety was not closely related to a State's capability
to produce nuclear material of concern and such R&D should therefore be excluded
from the activities to be reported to the Agency.
<P>
<DD>146. His Government recognized the usefulness and effectiveness of increased
physical access to improve the Agency's capability to detect undeclared nuclear
activities.  However, such access should be granted only to follow up questions and
inconsistencies relating to information provided in a State's Expanded Declaration. 
Furthermore, a statement of its purpose should be provided.  In order to reduce the
practical difficulties for a State while maintaining the effectiveness of complementary
access, the Agency should, in principle, provide the State with 24-hours' notice of its
intention to exercise its right to complementary access.  The nature of questions and
inconsistencies intended to be resolved through complementary access should also be
explained at the time of the notification and reasonable limits should be set upon the
frequency of such complementary access to the same site or, in the case of a complex
site, to the same installation within a site.  When the Agency made use of increased
access to nuclear R&D locations, a State should only be obliged to make all reasonable
endeavours to facilitate such access within existing laws and regulations for the
purpose of resolving questions or inconsistencies.  His delegation also believed that
subsidiary arrangements should be negotiated between States and the Agency with a
view to specifying the details of procedures for the application of increased physical
access.
<P>
<DD>147. With respect to the adoption of simplified inspector designation procedures and
direct communication between inspectors in the field and Headquarters, a common
understanding among the countries concerned should be formulated during discussions
on a legal instrument.
<P>
<DD>148.      At the present stage, Member States still held different views on certain very
important issues.  Nevertheless, he welcomed the early establishment of a committee
to discuss the required legal instrument as suggested in the recommended action
contained in paragraph 78 of document GOV/2863 and in the introductory statement
by the Director General.  His delegation supported that suggestion on the
understanding that the views of Member States expressed at the present series of
Board meetings would be officially recorded and that the views of the Secretariat
outlined in document GOV/2863 and the officially recorded views of Member States
would be taken into consideration on an equal footing in future deliberations on the
legal instrument.
<P>
<DD>149.    In conclusion, he said that once agreement had been reached on the
introduction of Part 2 measures, Japan was determined to take all the necessary steps,
including legislative steps if necessary, to ensure the smooth and effective
implementation of those measures. Furthermore, he hoped that the discussions on the
finalization of the legal instrument would result in a common understanding on issues
such as the scope and procedures of the new measures in order to ensure their smooth
implementation in all the countries concerned.

<B>EXCERPT FROM THE SUMMARY RECORD OF THE BOARD'S 895th MEETING</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Ms. LAJOUS VARGAS (Mexico) commended the Secretariat on the clarity of
document GOV/2863, on the explanation of the implications of the proposed Part 2
measures and on the explanation also of how and when those measures would be
applied.
<P>
<LI>She also commended the Secretariat on its efforts to take into account many of
the concerns expressed at the Board's previous session.  Nevertheless, a number of
points still required clarification.
<P>
<LI>One such point related to the question of the universality of application of the
proposed measures; there might well be non-uniformity in the application of those
measures if it was accepted that different States had different capacities for or
possibilities of complying with the rules.  In that context, her delegation hoped that the
nuclear-weapon States and the States with item-specific safeguards agreements would
allow the Programme 93+2 measures to be applied within their territories as evidence
of their commitment to non-proliferation and universal disarmament.
<P>
<LI>The importance of the confidentiality of information obtained by the Secretariat
either through the Expanded Declaration or through application of the measures and of
new safeguards techniques could not be overemphasized.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the costs of applying the Programme 93+2 measures, she
recalled the agreement - reached in the September 1995 negotiations on safeguards
financing thanks to the skillful guidance of Ambassador Akao of Japan and Ambassador
Doshi of India - whereby each "shielded" Member State of the Agency would increase
its contribution towards the safeguards component of the Regular Budget gradually
over a five-year period to a level corresponding to half of its base rate of assessment, it
being understood that during that period the contributions of the "shielded" Member
States would not be used in meeting cost increases resulting from the application of
the Programme 93+2 measures.  Obviously, that did not prejudge the need to negotiate
a new agreement once the five-year period had elapsed.
<P>
<LI>Her delegation shared the concern of some other delegations that certain
important points mentioned in document GOV/2863 were not covered in the draft
protocol contained in Annex III to that document.  For example, whereas paragraph 56
of the document stated that "sample identity is protected", Article 11 of the draft
protocol made no explicit reference to environmental samples.  Similarly, whereas
paragraph 53 stated that "the [environmental] sampling at locations other than nuclear
and nuclear-related sites would be for resolving an inconsistency or question", Article
5 of the draft protocol did not mention that limitation.
<P>
<LI>With regard to increased access and its scope, it had been stated on several
occasions (and was stated in paragraph 61 of document GOV/2863) that increased
access would be sought only "in connection with the resolution of inconsistencies or
questions or to implement a new technical measure".  That clarification did not appear
in the draft protocol.
<P>
<LI>The Mexican delegation shared the Director General's view, expressed at the
informal briefing given on 20 and 21 May 1996, that the final version of the draft
protocol must be completely consistent with the measures submitted for approval in
document GOV/2863.  That meant that there would have to be complete consistency
with the Expanded Declaration - a matter which Member States and the Secretariat
would have to study in detail.
<P>
<LI>The Mexican delegation supported the idea of establishing a committee of legal
experts to draft a safeguards protocol provided that the resulting text was based on the
measures actually approved by the Board.  It could therefore agree to the draft protocol
proposed by the Secretariat being used as a basis for the committee's work only to the
extent that the draft was consistent with the approved measures.
<P>
<LI>The committee of legal experts should perhaps be composed on more or less the
same lines as the committee which had produced document INFCIRC/153.  At all
events, it would have to be open-ended in order to permit the participation of all
States on an equal footing.
<P>
<LI>Referring to element 2.c.(iii) of the Expanded Declaration, she suggested that the
beginning of the last phrase be amended to read:  "and, additionally, when available,
information on nuclear R&D activities in the State ..."; the State should be aware of all
activities of the kind in question, but it might be unaware of some.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the explanation of element 2.c.(viii) of the Expanded Declaration
given in subparagraph 51(f) of document GOV/2863, where it was stated that "All
nuclear material exempted pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153 ... should be
reported, regardless of the amount involved", she proposed that an exception be made
in cases where only gram quantities were involved.
<P>
<LI>Ms. OK (Turkey), having commended the efforts of the Secretariat in
connection with Programme 93+2, said that, as a country which had been seriously
affected - both economically and socially - by the Gulf War, Turkey had from the
outset called for a more efficient safeguards system and for the use of new techniques
(such as environmental monitoring), improved access to information on possible
undeclared nuclear activities, and more comprehensive information on the export and
import of nuclear equipment.  In that context, her delegation welcomed document
GOV/2863 as it had developed out of Discussion Draft II considered at the Board's
March session.
<P>
<LI>With the NPT Review and Extension Conference behind them and the prospect
of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty being concluded in the near future, Member
States needed to maintain the momentum towards nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament.  That momentum must not be lost as a result of obstacles due to the
reservations of some Member States about Programme 93+2.  Her delegation
sympathized with the concerns of some Member States regarding the balance between
- on one hand - the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and - on the
other - verification, but believed that the two could be complementary rather than
conflicting.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the question of the universality of the envisaged strengthened
safeguards, her delegation had noted that in paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863 it
was stated that "Programme 93+2 is intended to strengthen safeguards in States with
comprehensive safeguards agreements, but participation of other States can enhance
the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the programme in several
ways."  That applied equally to the provision of information regarding exports of
nuclear equipment and non-nuclear material.  Nuclear-weapon States had a
responsibility to ensure full implementation of the measures envisaged in Programme
93+2.  In that connection, Turkey welcomed the commitment of the United States to
accept the import/export reporting requirements that would ultimately be approved by
the Board and its readiness to consider how many more parts of the programme it
could implement with a view to increasing the effectiveness of the safeguards system. 
It hoped that other nuclear-weapon States and the States with item-specific
agreements would join in that commitment.  It also hoped that the adoption of
Programme 93+2 by the Board would pave the way for the preparation and
acceptance of legally binding commitments to that programme by all Agency Member
States.
<P>
<LI>Her delegation would like to see Programme 93+2 agreed upon in principle at
the present session of the Board; the additional protocol and the Expanded Declaration
could be finalized soon afterwards by a working group, with a view to their adoption
at the Board's meetings in December.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. UMAR</I> (Nigeria) said that his delegation's support for measures that
would include broader access to relevant information, greater physical access and
optimization of the present safeguards system remained firm.  The Board should bear
in mind, however, that the Agency's safeguards system - whether the current or a
future one - would be judged by its effectiveness, efficiency and acceptability.  The
onus was therefore on all Member States to put in place measures that could be
applied with the utmost transparency and without any trace of discrimination.  The
ultimate objective should be to apply such measures in all States, including States with
voluntary-offer safeguards agreements and safeguards agreements based on document
INFCIRC/66.  In that connection, his delegation endorsed the view that globalization of
the nuclear non-proliferation regime was a sine qua non for enhancing compliance
and strengthening its political and legal basis.
<P>
<LI>His delegation fully supported the view that paragraphs 4 and 5 of document INFCIRC/153 should be brought into line with the Part 2 measures of Programme 93+2. 
Member States which were still apprehensive about the Part 2 measures needed to be
reassured that the Secretariat would be able to prevent the economic and
technological advancement of developing countries from being obstructed.  The
measures should enhance international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear
and related activities, especially the international exchange of nuclear materials and
related equipment.  Also, it was important that peaceful R&D activities in Member
States not be threatened in any way.
<P>
<LI>Recalling the signing of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the
Pelindaba Treaty) in Cairo on 11 April, he commended the efforts of the Director
General and the Secretariat in helping to make the conclusion of the Treaty a reality
and expressed the hope that all non-African Member States, and particularly the
nuclear-weapon States, would sign the protocol at an early date as a demonstration of
their support for the Treaty and the goal of global non-proliferation.
<P>
<LI>His delegation supported the idea of setting up an expert group of legal and
technical experts to resolve the problems associated with the Part 2 measures and
refine the text of the draft protocol.  It hoped that the Board would be in a position to
adopt the Part 2 measures once the comments and well-founded apprehensions of
some Member States had been taken into account.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. PETROV</I> (Bulgaria) said that the proposed measures would
significantly increase the Agency's ability to detect possible undeclared nuclear
material and activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.   His
delegation was in favour of their adoption and trusted that the expenditure involved in
their application would be kept as low as possible.  The Secretariat would undoubtedly
make every effort to use the resources available in a balanced and effective manner.
<P>
<LI>Application of the Part 2 measures would require an additional protocol based
on a model protocol.  The proposal made by the Ambassador of Italy on behalf of the
European Union and its associated States for the establishment of an open-ended
committee to finalize the text of a model protocol was a useful one and should be
adopted by the Board.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. LI Changhe</I> (China) said his delegation had noted that document
GOV/2863 was based on Discussion Draft II of 27 February 1996 and reflected
concerns expressed by various Governors at the March session of the Board.  Some
important concerns remained unresolved, however, and his delegation therefore hoped
that the Secretariat would pay close attention to the views expressed and suggestions
made at the Board's present session and intensify its consultations with Member States
regarding those concerns.
<P>
<LI>Referring to paragraph 9 of document GOV/2863, he said that his delegation
appreciated the Secretariat's efforts relating to the application of Part 1 measures. 
However, the application of Part 1 measures was still at a very early stage, some
aspects still being only under consideration.  There was still much to be done, and his
delegation would like the Secretariat to report periodically to the Board on progress
made and problems encountered; such information would be extremely useful to the
Board in its consideration of Part 2 measures.
<P>
<LI>In paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863, reference was made to the
applicability of Programme 93+2 measures to States which did not have
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency.  Those measures concerned
only States which had concluded such agreements, however, a point which had been
made repeatedly since 1993.  If the Board deviated from its original intention and tried
to extend the scope of Programme 93+2, the difficult issues already confronting it
would only be exacerbated.  The Chinese delegation consequently had reservations
about parts of paragraph 16 and other passages in document GOV/2863.  However, it
was not opposed to the idea that States without comprehensive safeguards agreements
had a contribution to make in the interests of preventing nuclear proliferation.  For
example, in 1991 China had undertaken to report to the Agency on a continuing basis
any exports to or imports from non-nuclear-weapon States of nuclear material over one
effective kilogram, and in 1993 it had undertaken to participate in the Agency's
universal reporting scheme and report to the Agency its imports and exports of nuclear
material and its exports of special equipment and non-nuclear material.  It had
faithfully fulfilled and would continue to fulfil its obligations in that connection.
<P>
<LI>With regard to costs, the strengthening of safeguards must not impose an
excessive financial burden on Member States or affect the distribution of resources
among the main activities of the Agency.  In the Administrative and Budgetary
Committee, the Chinese delegation had expressed its concern about the imbalance
between the Agency's safeguards and promotional activities.  Also, it shared the view
of the Group of 77 that the increasing tendency in the Agency to rely on
extrabudgetary resources was unhealthy.  It hoped that the Secretariat would submit
proposals for more effective utilization of the existing safeguards system and for
increasing the cost-effectiveness of the new measures.
<P>
<LI>Referring to the Expanded Declaration, he said his delegation welcomed the
clarifications in document GOV/2863 concerning nuclear fuel cycle-related R&D
activities and hoped that the Secretariat would continue its consultations on that
subject with Member States, so that a consensus might be reached on the content of
the Expanded Declaration.
<P>
<LI>With regard to wide-area sampling, its feasibility and effectiveness had not yet
been established and it involved questions of security, confidentiality and cost for the
Member States concerned.  The issue needed further study by the Secretariat, which
should produce a special report for the Board.  In the meantime, perhaps it should not
be provided for in the draft protocol, particularly since - as indicated in paragraph 54
of document GOV/2863 - further investigation of the practicality and cost-effectiveness
of such environmental sampling was planned.
<P>
<LI>In the process of strengthening safeguards it was essential to prevent
discrimination and abuses of safeguards information and of the right of verification. 
The Chinese delegation had in the past expressed its disapproval of the Agency's
reliance on information obtained through national technical means, which might give
rise to political differences and confrontation.  In view of the sensitivity of the issue of
"inconsistencies", the Chinese delegation had proposed the establishment of criteria
and procedures for dealing with them.  It had noted some of the explanations given
regarding that issue in paragraphs 34, 51 and 60 of document GOV/2863, but still
believed that some matters connected with the Expanded Declaration, the
determination of inconsistencies, and the relationship between complementary access
and special inspection (particularly the question of how to initiate the verification of
inconsistencies) needed further clarification.
<P>
<LI>The Chinese delegation would welcome the establishment of a governmental
expert group to examine the technical, financial and legal aspects of the Secretariat's
proposals regarding Programme 93+2 and hoped that arrangements would be made to
enable the group to start its work soon.
<P>
<LI>Reiterating his country's basic position, he said that China attached great
importance to Agency safeguards and looked forward to the adoption of appropriate
measures to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards
system.  However, the strengthening of safeguards should not hamper the development
of nuclear science and technology or of the nuclear energy industry in Member States,
nor should it affect international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
Also, an appropriate balance should be maintained between the Agency's safeguards
and promotional activities.  Those basic principles were in conformity with the general
direction of Programme 93+2 set at the March 1995 session of the Board.  China was
ready to co-operate fully with other Board members in an effort to establish a just,
rational, effective and efficient safeguards system.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. AL-TAIFI</I> (Saudi Arabia), reaffirming his country's support for the
Agency's safeguards system as a means of verifying non-diversion and compliance by
States with their international undertakings, said that Saudi Arabia would maintain its
support so long as it remained convinced that the Agency's safeguards policies were
sound and helping to promote international and regional peace and stability.
<P>
<LI>At the same time, his country would like the introduction of the proposed Part 2
measures to be deferred until their political, financial, technical and legal implications
had been fully assessed.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. MEADWAY</I> (United Kingdom), having endorsed the statement made by
the representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union, said that the United
Kingdom had consistently supported the broad thrust of the measures set out in
document GOV/2863, which should provide a good basis for strengthening the
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system.  If the Agency's
ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities in States with comprehensive safeguards
agreements was to be substantially strengthened, it was crucial that the Agency be
able to obtain and analyse a wide range of information on the nuclear activities of
States and, where necessary, to supplement its analyses through physical access.
<P>
<LI>His delegation supported the introduction of environmental monitoring
measures, but would like to point out that formal rules would be required to govern
the taking of samples, the procedures for their transfer and analysis, and the
transmission of results. 
<P>
<LI>There was still room for discussion aimed at accommodating the concerns
expressed by a number of non-nuclear-weapon States with extensive nuclear
industries, and the United Kingdom would continue to work towards a balanced
consensus with a firm legal basis which respected the rights and duties both of States
and of the Agency.  Any working group set up to create such a legal basis would need
to take into account the draft protocol and the supporting material in document
GOV/2863, and also the points made in the Board's discussions on that document and
its predecessors.
<P>
<LI>The United Kingdom, which believed that all Member States should contribute
actively towards strengthening the Agency's ability to detect clandestine activities
worldwide, was ready to contribute through the application of measures which would
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards being applied within the
framework of its safeguards agreement with the Agency (contained in document
INFCIRC/263).  Paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863 provided a good basis for
agreement in that connection.
<P>
<LI>Following consultations with other nuclear-weapon States, his country was
prepared to provide the Agency with information on:  imports and exports of nuclear
material for peaceful purposes; export licences for nuclear material and for non-nuclear
equipment, as envisaged in document GOV/2863; and export licences for other
selected items of nuclear-related equipment and non-nuclear material as might be
agreed upon by the Board of Governors.  Also, it was prepared to accept, at facilities
designated by the Agency within the framework of the safeguards agreement
contained in document INFCIRC/263, the application of measures specified in document
GOV/2863 which it was mutually agreed would improve the efficiency and
effectiveness with which the Agency fulfilled its obligations under that agreement.  In
addition, it was prepared to discuss with the Agency the possibility of providing
additional information which would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the
Agency in implementing Programme 93+2 worldwide.  The question whether new
national legislation was necessary in that connection would be considered by his
authorities.
<P>
<LI>The United Kingdom hoped that the non-nuclear-weapon States which did not
have a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency would be willing to
contribute to the efficient and effective implementation of Programme 93+2 in a
similar fashion.  
<P>
<LI>In his delegation's view, the next stage should be the preparation - and
submission to the Board for approval - of a single model protocol on the basis of which
States could accept the measures relevant to them in the light of their respective
non-proliferation commitments.  That would be the most straightforward way of
achieving the early acceptance and application of the proposed measures.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. SOKOLOV</I> (Russian Federation) said his country had consistently
supported the development of measures to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system
under Programme 93+2.  In fact, the President of the Russian Federation had recently
emphasized his country's support for Agency safeguards at the Moscow Nuclear Safety
and Security Summit.
<P>
<LI>In his delegation's opinion, document GOV/2863 took into account many of the
views expressed and suggestions made at the previous two sessions of the Board, at
the briefings organized by the Secretariat and during the consultations which had
taken place.  It also took into account the experience being acquired in the practical
application of Part 1 measures, giving an insight into what the practical implications of
the proposed Part 2 measures were likely to be.  That experience should continue to
be taken into account as far as possible in the further development of the Part 2
proposals and in the development of internal Secretariat documents designed to
provide guidance regarding the application of Part 2 measures.
<P>
<LI>Rather than simply being added on to the existing "classical" safeguards system,
the new measures should be made an integral part of it.  The resulting integrated
system would, in his delegation's view, not only help to enhance the effectiveness of
the Agency's verification activities, but also improve cost-effectiveness.  
<P>
<LI>The Russian Federation, which had been a consistent supporter of the principle
of zero real budgetary growth, believed that introduction of the new measures should
be paralleled by the abandonment of some measures currently being applied pursuant
to INFCIRC/153-type agreements.  In that connection, it would like the financial
implications of the application of the new measures to be computed more carefully. 
Widespread routine application of the new measures would involve unwarranted
expense, so his delegation would like them to be introduced progressively, with the
main focus on key facilities in countries regarding which the Agency might be
justifiably concerned about inconsistencies between the information provided by them
and other information available to it.
<P>
<LI>After the adoption of Part 2 of Programme 93+2, the Russian Federation would,
as a nuclear-weapon State, be ready, in the light of the experience with the
application of Part 1 measures and the arrangements arrived at on the basis of the
protocol, to consider steps such as the provision of information on nuclear exports. 
Also, it might examine the question of the application, within the framework of its
voluntary-offer safeguards agreement, of Part 2 measures such as environmental
monitoring.  However, such safeguards activities in nuclear-weapon States should be
seen as a way of gaining experience and the measures in question should be applied
selectively, the aim being to improve the effectiveness of the Agency's safeguards
system; otherwise, they might lead to an undue drain on budgetary resources.
<P>
<LI>As to the extent of the nuclear-weapon States' participation in Programme
93+2, his country would be prepared to continue consultations with the other
nuclear-weapon States on the basis of the joint commitments of the nuclear-weapon
States under the NPT.
<P>
<LI>His delegation supported the Director General's proposal that an open-ended
committee of the Board be convened for further consideration of the draft protocol and
the proposed Part 2 measures.  Such a committee might well, on the basis of the
excellent draft material produced by the Secretariat, succeed in developing a generally
acceptable document which could serve as a legal basis for the interaction between
the Agency and States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. ALLOTEY</I> (Ghana) said that the proposed measures would no doubt
lead to greater trust among States, regionally and globally, and thus facilitate the
transfer of peaceful nuclear technology, equipment and material.
<P>
<LI>Agency safeguards had been in existence for some 30 years, during which they
had been refined and strengthened through the introduction of new methods and
technologies as they became available, and his delegation agreed that they should be
further strengthened in such a way as to ensure the absence of any undeclared
nuclear material and activities.
<P>
<LI>Recalling that a number of African States had recently signed the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty), he said that in applying
safeguards the Agency should do its utmost to avoid hampering the economic and
technological development of Member States and should not discourage international
co-operation in peaceful nuclear-related activities - in particular the exchange of
nuclear material for R&D purposes.
<P>
<LI>His delegation supported the idea of the Board's establishing a committee of
experts to refine the text of the draft protocol before the Board's meetings in
September.  That should help to bring Programme 93+2 nearer to completion.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. DOSHI</I> (India) said India did not believe that Programme 93+2 would
resolve the nuclear dilemma.  That could be resolved only if a nuclear order was
established which was as universal as that established in the fields of chemical
weapons and biological weapons.  When the Board had begun its consideration of
Programme 93+2, there had been a feeling - or at least a hope - that the world was
moving towards some kind of universal nuclear order, but today not even the most
optimistic could view such an order as imminent or even likely.  In fact, recent
national, regional and international developments appeared to have deepened the
division between the nuclear "haves" and the nuclear "have nots", and strengthened
safeguards could well accentuate the trend.
<P>
<LI>A number of delegations had suggested that the scope of Programme 93+2 be
extended to cover countries which had not concluded comprehensive safeguards
agreements with the Agency.  That idea was not acceptable to India, as such an
extension of scope had no basis in law and would clearly be impracticable.  India
could therefore not agree that a legal document should be prepared in furtherance of
that idea.
<P>
<LI>Although his country was not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which
it considered to be a discriminatory body, it had never exported any sensitive
technology or equipment which could be used in a clandestine nuclear programme.
<P>
<LI>He feared that an extensive and intrusive safeguards system, particularly one
involving measures which were seen by some of the countries concerned as serving
no useful purpose, would severely inhibit the growth of technology for purposes such
as nuclear electricity production.  That would be particularly ironical in view of the fact
that the Agency was mandated to promote such technology.
<P>
<LI>If the countries which had concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements
with the Agency reached a consensus on accepting Programme 93+2 in its entirety,
India would be prepared to go along with that consensus, but it believed that further
action should be deferred until the Part 1 measures had been digested and the
Secretariat had made more precise estimates of the costs of strengthened safeguards
and reformulated its proposals accordingly.  He saw no need for hasty decisions, and
his delegation liked the idea of the establishment of an open-ended committee with
the task of examining the concerns which had been expressed and reporting to the
Board at its December meetings.
<P>
<LI>As ever, India was prepared to support any measures which would genuinely
make the world safe from the abuse of nuclear energy.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. PRETTRE</I>  (France), having  associated himself with the statement
made by the representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union, said that
Programme 93+2 would make a major contribution to the strengthening of the
non-proliferation regime and thus to international security.  The Iraqi affair had shown
that a country subject to Agency safeguards was capable of clandestinely conducting a
very extensive military nuclear programme.  The proposals for strengthening
safeguards set out in document GOV/2863 would enhance the Agency's ability to
detect clandestine nuclear activities, an objective endorsed by all countries which had
participated in the NPT Review and Extension Conference.
<P>
<LI>Non-proliferation was a matter of concern to all.  France, in compliance with the
obligations it had assumed under the NPT, was prepared to contribute actively to the
enhancement of the Agency's ability to detect clandestine nuclear activities elsewhere
in the world.  It was also prepared to apply those measures which were capable of
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards implemented by the
Agency under the voluntary-offer safeguards agreement contained in document
INFCIRC/290.  In that connection, it considered paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863
to be a good basis for agreement.
<P>
<LI>France was holding consultations with the other nuclear-weapon States on
ways of helping to strengthen Agency safeguards.  In the light of those consultations,
it was prepared to provide information to the Agency on:  imports and exports of
nuclear material for peaceful purposes; export licences for nuclear equipment and for
non-nuclear material, as envisaged in document GOV/2863; and export licences for
other items of non-nuclear equipment and material as might be agreed upon by the
Board.  Also, France was prepared to accept, at facilities designated by the Agency
within the framework of the safeguards agreement contained in document
INFCIRC/290, the application of measures specified in document GOV/2863 which it
was mutually agreed would improve the effectiveness and efficiency with which the
Agency fulfilled its obligations under that agreement.  In addition, it was prepared to
discuss with the Agency, in the light of its obligations under Article I of the NPT, the
possibility of providing additional information which would increase the effectiveness
and efficiency of the measures to be applied by the Agency pursuant to Programme
93+2 in States which had concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI>France hoped that the non-nuclear-weapon States which had not concluded a
comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency would agree to contribute to
the effective and efficient implementation of Programme 93+2 in a similar manner.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. PESCI BOUREL</I> (Argentina), emphasizing his delegation's strong
support for the process of strengthening the safeguards system, said that a major
feature of that process was the search for an acceptable balance between, on one
hand, the envisaged strengthening measures and, on the other, the need to respect the
legitimate interests and constitutional systems of States.
<P>
<LI>In the current final stage of the Board's consideration of Part 2 of Programme
93+2, his delegation would co-operate to the fullest extent possible in seeking a
consensus satisfactory to all delegations.  As stated in paragraph 74 of document
GOV/2863, the measures proposed represented "the culmination of the Secretariat's
and the Policy Making Organs' efforts to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system",
and in his delegation's view it was now up to Member States to take the necessary
political, legal and technical decisions.
<P>
<LI>Referring to paragraph 78 of document GOV/2863, he said that the most
appropriate mechanism for finalizing the required legal instrument would be an
open-ended intergovernmental committee of experts, which might well be able to start
meeting in the near future in view of the extensive preparatory work already carried
out.  Such a committee should be given all the time it needed in order to complete its
task, which should be to prepare a draft protocol additional to existing comprehensive
safeguards agreements on the basis of:  the draft text contained in Annex III to
document GOV/2863; the main part of document GOV/2863 with its description of the
envisaged Part 2 measures; and the views of Member States as conveyed to the
Secretariat in the course of consultations.
<P>
<LI>In that connection, the Director General's recent response to comments made by
his Government, while clarifying certain matters, had not allayed all of its concerns. 
Accordingly, his Government would like to continue the fruitful dialogue with the
Secretariat initiated during the recent visit to Buenos Aires of the Director for External
Relations, with the focus on four points:  adequate protection by the Agency of the
confidentiality of the information provided by States; the protection of legitimate
intellectual property and commercial interests; the relationship between
inconsistencies that might be found and requests for increased access; and increased
physical access to facilities with no nuclear material.
<P>
<LI>Should the Board decide to set up a committee of experts, Argentina would be
prepared to participate constructively in its work.  His delegation was sure that
Member States would make good use of the committee in completing the Programme
93+2 process and thereby adapting the Agency's safeguards to the changing needs of
international security in the post-Cold War era.
<P>
<LI>His delegation continued to attach great importance to the desired universal
nature of some of the measures which would constitute the envisaged new safeguards
system.  Those measures related to the provision of additional information through the
Expanded Declaration and of information on nuclear imports and exports, and his
delegation would like to see them applied not only by States with comprehensive
safeguards agreements, but also by States with INFCIRC/66-type and voluntary-offer
safeguards agreements.  That would not only help to consolidate the international
non-proliferation regime, but also satisfy basic principles regarding the equitable
sharing of obligations and responsibilities by all members of the international
community.  The legal instrument applicable to States with comprehensive safeguards
agreements and those applicable to States with INFCIRC/66-type and voluntary-offer
safeguards agreements should, in his delegation's view, be adopted at the same time.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. AHMAD</I> (Pakistan) said his delegation was in favour of strengthening
the effectiveness and improving the cost-efficiency of the Agency's safeguards system. 
Accordingly, it had in March 1995 gone along with the Board's endorsement of the
general direction of Programme 93+2 as regards the Part 1 measures.  The
implementation of those measures had hardly begun, however, and his delegation
would like to join some other delegations in cautioning against the way in which Part
2 of Programme 93+2 was being pushed.  His delegation felt it would have been
advisable to allow a couple of years for the monitoring and evaluation of Part 1
implementation before embarking on Part 2 measures.
<P>
<LI>Many countries with substantial nuclear programmes had reservations with
regard to matters such as confidentiality, financial implications, complementary access,
the peaceful development of nuclear energy, and sovereignty.  That being so, it might
have been better to set up an intergovernmental working group to discuss the
technical, legal and financial implications of the Part 2 measures presented in
document GOV/2863.  However, the convening of a committee - presided over by the
Chairman of the Board - would be a positive step, and his delegation hoped that the
committee would thoroughly analyse all aspects of the issue.
<P>
<LI>In conclusion, he said his delegation took strong exception to the suggestion -
made in paragraph 16 of document GOV/2863 - that the scope of Programme 93+2 be
extended to include countries having voluntary-offer and item-specific safeguards
agreements with the Agency.  Since its inception, Programme 93+2 had been geared
solely to the strengthening of safeguards based on document INFCIRC/153, and it had
been emphasized in all quarters that the focus was on the detection of undeclared
nuclear facilities and nuclear activities.  Programme 93+2 did not make sense in the
case of countries with such agreements.  The application of any Part 1 or Part 2
measures to countries with INFCIRC/66-type agreements would be unacceptable to his
delegation.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) said that the statement which he had made
regarding Programme 93+2 in the Board on 19 March<A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> was still valid.  Also, his
country's position had been spelled out further in the statement which he had made
on behalf of the Africa Group on 10 June.<A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>His delegation. while appreciating that the envisaged new measures arising out
of Programme 93+2 would create problems for the proponents of absolute sovereignty,
had been encouraged by the serious nature and high quality of the discussion, with -
for example - the overall philosophy expounded by the Governor from the United
States of America, the very useful recommendations constituting the position of the
European Union, the legitimate concerns expressed by the Governors from Japan and
the Republic of Korea, and the pertinent legal and technical points raised by the
Governor from Brazil.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat had done all it could, and it was now time for the governments
of Member States to take over the torch and, starting in July, negotiate the envisaged
protocol within the framework of a suitable body with a clear mandate and presided
over by the Chairman of the Board.  He was confident that Member States' collective
wisdom would overcome the obstacles ahead.
<P>
<LI>Morocco, which was prepared to accept some constraints in the interests of
greater collective security, believed that the exercise about to be embarked upon
would be a difficult one - but very worthwhile.  The broad application of Programme
93+2 measures, together with progress towards general and complete disarmament
and with the increasing utilization of nuclear energy for purposes of development,
should lead to a safer and more peaceful world, as envisaged when President
Eisenhower made the "Atoms for Peace" speech which ultimately led to the creation of
the Agency.  That was why, on 19 March, he had expressed the hope that Morocco
would be among the first countries to accede to the protocol - a hope conveyed at the
highest level to the Director General when he had visited Morocco in April.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. CIBILS</I> (Uruguay), having commended the Secretariat on document
GOV/2863, said that Programme 93+2 constituted a laudable endeavour and that a
final position on it should be taken only after thorough analysis of all the implications. 
In that connection,  his delegation believed there was a need to fine-tune many of the proposals made in
document GOV/2863 and the way in which they were reflected in the draft protocol
contained in Annex III to that document.
<P>
<LI>His delegation continued to be concerned about the cost of implementing the
Part 2 measures and hoped that their implementation would not affect the availability
of funds for the Agency's promotional activities.  Also, it hoped that the agreement -
arrived at in September 1995 - to the effect that "shielded" countries would, for five
years, not have to bear any part of the cost increases arising out of the implementation
of Programme 93+2 would be respected.
<P>
<LI>Programme 93+2 deserved very close attention, but before final approval was
given there should be a period of mature reflection.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. OWN</I> (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)<A HREF="#note_1">*</A> thanked the Director General, the
Deputy Director General for Safeguards and their colleagues for the efforts reflected in
document GOV/2863.
<P>
<LI>There was a need for a global system to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and in that context his country had
in 1992 submitted to the United Nations General Assembly a proposal regarding the
holding of a special session on the non-proliferation of such weapons.  In fact, his
country believed it was essential not only to prevent the proliferation of such weapons
but also to ensure the destruction of those already in existence.
<P>
<LI>Commenting on document GOV/2863, he stated that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    the safeguards system envisaged in that document should be based on
trust and co-operation;
<P>
<DD>-    implementation of the system must not have a negative effect on the
Agency's technical co-operation activities and must not hamper the economic and
technological progress of developing countries;
<P>
<DD>-    implementation of the system must not involve infringements of national
sovereignty;
<P>
<DD>-    legislation to permit implementation of the system in individual countries
should be passed only after the populations in question had been consulted;
<P>
<DD>-    random inspections should not be carried out without prior notification of
the countries in question, and the sites to be inspected should be agreed upon in
advance bilaterally by the countries in question and the Agency;
<P>
<DD>-    the proposed measures should be applied also in nuclear-weapon States
which (like Israel) were not parties to any multilateral non-proliferation instrument;
<P>
<DD>-    the envisaged safeguards should be implemented in a non-discriminatory
manner;
<P>
<DD>-    intelligence information acquired through implementation of the system
must not be misused;
<P>
<DD>-    implementation of the system must not increase the financial burden on
the countries concerned, especially if - like his country - they were being subjected to
an unfair economic blockade with freezing of their foreign assets; and
<P>
<DD>-    countries not accepting the proposed measures within their territories
must not be involved in the implementation of those measures elsewhere.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>There were gaps and uncertainties in the proposed system, and they should be
examined carefully before the implementation of Part 2 measures began, sufficient time
being taken to resolve all outstanding doubts.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. HODEL</I> (Switzerland)<A HREF="#note_1">*</A> commended the Director General, the Deputy
Director General for Safeguards and their colleagues on document GOV/2863, which
took into account most of the comments made and wishes expressed by Member States
at the Board's March session, so that there would probably be need only for some "fine
tuning".
<P>
<LI>Since the Board's March session, the competent authorities in his country had
submitted the complete list of Part 1 and Part 2 measures to representatives of
Switzerland's nuclear power plant operators and of the National Nuclear Research
Centre in order to elicit their reactions.  Those representatives had, after careful study,
stated that the measures were acceptable as long as their application did not impair
plant and staff safety or plant operating conditions.  Similarly, Switzerland's SSAC had
expressed its willingness to co-operate in the application of relevant measures.
<P>
<LI>Referring to section (c) on page 5 of document GOV/2863, he said that
Switzerland had acquired useful experience with a remote monitoring system installed,
with Agency co-operation, at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Wrenlingen.  The
feasibility had been demonstrated of monitoring safeguards equipment direct from
Vienna, thereby saving on inspector travel costs and related expenses.  It would not be
possible to install such systems in all five of his country's nuclear power reactors by
the end of November, but he hoped that such systems would be in place in all five
reactors in the coming year.
<P>
<LI>His delegation was in a position to state that Switzerland was ready to accept
the safeguards strengthening measures described in document GOV/2863 with the
exception of measure 2.c.(ix),<A HREF="#note_4"><SUP>1</SUP></A> the aim being to provide the Agency with the possibility
of increased physical access to nuclear and non-nuclear facilities, and to achieve
optimum utilization of the present safeguards system.
<P>
<LI>With regard to measure 2.c.(ix), Switzerland was basically ready to support
broader Agency access to information on transfers of nuclear equipment and material
and dual-use equipment, but that measure would be acceptable only in respect of
exports and only if:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    all States with comprehensive safeguards agreements, all the
nuclear-weapon States and all States with INFCIRC/66-type agreements undertook to
provide the Agency with the information in question, otherwise the envisaged
notifications would result in trade distortion and commercial discrimination (the
information would in any case be of very limited use as most of the relevant trade was
conducted by nuclear-weapon States); and
<P>
<DD>-    notifications of exports of dual-use equipment and material were limited
to equipment and material on the Nuclear Suppliers Group's list of dual-use items and
to exports to countries which were of proliferation concern.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Under present Swiss law, the provision to the Agency of information on imports
of dual-use equipment and material was not feasible.  Consequently, if measure 2.c.(ix)
ultimately came to be applied without modification, Switzerland would have to enter a
reservation.
<P>
<LI>On the question of universality in the application of the proposed new
measures, he said that - like many other Member States - Switzerland felt there would
be no real incentive to help strengthen the safeguards system unless all Member
States participated - not just those already subject to the most comprehensive
safeguards.  Accordingly, his delegation believed that the nuclear-weapon States and
the States with INFCIRC/66-type agreements should not only commit themselves to
providing information on imports/exports of nuclear equipment and material and
"listed" dual-use equipment but also assume commitments (relating to - for example -
the extensive use of remote monitoring systems and of remote data transmission,
simplified conditions for Agency inspector access to their territories, nuclear
programmes being conducted by them in co-operation with third countries, and the
extension of their current safeguards programmes) which would help to make
safeguards within their territories and the territories of States linked to them by
bilateral agreements on the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy more effective and
more efficient.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. COOK</I> (New Zealand)<A HREF="#note_1">*</A> said that Programme 93+2 was something in
which all Member States had a major stake, for the threat of nuclear proliferation was
ultimately a question of the national security of all countries.  The Agency was
expected to provide credible assurances that safeguards obligations were being
fulfilled.  As everyone knew, however, the safeguards system developed in the 1970s
was inadequate for detecting clandestine nuclear activities of the sort involved in Iraq's
nuclear weapons programme.  Implementation of the full Programme 93+2 package
was therefore a matter of urgency.
<P>
<LI>His delegation was grateful to the Secretariat, which had done everything
demanded of it by the international community in developing Programme 93+2. 
Member States had been given every opportunity to contribute to the process, and
document GOV/2863 took account of many concerns expressed during consultations. 
The Director General had presented a mature and balanced set of proposals, and it
was now up to Member States to bring the process to an expeditious conclusion.
<P>
<LI>The Board's discussion on Programme 93+2 was not taking place in isolation;
the NPT Review and Extension Conference had recognized the importance of an
increase in the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  When the
enhanced NPT review process got under way, in 1997, the Agency would have to
demonstrate that it had responded effectively to the Conference's call.  In fact, a strong
safeguards system was an essential foundation for nuclear disarmament, and
Programme 93+2 should be seen as a key part of wider multilateral efforts to halt both
horizontal and vertical proliferation.
<P>
<LI>What the Board was talking about was ultimately the collective and individual
responsibility of States for the effectiveness of the non-proliferation system.  States
with nuclear facilities had a special responsibility.  The expanded declaration,
environmental sampling and increased physical access were all essential components
of a package which would enable countries with nuclear programmes to demonstrate
transparency and generate international confidence with regard to those programmes.
<P>
<LI>Concerns had been expressed on behalf of the nuclear industry about the
intrusiveness of the proposed new measures, although similar concerns expressed
during the negotiations leading to document INFCIRC/153 had proved to be unfounded. 
His delegation believed that the Part 2 measures would not constitute an excessive
burden.  Moreover, a fully effective safeguards system was essential to international
trade in nuclear materials and technology, and the nuclear industry would benefit from
the increased confidence provided by Programme 93+2.
<P>
<LI>His delegation was in favour of seeking ways to make the application of Part 2
measures as universal as possible.  Surely all States had an interest in reducing the
costs and improving the efficiency of safeguards.  Also, there should be scope for
applying measures within the framework of voluntary-offer arrangements, in
preparation for an expansion of the role of safeguards with the conclusion of a cut-off
convention, and he had been pleased to hear the positive comments made in that
connection by the representatives of some nuclear-weapon States.  However, while
supporting the idea of the development of appropriate legal instruments, as suggested
by the Director General, his delegation would not like that exercise to delay the
acceptance of Part 2 measures by States which had already concluded comprehensive
safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI>The detailed package contained in document GOV/2863 (with Annexes II and III)
would provide a sound basis for the work of an open-ended expert committee on the
technical and legal aspects of the envisaged protocol.  At the same time, his delegation
would not like to see the text contained in Annex III changed in ways which could
undermine the effectiveness of Programme 93+2.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. ALTER</I> (Israel)<A HREF="#note_1">*</A>, having expressed appreciation of the package
contained in document GOV/2863, said that in principle his country supported the
strengthening of safeguards and that Programme 93+2 constituted a potential
improvement in that respect.  Aware that in principle no form of verification could
guarantee compliance with agreements, his Government wished to place emphasis on
political content and political culture, which were as essential as - or even more
essential than - safeguards measures in bringing about such compliance.
<P>
<LI>Programme 93+2 represented a commendable effort, but it could not offer any
lasting guarantees unless the political will - with stable internal checks and balances -
was there.  The experience of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and
the Agency's Action Team should serve as a warning to all.
<P>
<LI>Programme 93+2 might, under certain conditions, improve the safeguards
regime, but care should be taken to avoid complacency.  The main goal of Programme
93+2 was "to provide credible assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material from
declared activities and of the absence of any undeclared nuclear activities".  The need
to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear activities could arise only in
comprehensive safeguards situations, however, so that that goal was legally
extraneous to safeguards implemented pursuant to INFCIRC/66-type agreements.
<P>
<LI>As to the other goal, "to ensure that declared nuclear material is not diverted to
non-peaceful purposes", it should be recalled that, unlike INFCIRC/153-type
agreements, INFCIRC/66-type agreements did not provide that only nuclear material
should be subject to safeguards.  Thus, there was no need to seek complementary
legal authority in the case of such agreements.
<P>
<LI>The possibility - mentioned in document GOV/2863 - of States providing
information about export licences was worth looking into.  In that connection, the
Board might be interested to know that Israel was in the final stages of introducing
export controls in the chemical, biological and nuclear fields, the export controls in the
nuclear field to be introduced through adoption of the Nuclear Suppliers Group
guidelines and lists contained in document INFCIRC/254/Rev.2/Part 2/Mod.1.
<P>
<LI>In conclusion, he said that, if rapid implementation of Programme 93+2 was
sought, the effort should be concentrated - not diluted by politically motivated
digressions without a legal basis.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain) associated himself with the statement made by
the representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union, and especially with the
appeal made in that statement to all Member States to provide active support for the
safeguards system and the appeal to countries not having comprehensive safeguards
agreements with the Agency to play their part in the Programme 93+2 exercise.
<P>
<LI>His country, which supported the principles of universality and
non-discrimination, welcomed the willingness of nuclear-weapon States to provide
information to the Agency.  It believed, however, that the participation of the
nuclear-weapon States in Part 2 of Programme 93+2 should be legally institutionalized
and not simply be a unilateral concession.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. WALKER</I> (Australia), noting that during the discussion there had been
many references to the question of universality, said that that question had not
previously been discussed at great length.  Arguments had been put forward for the
application of Part 2 measures not only in States with INFCIRC/153-type agreements,
but also in States with INFCIRC/66-type agreements.  That implied the drafting of a
legal instrument over and above the envisaged protocol additional to INFCIRC/153-type
agreements.
<P>
<LI>In his delegation's view, it would be better to concentrate for the time being on
the protocol drafting exercise, since one would need to know what Part 2 measures
were to be applied in States with INFCIRC/153-type agreements in order to assess the
extent to which Part 2 measures might successfully be applied in other States.
<P>
<LI>The CHAIRMAN proposed that, in view of the importance of the subject, the
Board postpone further consideration of agenda sub-item 4(b) in order that he might
reflect on the points made in the discussion and hold consultations regarding a
conclusion which would command acceptance.
<P>
<LI><I>It was so agreed.</I>

<B>EXCERPT FROM THE SUMMARY RECORD OF THE BOARD'S 898th MEETING</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>84.       The CHAIRMAN, summing up the Board's discussion under agenda
sub-item 4(b), said that the Board had recalled that over the previous three years the
Secretariat and Member States had been engaged in an extensive effort to develop and
evaluate measures for further strengthening the safeguards system and making it more
cost-effective (Programme 93+2), with the principal objective of enhancing the
Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.
<P>
<DD>85.  The Board had also recalled its endorsement, in March 1995, of the general
direction of Programme 93+2 and that, in June 1995, it had taken note of the Director
General's plan to implement at an early date - after consultations with Member States
- those measures which fell within the Agency's existing legal authority ("Part 1
measures") and of the implementation activities undertaken so far.
<P>
<DD>86.  The Board had examined document GOV/2863, containing proposals for the
implementation of measures under complementary legal authority.  In that context, it
had acknowledged that additional information, environmental sampling and increased
physical access would strengthen the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear
material and activities.  It had emphasized that the new measures should strike a
proper balance between the Agency's need for information and access on the one
hand and the State's need to protect its legitimate interests and to respect its
constitutional obligations on the other.  It had further emphasized that implementation
of those measures should be subject to strict rules of confidentiality, to be observed by
the Agency with regard both to information received and to the entire process of
verification.  It had welcomed the Secretariat's assurance that the Agency would draw
conclusions only on the basis of information that it had assessed and corroborated
independently.
<P>
<DD>87.  The Board had considered that, in order to strengthen the Agency's capability to
detect, in the States concerned, undeclared nuclear material and activities in an
effective manner and increase the efficiency of the safeguards programme,
co-operation was needed from all States.  In that connection, it had welcomed the
willingness expressed by the nuclear-weapon States to consider how best to
contribute to the implementation of Programme 93+2.  Many members had expected
States without comprehensive safeguards agreements to accept relevant Programme
93+2 measures in the light of their respective non-proliferation commitments.  At the
same time, some had stressed that the definition of those measures in the form of a
legal instrument would be an important element to be taken into account before the
finalization of a model protocol.  Members with INFCIRC/66-type agreements had been
of the view that any extension of the proposed measures to States with such
agreements would go beyond the original purpose of Programme 93+2 and would be
unacceptable.
<P>
<DD>88.  The need for progress towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone
in the Middle East had been highlighted as a step that would contribute to the
strengthening of the safeguards system, enhance the security of the Middle East and
Africa, and reinforce the sustainability of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.
<P>
<DD>89.  With regard to implementation costs, the Board had noted the Secretariat's
expectation that, although the initial implementation phase would for some years
involve a net cost increase, savings would lead to cost neutrality as soon as possible. 
The shielded countries had recalled the decision taken by the Board in September
1995 that they would not be obliged to contribute towards any increase in the
safeguards budget beyond zero real growth.
<P>
<DD>90.  Developing Member States had regretted that there was a continuing imbalance
in the funds allocated for the Agency's promotional activities and its safeguards
activities.
<P>
<DD>91.  With regard to document INFCIRC/153, it had been emphasized that its
provisions, in particular paragraphs 4 and 5, must apply integrally and effectively to
the Part 2 measures of Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>92.  Many members had welcomed document GOV/2863, and some of them had
been ready to accept the proposed measures as described in that document.  On the
other hand, other members had had reservations about certain provisions in the
document and had been of the opinion that a solution would have to be found before
the proposed enhancement of the safeguards system could be accepted.
<P>
<DD>93.  The Board had concluded that the examination of a draft model protocol would
provide opportunities to find precise language striking a balance between the concerns
of individual States and the need to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the
measures proposed.
<P>
<DD>94.  Therefore, the Board had decided to establish a committee with the task of
drafting the model protocol basing itself on Annex III to document GOV/2863 and
taking into account, inter alia, the explanation of the measures contained in that
document and the discussions on the matter in the Board.
<P>
<DD>95.  All Member States, and all other States that had concluded or had a legal
obligation to conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency, could
participate in the work of the committee; any intergovernmental organization which
was party to such an agreement could participate therein as an observer.
<P>
<DD>96.  The committee would be presided over by the Chairman of the Board.
<P>
<DD>97.  The Committee would commence its work early in July 1996.  An oral progress
report by the Chairman would be made to the Board at its forthcoming September
session.  The committee would report to the Board on the outcome of its work at the
Board's December 1996 session.  It should meet as frequently as was necessary in
order to ensure progress while allowing adequate time for consultations with capitals
and affected parties.
<P>
<DD>98.  The Board requested the Director General to make the necessary arrangements,
including interpretation services, for the committee's meetings and to provide the
committee with other support as required.
<P>
<DD>99.  He took it that the summing-up was acceptable to the Board.
<P>
<DD><I>100. It was so decided.</I>
<P>
<DD>101.  <I>Mr. JIANG</I> (China), having congratulated the Chairman on the Board's
acceptance of his summing-up and commended the co-operative spirit displayed by
many delegations during the consideration of Programme 93+2, said that his
delegation had been a consistent supporter of strengthening the Agency's safeguards
system and had been playing an active and constructive role in the Programme 93+2
discussions.  It hoped that as a result of broad consultations a just, reasonable,
effective and feasible set of measures would emerge.
<P>
<DD>102. His delegation was pleased with the progress made so far under Programme
93+2, but it felt compelled to express concern about what appeared to be a wish on
the part of some countries to deviate from - or go beyond - the original purpose of that
programme.
<P>
<DD>103. Whatever the political intentions of those countries, the consequence might be
to make the future deliberations on Programme 93+2 more complicated and hence
delay - or even prevent - the achievement of the envisaged objective.  His delegation
hoped that all parties involved in those deliberations would co-operate in efforts to
reach an early agreement in accordance with the original purpose of Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>104.  <I>Mr. SOKOLOV</I> (Russian Federation) said his delegation was pleased that,
thanks in large measure to the Chairman's efforts, the Board had reached general
agreement on the further work to be done under Programme 93+2.
<P>
<DD>
105. However, as the main purpose of strengthening the safeguards system was to
enhance the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities and materials in
non-nuclear-weapon States, the suggestion made by certain delegations that
nuclear-weapon States should assume legal obligations before the conclusion of the
work on a model protocol implied going beyond what had been intended when the
Agency had embarked upon Programme 93+2.  The question of how the
nuclear-weapon States might contribute to the implementation of Programme 93+2
could be considered within the framework of the safeguards agreements already
concluded by them with the Agency.
<P>
<DD>106.  <I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) commended the Chairman on the democratic
nature of his consultations and wished him the best of luck in presiding over the
committee just established by the Board.
<P>
<DD>107.      <I>Mr. DOSHI</I> (India), congratulating the Chairman on the skillful manner in
which he had tackled a range of difficult issues, said that, while the Indian delegation
still had doubts about the safeguards strengthening programme, it nevertheless
believed that, if the programme was implemented without undue haste and at the
same time real progress was made towards universal nuclear disarmament, the Agency
might ultimately succeed in helping to make the world a safer place.  If that did
happen, much of the credit would go to the Chairman.
<P>
<DD>108.     <I>Mr. MAZILU</I> (Romania) said that the tangible results achieved by the
Board during its present session had been due in large measure to the patience of the
Chairman in seeking common positions on many sensitive issues.  He wished the
Chairman every success in presiding over the newly established committee and
expressed the hope that the committee would make rapid progress.
<P>
<DD>109.     <I>Mr. ALLOTEY</I> (Ghana) commended the Chairman on his efforts leading up
to the decision just taken by the Board.
<P>
<DD>110. Emphasizing that his country was in favour of strengthening the effectiveness
and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system, he expressed the hope that the
"continuing imbalance in the funds allocated to the Agency's promotional activities and
its safeguards activities" would in due course be reduced - if not eliminated altogether.
<P>
<DD>111.    <I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain) asked when in July the newly established
committee would take up its work.
<P>
<DD>112.      <I>The CHAIRMAN</I> said it was envisaged tentatively that the committee
would take up its work on 2 July, considering organizational issues and holding a
general discussion on 2 and 3 July and starting a first reading - article by article - of
the draft protocol contained in Annex III to document GOV/2863 on 4 July, and that the
session would continue until 12 July.  However, it would be for the committee to
decide on its timetable.
<P>
<DD>113. Also, it was envisaged tentatively that the committee would hold a further
session from 7 to 18 October.
<P>
<DD>114. There would be no need for amendments to the draft protocol to be proposed
for consideration during the July session.  Also, the participation of safeguards experts
would not be needed on 2 and 3 July.
<P>
<DD>
115.      <I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain) said it would be helpful if it could be arranged
that safeguards experts were not needed until the week starting 8 July.

<P>
<HR>
<P>The effectiveness of the IAEA safeguards system depends on what the Agency knows about nuclear-related activities. With a broad knowledge of such activities and a good understanding of their relationships, the IAEA can with a fair degree of confidence assess the non-proliferation credentials of a country. Up to now, the system has been rather narrowly focused, leading to perhaps overly thorough safeguards activities on large and visible facilities such as nuclear power plants, while other smaller facilities with a potentially larger proliferation risk would receive less attention. During the last years, the IAEA - the Secretariat, Board of Governors, and Member States - has taken a fresh look at the safeguards system. A shift in focus is under way, a drive to look beyond the current horizon to gain a broader <I>horizontal view</I>, rather than piling up controls vertically on existing nuclear facilities. This article examines key aspects of efforts to strengthen IAEA safeguards, and addresses some concerns that have been raised from the viewpoint of the nuclear industry.
<H3>Towards more efficient safeguards</H3>
Since 1991, the IAEA has begun to revamp the safeguards system through various initiatives and programmes. In 1993, a programme of strengthening and efficiency improvement was initiated on a broad scale in close association with Member States. Nicknamed "Programme 93+2", it led to a series of specific proposals that were approved by the IAEA Board of Governors and broadly endorsed by the Review and Extension Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May 1995. Prime movers were the negative experiences that the IAEA encountered in Iraq and in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the positive experiences gained in the verification of the dismantlement of the South African nuclear weapon programme. By that time, it had become clear that the old approach of improving the effectiveness of standard safeguards only on <B><I>declared</I></B> facilities was approaching its limit. The IAEA had to broaden the focus of its safeguards system to <B><I>undeclared</I></B>, clandestine activities. This new approach requires by necessity access to more information and more access to several kinds of facilities, whether such facilities contain nuclear materials or not. This double objective of additional access - to information and to facilities - lies at the core of the strengthening proposals contained in Programme 93+2.
<P>
In early 1996, the IAEA began to implement under its existing legal authority new measures contained in Programme 93+2. The collection of environmental samples and unannounced inspections stand in the forefront. From Kazakstan to South America and Australia, in tens of countries, the inspectors have introduced these new measures. This was done after consultations with the national authorities to ensure that the modalities of applications would satisfy the Agency's requirements and the operators' needs for safe and unhampered use of their facilities. <I>(See the <A HREF="schrief.html">following article</A> for fuller details on the implementation of Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2.) </I>
<P>
Negotiations now are taking place in an open-ended Committee of the IAEA Board regarding other proposals for strengthened safeguards that require additional authority, Part 2 of Programme 93+2. In these negotiations, some delegations, reflecting the views of facility operators with nuclear materials, have expressed concerns about providing extended access to buildings on their sites beyond strategic points, to such places as workshops, storage areas, and administrative buildings. Further-more, some governments doubt their own ability to provide the Agency with information about and access to facilities without nuclear materials, that is, to locations where their own authority may be quite limited.
<P>
The Board's open-ended Committee met in July 1996 for a first reading of the proposals that had been put forward by the IAEA Secretariat for the measures requiring additional authority. The discussions were pursued in October 1996 in the course of a two-week session that included a thorough second reading with a review of the amendments that had been previously submitted by delegations. Much work remains to be done to reach an agreement on the substantial issues reflected in the current bracketed text (rolling text). Intensive multilateral consultations are under way and it can be hoped that substantial progress can be achieved in the negotiations during the next Committee session in late January 1997.
<H3>Proposed strengthened safeguards measures in a nutshell</H3>
The new measures include the provision to the IAEA of <B><I>additional information</I></B>. For existing nuclear sites, the State would provide additional information containing a description and an explanation of the use of all buildings on the site, and, in some cases, additional operational data of safeguards relevance. The State is also called upon to provide information on pre- and post-safeguards nuclear materials (mines, export-import, nuclear wastes, etc.), on fuel cycle research and development facilities that do not involve nuclear materials, as well as on supporting facilities directly related to the operation of nuclear facilities. 
<P>
As far as <B><I>additional physical access</I></B> is concerned, the Agency would be given an assured access to nuclear sites (where required "managed" to prevent exposure of commercially sensitive information) and a conditional access to non-nuclear sites.
<P>
The additional authority sought by the Agency rests on a few essential principles that show clearly the difference from the conventional verification measures applied to nuclear materials:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The focus will extend beyond nuclear materials to the factors that might indicate the presence or production of undeclared nuclear materials. The treatment of the additional information and access will be <I>qualitative</I> rather than quantitative;
<P>
<LI>The IAEA will not routinely verify <I>on site</I> the additional information received; it will most of the time assess such information in its own offices and when necessary ask questions to check its consistency; and
<P>
<LI>For the locations under complementary access, the IAEA will not install traditional safeguards equipment as for nuclear materials. Its inspectors will mostly walk around for visual observation and, when appropriate, they will take an environmental sample.
</UL>
<P>
This short description should bring to light an important fact that has been somewhat overlooked, namely that <B><I>the main burden of implementing the additional authority sought by the IAEA will fall on the shoulders of the State authorities and not on the nuclear industry</I></B>. The authorities cannot always easily provide information about all "nuclear related facilities" in a State, and even less so ensure automatic access upon request. By contrast, the operator of a nuclear site maintains at all times an overview of his own facility, with a solid organization and a staff well trained in the related areas of security, safety, and safeguards. The additional information can be provided and updated by the operator with a minimal effort, and the complementary access granted with only a marginal perturbation and burden. 
<H3>Concerns of the fuel cycle industry</H3>
The nuclear fuel cycle industry has a record of clear support for non-proliferation and for the safeguards system put in place by the IAEA. Confronted with new proposals for the strengthening of the existing system, the industry wonders what is in stock for it, what could be the consequences in terms of costs or competitiveness. Those are of course legitimate concerns that governments participating in the negotiations of the new legal instrument for the IAEA need to take into account. Yet, in reality, the impact of the new measures should not affect much, if at all, their commercial interests.
<P>
An information paper issued by the nuclear industry of one State illustrates many of the concerns expressed by operators. Some of the objections put forward (here in italics) call for a comment:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>"...the safeguards approaches implemented have so far proved successful in States with democratic societies"</I>. Yes, but as an international organization, the IAEA does not distinguish between political systems. In carrying out its verification mandate, the Agency can only take into account the readiness of its partners to demonstrate transparency in the relevant nuclear activities.
<P>
<LI>About the additional information that the IAEA wishes to receive, it was stated that the collection <I>"will require considerable effort on the operator's part if it is to correspond to the demands expected"</I> and <I>"will mean direct interference with facility operation"</I>. At the least, such a statement reflects a fundamental misreading of the proposals, since the additional information requested from nuclear facility operators will remain of a common nature with generally infrequent updates. As already noted, the situation could be quite different for State authorities in regard to facilities without nuclear materials. Incidentally, the proposals acknowledge concerns regarding commercially sensitive information and that constraints may need to be imposed by operators to maintain confidentiality.
<P>
<LI>A fear expressed about increased physical access to nuclear facilities is that the <I>"number of personnel involved will increase quite considerably as opposed to earlier practice."</I> An occasional visual visit to the workshop, the storage rooms or the laboratories by the very same inspectors coming for materials verification may well add a few hours to the duration of the inspection. But it will hardly require the hiring of additional personnel.
<P>
<LI>Environmental sampling is labelled as a <I>"method unacceptable for routine use"</I>. The objections cover the rights of the operator (yes, the IAEA does leave duplicate samples in the facility), the lack of representativity of individual samples (yes, but conclusions will be drawn only from multiple samples), the fear of cross-contamination (yes, but detailed sample collection and handling procedures have been implemented that limit this possibility). The method is indeed quite sensitive - but not sensitive to the point of detecting <I>"transborder nuclear transports and illicit transfer of nuclear materials"</I>, tens or hundreds of kilometres away. The field trials carried out by IAEA staff in collaboration with many Member States between 1993 and 1996 have demonstrated that the method provides a powerful tool and that it is acceptable for routine use. Therefore, as instructed by the IAEA Board of Governors, the IAEA inspectorate will implement it in all States having comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
<LI>Another serious concern is that the discovery of inconsistencies coming to light through additional information and access could discredit operators and nuclear energy as a whole. Over the years the IAEA has handled a large number of inconsistencies of varying importance without much publicity. Common sense in managing inconsistencies calls for checking and re-checking, for a dialogue with operators and national authorities, a dialogue that normally resolves the matter. Only when this dialogue fails does the IAEA ring the bell.
</UL>
<P>
The proposed measures have been discussed with industrial representatives of many countries having large nuclear industries. While concerns were also expressed about the still unknown burden that these strengthening measures would entail, the measures themselves and the ability of the IAEA to implement them were not much questioned. The bottom line, the bottom question was rather: "What are the benefits - for us?"
<H3>Reducing the safeguards burden</H3>
Strengthening - that is, better effectiveness - is not the last word in Programme 93+2. As a matter of fact, efficiency - that is, the better use of resources - is part of the Programme's full official title. The Programme's original scope in matters of efficiency included two distinct elements: the first covered the accelerated development of all the technical and administrative measures which could be readily identified; the second dealt with additional efficiencies that would result from the strengthening of the system itself. Indeed, one important early dimension of Programme 93+2 has since then been under-emphasized, namely that a strengthening of safeguards can be a step towards a simplification of safeguards for existing facilities of the nuclear fuel cycle.
<P>
The search for greater efficiency has always been an essential element of good safeguards management. The reduction from US $3000 in 1980 to $1000 in 1995 of the annual cost of safeguarding one "significant quantity" of nuclear material reflects this ongoing commitment.<A HREF="#note_a">*</A> This effort includes such things as the optimization of safeguards planning (e.g., through the use of regional offices) or the use of technological innovations that permit unattended modes of monitoring and verification.
<P>
In this respect, one technology stands out: the remote monitoring at IAEA headquarters, through line or satellite communications, of safeguards information in a facility located anywhere in the world. Several field trials are under way or planned: one in Switzerland started in February 1996 and another in the United States is scheduled to start in late 1996. The purpose of these field trials is to test the concept of remote monitoring via satellite and telephone links in real safeguards situations. Additional field trials are planned in South Africa, Canada, and Japan. The experience from these trials, as well as from the use of remote monitoring in Iraq by the UN/IAEA Action Team, will help identify and resolve issues associated with remote monitoring, as well as provide data on costs. This experimental work provides a solid basis to simultaneously establish the safeguards approaches and criteria for various types of facilities where remote monitoring is to be implemented, with priority given to material stores and nuclear power plants. A special Remote Monitoring Project has recently been established in the IAEA Department of Safeguards to prepare, through testing and planning, for the implementation of remote monitoring in January 1998.
<P>
But there is more to greater efficiency than technological improvements.
<P>
Confronted with severe budgetary constraints, the IAEA has no choice but to pay attention to the optimum use of resources - to ascertain that the money available is best used to achieve its broad non-proliferation objectives - by properly distributing its resources on the verification of declared facilities on the one hand, and providing assurances regarding the absence of undeclared activities on the other hand. In fact, for many years, the promoters of Programme 93+2 - in and outside the IAEA - have recognized that the strengthened measures, by giving more teeth to the safeguards system, could also permit a simplification of conventional verifications on declared facilities, thereby resulting in a better efficiency of the system as a whole. Simply stated, if the controls carried out in the most sensitive facilities of a country from the point of view of proliferation - research centres and some processing facilities - are conclusive, why should the IAEA inspect so frequently and thoroughly nuclear power plants? The greater degree of transparency that a State would demonstrate through the availability of more information and by offering generous access to its facilities would create a solid basis for a reduction in the inspection load in facilities of less concern. The IAEA Secretariat has not yet spelled out in any detail what these benefits would be - what it could "give" - preferring to await the end of the negotiations on Programme 93+2 in the Board Committee. However, the Secretariat's commitment to implement the revised safeguards system, within costs acceptable to Member States and with a burden acceptable to operators, has been repeatedly formulated, in particular by IAEA Director General Hans Blix.
<H3>A new look at spent fuel</H3>
The strengthening of the safeguards system envisaged by the full implementation of Programme 93+2 would open up new vistas and indeed allow a fresh look at some fundamental tenets of classical safeguards. The spent fuel from nuclear reactor operations might be one such possibility.
<P>
Over the last decades, the IAEA has developed specific procedures and criteria to apply safeguards to various forms of nuclear materials. In the case of uranium, safeguards application takes into account the nature of the materials - natural, depleted, low-enriched, or highly enriched uranium. The degree of proliferation concern varies and this fact is duly reflected. Up to now, a differentiated approach has not been considered for plutonium, except to take account of whether it is separated or still mixed in spent fuel. Seen in the broad context of all nuclear materials, verification might be insufficient for separated plutonium and excessive for high burnup spent fuel. The time may well have come to revisit the issue.
<P>
A relevant initiative in this direction has been taken in the report published in August 1996 by the Canberra Commission, a group of eminent personalities brought together by the Government of Australia: Nobel Peace Prize recipient Joseph Rotblat, Sri Lankan Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala (Chair of the 1995 NPT Conference), former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Dr. Ronald McCoy (International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War), and General Lee Butler (former Commander in Chief of the US Strategic Air Command), among others. The Commission dealt with the broad issue of nuclear disarmament and the required verification mechanisms.
<P>
The report contains interesting ideas about the use of civilian and demilitarized fissile materials. Noting that a proper balance must be struck between the legitimate civilian use of such materials and the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, the Commission states that striking such a balance might be feasible: 
<P>
<I>"One possibility may be to draw a distinction between plutonium of different isotopic grades and to use this distinction both for safeguards purposes and for a proscription on the separation of plutonium of an isotopic composition which makes it attractive for weapons use...It is an unfortunate consequence of the current practice of not differentiating between plutonium grades for safeguards purposes that special attention is not directed to plutonium having the isotopic characteristics of greatest proliferation concern. Therefore, there would be merit in investigating various categories of plutonium in terms of applicable safeguards measures and resulting verification costs". </I>
<P>
All those interested in strengthening safeguards, as well as those keen to reduce costs, should have an interest in such an investigation. For example, in analogy with the various categories of uranium, one could possibly define two or even three categories of plutonium: 1) <I>degraded</I> plutonium, such as high burnup spent fuel, 2) <I>low-grade</I> plutonium, such as separated high-burnup plutonium from light-water reactors; and 3) <I>high-grade</I> plutonium, e.g. from weapons, in breeder blankets, or in low-burnup spent fuel. 
<H3>A sense of perspective</H3>
The proposals formulated by the Agency to strengthen its safeguards system have opened a broad debate on how the fight against proliferation should be led. Most of the discussion has been of a political nature - the lessons of Iraq, the need to reinforce the NPT regime, the drive towards nuclear disarmament. Many operators of nuclear facilities - in particular in those countries with a large fuel cycle - feel that the burden to achieve these grandiose objectives will fall on their shoulders. The following points must certainly be carefully thought about:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The debate is indeed first of all political. Non-proliferation is part of the efforts of the international community to build a more secure world. While protecting its legitimate interests, while questioning what would be done in their facilities and the costs incurred, industrial associations should also maintain a broad vision of the political dimension and recognize that credible safeguards are vital to preserve public confidence in nuclear power.
<P>
<LI>To truly assess the potential burden of Programme 93+2, the open-minded observer in industry should look at the fine print. He or she will see that the proposed new measures will not really affect the competitiveness of the business, that they will not in fact stand out through the burden they cause, but rather through their different nature: unannounced inspections, and request for access to unusual places, such as the workshop. Observers should also know that the safeguards budget of the IAEA will most likely stay at about the same level in the forthcoming years - it has been frozen for more than 10 years. Hence, there will be no resources for a profusion of burdensome inspections. Like any organization operating under the conflicting demands of "high-quality service" and "low cost", the IAEA Department of Safeguards will have to focus routine verification measures on the essential - namely, on the nuclear materials and facilities of real proliferation concern - and will have to plan its activities pragmatically, possibly by tuning down some of the old verification measures in order to make room for new ones.
</UL>
<P>
As a community, the nuclear fuel cycle industry has few reasons to object to Programme 93+2. As a matter of fact, nuclear operators should wholeheartedly support the additional authority sought by the IAEA, since the better transparency and better non-proliferation assurances offered by the new measures will open the door to simpler, less frequent controls on nuclear materials.

New safeguards measures
<BR>
Initial implementation and experience </H2>
<P>
<I>States have approved a number of measures for strengthening the IAEA's safeguards system, and now are considering others</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Dirk Schriefer</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Soon after Iraq's armies invaded Kuwait in 1990, the IAEA discovered - through its inspections in the aftermath of the Gulf conflict - the size and scope of the Iraqi clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Subsequently, the international community agreed, almost unanimously, that the Agency's safeguards system needed to be strengthened in its ability to detect undeclared inventories of nuclear materials and installations.
<P>
In 1991 additional steps were proposed by IAEA Director General Hans Blix with respect to an increased assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in States having comprehensive safeguards agreements: access to more information and better physical access to sites. In 1992 the Agency's Board of Governors took some measures to strengthen the safeguards regime. It reconfirmed the right of the IAEA to carry out special inspections under the existing provisions of comprehensive safeguards agreements, approving the requirement for the early provision to the Agency of design information on new and modified nuclear facilities and endorsing an expanded reporting scheme. Under this scheme, States are beginning to provide the IAEA with information on exports, imports, and production of nuclear material and exports of specified equipment, beyond that required by their safeguards agreements.
<P>
In April 1993, the Director General's Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI) submitted recommendations for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. In the summer of the same year, the Agency began a new activity with a view to developing a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards regime. Considering the Review and Extension Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), then two years in the future, it was termed "Programme 93+2", or P93+2 for short. The activity was accompanied from the very beginning by the direct involvement of a number of Member States, who had agreed to test the measures as they were developed. Proposals under P93+2 were presented to the Board of Governors in 1994, with a special presentation of results in March and June 1995. Prior to the June Board meeting, it was decided that there were certain measures that had a legal basis in the existing comprehensive safeguards agreements (CSAs) and, thus, could be implemented immediately, and other measures that required a complementary legal basis. This approach was endorsed in June 1995 by the Board and in the following September by the General Conference. Upon the endorsement of the proposal, the Department of Safeguards established a plan with a schedule for the beginning of the implementation in January 1996.
<H3>Components of Programme 93+2</H3>
Following the extensive discussions up to the March 1995 Board of Governor's meeting, a document on P93+2 was submitted for the Board's consideration in June 1995. The measures proposed were arranged in two parts. Part 1 consisted of those which could, in the Secretariat's view, be implemented under existing legal authority and which would be practical and useful to implement at an early date. Part 2 consisted of those which the Secretariat proposed for implementation on the basis of complementary authority. While it was recommended that the Board take action on those measures falling within the Agency's existing legal authority (Part 1), the Director General recommended that action by the Board on the remaining measures await his next report, allowing the Secretariat the benefit of further informal consultations with Member States. Following extensive discussion of the report, the Board took note of the Director General's plan for early implementation of the measures described in Part 1. The Board urged States party to comprehensive safeguards agreements to co-operate with the Secretariat to facilitate such implementation, on the understanding that elaboration of the implementation arrangements and the clarification of States' concerns would be required. Comments and suggestions made during the discussion have been taken into account in planning the implementation of the Part 1 measures. The Agency is proceeding with the implementation of Part 1 measures as rapidly as time and resources allow. 
<P>
Subsequent to the June Board meeting, a detailed implementation plan was developed, and in early November 1995 communications were sent to States party to comprehensive safeguards agreements. These letters described the actions that the Department of Safeguards had identified as necessary to proceed. The letter indicated also that implementation of Part 1 measures would be undertaken beginning in 1996, after consultations, as broadly and extensively as possible, subject to operational and budgetary constraints. 
<P>
This article reports on major selected aspects of the IAEA's experience in implementing Part 1 measures. It addresses activities related to the IAEA inspectorate's broader access to information, through measures such as environmental sampling, information analysis, the provision of increased physical access to IAEA inspectors, and the use of unannounced inspections. The article further addresses the optimal use of the present safeguards system, including unattended and remote monitoring systems, greater co-operation with State Systems of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (SSACs), and the provision of training courses.
<H3>Broader access to information</H3>
<B><I>Letters requesting additional information from States.</I></B> The SSAC questionnaire was sent to 59 States with operative comprehensive safeguards agreements and two regional systems (EURATOM and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for the Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, ABACC) in December 1995. At the same time an information letter was sent to all States with a suspension protocol, to all nuclear-weapon States and to the States with INFCIRC/66-type safeguards agreements in force. It was requested that the responses be returned to the Agency by the end of February 1996. By mid-November 1996, thirty-six responses had been received, including five with incomplete or not completed questionnaires. Work is ongoing to assess the information received and to review criteria which may apply for closer co-operation with the State systems.
<P>
A letter requesting information on certain closed-down or decommissioned nuclear facilities and locations-outside-facilities (LOFs) and on nuclear facilities which were built, but where nuclear material was never introduced, was sent to all States with CSAs at the end of March 1996 with responses requested by the end of April 1996. A number of responses were received, most of which confirm the absence of such facilities; however, others acknowledge the existence of such facilities, and more information is provided. A letter requesting additional information regarding the nuclear fuel cycle that can be sought under existing legal authority is still being prepared.
<P>
<B><I>Environmental sampling.</I></B> Initial implementation of environmental sampling is being focused on enrichment and hot-cell facilities. This consists of taking swipe samples at locations which would be accessible to the IAEA inspectors during inspections or during design verification visits. General guidelines for these applications have been developed and approved, candidate facilities have been identified, facility-specific sampling objectives, and plans and procedures have been developed. Consultations with Member States regarding implementation were initiated throughout the year as resources were available. The consultations were held at different levels, as required by the complexity of the specific sampling or at the explicit request of the State.
<P>
Analytical equipment for the clean laboratory in Seibersdorf near the Agency's headquarters in Vienna has been installed. The laboratory has been able to receive and handle samples since mid-May, with full operation commencing in July 1996. Baseline sample collections began as early as February 1996 and have been conducted in a majority of relevant countries. Samples were taken in enrichment plants and hot cells in more than 20 countries; by mid-November 1996, more than 400 samples from different sampling points had been taken, shipped, and received for analysis in Vienna. Analysis results are now being returned to the Department of Safeguards for assessment and evaluation. Consultations with Member States on the baseline results are beginning; as results become available, and as resources permit, these will increase in the first half of 1997.
<P>
<B><I>Improved information analysis.</I></B> A general framework and methodology for improved information analysis has been developed. Some computer-based tools for its implementation are in place. The work of a group of experts from several Member States on the development of the physical model of the nuclear fuel cycle is complete. In addition, the role of existing country officers is being expanded, and open source and other additional information is being added for overall assessment of non-proliferation and safeguards agreement pledges. Modifications regarding the organizational structure are in progress.
<P>
<B><I>Information confidentiality.</I></B> A review of procedures for protecting safeguards confidential information has taken place to ensure the adequacy of protective measures. Particular attention is being paid to the means of controlling access to safeguards confidential data in computer files. A Note by the Secretariat on the confidentiality of safeguards information was distributed to Member States in August 1996. Regarding the Agency's procedures for the distribution of environmental samples and for reporting analytical results, intended to protect the anonymity of samples and the confidentiality of results, a Consultants Group of experts from Member States reviewed the IAEA's procedures in December 1995. The Group agreed that implementation of the procedures met the objective of the Agency and of Member States.
<H3>Increased physical access</H3>
<B><I>Visas.</I></B> As a prerequisite for enhanced physical access to nuclear facilities or other nuclear installations, it is required that Member States provide Agency inspectors with long-term visas that include the right for multiple entry and exit to and from the country, or visa-less entry. The Agency requires and requests a one year minimum for the validity of the inspector's visa.
<P>
A large number of States has already accepted this type of visa (usually in the subsidiary arrangement to the safeguards agreement), so that in these States the possibility for immediate implementation exists. Letters have been sent out to all Member States that grant Agency inspectors less than what is deemed to be the minimum with regard to visa requirements.
<P>
<B><I>Unannounced inspections.</I></B> Work is under way to identify how unannounced inspections could lead to more effective and efficient safeguards for a number of facility types. This will usually be done in conjunction with other measures. An approach is being tested in a low-enriched uranium fuel fabrication facility, and detailed consultations are under way in an attempt to define an approach for similar facilities in other countries. For research reactors, plans have been made to introduce unannounced inspections in several reactors to provide a higher degree of confidence regarding the absence of unreported production of plutonium.
<P>
Administrative procedures necessary to support unannounced inspections as part of the routine implementation of safeguards have been developed. This is particularly difficult in countries where language barriers are high, and where the use of travel and communication facilities is restricted.
<H3>Optimal use of the safeguards system</H3>
<B><I>Unattended and remote monitoring.</I></B> A variety of advanced technology for remote monitoring and transmission, and unattended measurements with remote transmission is being examined, tested and demonstrated. This includes digital surveillance cameras, electronic seals and motion and radiation detectors, with remote transmission by satellite and phone lines.
<P>
Two digital surveillance cameras and an electronic seal using remote data transmission through a satellite link to Vienna have been operational from a facility in Switzerland since mid-January 1996. The location under remote monitoring is a vault containing a semi-static store of direct-use material. A variety of query and transmission strategies is being evaluated. It is planned to expand this capability to a network involving five facilities in Switzerland by the end of this year.
<P>
The objective is the development of new safeguards approaches for these locations which combine the new technology with unannounced inspections thereby permitting reductions in inspection frequency and effort. Similar applications of advanced technology are scheduled to be demonstrated in the United States and in South Africa. In all cases the installations include the authentication requirements of the Agency and the encryption requirements of the State. Other automatic systems have been providing data on facility and process status in unattended mode for some time in other countries.
<P>
<B><I>Increased co-operation with SSACs.</I></B> The development of, and States' responses to, the SSAC questionnaire sent out in February 1996 provide a mechanism for a systematic exploration of areas of increased co-operation which could benefit both the Agency and the SSAC. At the same time the process of increasing co-operation between the Agency and regional systems and a large, single state SSAC is continuing.
<P>
Implementation of the New Partnership Approach (NPA) continues with EURATOM; areas of increased co-operation will feature in the consultations with ABACC; and a modified NPA safeguards approach to light-water reactors will be tried in a Member State with a large number of light-water reactors.
<P>
<B><I>Training courses.</I></B> A number of training courses necessary for the implementation of the Part 1 measures are in various stages of development, pilot testing and implementation. Training courses on environmental sampling have taken place. By the end of September 1996, the training had been provided to approximately 100 inspectors. Training courses on the physical model and enhanced observational skills have been pilot-tested. Other courses dealing with the conduct of unannounced inspections and design information verification of closed-down and decommissioned facilities are under development. For increased co-operation with SSACs, courses for the training of SSAC personnel are under development to familiarize them with IAEA requirements. Additional training courses have been requested and are in the process of being designed. More training in support of the new measures is necessary; it is restricted by the inspectors' availability from their normal safeguards implementation duties.
<H3>Conclusions and outlook</H3>
The implementation of Part 1 measures began according to schedule, but numerous problems were encountered. Most significantly, safeguards staff had to give priority to the implementation of activities planned and scheduled under the existing safeguards regime. Implementation, as well as educating and training safeguards staff on measures and procedures relevant to Part 1, has taken more time than anticipated, due to constraints on the availability of inspectors and support staff. Consultations and discussions at various technical levels in individual States have consumed an unexpected amount of time.
<P>
The partitioning of the measures for implementation according to the legal basis as presented to the Board in June 1995, and the decision to proceed immediately with the implementation of those measures that are within existing authority, were made for pragmatic reasons only. This mode is not designed to diminish in any way the integrated nature of the entire Programme 93+2. The full benefits in strengthened effectiveness and efficiency will be derived only from a full implementation of all measures in the package.
<P>
Finalization of the measures presented in Part 2, the implementation of which requires complementary legal authority and the associated draft legal instrument, will proceed. The IAEA Board of Governors agreed in June 1996 to establish a Board Committee to continue the work on Part 2 measures and the legal instrument. The Committee has held two sessions, in July and October, and next will meet in January 1997.
<P>
The IAEA Secretariat will facilitate the work of the Committee. Progress, including the date for implementation of Part 2, will depend now on the willingness and readiness of the IAEA's Member States to talk to each other and reach agreement, and to authorize the Secretariat to continue with the implementation of the new safeguards measures.

<I>An overview of the IAEA's verification activities for low-enriched uranium facilities and steps toward greater co-operation with operators</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Anita Nilsson</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Low-enriched uranium, or LEU, fuel cycle facilities comprise an important product of the nuclear industry, and are intimately related to nuclear power production. Such facilities include those for production of uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium (to less than 20% uranium-235), conversion to uranium oxide powder, and the production of nuclear fuel assemblies for subsequent use in reactors. They also normally include facilities (excluding reprocessing plants) for encapsulation and deposition of spent fuel, which contains plutonium. This article primarily deals with fuel cycle facilities using LEU, and only briefly touches upon safeguards for spent fuel to be deposited in geological repositories.
<P>
In all LEU facilities, the presence of uranium is the reason for IAEA safeguards under agreements concluded pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Natural or low-enriched uranium is nuclear material that only can be indirectly used for nuclear weapons production. Further enrichment of uranium in the isotope uranium-235, to a level above 20%, is necessary to obtain material that can be utilized in a nuclear explosive device. 
<P>
This fact is central to the implementation of IAEA safeguards on LEU. The Agency has an obligation to draw independent conclusions that the nuclear material subject to safeguards has not been diverted from peaceful uses, i.e. to nuclear explosives or for purposes unknown. The safeguards approaches and criteria used by the IAEA to obtain that goal are defined with due consideration to the potential use of the nuclear material for nuclear weapons. The enrichment in the isotope uranium-235 that would be required for turning natural or low-enriched uranium to weapons usable material is an expensive and time-consuming process, in particular if it is concealed. It has been estimated through technical analysis that a State could have the material enriched to the desired degree for weapons production in about one year's time. Recent reviews within the Agency, however, have shown that while the establishment of an enrichment facility, in particular if is concealed, is a costly and lengthy process, the subsequent enrichment of LEU, once the enrichment facilities have been established, could be achieved in less than one year. 
<H3>Current safeguards for LEU facilities</H3>
The application of IAEA safeguards on LEU is based on a number of criteria, specifying inspection goals whereby the <I>significant quantity</I> is an amount of uranium containing 75 kilograms of uranium-235, and the <I>timeliness goal</I> is one year. This means that the Agency, when implementing its safeguards system, shall be able to detect a diversion of at least 75 kilograms of uranium-235 contained in LEU during a time period of one year. 
<P>
An LEU fuel cycle facility processes nuclear material in bulk form. During the industrial process, nuclear materials used as feedstock may be changed isotopically, chemically, and physically. In the process, some nuclear materials also become waste products and minute quantities are discarded in waste water or otherwise discharged. A common objective for both safeguards and financial reasons is to keep the wastes and losses to the lowest levels possible. 
<P>
To reach its safeguards goals for an industrial process where bulk nuclear material is handled in various forms, the IAEA establishes a safeguards approach enabling its annual evaluation and independent verification of the facility's <I>material balance</I> over specific periods of time.
<P>
The IAEA must reach its conclusions independently from both operators and Member States. The activities to reach those conclusions, however, can be performed jointly with a State System of Accountancy and Control (SSAC) or Regional System of Accountancy and Control (RSAC). To reach the conclusions, the quantities of safeguarded material must be verified with a certain degree of confidence. 
<P>
According to the present safeguards criteria, both nuclear material in flow throughout the facility and in the facility's inventory should be independently verified. For an LEU fuel fabrication plant, the verification is to cover at least 20% of the nuclear material <I>in flow</I>, and, once a year, the operator's complete physical inventory of all nuclear material at the facility; this is done when the material balance is closed for accounting purposes. 
<P>
The Agency uses statistical methods for cost-effective verification, based on its knowledge of the facility's industrial process, and the accuracy and precision of nuclear material measurements performed by both the operator and the IAEA. Information regarding the process and measurement system applied at the facility is included in the <I>design information</I> provided to the Agency.
<P>
The information on which the Agency bases its activities is provided by the State, through the SSAC or the RSAC. Formal State reports on inventory changes are given periodically, often monthly, reflecting changes in the previous month.
<P>
<B><I>Inspections and verification activities.</I></B> During routine inspections, the Agency verifies the operator's declarations of material accountancy, i.e. the accountancy records and supporting source documents, and compares, often at headquarters, the result with the formal Inventory Change Reports submitted by the SSAC or RSAC. According to the IAEA safeguards criteria now applied, routine inspections are performed to meet the inspection goals. For an LEU fuel fabrication plant, normally five inspections should be performed for flow verification, and one for physical inventory verification during a material balance period. At an enrichment plant, monthly inspections are performed, primarily to confirm the declared enrichment (absence of enrichment above 20% uranium-235). The inspection planning is based on operational information given semi-annually and advance notifications of receipts and shipments of nuclear material. Verification of nuclear material in flow is performed by weighing and sampling for subsequent chemical analysis, as well as by non-destructive assay (NDA) for enrichment control. The importance of performing "flow inspections" becomes clear when considering that fuel cycle facilities handling nuclear material in bulk form are designed to have a large throughput and a relatively small inventory of nuclear material.
<P>
The verification of the physical inventory builds on the application of statistical methods. When comparing the inventory as registered (book inventory) with the measured inventory (physical inventory) for a facility handling nuclear material in bulk form, there is always a difference. This difference is called material unaccounted for (MUF). The statistical evaluation of the material balance leads to a conclusion whether or not the MUF is within acceptable limits. Although a large value of the MUF <I>can</I> indicate a possible diversion, the overall assessment of a possible diversion of nuclear material must be made in the broader context of a State's nuclear material declarations and the IAEA's independent verification of these declarations. 
<P>
Under the present safeguards system, the SSAC or RSAC always receives advance notification of inspections. Historically, this has been deemed necessary in order for the State and operator to prepare the nuclear material declaration and other documentation required for the inspection.
<P>
<B><I>Accountancy and control.</I></B> The safeguards system requires the operator to keep an updated register (general ledger) of the nuclear material according to agreed standards and recommendations. However, it is likely that nuclear material accountancy would be performed even if there were no safeguards requirements or system in place. Nuclear material is expensive, and accounts for a significant part of the operating cost of a nuclear reactor. It is thus in the interest of the nucleaer material's owner that the losses are kept to a minimum, and that the highest possible level of quality control is maintained. 
<P>
Nuclear material accountancy is one way for the operator to keep track of the nuclear material processed, as part of the operator's responsibilities to the owner of the material. In addition, nuclear safety and reactivity calculations require precise enrichment specifications. Unknown spikes in the enrichment of pellets in a fuel rod may cause burnout, and subsequent leakage of fission products to the cooling system, with entailing losses in the production of electricity. Even at a low level, such leakage could contribute to the general public's exposure to sources of radioactivity. For the same reason, operators of a fuel cycle facility minimize and control releases of nuclear material to the environment, as is also shown by the measurement and accountancy system. 
<P>
To maintain high quality in production, the operator of a nuclear fuel cycle facility uses advanced instruments. Rod scanners are used for enrichment control, and precision scales are used for weight determinations. In some facilities, routines have been established by which the Agency can use equipment owned by the operator. In such cases, in order to maintain independence, the Agency keeps, under seal at the facility, sources or nuclear material standards for calibration purposes. Such co-operative schemes improve efficiency during inspections, and maintain or improve the effectiveness of safeguards.
<P>
One other reason for the operator to maintain a control system is the requirement in bilateral or multilateral agreements related to nuclear non-proliferation. Nuclear supplier States require that safeguards are maintained and that nuclear material is accounted for according to specified standards. In other words, nuclear material accountancy and IAEA safeguards are prerequisites for nuclear trade, and it has been recognized that without a safeguards system of high quality, trade would be severely hampered, if not impossible.
<H3>Possible new elements of safeguards</H3>
Recent events have pointed out the need for improved safeguards, whereby the IAEA's system should not only verify the correctness and completeness of States' declarations of nuclear material but also provide credible assurances of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. A strengthened safeguards system has been proposed under the IAEA programme known as "93+2". Part 1 of the programme is being implemented under comprehensive safeguards agreements, while the new measures comprising Part 2 require additional legal authority for the IAEA. In June 1995, the IAEA Board of Governors agreed that the Agency should start implementing Part 1, and in June 1996, a Board Committee was established to work on a Protocol to complement existing comprehensive safeguards agreements. The Protocol would give the Agency the additional tools required to implement the entire strengthened safeguards system envisaged. 
<P>
For LEU fuel cycle facilities, Part 1 includes increased physical access and increased co-operation with the SSAC or RSAC, as applicable. Increased physical access includes unannounced inspections, i.e. inspections where the State is not notified in advance. Unannounced inspections can provide effectiveness and efficiency benefits when near-real-time declarations on material flows and facility operations are available. With increased access, all buildings at a <I>nuclear site</I> will be accessible for the inspector. Also important for strengthened safeguards is the <I>optimal use of the present system</I>. Enhanced information from SSACs, given by the States, provides for increased co-operation between the Agency and the national or regional authority. Increased co-operation can encompass sharing of measurement instruments, early submission to the IAEA of data available to the national or regional authority, and joint activities, provided the IAEA's independent control function can be maintained. Through greater co-operation, inconsistencies or questions could be solved in a timely manner. 
<P>
<B>Field trials.</B> Field tests of strengthened safeguards systems have been performed in Canada, Finland, and Sweden. They provided good examples of how the strengthened safeguards system could work in practice.
<P>
<B><I>Tests in Canada.</I></B> Tests in Canada showed that unannounced access could be gained to locations that are not normally accessible for safeguards purposes at a wide range of fuel cycle facilities. The facilities involved included a uranium conversion facility, a fuel fabrication facility, two multi-unit power reactor facilities, a partially decommissioned research reactor, and a nuclear research and development complex. The tests also demonstrated (as communicated by the Atomic Energy Control Board) enhanced co-operation between the Canadian SSAC and the Agency in several respects: the site-specific procedures for unannounced access developed by the operators and the SSAC were shared with the IAEA so that they would be taken into account in the development of the inspection arrangements. Specifically, the tests ranged from broad access requested during a scheduled inspection to unannounced access outside normal working hours; the measures used included environmental sampling, design information verification, visual observation, and non-destructive analysis. In every case, access was granted without delay and the IAEA was able to carry out the required activities. In a broad sense, the tests showed that procedural arrangements can be made by the SSAC, the operator, and the IAEA that will result in the successful implementation of unannounced and short-notice access to any location at nuclear facilities in Canada.
<P>
<B><I>Tests in Finland.</I></B> Field tests in Finland were focused on environmental sampling and increased co-operation with the SSAC. In-field environmental monitoring techniques were evaluated and, as a result, commercially available instrumentation was described that could be used in the environmental monitoring of LEU facilities without extensive development work.  Also successfully demonstrated was the applicability of autoradiography for screening environmental swipe samples.  The Finnish laboratories analyzed different types of samples collected during the field trials in various countries and provided valuable analytical results.  A satellite navigation and desktop mapping system was developed for determining and recording environmental sampling locations in the field.  This computerized mapping and navigation system was demonstrated to be very useful in environmental sampling outside facilities.  
<P>
Increased co-operation with the SSAC was tested by submitting the SSAC questionnaire and expanded declaration to the IAEA and by performing unannounced inspections at LWRs and at a research reactor.  As a result, experience was gained in carrying out such inspections with broader access to information and sites.  Procedures for unannounced inspections were developed and a new improved safeguards approach for WWER-type reactor facilities was worked out.
<P>
<B><I>Tests in Sweden.</I></B> The tests in Sweden were related to environmental monitoring and increased co-operation with the SSAC, including the submission of additional information  to the IAEA with near-real-time accountancy reports, unannounced inspections, SSAC information, and an expanded declaration.
<P>
More specific parts of the tests in Sweden focused on the implementation of unannounced inspections at an LEU fuel fabrication plant. A scheme of unannounced, randomized inspections was implemented in such a way that there was a non-zero probability of inspection at any day and any time during the period. The scheme required, <I>inter alia</I>, that information was provided on a weekly basis on the operational forecast of the facility. The information was provided electronically, by a secured link to the Agency. Before the test, procedures had been agreed regarding inspector visas, entry at the facility, escorts of inspectors by facility staff, and access to data in the operator's computerized nuclear material accountancy system. The results of the unannounced inspections, together with a physical inventory verification that completed the test, provided a firm basis for evaluating the approach.
<P>
The overall test results pointed to positive effects of a strengthened safeguards system for the IAEA, the national authority, and the operator. In short, due to the randomness of the unannounced inspections, the verification results obtained in these inspections could be projected to <I>all</I> the material involved in production during the material balance period. This meant a significant increase in effectiveness, from partial to full coverage of the nuclear material in flow. The increased access for inspectors allowed the performance of activities to assure the absence of undeclared activities at the facility site. 
<P>
In summary, the tested approach was shown to provide more cost-effective safeguards: the system was signficantly strengthened while the inspection effort remained at the same level. The routines applied were less intrusive for ongoing facility operations than inspections within the normal "classical" system because they were directed towards the process rather than the product. These advances compensated well for the additional work that was imposed on the operator in providing a weekly operational forecast and the establishment of routines to allow unannounced inspections at the plant to take place.
<P>
Within the Agency, a task force has recently been established to evaluate the possible safeguards approaches for LEU fuel fabrication plants, taking into consideration the applicability of different approaches in different facilities and States.
<H3>Future directions</H3>
<B>Elements in a strengthened system.</B> Further measures for strengthening safeguards being considered by the IAEA Board build on broader access to information on the State's nuclear programme, increased physical access of Agency inspectors to nuclear facilities and other nuclear sites, and the use of new techniques, primarily environmental sampling and the optimization of the present system. The objective will be <I>both</I> to verify that no diversion of nuclear material has taken place <I>and</I> the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The total effect on a country of a strengthened safeguards system depends on its nuclear programme. The system would provide for the allocation of efforts to sensitive nuclear facilities, where high-enriched uranium or plutonium is handled, and provide for less effort on less sensitive material such as low-enriched uranium, depending on assurances obtained about undeclared nuclear activities. As noted earlier, unannounced inspections can provide greater assurance of non-diversion of nuclear material, and, at the same time, provide confidence of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The possibility of taking environmental samples will be important for the latter. If environmental samples are taken during regular inspections, there will be no need for separate inspections with the attendant costs for both the IAEA and the operator.
<P>
The increased information to be provided by the State will constitute the basis for the Agency's evaluation of information. The gradually increasing confidence as to the absence of undeclared activities may provide justification for a reduction in the intensity of safeguards on declared nuclear material. Spent nuclear power fuel may be taken as an example. Although spent fuel contains plutonium, the enhanced assurance of the absence of clandestine reprocessing in a State will influence the safeguards approach. 
<P>
In some States, spent fuel will be encapsulated for permanent disposal in deep geological repositories without changes to the integrity of the fuel. In an advisory group meeting convened by the IAEA, representatives of participating States agreed that safeguards cannot be terminated for spent nuclear power fuel that is aimed to be, or has already been, deposited in a geological repository. However, it was also agreed that the measures applied should build on "continuity of knowledge", and take account of developments in the safeguards regime. Although a geological repository would contain large quantities of plutonium, safeguards measures for the site could be both effective and highly efficient - for example by applying containment and surveillance measures at the site and maintaining information about the deposited material - given the assurances provided with the strengthened safeguards system about the absence of undeclared reprocessing.
<P>
In a broad joint effort through an IAEA Safeguards Support Programme, a number of States are engaged in work related to the safeguards approach for spent fuel to be deposited in geological repositories. A joint report is due to be prepared before the next scheduled advisory group meeting that will address the matter of safeguards for the back-end of the fuel cycle.
<P>
The application of modern techniques could mark a significant change in the safeguarding of LEU fuel cycle facilities. Electronic, near-real-time transmission of accountancy and operational data could provide for both increased efficiency and effectiveness. Encryption techniques and specific transmission protocols would provide for secure transmission of data. Remote electronic transmission of authenticated measurement data would open the same opportunities for LEU facilities as remote surveillance would for nuclear reactors. Available measurement techniques provide, increasingly, the result in digital format, which is necessary for remote transmission of measurement results. The application of new techniques can, therefore, further reduce the actual inspection frequency at facilities, while maintaining or increasing the level of confidence.
<P>
<B>Towards enhanced co-operation.</B> For LEU fuel cycle facilities, the strengthened safeguards system is likely to provide a change in the relationship of the State (through the SSAC or RSAC) and the operator with the IAEA. It envisages greater co-operation through the provision of more timely information of selected operational events and the acceptance of unannounced inspections in the interests of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards.
<P>
During this evolutionary phase of safeguards development, it is worth considering that on-site inspections provide a value over and beyond their role in verifying the non-diversion of nuclear material. When the inspectors meet the operator at the facility, matters of concern can be discussed and inconsistencies or questions resolved. In all inspections or control regimes, the confidence between the parties is important. 
<P>
The IAEA's safeguards inspectors are basically there to provide a service: the assurances required by the international community that the nuclear material at the facility is used according to the non-proliferation undertakings of the State. With these assurances, the facility can maintain its credibility with the public that it is only engaged in peaceful activities, and contributes, with its industrial production, to the welfare of society. The evolving safeguards system requires, and promotes, increased co-operation between the IAEA, national or regional authorities, and the operator. In the end, its effective and efficient application is a credit to facility operators, as well as to the State and the international community.

Safeguards at light-water reactors
<BR>
Current practices, future directions </H2>
<P>
<I>Advanced verification methods for LWRs are being tested as part of IAEA efforts toward more effective and efficient safeguards</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Neil Harms and Perpetua Rodriguez</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Safeguards measures at the world's light-water-cooled reactors (LWRs) - the major type of nuclear power reactor in use today for the production of electricity - are well established. More than 220 LWRs and other types of power reactors presently are under IAEA safeguards in non-nuclear weapon States.<A HREF="#note_a">*</A>
<P>
This article addresses current IAEA safeguards practices at LWRs and also safeguards measures under consideration and development that go beyond the practices of today.
<P>
Why does the IAEA implement safeguards at nuclear power plants? How are these facilities a threat to nuclear proliferation? To answer these questions, it is important to look at the kind of nuclear materials at nuclear power plants. Excluding the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuels for the moment, LWRs use low-enriched uranium (LEU), categorized as "indirect-use" material from the standpoint of its potential use in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. After these nuclear materials have been fueled in the reactor core, the spent fuels are categorized as "direct-use" material. Plutonium contained in spent fuel, as well as fresh MOX fuels, represent a strategic material from a safeguards standpoint. This is one of the determining factors that affects the safeguards approach and the inspection goal for a facility. 
<P>
Implementation of safeguards at these facilities is covered by agreements between the State, or States, and the IAEA. To fulfill its obligations under the agreements, the IAEA carries out verification activities in order to draw its own independent safeguards conclusions. For agreements concluded under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the technical objectives of safeguards are defined in Article 28 of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) as "the timely detection of diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes unknown and deterrence of such diversion by risk of early detection". Safeguards agreements under the non-NPT system are based on guidelines contained in the document INFCIRC/66 Rev. 2; it requires that safeguards be applied to nuclear materials, facilities, equipment, and non-nuclear material and to certain technological information. The manner in which the IAEA designs the safeguards activities at these facilities is referred to as the "safeguards approach".
<H3>The classical safeguards approach</H3>
The safeguards approach is based on an analysis of all technically possible diversion paths at a facility and on the requirements of the particular safeguards agreement. The approach is also designed to counter the possible undeclared production of direct-use material. It refers to the system of nuclear materials accountancy, containment, surveillance, and other measures chosen for implementation of safeguards. The following are also taken into consideration: (i) measurement methods and techniques available to the Agency; (ii) the design features of the facility; (iii) the form and accessibility of the nuclear material; (iv) the possible existence of unsafeguarded nuclear activities; and (v) inspection experience.
<H3>The inspection goal</H3>
The inspection goal for a facility consists of a quantity component and a timeliness component. <I>(<A HREF="#table">See table</A>.)</I> The quantity component relates to the scope of the inspection activities necessary in order to provide assurance that there was no diversion of a significant quantity (SQ) of nuclear material over a material balance period (MBP). The timeliness component on the other hand relates to the periodic inspection activities necessary to provide assurance that no abrupt diversion has taken place. The inspection goal for each facility is regarded as attained if all the criteria relevant to the material types and categories present at the facility have been satisfied. In its implementation of safeguards, the Agency strives for full attainment of both components of the inspection goal.
<H3>Current safeguards implementation</H3>
How are IAEA safeguards being implemented at the present time? Fundamentally, the Agency's safeguards implementation is regulated by the IAEA Statute and by the safeguards agreements. Paragraph 2 of INFCIRC/153 (Corrected), the model for safeguards agreements, stipulates more specifically that safeguards will be applied "...for the exclusive purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices..." In the case of LWRs, the safeguards approach considers two basic tools to achieve the inspection goals:
<P>
<B><I>Item accountancy.</I></B> This includes item counting and identification, non-destructive measurements and examination to verify the continued integrity of the item.
<P>
<B><I>Containment and surveillance (C/S) measures.</I></B> These are used to complement the accountancy verification methods for safeguarding the spent fuel. Since LWR cores are usually not opened more than once per year, it is often possible to seal the reactor pressure vessel head.
<P>
The installation of a surveillance system that surveys the area where spent fuel is stored allows the Agency to detect undeclared movements of nuclear material, and potential tampering with containment and/or Agency safeguards devices.
<P>
In summary the following activities are performed to achieve IAEA inspection goals:
<P>
<UL><B><I>
<LI>Audit of accounting records and comparison with reports to the Agency;
<P>
<LI>Examination of operating records and reconciliation with accounting records;
<P>
<LI>Verification of fresh fuel before core loading.</I></B> In order to detect possible diversion of fresh fuel, the verification is carried out by item counting, serial number identification, and non-destructive assay (NDA). For facilities using fresh MOX fuel, the verification activities are carried out on a monthly basis by item counting, serial number identification, and seal verification assuming that the fuel is received from an IAEA safeguarded facility. However, in the case where fresh MOX fuel is received from unsafeguarded facilities, additional NDA measurements are performed and the fuel is maintained under seal if kept in a dry store, or under surveillance if kept in a wet store. Seal verification and/or surveillance evaluation is also carried out on a monthly basis in addition to the usual accountancy verification methods.
<P>
<B><I>Verification of fuel in the core.</I></B> The fuel is verified by item counting and serial number identification following refuelling and before the reactor vessel is closed. For facilities using fresh MOX fuel in the core, loading is either maintained under human or underwater surveillance. Soon after verification, C/S measures are applied to ensure that the reactor core remains unchanged.
<P>
<LI><B><I>Verification of spent fuel pond.</I></B> The spent fuel is verified after sealing the transfer canal gate or upon closure of the reactor core. In addition to evaluating the C/S measures applied, verification of the spent fuel by observation and evaluation of the Cerenkov glow using NDA techniques is performed.
</UL>
<P>
Each year, the IAEA issues the Safeguards Implementation Report, which records the main conclusions reached, draws attention to deficiencies, and recommends corrective actions. The problems encountered include inconclusive surveillance, lack of appropriate equipment, incomplete safeguards measures, difficulties in the verification of some nuclear materials, restrictions on planning inspections, inspector designations, and some other administrative problems indirectly affecting the IAEA's goal attainment.
<P>
With the experience gained from these problems, recommended steps to minimize their occurrence have greatly improved safeguards implementation. In countries of the European Union, an agreement has been reached between the Agency and EURATOM to work on co-operative activities (referred to as the New Partnership Approach) which has resulted in a reduction of inspection effort and introduction of new surveillance systems. Equipment has been improved to cope with difficult facility conditions where traditional equipment has failed to provide conclusive verification results. Co-operation from the operators has also resulted in additional improvements for the safeguards approach of some facilities.
<H3>Programme 93+2 and future directions</H3>
Recent events have demonstrated the need for the IAEA's safeguards system to provide credible assurances not only regarding declared nuclear activities but also regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The system based on material accountancy has proved to be reliable in providing assurance about the peaceful use of declared material and declared facilities and installations. However, the system can be strengthened and made more efficient with new measures, in particular by improving the Agency's capability to detect undeclared activities in States having comprehensive safeguards agreements. The need for strengthening measures that would go beyond the scope of the existing safeguards agreements has been emphasized. This gave birth to what is called "Programme 93+2", the purpose of which is to provide the most effective overall approach to strengthen safeguards and, concurrently, to reduce the frequency of some other measures, thereby saving costs.
<P>
<B><I>Remote Monitoring Systems.</I></B> As a step towards the IAEA's objective of reducing inspection costs at LWRs while improving safeguards efficiency and effectiveness, a field trial using a Remote Monitoring System (RMS) has been undertaken in a semi-static storage facility in a co-operative effort between Switzerland and the Agency. The RMS currently being tested is based on an all digital approach which facilitates image and data handling (for example, information on Agency seals), transmission, processing, and storage. The communication system is independent of the monitoring system. The equipment has sufficient internal data storage and battery power, allowing the system to gather images and data in the event of loss of the network connection and/or facility power. The "state of health" data regarding system operation and its environment is provided to monitor equipment performance and malfunctions. The system provides near-real-time information, depending on how images and data acquisitions are set up. The use of RMS at an LWR facility is anticipated to be in conjunction with a reduced number of interim inspections, either announced or unannounced. An unannounced inspection would mean that the State and the operator would be informed of the Agency's intention to perform such an inspection only when the IAEA inspector arrives at the entrance to the facility. 
<P>
Assuming the use of advanced technology, for example an RMS in an LWR facility, how would it affect the current safeguards implementation?  At LWRs where currently three to four quarterly interim inspections are done per year, the number of inspections could be less, probably one unannounced inspection in addition to the physical inventory verification. At LWRs having fresh MOX fuel present, the current monthly interim inspections performed per year could be reduced, possibly to two to four unannounced inspections. The result - from the synergistic effect of combining routine inspections, unannounced inspections providing broad access at locations identified in the Expanded Declaration, increased co-operation with State Systems of Accounting and Control (SSAC), advanced C/S technology, and more frequent declarations by facility operators of certain operational and nuclear material transfer data - would be increased assurance regarding the exclusively peaceful use of facilities and the absence of undeclared activities. 
<P>
When considering an alternative safeguards approach, it is useful to include the perspective of those parties directly affected by IAEA safeguards at LWRs, that is, facility operators and the SSAC in a particular State.
<P>
Every IAEA safeguards inspection is seen as an "interruption" to the nuclear facility operator's routine activities. How do facility operators regard safeguards inspections during a refueling outage when their time is heavily occupied with maintenance and shutdown activities? How much time is involved for a normal routine safeguards inspection? The following items could be given due consideration:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reduction of the number of IAEA inspections, especially during refueling and maintenance outages;
<P>
<LI>For LWRs receiving fresh MOX fuel, possible co-ordination of IAEA verification with other State (shipper) regulatory functions to minimize handling and reduce radiation exposure to personnel;
<P>
<LI>Implementation of improved unattended monitoring and surveillance systems to reduce inspection frequency and costs, while maintaining and improving safeguards effectiveness; these systems may transmit the information directly to the Agency for near-real-time analysis;
<P>
<LI>Increase in the use of computerized operator records by IAEA inspectors to facilitate auditing in a timely and efficient manner;
<P>
<LI>Reaching a practical working agreement between the SSAC and the specific Operations Division in the IAEA to utilize a manageable number of designated inspectors familiar with the specific plant layout and procedures. The intent is to avoid seeing new inspectors every time. If a "core" of designated inspectors who would most likely conduct inspections were identified at the beginning of the calendar year, the SSAC could take the necessary measures to facilitate the administrative requirements of the operators with reference to security and radiation safety and ease the bureaucratic procedures sometimes encountered during inspections; this, however, may require more freedom in scheduling inspections, or more inspectors;
<P>
<LI>Scheduling of IAEA inspections to be performed within the day shift (e.g., 08:00 hrs to 18:00 hrs) to ensure availability of facility personnel knowledgeable about IAEA safeguards. There may be unavoidable exceptions to this, e.g., re-fueling activities involving loading of fresh MOX fuel into the core. Also, it is important that the shift staff is informed of IAEA equipment needs, for example, maintaining adequate lighting in areas where IAEA surveillance equipment is installed, or concerning actions to be taken in case an IAEA seal is broken.
</UL>
<H3>Towards greater co-operation</H3>
The classical safeguards approach is applied to the majority of LWRs currently under IAEA safeguards around the world. It utilizes a combination of routine interim and physical inventory verification inspections. It incorporates nuclear material item accountancy, containment and surveillance, and other measures required to establish confidence that no unsafeguarded nuclear activities have taken place.
<P>
As part of IAEA efforts to devise an improved safeguards approach for light-water reactors, the IAEA is currently studying the possibility, under the mandate of Programme 93+2, of establishing a network of unattended near-real-time surveillance systems at selected LWRs within a State. The information gained from such a network would be supplemented by IAEA inspections at some reduced frequency, and would likely be unannounced. It might also be expected that the inspector, during his infrequent inspections, would need greater access to the plant site. Cost savings resulting from this new approach would, in part, depend upon the particular fuel cycle and number of facilities to be inspected.
<P>
A reformulation in the requirements for IAEA timeliness goals - through the use of advanced technology and/or through accumulating assurance regarding the absence of undeclared activities (particularly undeclared reprocessing or enrichment) - would also provide a basis for reducing costs in implementing safeguards on declared material in the natural and low-enriched uranium fuel cycles.

<HR>
<P>
Approximately 180 research reactors and critical assemblies currently are under IAEA safeguards. The vast majority of the research reactors operate at relatively low power levels (10 megawatts-thermal or lower) and the critical assemblies at virtually zero power.<A HREF="#note_a">*</A> From a safeguards standpoint, this is important since a reactor's power level is a determining factor of its capability to produce plutonium. Along with high-enriched uranium (HEU) and uranium-233, plutonium is considered a "direct use" material which could be diverted for the production of nuclear weapons. 
<P>
In this article, the IAEA's safeguards implementation at research reactors is addressed, including aspects related to diversion and clandestine production scenarios and main verification activities. Additionally addressed are new safeguards measures that are being introduced for purposes of providing assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities.
<H3>Safeguarding research reactors</H3>
Several types of research reactors are in operation. A very common type of research reactor is the swimming pool reactor which typically operates at power levels around or below 10 megawatts-thermal. The fuel elements normally consist of HEU (enriched to contain 20% or more of the isotope uranium-235) or low-enriched uranium (LEU, containing less than 20% uranium-235) contained in aluminum alloy plates, rods, or tubes. The reactor core is immersed in a large pool of water that provides both cooling and neutron moderation. The fuel assemblies in the core of a swimming pool reactor are normally visible and accessible for safeguards measurements.
<P>
Other types of research reactors operate at higher power levels (exceeding 10 megawatts-thermal). They need more powerful heat removal systems and are therefore normally enclosed in core vessels and equipped with coolant pumps and heat exchangers. The fuel elements in the reactor core at these installations are usually not visible or accessible for safeguards measurements.
<P>
Research reactors are widely used for scientific investigations and various applications. Neutrons produced by research reactors provide a powerful tool for studying matter on nuclear, atomic, and molecular levels. Neutrons often are used as probes by nuclear and solid state physicists, chemists, and biologists. Neutron experiments can also be performed outside the biological shield by means of installed beam tubes. Additionally, specimens can be positioned in or near research reactor cores for neutron irradiation, e.g. to produce radioactive isotopes for medical or research use.
<P>
<B>Diversion scenarios.</B> Under existing comprehensive safeguards agreements, the IAEA has the right and obligation to verify that no nuclear material is diverted from peaceful use to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. States conclude these agreements with the IAEA pursuant to their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). 
<P>
For research reactors, the following diversion scenarios are considered:
<P>
<B><I>Diversion of fresh or slightly irradiated fuel for clandestine chemical extraction of fissile material.</I></B> This scenario - for which commonly available chemical engineering equipment would be adequate - is given particular safeguards attention at facilities where the fresh fuel contains HEU or plutonium, for which no further transmutation or enrichment would be needed for use in a nuclear explosive device. About 20 research reactors under IAEA safeguards are currently using such direct-use fissile material in amounts equal to more than one significant quantity (SQ). For safeguards purposes, one SQ is currently defined as 8 kilograms plutonium or uranium-233 or 25 kilograms of uranium-235 in HEU.
<P>
International efforts - for example, under the US Reduced Enrichment Research and Test Reactor programme - have been directed at developing the technology needed to use LEU instead of HEU fuel in research and test reactors without significant degradation in their performance for experiments, costs, or safety aspects.
<P>
<B><I>Diversion of spent or extensively irradiated fuel for clandestine chemical extraction of fissile material in a reprocessing facility.</I></B> This scenario is technically more demanding and time-consuming than the one mentioned above because of the high level of radioactivity from the fuel which is involved. However, it is of particular concern at about 15 research reactors under IAEA safeguards due to large accumulated quantities of spent fuel, and it is of importance at more than 10 others.
<P>
<B>Clandestine production scenarios.</B> The possibility exists for clandestine production of plutonium or uranium-233 through irradiation of undeclared fertile material. As techniques for using neutrons have developed, there has been an accompanying need for higher levels of neutron flux in order to carry out more complex and time-consuming experiments in a shorter time. Large research reactors have been constructed to provide these flux levels. At such reactors, production of substantial quantities of plutonium or uranium-233 through irradiation of undeclared fertile material would be technically feasible. This could be achieved, for example, by placing target materials in irradiation positions in or near the core, or by replacing reflector elements by fertile material targets. However, studies have shown that it is not possible to produce one SQ of plutonium in one year at a research reactor that operates below about 25 megawatts-thermal. The actual production capability depends on the individual reactor design and operating parameters.
<P>
The Agency's current safeguards system requires that all research reactors operating at power levels above 25 megawatts-thermal are evaluated with respect to their capability to produce at least one SQ of plutonium (or uranium-233) per year. 
<P>
At present, there are about 30 thermal research reactors with power levels of 10 megawatts-thermal or higher which are subject to IAEA safeguards. About 10 of these operate at power levels exceeding 25 megawatts-thermal and are subject to additional safeguards measures with respect to the clandestine production scenarios.
<H3>Elements of "classical" IAEA safeguards </H3>
Currently, the IAEA's principal inspection activities at research reactors are an annual physical inventory verification (PIV); inspections serving timely detection purposes for fresh (unirradiated) fuel, core fuel, and spent fuel; auditing of records and reports; verification of specific types of fuel transfers; and verification activities to confirm the absence of clandestine irradiation of fertile material.
<P>
At the PIV, the fresh fuel and spent fuel are verified using non-destructive assay (NDA) methods to confirm that all declared fuel is accounted for. Core fuel is verified by NDA methods or by a criticality check corroborated by other reactor data.<A HREF="#note_b">**</A> Interim inspections are performed at research reactors at intervals determined by the safeguards timeliness requirements for specific inventories of different material types.<A HREF="#note_c">***</A> If more than one SQ is present at a facility, verifications of the core fuel and spent fuel are carried out four times per calendar year at quarterly intervals, while verification of fresh fuel containing HEU and plutonium are carried out 12 times per calendar year at monthly intervals. Verifications of fresh fuel containing less than one SQ of HEU or plutonium are carried out four times per calendar year at quarterly intervals if more than one SQ of HEU or plutonium (fresh and irradiated) is present at the facility.
<P>
Transfers of fuel and experimental material containing HEU, plutonium, or uranium-233 into or out of a facility are verified either at the shipping or receiving facility if shipments are sealed by the Agency, or at both the shipping and receiving facilities if the shipment is not sealed.
<P>
To check that there has been no unrecorded production at high-power research reactors (greater than 25 megawatts-thermal) of one SQ of plutonium or uranium-233, one of the following procedures are used:
<P>
<LU>
<LI>analysis of the facility design and operations;
<P>
<LI>containment and surveillance (C/S), among other measures (e.g. power monitoring), which confirm that the reactor is shut down or has not operated for a sufficient period;
<P>
<LI>performance of one of the following activities: 1) the use of C/S measures to confirm that no unrecorded introduction of fertile materials or their removal after irradiation has taken place; or 2) evaluation of the fresh fuel consumption and the operator's data on spent fuel burnup to confirm that they are in conformance with declared design information and reactor operations.
</UL>
<P>
Information of relevance to safeguards about the design of the research reactor is provided to the Agency by the State. It is examined and verified according to established Agency procedures and is re-examined at least once a year. When modifications or changes in design information relevant to safeguards occur, they are verified to establish the basis for adjustment of safeguards procedures, and the necessary adjustments are then implemented.
<H3>Elements of strengthened safeguards at research reactors</H3>
In June 1995, the IAEA Board of Governors endorsed the general direction for a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards system, under Part 1 of what is known as "Programme 93+2". Part 1 measures are those that can be implemented under the Agency's existing legal authority provided in comprehensive safeguards agreements.
<P>
Some measures designed to increase the efficiency and improve the effectiveness of safeguards are of a general nature. They include early provision of design information; and description of the State's nuclear fuel cycle.
<P>
Other measures are more specific to particular facilities. They include the description and status of the research and development activities, in particular related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing; environmental sampling at strategic points selected for routine inspections; unannounced routine inspections to confirm declared nuclear activities and the absence of undeclared nuclear activities; unattended monitoring and remote transmission of safeguards information.
<P>
The continuous development of new technologies also brings to light the possibility of new safeguards measurements and surveillance systems, which allow the remote operation of equipment and remote transmission of safeguards data. The impact of these new measures on the operators and States will depend very much on the type of nuclear facilities and the particular States or areas where these facilities are located.
<P>
An essential component in introducing the proposed measures is the increased co-operation with the States and the State System of Accounting and Control (SSAC) for nuclear material. This is needed to enable the IAEA to plan and conduct inspection activities more efficiently. The SSACs and IAEA may also carry out inspections or selected support activities jointly in order to economize resources and to make optimal use of the present system. The co-ordinated and efficient use of the new measures will reduce the current effort of safeguarding declared nuclear material and at the same time will enhance detection capability of possible undeclared nuclear activities and material.
<P>
As mentioned earlier, the frequency of inspections at research reactors varies from one to 12 per year, depending on the type and quantity of nuclear material present at the facility. The current inspection activities are planned in such a way as to provide assurance that the declared nuclear material remains under safeguards. It is more difficult within the present system to give assurance that the reactor has not been used to produce undeclared plutonium or uranium-233 by undeclared operations, in particular if the produced quantity of undeclared fissile material is much less than one SQ (e.g. 2 kg or less of plutonium per year).
<P>
For facilities now inspected 12 times per year, measures can be taken during these frequent inspections to check for possible undeclared operations. In other research facilities where the quantities of declared nuclear material are below one SQ, the frequency of inspections is normally once per year, or for some larger research reactors, two inspections per year. In these cases the new measures can considerably contribute to improving the Agency's capability to provide assurance regarding the absence of undeclared activities.
<P>
Measures which are presently being introduced under the IAEA's existing legal authority include:
<P>
<B><I>Environmental sampling.</I></B> The irradiation of targets and their subsequent dissolution in a hot cell to extract, for example, plutonium might be successfully concealed from the classical safeguards measures, particularly if the quantities produced are much less than one SQ. Where the inspections are announced and the frequency is limited to once per year, it might be possible to conceal the undeclared activity and interrupt it before the IAEA inspection is carried out. However, in any chemical process used to separate fissile material, small amounts of material would migrate to the surroundings of the area where this material is processed. Even though great care were taken to prevent losses, traces of this activity could remain and could be detected by the sophisticated and highly sensitive analytical methods used on environmental swipe samples.
<P>
The impact which these analytical techniques will have on facility operations is low, since the sampling is carried out by taking swipe samples inside or outside hot cells during regular inspections; little preparation is required by the operator.
<P>
<B><I>Unannounced inspections.</I></B> Unannounced inspections are those where the State and the operator are first informed of the Agency's intention to carry out an inspection at the time when the IAEA inspector arrives at the entrance of the site. The State's co-operation is necessary since the implementation of such inspections requires that the State grant multiple-entry visas or allow entry without visas to the inspectors. In addition, arrangements have to be made by the operator to grant access to the Agency inspector to the facility in a short time. The facility operator needs to be prepared for an unannounced inspection at any time. The benefit is that an assurance about the absence of undeclared activities at the facility at the time of the inspection implies that this has been the case with certain probability over the whole time interval since the last on-site inspection.
<P>
<B><I>Remote monitoring.</I></B> These types of systems include:
<P>
<I>Video surveillance.</I> The installation of cameras which can be operated remotely would allow continuous surveillance of facility operations and reduce the possibility that undeclared activities could be carried out undetected. This technique is not intrusive to the operator, since the only requirement is continuous and sufficient illumination of the area under surveillance.
<P>
<I>Measurement and accountancy data.</I> Remote transmission of inspection data would provide additional assurance that no undeclared activities have taken place, particularly when used in connection with unannounced inspections. The extent to which the necessary equipment can be used in a facility depends on the facility conditions and operating practices and requires the co-operation of the State, the SSAC, and the facility operator, who will be operating the equipment that provides the data for use by the IAEA.
<P>
The utilization of remote monitoring will enable a reduction in the requirement for inspectors to be physically present, with additional reductions in intrusiveness in facility operations. <I>(See <A HREF="#table">table</A> for a general overview of the verification capabilities provided using new safeguards measures at research reactors.)</I>
<H3>Future co-operative efforts</H3>
Over the past years, the IAEA and its Member States have been taking steps to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system. The objective is to provide assurances that a State's declared nuclear material remains in peaceful use and that no undeclared nuclear activities and material are known to exist.
<P>
The "classical" safeguards system based on the accountancy of nuclear material has proved to be reliable in providing assurances about the peaceful use of declared material and declared facilities and installations. However, the system needs to be further strengthened with respect to providing assurances about undeclared nuclear materials and activities.
<P>
Some of the new safeguards measures that have already been approved are aimed to strengthen the system and have to some extent already been introduced. They considerably improve the capability of detecting the diversion of declared nuclear material and the production of undeclared nuclear material. However, they are not capable of determining the quantity of undeclared nuclear material produced through undeclared activities. Attaining such verification objectives would require greater co-operative efforts and additional safeguards measures. 
<P>
At the present time, the IAEA Board of Governors is considering further measures for strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards. The extent to which additional measures can be implemented will depend upon the outcome of its work.

<P>
<I>The civilian nuclear industry has long backed the need for an effective system of nuclear verification</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Gerald Clark</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
There was considerable relief among the Members of the Uranium Institute in May 1995 that the Conference in New York to discuss the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) had agreed without a vote on permanent extension of the Treaty. The Institute had campaigned for this result. It was a matter of vital importance to its members that the international safeguards regime which had served the civil nuclear industry well for more than 25 years should be thus extended permanently. The terms which were agreed as the price of permanent extension were also fundamentally in the industry's long-term interests.
<P>
It is worth examining why this should have been so. Ever since US President Eisenhower launched the civil nuclear age with his Atoms for Peace speech at the United Nations in December 1953 the civil industry has been at pains to show that it is an independent endeavour, quite separate from and in no way linked to the ambitions of ministries of defence. For many years this was an exceedingly difficult, almost impossible task. The civil applications of nuclear energy had their origins in the Manhattan project culminating in the two atom bombs which brought the Second World War to an end, and for many decades after that nuclear rivalry between the superpowers inevitably was uppermost in the public mind. The horrors of a possible nuclear war, fortunately never realized, held a far stronger grip on the public imagination than the developments, however impressive, of the closely related civilian technology.
<P>
Nevertheless, as the civilian technology became more distinctive, and its objective, the economic safe and efficient generation of electricity, became an end in itself, it became easier to show that the putative linkage between the two was more imaginary than real. It was also possible to take internationally inspected measures to demonstrate that the work of the civil industry need have no connection with attempts, overt and clandestine, real and imagined, to embark on a nuclear weapons programme.
<H3>The civil/military split</H3>
Historically none of the existing five acknowledged weapons States used a civilian programme of nuclear power generation as a stepping stone to their nuclear arms manufacture. Rather the reverse was true. Electricity was a by-product of the early plutonium producers, but once electricity generation became the primary aim, it was also seen that it should be pursued for its own sake, and weapons material production became the province of specially dedicated installations. One reason for this was the usual obsession with national security, but the need to discriminate between appropriate technologies became a more important reason. The retrieval of weapons grade plutonium is incompatible with maximising the output of electricity even from channel reactors. The natural or low-enriched uranium fuel of present day power reactors is unusable as bomb material. Enrichment to the required degree to deliver weapons grade highly enriched uranium involves taking the process much further, involving far more extensive cascades than would be found in a civilian plant.
<P>
In other words, for both technical and economic reasons, misuse of the civil technology for weapons production is not the best way to proceed, and in practice the weapons States and the "would be" weapons States have not gone down that route. The development of a civil nuclear power programme is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the pursuit of a weapons programme. However, the civil industry does make use of materials and technical skills which are commonly also used in nuclear weapons programmes. There is thus an onus on it to collaborate fully with any regulatory system which is designed to show that there has been no diversion of material away from legitimate civilian purposes.
<P>
It is implicit in the IAEA Statute that it should devise a safeguards system which does just that. The system developed naturally as the technology spread. The arrangements already established by EURATOM for its members were a model. The arrival of the NPT, which came into force in 1970, was the signal for a much more comprehensive system: that of full-scope safeguards, where a signatory country has to apply the Agency's safeguards system to all its nuclear materials. In the course of the next 25 years the value of the system gradually became apparent, not only to the arms-control community, but to the civil nuclear industry, which came to realise the value of the certificate of good conduct which its willing collaboration with the safeguards system provided.
<P>
It is easy to deduce from what has been said above that safeguards are more essential for ensuring non-diversion in some parts of the nuclear fuel cycle than in others. Mining, milling, processing and conversion, all of which take place with natural uranium only, are relatively innocuous. The material is far from usable directly in a weapon, and, were it to be diverted, the diverter would still face an enormous task to achieve his ends. It is much more important for the civil industry to be able to demonstrate that the materials arising from enrichment and from recycling are subject to safeguards, and that no diversion has taken place.
<H3>Forty years of success</H3>
The IAEA and the civil nuclear industry have together developed a safeguards system which has worked well for nearly 40 years. Diversion of material from the civil industry has not taken place. Even those examples which have been held to call the safeguards regime into question, and are the catalysts for current measures to extend the system, are not so much failures of the system but demonstrations that it has worked. Iraq realised that diversion from its existing civil programmes (all of which by 1991 were research reactors and not power generating reactors) would inevitably be detected, so went to very expensive lengths to start its weapons programme from scratch, quite separately from its civil research programme. The imbroglio over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) arose because the IAEA noticed that its rules for the implementation of an INFCIRC-153 type agreement were being flouted, and the DPRK refused to put its house ostensibly in order.
<P>
The civil industry had thus come by 1995 to have a lot at stake in the continued health of the international safeguards system. Nuclear power generation is a very long-term business. The existence of a long lasting, preferably permanent, system of international regulation and control has become a necessary condition for the continued existence of a healthy trade in civil nuclear materials and technology. The general acceptance of the IAEA system of safeguards and related measures of materials accountancy and other forms of control is of great benefit to companies and countries involved in the civil nuclear trade. There are now general rules of practice. Much of the trade is mundane and normal. The shipment for which special arrangements have to be made is the exception not the norm. The designers of the Treaty presumably had this in mind in drafting its Article IV. From an industrial perspective, the Treaty has worked. Nuclear power generation has spread from the handful of countries which were pioneers in the 1950s and early 1960s to 30 countries, and nuclear electricity is now 17% of the world's supply.
<P>
The spread of nuclear technology has not been confined to nuclear power generation. Much of the world relies to a far greater extent than most people realise on the medical, industrial and agricultural applications of radioisotope technology. While some may think that this is relatively small beer, an interesting paper by the American Nuclear Society has demonstrated that in the United States the industries which rely on these technologies are about four and a half times as large as the power-based nuclear industry. Since 1980 the IAEA has processed over $500 million worth of technical assistance in these technologies. None of it would have been possible without the international safeguards system.
<H3>Universal application</H3>
After 25 years of operation the application of the NPT has become almost universal. Compared with the early years when there were many important countries which were not members of the Treaty, and other regulatory arrangements for the civil nuclear trade were still in widespread use, the present membership of the Treaty has expanded to 184, with very few exceptions remaining outside its ambit. It has therefore become the main regulatory system, with most other arrangements dependent upon it. Even if some of the NPT's achievement of virtually global coverage is of very recent date, the accreditation of members in the last five years is as important for the regulation of the civil trade as for arms control.
<P>
The world political climate has completely changed compared with the 1960s when the Treaty was negotiated. The existence of the Treaty has contributed to that change. Countries have gradually become comfortable with the regulatory regime it imposes. The change in climate is perhaps best demonstrated by the contrast between governmental attitudes to the safeguards system in the early years and now. When the Treaty was under negotiation, the proposal for international inspection of areas of activity so close to vital national security interests was an unprecedented intrusion into national sovereignty. This could clearly be seen in the minimalist view of international inspection in support of the safeguards regime which animated the drafting of Article III of the Treaty, and the related "INFCIRC 153" type agreements on the application of safeguards.
<P>
Whereas safeguards were originally seen as very intrusive, to the extent that some important States hesitated long before joining the Treaty, there is now strong pressure to extend the system. While there may be differences about the scope of measures to strengthen the system, the principle that it should be strengthened is almost universally accepted. This presents no problems of principle to the civil nuclear industry as it has every interest in the wide acceptance of a well respected and effective regulatory regime. The civil industry is well aware that, if the Treaty had not existed the spread of the benefits of civil nuclear energy would not have been as widespread as they are. But obviously we want to ensure that the implementation of any such "improvements" does not raise serious obstacles to the legitimate trade permitted under the Treaty.
<P>
I have so far set out the general arguments why the civil nuclear trade supported the permanent extension of the international safeguards system enshrined in the NPT. Above all, its application over the first 25 years of the Treaty has demonstrated that the expansion of the civil nuclear industry across the world has not led, and does not need to lead, to proliferation of nuclear weapons. (In the 1960s it was widely assumed that by now there would be 20-30 nuclear weapons States. There are still only five declared weapons States, and fewer "threshold" States.) The Treaty has achieved what it set out to achieve in this regard.
<H3>Costs and benefits</H3>
But it is not without cost to nuclear operators. It is often forgotten in the hurly-burly of diplomatic in-fighting that the system is not an abstract construct but has to be implemented meticulously and constantly, not so much by the inspectors of EURATOM or the IAEA, as by the industrial enterprises which they inspect.
<P>
The safeguards requirements stemming from the facility attachments required as an integral part of the INFCIRC 153-type agreements which the Treaty enjoins upon its signatories clearly vary from installation to installation. Little has hitherto been published concerning the costs which the nuclear industry has to bear in order to comply with these requirements. The Uranium Institute did some work on the subject when preparing briefings for the delegates to the NPT Extension Conference, and the figures which follow are based on that work. Our estimates are inevitably very broad, as there are a number of factors, some of which balance each other out, which are very difficult to quantify. These costs arise both in the construction of installations and in operating them. 
<P>
We estimate that for a new nuclear power station the increase in capital cost, attributable to measures which make it possible to demonstrate that safeguards requirements are being met, lies in the range 0.1- 0.2% of the total cost of the station. This implies a total capital cost of between $2 million and $4 million for a nuclear power station costing $2 billion. For nuclear facilities in which plutonium is being processed, such as reprocessing plants and MOX fuel-fabrication plants, the costs of safeguards equipment are an order of magnitude higher, and lie in the range 1-2%. Thus the additional capital cost in the case of a reprocessing plant costing $4 billion would be from $40 million to $80 million. For a MOX fabrication plant costing $400 million, the extra capital cost would be from $4 million to $8 million.
<P>
We estimate that the effect on operating costs of the aggregated effort, and associated expenditure of the industrial enterprises in countries which are party to safeguards, is comparable to the safeguards-related expenditures of the inspecting organisations, the IAEA and EURATOM. In other words, the industry's collective annual operational costs worldwide, ascribable to safeguards-related activities, are of the order of $100 million.
<P>
The industry has come to see that this is a price well worth paying for an effective Non-Proliferation regime as it carries with it the associated bonus of a smooth flow of trade in nuclear technologies round the world. It is not surprising that the permanent extension of the NPT was regarded by the Uranium Institute's members as a triumph of good sense. They were not in the least dismayed by the fact that the concessions its supporters had to make in order to achieve it on something akin to a consensus basis included negotiations towards a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, preliminary moves towards a fissile materials cut-off agreement, and of most relevance to the civil industry, the IAEA's plans for strengthening safeguards, "the 93+2 Programme". The industry has kept a close watch on these developments, and while it accepts that a strengthening of the system is desirable, it is concerned that the resultant arrangements should be in accord with the principles of good materials accountancy, and should not bear unduly on countries with a good record of compliance.

<H2>Safeguards & illicit nuclear trafficking
<BR>Towards more effective control</H2>
<P>
<I>In important respects, elements of effective safeguards can assist States in their efforts against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Svein Thorstensen</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Reported cases of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials have focused international attention on ways to combat an emerging phenomenom of the 1990s. Many of the nearly 130 confirmed cases reported to the IAEA over the past three years have involved individuals trying to illegally sell radioactive sources used in medicine or industry whose unauthorized use or movement poses a danger to public health. Some other cases have involved samples of weapons-grade material confiscated from individuals. The incidents have raised public and governmental concerns and have prompted stronger efforts to prevent illicit nuclear trafficking by State authorities, including their greater co-operation with supporting international organizations such as the IAEA. 
<P>
In April 1996, the Nuclear Safety and Security Summit convened in Moscow underlined the importance of States working together to combat the trafficking problem. In reaffirming their concerns, State leaders recognized the need for countries to co-operate bilaterally, multilaterally and through the IAEA to ensure effective national systems for controlling nuclear materials.
<P>
Over recent years, States have requested the IAEA to assist relevant State, regional, and international authorities working to prevent cases of illicit trafficking. The Agency's work encompasses maintaining an authoritative database on trafficking incidents; assisting in the development of national systems of control; and providing technical support related to areas of physical protection. It involves establishing closer collaboration with organizations on the front line of efforts to combat illicit trafficking, especially law enforcement bodies and customs authorities principally responsible for detection and prevention.
<P>
This article looks at the issue of illicit nuclear trafficking from the perspective of nuclear safeguards. It examines some ways in which essential elements of an effective safeguards system can contribute to the efforts of States against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials that could be of use for weapons production. Particularly addressed are aspects related to the accounting and control of nuclear material and technical assistance that States can receive to establish or strengthen such control systems. The article does not address aspects related to radiation protection and safety involving radioactive sources that could pose a public health danger but that are of little or no concern from the standpoint of nuclear proliferation.<A HREF="#note_a">*</A>
<P>
For context, it is important to note that the main purpose of IAEA safeguards is not directed at illicit nuclear trafficking, which is a complex and multi-dimensional safety and security issue. All States - including those having no known nuclear material on their territories - are vulnerable to such trafficking. This fact underscores the need for co-ordinated actions - not only within a State but also among States - including consideration of relevant support that could be derived through elements of an effective system of nuclear safeguards.
<P>
<B>Establishing effective countermeasures.</B> Legitimate trade in nuclear material is conducted under the authority and within the limitations of State regulation. States have the direct responsibility to assure proper security for nuclear material, as well as its proper handling, control and accounting. Consequently, any State which is determined to combat illicit trafficking must create a solid regulatory infrastructure that includes <I>prevention</I>, <I>response</I>, and <I>training</I>.
<P>
<B><I>Prevention.</I></B> The most important precondition for preventing illicit trafficking is an effective national control system for nuclear materials. These control systems must be based on legislation and regulations that incorporate modern standards and meet the State's obligations and commitments arising from international treaties and conventions to which it is a party. They must also include mechanisms at the State level for preventing, detecting, and deterring unauthorized activities. Nuclear materials require systems and procedures for accountability and control, physical protection, and export/import control.
<P>
<I>Accounting and control of nuclear material.</I> A primary deterrent to the theft of nuclear material is a strong regulatory system that recognizes the complementary nature of material accounting and control and physical protection regulations and associated procedures. Material accounting and control is designed to ensure that the location of all nuclear material in a State is known and its continuing presence confirmed through the taking of periodic inventory.
<P>
Of relevance here is the fact that under comprehensive safeguards agreements concluded with the IAEA, a State must establish a State System of Accounting and Control (SSAC) of nuclear material on a national or regional basis. The SSAC co-operates closely with the IAEA in the implementation of safeguards, regularly providing the Agency with information on matters related to the nuclear material accountancy system in force and the State's adherence to the reporting requirements. Both at the time a comprehensive safeguards agreement is concluded as well as upon specific request, the IAEA assists States in establishing effective procedures and routines for the SSAC, both at the State and facility levels. 
<P>
<I>Legislation and regulations.</I> The foundation  of a strong national control system is appropriate legislation and regulations.  For most States,  the basic international obligations for nuclear material are contained in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the mandated comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA. In States where such a safeguards agreement is in force, the IAEA is obliged to verify the presence of nuclear material subject to safeguards, and the State is obliged, among other things, to report to the IAEA if the State believes there is or may have been a loss of nuclear material.
<P>
When requested by a State, the IAEA has supported national activities in the area of legislation and regulations. This is being done because the State wants to ensure that its legal and regulatory framework meets international standards, taking into account its commitments to international conventions and agreements. 
<P>
<I>Physical protection.</I> Another component involved in prevention of illicit trafficking is a system of physical protection against the theft or unauthorized diversion of nuclear material and against sabotage of nuclear facilities. The responsibility for establishing and operating a comprehensive physical protection system for nuclear material and facilities within a State rests entirely with the Government of that State. In order to ensure that adequate physical protection is provided, State systems must establish conditions which minimize the possibilities of unauthorized removal of nuclear material or of sabotage; provide rapid and comprehensive measures to locate and recover missing nuclear material; and minimize the effects of sabotage. Physical protection regulations and associated procedures must thus be designed to thwart any attempted theft and to promptly detect an actual theft.
<P>
In this area, nuclear authorities from a number of States have asked the IAEA for technical support and advice. In April 1996, a new IAEA service known as the International Physical Protection and Advisory Service was formed to assist interested IAEA Member States which request specific types of assistance. Under the service, an international team of experts reviews national regulatory programmes for the physical protection of nuclear material and/or for the implementation of physical protection systems at specific nuclear facilities. The IAEA also has provided extensive training courses in physical protection for responsible personnel in a number of States.
<P>
<I>Export/import control.</I> Prevention of illicit trafficking further requires an effective State control system on exports and imports which serves to prevent unauthorized movement of nuclear material across borders.  States initiate and establish such measures by means of legislation and their national systems of controls on the handling and use of such materials.
<P>
Besides the systems and procedures specifically implemented in the area of nuclear activities, such measures must engage conventional components in a State's anti-trafficking infrastructure, for example, law enforcement authorities and customs officials. The extent to which such components are utilized, and the way in which they are organized and co-ordinated, depends on the specific conditions in each country.
<P>
Some elements associated with nuclear safeguards are of relevance on the general matter of exports and imports. Under the proposed IAEA strengthened safeguards system, complementary legal authority is being sought that would obligate States having comprehensive safeguards agreements to report to the IAEA exports and imports of nuclear material and specified non-nuclear material and equipment. This would also enable the Agency to assess whether import and export patterns are consistent with other information available to it about States' nuclear programmes. The IAEA's information database also is being improved by including available information derived from open source literature, obtained through the Agency's verification activities, provided to the Agency by governments, or obtained elsewhere. These activities are important components of a strengthened safeguards system which can also support States's co-operative efforts in combating illicit trafficking.
<P>
<B><I>Response to illicit trafficking.</I></B> Only State authorities can be responsible for detecting and responding to illicit trafficking activities on their territory. However, no clear minimum requirements exist on what measures are necessary to meet this responsibility. 
<P>
In some countries, the anti-trafficking infrastructure - which encompasses responsible authorities including customs, police, nuclear, intelligence and defense agencies - are co-operating and co-ordinating their efforts against trafficking. Threat and response scenarios are identified. Personnel are also trained in nuclear-related matters (e.g. at schools for customs and police staff). Detection equipment for nuclear material is available. Regulations and procedures are established and the public is informed.  These are good models from which other States may benefit.
<P>
Each State will need to determine the extent to which it must establish a strong infrastructure and related measures, based on the threat it perceives from illicit nuclear trafficking.  For some States, this may involve making less formal arrangements; for others, however, the needs may be more extensive.
<P>
At the present time, some States, including those having an SSAC for controlling nuclear materials, may lack the regulatory knowledge and inter-agency co-ordination to effectively combat illicit trafficking.  At the same time, many other countries without nuclear materials have neither a nuclear control system nor anti-trafficking measures, even though they may be in a high-risk trafficking area.
<P>
<B><I>Training.</I></B> If a State decides to take serious measures against illicit trafficking, then it will also need to train staff from all relevant authorities on various aspects, including the utilization of equipment and in forming co-operative programmes for effective inter-agency co-ordination. The extent of training requirements for establishing or improving anti-trafficking infrastructures depends upon how many States decide to establish them, as well as the minimum objectives to be achieved.
<P>
Of relevance here from the standpoint of nuclear safeguards is that States can receive support that would contribute to their overall training needs.  This training support would be directed at establishing or improving the nuclear control system, including the SSAC, in States having comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
<P>
<B>An evolving supporting role.</B> In a number of respects, essential elements of effective nuclear safeguards can play an important supporting role in States' efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Further implementation of safeguards strengthening measures will increase the assurance that <I>all</I> nuclear material in such countries is safeguarded and under effective SSAC control. As more States decide to institute national control systems, illicit trafficking involving the safeguarded nuclear inventory will become less of a threat.  However, threats posed by <I>cross-border</I> illicit trafficking would not be affected as long as some States lack nuclear control systems and co-ordinated anti-trafficking infrastructures.
<P>
As the Moscow Summit noted, co-operative anti-trafficking efforts must be initiated to prevent the unauthorized movement and sale of nuclear materials. It is in this spirit that the IAEA, as part of its overall supporting role, is responding to requests from States seeking to establish or improve their anti-trafficking capabilities, including inter-agency co-ordination. An important component in this connection is establishing and maintaining close collaboration with relevant organizations, in particular the World Customs Organization and Interpol, and with regional bodies such as Euratom and Europol, to ensure practical co-ordination among the different national agencies invariably involved in this complex issue.
<P>
In keeping with the desires of its Member States, the IAEA will support interested States as its expertise and resources allow to assist in the prevention of illicit nuclear trafficking.

<H2>Nuclear plant safety & performance
<BR>
Elevating standards of quality assurance </H2>
<P>
<I>Under its Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) programme, the IAEA has revised the standards for quality assurance of nuclear power plants</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Nestor Pieroni</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Over the past five years, nuclear experts have worked to review and revise a wide body of documents that lay down quality assurance standards for the world's nuclear power plants. The work was done within the framework of the IAEA's Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) programme, which was set up in 1974 to lay down advisory standards useful to national authorities responsible for regulating the safety of nuclear plants. A comprehensive revision of the complete set of NUSS standards on quality assurance was approved and issued in 1996.
<P>
The result of the extensive and complex revision was the production of 15 NUSS documents: one Code and 14 supporting Safety Guides, which the IAEA issued in 1996 as a single publication, Safety Series No. 50-C/SG-Q. The revised standards offer a simplified set of basic requirements and implementation methods that facilitate for regulatory bodies the establishment of requirements and the measurement of their fulfillment; formulate clear responsibilities for responsible organizations for achieving improved quality and safety performance; and provide additional guidance on methods to fulfill the basic requirements.
<P>
This article highlights major elements of the revision process and key features of the revised quality assurance standards in selected areas.
<H3>Revision of quality assurance standards</H3>
Under the NUSS programme, more than 60 documents, including Codes and Safety Guides, have been published over the past two decades. The Codes establish the objectives and basic requirements that must be met to ensure adequate safety in the operation of land-based nuclear power plants. The Safety Guides describe acceptable methods of implementing particular parts of the relevant Codes. Although Codes and Safety Guides establish an essential basis for safety, they may require the incorporation of more detailed requirements in accordance with national practice. The NUSS programme covers five areas: governmental organization, siting, design, operation and quality assurance. Each area includes one Code and several supporting Safety Guides. Revisions and reissues of the Codes and Safety Guides are made as needed in order to take account of lessons learned and to incorporate new developments in technology and methods.
<P>
The development of the NUSS standards - whether the production of new documents or the revision of the existing ones - is accomplished by an elaborate and comprehensive process directed to achieve consensus among the IAEA's Member States. The resulting documents, therefore, reflect harmonized views and experience collected from around the world.
<P>
As in each of the NUSS areas, a specific Code on quality assurance and the corresponding Safety Guides were first developed during the period 1974-84. After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the Code was revised with the intention to verify if lessons learned from that accident should be reflected in the document. The resulting revision was issued in 1988, though it was found that no essential change as a consequence of the accident was necessary. In fact, it was indicated that the Chernobyl case showed the consequences of <I>not</I> following the procedures and requirements normally implemented through an effective quality assurance programme such as recommended in the NUSS documents. 
<P>
The review in the 1980s also showed that effective implementation of requirements en-countered a number of difficulties depending on the particular country or organization. The IAEA thus tried to identify specific causes. Some typical issues that were identified include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>interpreting quality assurance requirements as solely regulatory, as if they had no beneficial effect on work performance;
<P>
<LI>viewing a good quality assurance programme as only demanding many written documents and procedures, i.e., it is only concerned with "paper work"; 
<P>
<LI>assigning responsibility for quality only to the quality assurance unit;
<P>
<LI>auditing for compliance with formal requirements without analyzing the final results;
<P>
<LI>not recognizing that management and workers have the main responsibilities in the achievement of quality assurance results;
<P>
<LI>being unaware of the importance of adequate qualification and motivation of personnel;
<P>
<LI>not assessing the effectiveness of the quality assurance programme;
<P>
<LI>not providing clear management support and commitment to the implementation of the quality assurance programme.
</UL>
<P>
This situation largely prompted the need to revise NUSS documents on quality assurance, and the work was initiated in 1990. The revision process took almost five years because of the need to reach consensus, a requirement for the issuance of IAEA safety standards. Seventeen advisory and consultancy meetings were held, involving more than 70 experts. Altogether they represented 22 IAEA Member States and three international organizations, namely the European Community (EC), European Atomic Forum (Foratom), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). All the proposed revisions were submitted to IAEA Member States and international organizations for review before approval. A total of 3300 comments were received, an indication of the interest, vigorous participation, and effective support provided to the revision process.
<H3>Highlights of specific changes</H3>
As part of the revision process, the IAEA performed an analysis of the main reasons for variation in the performance of the world's nuclear power plants. A summary of the findings from this analysis includes the following key conclusions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>practices that ensure operational safety are the same as those that improve overall plant performance;
<P>
<LI>top management that supports disciplined operations is essential for achieving plant safety, and therefore reliability and economic performance objectives;
</UL>
<P>
The focus on overall performance, including safety and other plant objectives, and the emphasis on the essential role of management were considered the driving elements that contributed to avoiding misinterpretations of, and failures to effectively implement, quality assurance requirements.
<P>
<B><I>Main changes incorporated in the revision.</I></B> The concept applied in the revision procedure sought to instill a performance-based approach to quality assurance, an approach that positively influences plant safety, reliability and economics. The overriding principle is that safety shall not be compromised for reasons of production or economics, or for any other reason. The approach emphasizes the key management responsibility and accountability for all aspects of quality of performance, including planning, organization, direction, control and support.
<P>
Since the approach looks for total quality, it helps to align people and activities towards the achievement of established requirements. To succeed, it is necessary to integrate the contributions that are made to quality and safety by the people managing it, those performing the work, and those assessing it.
<P>
The substance of the changes incorporated by the IAEA in the revision process emphasized the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>achievement of overall performance objectives;
<P>
<LI>the responsibility of everyone regarding achievement of the objectives;
<P>
<LI>the key role and commitment of managers;
<P>
<LI>provision of additional guidance on quality assurance activities directed to assessment,  siting, commissioning, decommissioning, research and development, non-conformance control and corrective actions, training and qualification, and instrumentation and control.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Simplified standards.</I></B> In order to reflect the world experience evaluated by the IAEA, the revised documents enhance the essential responsibility of everyone in achieving performance objectives. The revised Code divides the responsibilities into three functional categories: management, performance and assessment. In correlation with these categories, ten basic requirements are established. They are the ones whose fulfillment has to be demonstrated by the responsible organization to the satisfaction of the regulatory body. 
<P>
Some changes were made to provide guidance on the implementation of each basic requirement of the Code in each of the six licensing stages. Specifically, the content of the existing Safety Guides was rearranged and new Safety Guides were developed. The guidance contained in the Safety Guides, although not the only means of fulfilling the basic requirements of the Code, represents implementation methods that are generally accepted and have been proven by experience. The Code and Safety Guides integrate a complete and consistent set of guidance structured within a clear framework for safety regulation.
<P>
<B><I>Global safety standards.</I></B> The revised standards take into account international industry standards, such as ISO 9000 standards for quality management. There are fundamentally two application levels of standards set by NUSS and the ISO. The <I>establishment level</I> concerns the interface between the regulatory body and licensee/responsible organization (owner or operator of the nuclear power plant). The nuclear safety requirements are established by the regulatory body and their accomplishment must be demonstrated by the responsible organization. The NUSS documents provide the safety requirements and methods that may be applied at this level. The <I>implementation level</I> concerns the interface between responsible organizations and suppliers. The contractual agreements, including nuclear safety and other requirements, technical specifications, schedule, costs and other obligations, have to be arranged. The ISO standards (as well as other national or international industry standards) may be applied at this level. Additional measures are sometimes needed to complement the industry standards so as to meet the safety requirements for nuclear items and services.
<P>
<B><I>Quality system respective to suppliers.</I></B> The NUSS standards require that a quality assurance programme be established and implemented for all items and services affecting the safety of nuclear power plants. The supplier organization might have established a quality system as part of its way of doing business. If a quality system exists in the supplier organization, the establishment of the required quality assurance programme would be facilitated. However, the mere existence of a quality system is not enough to fulfill the safety requirements. The NUSS standards require a specific quality assurance programme for the nuclear items and/or services, irrespective of whether the organization has a quality system in place or not. It is the performance of the delivered products that is relevant and not (only) the implementation of the quality system of the supplier organization.
<P>
<B><I>Quality certification.</I></B> Since they are focused on performance and quality of the final product, the NUSS standards do not require reliance on any type of certification. Certification may lead to the undesirable consequence that priority is shifted to a mere compliance with procedures and documentation instead of conformance with specifications. Concentration on documentation and procedures - which are certainly necessary - is not sufficient to ensure the effective implementation of a quality assurance programme. The NUSS quality assurance approach, by re-emphasizing product quality as the main goal, de-emphasizes reliance on certification programmes provided by third parties. It is the pursuit of quality rather than the pursuit of certificates that is intended.
<P>
<B><I>Personal attitudes.</I></B> As indicated earlier, the performance-based quality assurance approach does not place the responsibility, initiative and effort solely upon managers and supervisors. Emphasis is given to the essential role of managers, but it is also placed on the inescapable responsibility of everyone: managers as well as operators and verifiers. They all contribute to the final achievement of quality.
<P>
This entails the acceptance of personal responsibility for the assigned task. This responsibility is not diluted because of responsibilities assigned to others. Everyone understands that the assigned work has to be performed "right the first time". Each person feels the sense of responsibility, endeavours to correctly accomplish the work and enjoys the satisfaction of achieving the final aim if this is successful. If it is not successful, the person will try to improve his/her contributions, if this is possible, because he/she is not indifferent or passive, but part of the overall achievement.
<P>
The approach thus demands particular efforts, such as: deeper and frequent training, a permanent search for information, improved communication, strong discipline, creativity and permanent striving for improvements. The pursuit of quality ends up being an entirely voluntary and personal attitude.
<P>
<B><I>Grading of quality assurance.</I></B> The IAEA standards are primarily directed towards the safety of nuclear power plants and make no explicit statement regarding costs. This does not imply a disregard of the impact that costs have in nuclear power production, as they do in any other human activity. 
<P>
In connection with the fulfillment of quality assurance requirements, part of the costs are related to the content and volume of documents and records, details of procedures, the type of verification and testing, and qualification skills. The NUSS quality assurance Code establishes the use of a graded approach, based on the relative importance to nuclear safety of each item, service or process. The approach reflects a planned and recognized difference in the application of specific quality assurance requirements. 
<P>
Management - which is responsible for planning, direction and resource considerations - has to define the essential procedures, activities and documentation that must be controlled, on the basis of their relative importance to nuclear safety. Management further establishes the content of important records, the essential data that are to be maintained and the applicable scope of quality assurance verification activities. This assures that time and money are not wasted on activities not essential to the quality of the product or service, thereby preventing unnecessary and uncontrolled costs associated with nuclear quality assurance programmes.
<H3>Benefits to users</H3>
The revised Code holds the following benefits for users:
<P>
<B><I>Regulatory bodies.</I></B> The contents of the revised Code are arranged in a form that is much more suitable for incorporation in a national regulation than its predecessor. It contains only basic requirements that must be satisfied to ensure safety. Therefore the main text has been significantly condensed and contains only "shall" statements, meaning strict requirements.This facilitates the functions of the national regulatory body that desires to make the contents directly applicable to the activities under its jurisdiction. All the guidance on how to implement the ten basic requirements has been included in the corresponding Safety Guides. 
<P>
<B><I>Responsible organizations.</I></B> The requirements to be fulfilled by the responsible organization also are more clearly formulated. This helps the function of the regulatory body because it provides precise elements against which work performed by the licensee can be subjected to regulatory inspections and follow up. Quality assurance further is integrated with normal plant management, making quality assurance an effective contributor to nuclear power plant safety and reliability. Since all personnel are involved actively, they remain committed to a process that supports and enhances their work results.
<P>
<B><I>Additional guidance.</I></B> New or revised specific recommendations are included to fulfill quality requirements regarding siting, commissioning, decommissioning, research and development, grading, instrumentation and control, non-conformance control and corrective actions, training and qualification, and assessment.
<P>
<B><I>Overall benefits.</I></B> The standards serve to enhance plant safety, by focusing on the performance and the effectiveness of day-to-day work in all stages of the nuclear power plant.
<H3>A look ahead</H3>
In recent years, quality assurance activities have become intrinsic components of managing, performing and assessing work. As a consequence, these activities are progressively detached from the exclusive fulfillment of requirements from a particular quality assurance standard. They are instead incorporated as common practices. As a consequence, activities that would currently be identified as part of a quality assurance programme are not necessarily perceived in that way anymore.
<P>
In some organizations trying to enhance the quality of performance, a specific unit or department with specifically assigned responsibility for quality assurance does not appear in the organizational charts. This is because such responsibility is shared and accepted by every individual involved. These organizations have built up an environment that integrates people qualified and motivated for accepting and accomplishing responsibilities; systems and procedures tailored to the particular work; and hardware and installations operating in accordance with established specifications. 
<P>
The successful organizations are characterized by an effective quality culture, manifesting itself by the following features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Management is consistently involved in plant activities, promotes staff accountability and sets high expectations for performance.
<P>
<LI>Performance objectives are included in the organization's policy documents and procedures, integrated into staff training and work programmes, communicated to contractors prior to work commencement and reinforced by management staff in daily communications and meetings.
<P>
<LI>Management dedicates permanent attention to performance data and their trend analysis, identification of performance deficiencies and associated root causes and development of performance improvement programmes with provision of adequate resources.
<P>
<LI>Responsibility to achieve quality and to verify its achievements is assigned to those performing the task and their associated line management, who in all their activities make safety precede production objectives.
</UL>
<P>
In accomplishing their policy and objectives, organizations with vigorous quality-raising initiatives have evolved beyond the fulfillment of requirements established in safety and industrial quality assurance standards. In fact, environments with this type of culture are progressively less dependent on the fulfillment of requirements established in quality assurance standards. This is because these requirements are automatically accomplished by the normal way of work performance.
<P>
If we allow our imagination to project into an ideal future where such a culture would be universally implemented, the need for quality assurance standards would be minimized. The successive revisions of present standards would be consistently streamlining the contents, because fewer and fewer requirements would need to be established.
<P>
The final goal in this ideal picture would be a future standard making all quality assurance requirements converge into just one single and unmistakable item. This could, for example, be plainly stated as "doing things right the first time and improving thereafter". 
<P>
This vision does not intend to suggest that quality assurance standards will cease to be needed, particularly in the field of nuclear safety. It only invites us to look ahead, with the intention of progressing towards the creation of a quality culture that integrates quality assurance requirements as an indivisible component of every work performance. This will allow simpler standards and will contribute to an improvement of the present situation where sometimes proliferating, overlapping and contradictory requirements, methods, and terminology impair the understanding and achievement of the quality objectives.
<P>
The IAEA's revised NUSS standards on quality assurance for nuclear power plants offer a simplified set of basic requirements and implementation methods. They clearly convey the application of global nuclear safety requirements and provide guidance consistent with worldwide industry standards. They thus address the interests and concerns of regulatory bodies, operating organizations, and suppliers. In years ahead, the stronger development of a culture aimed at achieving a rising excellence of performance will allow formulation of even simpler and more effective quality assurance standards.

three essential elements: increased access to information about a
State's nuclear activities; broader access to sites and locations
within a State; and expanded use of new and available
technologies to increase detection capacity and, in due course,
to reduce the frequency of on-site inspections. The first of two
interrelated sets of strengthening measures was accepted by the
Board of Governors in June <I><A HREF="box1.html">(see Box
1)</A></I>.  
<P>
<I>Democratic People's Republic of Korea</I>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) was still not in full compliance with its safeguards
agreement pursuant to the NPT. At the request of the United
Nations Security Council, Agency inspectors have been present in
the Nyongbyon area since May 1994 and since November of that year
the Agency has (with the authorization of the Board of Governors)
monitored a "freeze" on the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors
and related facilities as provided for in the "Agreed Framework"
between the USA and the DPRK of 21 October 1994. The DPRK has
enabled the Agency to implement certain safeguards measures and
activities but did not accept other activities, such as the
monitoring of the nuclear liquid waste at the reprocessing plant
(Radiochemical Laboratory) and measurement of the plutonium
content of the spent fuel at the 5 MW(e) reactor. In addition to
the safeguards activities carried out at facilities subject to
the "freeze", the Agency continued to conduct inspections at DPRK
facilities not covered by the "freeze". Agreement was reached
with
the DPRK in September to enable Agency inspectors to photograph
the new process line and other areas of the DPRK's reprocessing
plant known as the Radiochemical Laboratory. By the end of the
year, however, inspectors had not been allowed to carry out these
activities as DPRK operators raised new objections and imposed
unacceptable preconditions.  
<P>
<I>Iraq</I>
<P>
The Agency's safeguards obligations in Iraq continued under the
mandate assigned to the Agency by resolutions of the United
Nations Security Council. Since August 1994, the Agency has
maintained a continuous presence in Iraq in order to carry out
monitoring and verification inspections to confirm Iraq's
compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
<P>
In August, the Agency received additional information on Iraq's
former nuclear weapons programme, transmitted by Iraq to the
Agency and the United Nations Special Commission following the
departure to Jordan of Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel, the
former Iraqi Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization.
According to this information, a crash programme to produce a
nuclear weapon using high enriched uranium (HEU) contained in the
safeguarded research reactor fuel stored at the Iraqi nuclear
research centre in Tuwaitha had been launched shortly after
Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. On 17 January 1991, the programme was
effectively brought to a halt by air raids on Tuwaitha which
destroyed the building where the uranium extraction was planned
before any processing of the fuel could occur. By this time,
however, the equipment needed to extract the uranium had been
manufactured and installed in a hot cell facility at Tuwaitha.
The additional information is being examined for any new
indications which might affect the Agency's assessment that
Iraq's
practical capability to manufacture nuclear weapons had been
destroyed, removed or rendered harmless.  
<P>
The Agency conducted two ad hoc inspections in 1995 to follow up
on the new information received and to further clarify the
progress made by Iraq in achieving a nuclear weapons capability
in the period immediately preceding the outbreak of the Gulf War.

<P>
<I>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</I>
<P>
In May 1995, the Review and Extension Conference of the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reached the
decision to extend the Treaty indefinitely. This decision, and
the adoption of the agreed principles and objectives and the
strengthened review process, imply a renewed and collective
commitment by the Parties to the Treaty to the exclusively
peaceful use of nuclear energy and the renunciation of nuclear
weapons - a commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States not to
acquire such weapons and a commitment by the weapon States to
nuclear disarmament.  
<P>
The outcome of the NPT Conference has far reaching implications
for the future work of the Agency. Its role as a central point
for international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy was confirmed and the Agency was expressly recognized as
the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with
safeguards agreements. The Conference called on parties to the
NPT who had concerns regarding non-compliance with safeguards
agreements to direct such concerns, along with supporting
information, to the Agency so that it could investigate, draw
conclusions and decide on necessary actions in accordance with
its mandate. The Conference further urged support for Agency
efforts to strengthen safeguards and to develop its capability to
detect possible undeclared nuclear activities.  
<P>
Backing was given to the concept of an expanded Agency role in
verification and it was recommended that nuclear material
released from military use be placed under Agency safeguards as
soon as practicable and that safeguards be universally applied
once the elimination of nuclear weapons has been completed. There
was a call for the early conclusion of an agreement to end the
production of material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices, and for the creation of additional
nuclear-weapon-free zones.  
<P>
<I>The Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty in Africa</I>
<P>
As requested in 1994 by the General Conference, the Secretariat
continued to assist the African States in their effort to
establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone and, in particular, to help
develop its verification regime. A proposed text, which entrusted
the Agency with the task of verification, was adopted by the
African Heads of State in Addis Ababa in June. Welcoming the
adoption of the text (the "Pelindaba Treaty"), the United Nations
General Assembly called upon African States in December to sign
and ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.  
<P>
<I>A Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone for the Middle East</I>
<P>
The General Conference in 1995 requested all parties directly
concerned in the Middle East to consider taking steps to
establish a mutually and effectively verifiable
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. The Director General
continued consultations with the States of the Middle East to
facilitate the early application of full scope Agency safeguards
to all nuclear activities in the region and the preparation of
model verification agreements.  
<P>
<I>Nuclear Testing</I>
<P>
The General Conference in 1995 adopted a resolution expressing
grave concern at the resumption and the continuation of nuclear
testing and calling upon those States which have active nuclear
testing programmes in place to desist from testing until a
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty enters into force. The
resolution also called for co-operation between the States
concerned and the Agency. Reservations were expressed by some
Member States on this resolution. The Government of France
requested the Agency to perform a study to assess the full
radiological situation in the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa,
taking into account all past events of radiological significance.
Such a study - which would be funded by extrabudgetary
contributions from France - would consist of two parts: an
assessment of the current radiological situation; and an
evaluation of the potential long term radiological impact. After
consultations with Member States and the French authorities, the
Director General informed France that the Agency agreed to
conduct the study after the cessation of testing.  
<P>
<I>Radiological Situation in the Marshall Islands</I>
<P>
The Agency organized a re-examination of the radiological
situation at the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands <I><A
HREF="box2.html">(see Box
2)</A></I>. It also undertook a review of an area in Kazakhstan
where
nuclear weapons had been tested for many years: comprehensive
studies were made on potential doses to the population and on
levels of plutonium contamination in the vicinity of the former
test site. The results confirm overall that there is no need for
concern among those living in the settlements around the test
site.  
<P>

<I>Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Materials</I>
<P>
For the last two years the international community has been
concerned about the large number of incidents of illicit
trafficking in nuclear materials as well as other radioactive
sources. In 1995, the Agency established a special programme in
this area and set up a database of trafficking incidents to
provide factual information to Member State governments and the
public. Since effective national accounting and physical
protection are basic prerequisites for preventing nuclear
material from falling into unauthorized hands, the Agency
conducted training courses in the implementation of State systems
of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical
protection methods and technology. With the assistance of donor
countries, the Agency co-ordinated technical support for the
upgrading of physical protection of nuclear material in the newly
independent States of the former Soviet Union. In July, the
United Nations Security Council expressed its full support to the
Agency and other international bodies for their work in this
field.  
<P>
<I>The 'Red Book'</I>
<P>
The new edition of the joint IAEA-OECD/NEA 'Red Book' (<I>Uranium
1995 - Resources, Production and Demand</I>), which has long
served as a reference text, became a genuinely global report as a
result of the inclusion of a large volume of new data from
countries from which information had previously not been
available. In addition, 1995 saw the completion and publication
(in co-operation with the Geological Survey of Canada) of a new
map of the world's uranium deposits.  
<P>
<I>Plutonium Inventory</I>
<P>
Worldwide estimates of civil separated plutonium were developed
by the Secretariat and published in the <I>IAEA Yearbook
1995</I>. These
estimates should serve as a foundation on which appropriate
plutonium management concepts can be developed.  
<P>
<I>Nuclear Liability Convention</I>
<P>
The question of nuclear liability continued to be of concern to
Member States. At the thirteenth session of the Standing
Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage, broad agreement was
achieved on the revision of the Vienna Convention. The Committee
adopted, albeit with certain exceptions and reservations, a full
set of texts for amendments to the Convention. On supplementary
funding, the discussions were based on the new text of a free
standing draft convention. While work continued on the
strengthening of an international nuclear liability regime, the
numbers of States that have adhered to the Vienna Convention and
Joint Protocol increased, especially in terms of States in
eastern and central Europe, and at the end of the year stood at
26 and 20 respectively (increases of 2 and 4 over 1994).  
<P>
<I>Convention on Waste Safety</I>
<P>
The preamble of the Convention on Nuclear Safety adopted in 1994
urges the preparation of a convention on the safe management of
radioactive waste. The Board of Governors convened an open-ended
group of legal and technical experts who entrusted its chairman
with the preparation of a draft of the convention. The group held
a second meeting in December, making good progress.  
<P>
<I>Co-operation in Nuclear Waste Management in the Russian
Federation</I>
<P>
In the context of measures to resolve international waste
management issues, the Agency, at the request of the Nordic
Council of Ministers and with the co-operation of the Russian
Federation, organized in May a seminar on international
co-operation on nuclear waste management in the Russian
Federation. A Contact Expert Group was established under the
auspices of the Agency for the purpose of organizing and
following up co-operative activities between the Russian
Federation and other States and the group held its first meeting
in Stockholm. 
<P>
<I>Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe and the Former USSR</I>
<P>
Agency work on the assessment of the safety of nuclear power
plants in eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR made
steady progress throughout the year. Since an international
consensus has been reached on the major safety issues and their
significance for each of the various reactor types, the emphasis
shifted to a review of the status of the implementation of the
proposed improvements. The results of this work provided critical
input into bilateral and multilateral assistance projects
co-ordinated by the G-24 mechanisms.   
<P>
Following the decision by the Armenian Government to restart the
Medzamor Unit 2 reactor, an Agency mission visited the plant in
April 1995. Its report pointed to a difficult safety situation,
including a number of unresolved technical issues. The Director
General conveyed the results to the Armenian Government,
stressing the importance of solving the safety issues before the
plant was restarted and reiterating the need for highly competent
and well trained operating staff to be available.   
<P>
<I>Sealed Radiation Sources</I>
<P>
A contribution to the safety of radiation sources worldwide was
made by the release during the year of the Sealed Radiation
Sources Registry package, consisting of a program diskette and
documentation for use by register administrators in Member
States. This formed one of the major components in the Agency
programme to help improve the control of in-use and spent
radiation sources.  
<P>
<I>Sustainable Development and Nuclear Energy</I>
<P>
One of the major challenges in the energy field is to ensure
sustainability - a goal that requires improved management of
natural resources and a reduction of the emissions which are
dangerous to health and the environment. The threat of global
climate change due to such emissions is a matter of concern to
many governments. However, the first conference on the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, held in Berlin at the end of March,
showed that reaching an international consensus will take time.
Three years after the Rio "Earth Summit" the progress made, for
example, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is extremely small.
Carbon dioxide emissions have slowed only marginally in
industrialized countries, and have increased significantly in
most developing countries owing to energy demand growth and the
increasing use of fossil fuels, which are the most readily
available energy source. In this context, the Agency continued to
co-operate with other international organizations in drawing up
methodologies and databases for the comparative assessment of
different options for the production of electric power. An
international symposium addressed this issue in Vienna in October
<I><A HREF="box3.html">(see Box 3)</A></I>.  
<P>
A potential application of nuclear power that received particular
attention in 1995 was related to the growing problem of potable
water in many Member States. Considerable progress was made on
the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of
seawater desalination using nuclear energy. The North African
regional feasibility study was completed, showing that the use of
nuclear power plants for desalination is technically feasible and
that the costs are competitive with those of fossil fuelled
plants in the region. A similar feasibility study for Saudi
Arabia was under way at the end of the year.  
<P>

<I>Technical Co-operation Programme</I>
<P>
At present only a few developing countries use nuclear power.
However, most of them are interested in using non-power nuclear
techniques that may help their development and in this regard the
Agency continued its major task of assisting in the transfer of
the relevant technology. Emphasis was placed on those techniques
which will contribute to sustainable development, food production
and preservation, the harnessing of fresh water resources, the
improvement of industrial processes and the promotion of human
health.   
<P>
Several initiatives were undertaken to strengthen the technical
co-operation programme and to make it more effective and more
relevant to sustainable development. Many of these initiatives
concentrated on improved planning - such as, for example, the
preparation of 27 Country Programme Frameworks, which provide an
orientation for the technical co-operation programme and help to
maintain the focus on activities which result in a significant
benefit. Other initiatives taken in 1995 involved improvements in
management, such as the systematic assessment of the status of
radiation safety in Member States and the planning of time
limited follow-up activities. These and other measures, together
with the careful use of overprogramming, combined to produce the
highest programme delivery ever.   
<P>
A Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and
Co-operation (SAGTAC) was established and met for the first time
in December. The Group will review policy and  strategy and make
recommendations to the Secretariat on means of improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of the technical co-operation
programme.   
<P>
<I>Joint Programme with FAO</I>
<P>
A number of new directions were introduced into the Agency's
joint
programme with the FAO. In particular, increased use was made of
modern biotechnology. A symposium in June confirmed that
radiation induced mutations followed by appropriate selection
procedures had been successful in improving the performance of
germplasm throughout the world: significant achievements during
the year in Peru, China and Mali were reported. There was a major
success in 1995 with the eradication, using the sterile insect
technique (SIT), of the medfly pest from Chile through an
IAEA/FAO supported project. The benefits to the Chilean economy
were estimated at $500 million annually.   
<P>
<I>Use of Isotope Techniques in Hydrology</I>
<P>
An important part of the Agency's programme in research and
development is related to the use of isotope techniques in
hydrology. At a symposium in March - the ninth in a regular
series - the focus was on practical applications of the
techniques in the management of groundwater resources. In this
area, a model technical co-operation project in Venezuela
produced valuable results <I><A HREF="box4.html">(see Box
4)</A></I>.  
<P>

<I>'Hidden Hunger'</I>
<P>
The Agency embarked on new programmes in the area of human
nutrition, where isotope techniques are being developed and used
to monitor and control the impact of nutritional intervention
programmes for overcoming "hidden hunger", a term coined by WHO
and
UNICEF to describe the deficiencies of vitamin A, iron and other
essential micronutrients that are affecting hundreds of millions
of people in developing countries. Major projects were planned in
several Member States in collaboration with WHO and a model
technical co-operation project was supported in Peru.  <P>
<I>Irradiation of Sewage Sludge</I>
<P>
A new Agency co-ordinated research programme was initiated in
1995 on the use of irradiated sewage sludge to increase soil
fertility and crop yields and help preserve the environment. The
aim is to find ways by which solid and liquid wastes from
households and industry can be utilized as a source of organic
matter and nutrients for increasing crop production. This could
reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and the pollution of
other sewage treatment processes. The use of gamma and electron
beam irradiators to eliminate disease-producing microbial
pathogens is a promising technique that may permit the safe
utilization of sludges as a biofertilizer.  
<P>
<I>Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of INIS</I>
<P>
In May, the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)
celebrated its 25th anniversary. INIS has played a key role in
providing access to nuclear information to support activities
worldwide. By December, the INIS database included over 1.8
million references to nuclear literature and was growing at the
rate of about 7000 records per month.   
<P>
<I>International Centre for Theoretical Physics</I>
<P>
At the end of the year, administrative responsibility for the
International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste was
handed over to UNESCO. The Agency, which remains one of the
partners in the operation of the Centre, will continue to follow
the future activities of the Centre and to co-operate with it
actively in certain fields.  
<P>
<I>United Nations Co-ordination</I>
<P>
The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was
celebrated in 1995, encouraged wide public scrutiny of the
system. For the Agency it is clear that co-ordination and
co-operation amongst international organizations remains a major
goal. This was an important theme at a meeting of the United
Nations Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC), which
was chaired by the Secretary-General and hosted by the Agency in
February.   
<P>
<I>The Agency Beyond 2000</I>
<P>
At a two day meeting in June, a number of high level officials
from Member States met with the Agency's senior management to
look
beyond the year 2000. There was a common understanding on a
number of points: the role of the Agency will continue to evolve;
the verification functions will expand; many of the present
activities in the areas of nuclear safety and technology transfer
will remain essential; and programmes in the field of nuclear
waste are expected to grow. Further, it was generally agreed that
although the acquisition of nuclear technologies will
increasingly become a matter of commercial rather than
governmental decisions, the Agency should be ready to provide
impartial advice on the advantages and disadvantages of available
nuclear and non-nuclear approaches - in both power and non-power
applications.  
<P>
<I>The Agency on the Internet</I>
<P>
Greater use was made throughout the Secretariat in 1995 of new
technologies, especially in the area of communications. As the
Internet became a more common tool for the public, the media and
decision makers, steps were taken to ensure that many Agency
products were made available on it.  
<P>
<I>Gender and Geography in Staff Recruitment</I>
<P>
In response to resolutions adopted by the General Conference,
special efforts were made to increase the professional
representation of women and staff from developing countries in
the Secretariat. In a situation where the number of staff is
static and where some activities require very specialized skills
which are available only from a very limited labour market, rapid
change is not easy. However, the Secretariat continued to look
for ways to improve the situation.  
<P>
<I>Membership and Budget</I>
<P>
During 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Agency, bringing
the total membership to 123, an increase of more than 40 over the
number of "initial members". It is worth recalling that now for
more than a quarter of its history the Agency has been operating
under zero real growth. In 1995, the regular budget appropriation
for Agency programmes was approximately $251 million and total
new resources amounting to around $64 million were available for
technical co-operation activities. Extrabudgetary funds, apart
from those directed to technical co-operation and the ICTP were
at a level of about $32 million.   
<P>
<I>The Agency Remains Dynamic and Solvent</I>
<P>
In spite of the constraints on approved resources and continued
difficulties caused by some countries failing to make
contributions on time, the Agency has managed during the last ten
years to deliver an expanding programme and to respond to the
needs of Member States. This result certainly could not have been
achieved without extrabudgetary contributions from a number of
governments. It is also in large measure attributable to the
continued search for efficiency and savings as well as to the
commitment and professionalism of the Agency's staff and its
collaborators around the world.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Safeguards Statement</I></B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n fulfilling the safeguards obligations of
the Agency in 1995, the Secretariat did not find any indication
that nuclear material which has been placed under safeguards was
diverted for any military purpose or for purposes unknown, or
that safeguarded facilities, equipment or non-nuclear material
were misused. All the information available to the Agency
supports the conclusion that the nuclear material and other items
which were declared and placed under Agency safeguards remained
in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise adequately
accounted for.  
<P>
The Agency is still unable to verify the correctness and
completeness of the initial declaration of nuclear
material made by the DPRK and is therefore still unable to
conclude that there has been no diversion
of nuclear material in the DPRK. The safeguards agreement between
the DPRK and the Agency
remains in force, and the Agency is continuing to implement
safeguards measures in the DPRK under
this agreement including the monitoring of the "freeze" on the
DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and
related facilities, as requested by the United Nations Security
Council and as foreseen in the "Agreed Framework" of October 1994
between the DPRK and the USA. 
<P>
The Agency has been endeavouring to strengthen its capability for
detecting undeclared nuclear
material, facilities and activities. A number of measures
designed to strengthen that capability have
been implemented while others are either in the process of being
implemented or are under
development.  
<P>
As of 31 December 1995, 207 safeguards agreements were in force
with 125 States (and with Taiwan,
China), compared with 200 agreements with 119 States (and with
Taiwan, China) at the end of 1994. 
<P>
Safeguards agreements pursuant to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)
entered into force with Croatia in January, Myanmar in April,
Zimbabwe in June and Belarus and
Kazakhstan in August. A safeguards agreement pursuant to NPT and
the Treaty of Tlatelolco entered
into force with Bolivia in February. A safeguards agreement with
Chile pursuant to the Treaty of
Tlatelolco entered into force in April. A sui generis
comprehensive safeguards agreement with Ukraine
entered into force in January.  
<P>
Sweden acceded to the safeguards agreement between the
non-nuclear-weapon States of EURATOM,
EURATOM and the Agency on 1 June, and Finland did so on 1
October. 
<P>
The Government of Cuba informed the Agency that it had decided to
terminate the construction of the
research reactor which was to be supplied by the former USSR.   
<P>
Consequently, the Agency's Board of Governors took note that the
unilateral submission agreement with
Cuba had terminated.  
<P>
The Board of Governors approved a draft safeguards agreement with
Barbados pursuant to NPT and
the Treaty of Tlatelolco, and with Moldova and Ukraine pursuant
to NPT. None of these agreements
had entered into force at the end of 1995.  
<P>
As of 31 December 1995, safeguards agreements were in force with
108 States pursuant to NPT. For
67 non-nuclear-weapon States party to NPT there is no safeguards
agreement in force. As far as the
Agency is aware, six of these States have significant nuclear
activities. Out of these six, safeguards
were being applied in four (Argentina, Chile, Colombia and
Ukraine) pursuant to other comprehensive
safeguards agreements, in one State pursuant to
INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type safeguards agreements
(Algeria) and preparatory work for the application of safeguards
is under way in the sixth State
(Georgia).  
<P>
NPT safeguards agreements are in force with all 11 signatories of
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone
Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty); safeguards were applied in one of
these States (Australia) pursuant to such
an agreement.  
<P>
Twenty-two of the 30 States party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco
have concluded safeguards agreements
with the Agency pursuant to that Treaty and at the end of 1995
safeguards agreements pursuant to the
Treaty of Tlatelolco were in force with 19 States. Safeguards
agreements pursuant to Additional
Protocol I of the Treaty of Tlatelolco are in force with two
States (Netherlands and the USA) with
territories in the zone of application of the Treaty, and a
similar agreement with a third such State
(United Kingdom) has been approved by the Board of Governors, but
has not yet entered into force. In
June 1995, with a view to the early entry into force of
safeguards agreements pursuant to NPT and the
Treaty of Tlatelolco, the Board of Governors authorized the
Secretariat to confirm, through an exchange
of letters with the relevant States in the Latin America and
Caribbean region, that:      
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-  Comprehensive safeguards agreements concluded pursuant to
the NPT satisfy the
requirement under Article 13 of the Treaty of Tlatelolco for
Contracting Parties to conclude safeguards
agreements with the Agency;   
<P>
<DD>-  Comprehensive safeguards agreements concluded pursuant to
the Treaty of Tlatelolco alone
satisfy the requirement under Article III.1 of the NPT for
non-nuclear-weapon States to conclude
safeguards agreements with the Agency;  
<P>
<DD>-  The quadripartite safeguards agreement between Argentina,
Brazil, the ABACC and the
Agency satisfies the requirement of a State Party under either
the Treaty of Tlatelolco or the NPT to
conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement.  
</DL>
<P>
At the request of the United Nations Security Council, the Agency
has maintained a continuous
inspector presence in the Nyongbyon area in the DPRK since May
1994. At the request of the Security
Council, and as authorized by the Board of Governors, the Agency
has since November 1994
monitored the freeze on the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors
and related facilities as provided for in
the "Agreed Framework" between the USA and the DPRK of 21 October
1994. The DPRK has enabled
the Agency to implement specific safeguards measures and the
safeguards activities, but has declined
to accept other activities, such as the monitoring of nuclear
liquid wastes at the reprocessing plant
(Radiochemical Laboratory) and measurements of the plutonium
content of spent fuel at the 5 MW(e)
Experimental Nuclear Power Plant reactor. In addition to the
safeguards activities carried out at facilities
subject to the freeze (the Radiochemical Laboratory, Nuclear Fuel
Rod Fabrication Plant, 5 MW(e)
reactor, 50 MW(e) Nuclear Power Plant and the Taechon Nuclear
Power Plant which is presently under
construction), the Agency conducted inspections in 1995 at DPRK
facilities not covered by the freeze
(IRT Research Reactor, Critical Assembly, Nuclear Fuel Rod
Storage and Sub-Critical Assembly). Other
issues remain open.  
<P>
The Agency's safeguards obligations in Iraq continued to be
subsumed under the mandate assigned to
the Agency by resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
Since August 1994, the Agency has
maintained a continuous presence in Iraq to carry out monitoring
and verification inspections to confirm
that country's compliance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions. In addition, the Agency
conducted two inspections in 1995 to clarify specific matters
relating to Iraq's past nuclear weapons
programme.  
<P>
In August 1995, the Agency received additional information on
Iraq's former nuclear weapons
programme in the form of new statements and numerous documents
and materials transmitted to the
Agency and the United Nations Special Commission by Iraq
following the departure to Jordan of
Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel, the former Iraqi Minister of
Industry and Military Industrialization.
According to this additional information, a crash programme to
produce a nuclear weapon had been
launched shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (on 2 August
1990). This programme foresaw the
extraction of the high enriched uranium (HEU) contained in the
safeguarded research reactor fuel
stored at the Iraqi nuclear research centre in Tuwaitha and its
transformation into weapons-usable HEU
metal. On 17 January 1991, the programme was effectively brought
to a halt by the damage inflicted on
Tuwaitha by air raids, which destroyed the building where the
uranium extraction was planned before
any processing of the fuel could occur. By this time, however,
the chemical equipment needed to
extract the uranium had been manufactured, installed and
commissioned in a hot cell facility at
Tuwaitha. The additional information is being examined for any
new data which might affect the
Agency's former assessment that Iraq's practical capability to
manufacture nuclear weapons had been
destroyed, removed or rendered harmless.

During 1995, work on the verification of the nuclear material
specified in the initial report pursuant to
the safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC and
the Agency and verification of
facility design information was largely completed. This included
verification activities at a gaseous
diffusion enrichment facility in one of these States. Major
installations in both States were also visited to
verify the completeness and correctness of the initial report.   
<P>
Following the entry into force of the comprehensive safeguards
agreement with Chile pursuant to the
Treaty of Tlatelolco, activities for the verification of the
initial report provided pursuant to this agreement
were carried out.  
<P>
Considerable safeguards work was carried out in the newly
independent states (NIS) of the former
USSR, in particular:     
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-  Initial inventory verifications pursuant to the sui
generis safeguards agreement with Ukraine
started in April.   
<P>
<DD>-  Verification of the initial inventory began pursuant to
the NPT safeguards agreement with
Belarus.  
<P>
<DD>-  Initial inventory verifications were undertaken pursuant
to the NPT safeguards agreement with
Kazakhstan. Special equipment for monitoring transfers of breeder
fuel from the reactor, as well as
surveillance systems, were put into operation.

Development of a safeguards system for the CANDU 600 nuclear
power complex in Romania
proceeded according to schedule for Unit 1. The initial core
loading was verified by the Agency. The
reactor underwent hot performance tests in the last part of 1995,
and the fuel handling systems were
commissioned.  
<P>
Some progress was made in the negotiation of Subsidiary
Arrangements, one new and six revised
General Parts of Subsidiary Arrangements (one new and five
revised in 1994) and 16 facility
attachments (7 new and 9 revised) (29 in 1994) entered into
force.  
<P>
A safeguards project between the Agency, China and the Russian
Federation was agreed in
September. The objective is to establish a basis for applying
effective and efficient safeguards at the
enrichment plant presently under construction at Han Zhong in
China.  
<P>
As a result of the decision announced by the President of the USA
in September 1993 to submit to
Agency safeguards excess nuclear material released from the US
military programme, the Agency
carried out monthly interim inspections at one site containing
HEU and at one site containing plutonium.
Safeguards activities in the USA increased considerably in 1995
as additional nuclear material was
placed under safeguards. The initial verification was carried out
on the newly received plutonium at one
site in August. In April, a new storage facility was added by the
USA to the eligible list and
subsequently selected by the Agency for the implementation of
safeguards. The verification of the initial
inventory of plutonium at this site began in early December.
Further, following the President's decision
on 1 March 1995 to permanently withdraw 200 tonnes of fissile
material from the US nuclear stockpile,
consultations were held to discuss the implementation of Agency
safeguards on the material concerned.

The Director General reported to the Board of Governors in March
on proposed measures for
strengthening the present safeguards system ("Programme 93+2").
The report discussed the
interrelationship of the various measures and how their
synergistic effect would increase the level of
assurance that could be attained. Each measure was described in
detail in terms of its cost or effort,
technical and legal aspects (whether the Secretariat would
implement the measures on the basis of
existing legal authority or whether complementary authority would
be sought). The Board endorsed the
general direction of Programme 93+2 and reiterated its support
for a safeguards system designed to
provide credible assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear
material from declared activities and of the
absence of any undeclared nuclear activities. This support was
also reflected in the strong endorsement
in April at the NPT Review and Extension Conference of the work
of the Agency to strengthen further
the effectiveness of safeguards. As requested by the Board of
Governors at its March meeting, the
Secretariat submitted for the Board's consideration in June a
comprehensive set of measures to
strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of safeguards in two
parts. Part 1 consisted of those
measures which could, in the Secretariat's view, be implemented
under existing legal authority and
which it would be practical and useful to implement at an early
date. Part 2 consisted of those
measures which the Secretariat proposed for implementation on the
basis of complementary authority.
The Board accepted the Director General's plan to implement at an
early date the measures described
in Part 1. The General Conference endorsed the actions taken by
the Board in March and June.  
<P>
Following the meeting of the Board in June, a detailed
implementation plan was developed. This
provided the basis for a letter sent in November to States party
to comprehensive safeguards
agreements describing the actions the Secretariat had identified
as being necessary to proceed further.
The letter indicated that the Secretariat would undertake
implementation of Part 1 measures, starting in
1996, as broadly and extensively as possible, subject to
operational and budgetary constraints. Some
measures are currently being implemented. 
<P>
A draft discussion paper containing additional details on the
Part 2 measures to be implemented under
complementary authority was discussed by the Board of Governors
during its meeting in December.
The paper contained a draft protocol to comprehensive safeguards
agreements that the Secretariat is
proposing as the means by which States can provide the Agency
with the authority to implement the
Part 2 measures. The Secretariat was asked to consider all the
comments made by Member States
when finalizing and fine-tuning its proposals for Part 2 of
Programme 93+2 for Board action.  
<P>
The Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) and the Network of
Analytical Laboratories (NWAL)
performed 1752 measurements for calibration and quality control
on non-destructive analysis (NDA)
techniques, for certification of secondary reference samples, for
maintenance and improvement of
off-site destructive analysis (DA) and for testing procedures for
on-site DA. In addition, 2931
measurements were performed by SAL and the NWAL for the routine
quality control of the analysis of
inspection samples. SAL also assisted in the measurement of
samples taken in Iraq during inspections
carried out pursuant to United Nations Security Council
resolutions. A total of 70 analytical results were
reported by SAL on environmental type samples taken during
routine or ad hoc inspections as well as
field trials under Programme 93+2. The median times required to
complete verification by off-site DA
were 52 days for uranium, 59 days for plutonium and 59 days for
spent fuel samples.   
<P>
The construction of a clean laboratory for safeguards analytical
work was completed. Procedures for
measuring environmental samples in the laboratory were developed
and tested. The primary isotopic
mixes required for the preparation of reference materials for
performance evaluation of the clean
laboratory and of network laboratories were also completed.
Samples of these reference materials were
distributed to selected laboratories.  
<P>
As part of Programme 93+2, environmental sampling field trials
were conducted. In support of the
decision to proceed with the implementation of measures contained
in Part 1 of Programme 93+2,
guidelines were developed for the planning, collection and
analysis of swipe samples at enrichment
plants and hot cell facilities. A review was carried out in
December of the experience gained in the
course of the field trials and there was discussion of the
establishment of an effective and efficient
analytical services network. 
<P>
At its meeting in February 1993, the Board of Governors endorsed
the establishment of a reporting
scheme for nuclear material and specified equipment and
non-nuclear material as a means of
strengthening the Agency's safeguards system. The Board further
expressed the hope that subscription
to the scheme, which will be voluntary in nature, would become
universal. Information received by the
reporting scheme is used on a routine basis as part of the more
systematic analysis by the Agency of
information about nuclear activities. To date, 52 Governments and
the European Union have indicated
that they intend to participate in the reporting scheme, with 35
of these States and the European Union
having already submitted information.  
<P>
Activities in 1995 in the New Partnership Approach (NPA) with
EURATOM included a review of Agency
and EURATOM equipment needs for 1995 and 1996 encompassing the
replacement of obsolete
equipment and verification needs at new facilities. Common
training courses for Agency and EURATOM
inspectors were organized. The sharing of analytical capabilities
using a mobile mass spectrometer for
inspections at low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication and
enrichment plants was initiated, thus
reducing the cost of transporting and analysing samples at each
organizations analytical laboratory.  
<P>
As part of the development of Programme 93+2, and with the
co-operation of a Member State, a six
month field trial was initiated to demonstrate a remote
monitoring system at a storage vault for MOX
fuel. The system includes self-contained digital video cameras,
and features  the authentication and
encryption of the surveillance data, as well as remotely
verifiable seals. Sophisticated power monitoring
and control, front end scene change detection and backup scene
and data storage are integral parts of
the digital camera. Surveillance images and data are transmitted
to the Agency by means of low cost,
ultra-small aperture satellite communications. Inspector review
is carried out using a computer based
review station. The results of the field trial will be evaluated
as part of an overall study of remote
monitoring systems.  
<P>
Actions to improve the performance of modular integrated video
surveillance systems were
implemented, including: modifications for increased immunity to
mains power anomalies and
electromagnetic interference; training for inspectors in
troubleshooting, problem diagnosis and corrective
actions; improvements to facility power sources; improvements in
the availability and distribution of
spare components; and improvements in performance monitoring. As
a result, the mean time between
failure of these systems improved from 30 months in 1994 to 50
months in 1995. 
<P>
The extrabudgetary Member State support programmes continued to
provide major contributions to the
research and development and safeguards implementation support
activities. Some 250 projects
addressing safeguards needs identified by the Agency were under
way, and about 60, were completed.
During the year, bilateral meetings were held to review the
status and activities of all the programmes.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>his is a new programme which was
established in 1995 with the aim of
ensuring the security of nuclear material and other radioactive
sources. With support from Member
States, the Secretariat established an illicit trafficking
database designed to provide a reliable
source of information to States and the public on all incidents
where illegal movement of such
materials has been reported. At the end of 1995, 163 incidents
were contained in the database.   
<P>
In May, the Agency held a meeting of representatives from 16
countries to consider the provision to
the Agency of information from governments on illicit trafficking
and Agency reports to governments.
States were invited to indicate their interest in participating
in a programme on information sharing
and, by the end of 1995, 25 had responded positively.    
<P>
In June, the Agency convened a Technical Committee meeting in
Vienna to consider actions to be
taken to combat the illicit movement of materials. The meeting
included representatives from 20
Member States plus EUROPOL and the World Customs Organization.
Recommendations were
made to the Agency related to information sharing, co-ordination
of activities, detection of materials
at borders, utilization of the Agency's illicit trafficking
database and notification of incidents.  
<P>
Another meeting, in Vienna in September, of international
organizations (the United Nations,
INTERPOL, World Customs Organization, EURATOM, EUROPOL, IMO and
ICAO) examined the
cross-border movement of radioactive materials, including nuclear
materials. In 1995, the Agency
convened three meetings to address various aspects of guidance
needed by States in strengthening
their programmes concerned with the illicit movement of
radioactive sources.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Agency's radiation safety programme
encompasses research
co-ordination, development and harmonization of safety standards,
regulations concerning the safe
transport of radioactive material, emergency preparedness
procedures, practical assistance services,
training and information exchange. Together, these activities
provide a comprehensive and co-ordinated
framework for promoting good radiation protection practices in
Member States. The 1995 work
programme focused on three activities. The first was a systematic
document revision and elaboration
process to help users fulfill the requirements stipulated by the
new <I>International Basic Safety
Standards for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the
Safety of Radiation Sources</I> (BSS)
(jointly sponsored by the FAO, IAEA, ILO, OECD/NEA, PAHO and
WHO). The second effort covered
services and assistance to Member States in carrying out
radiological assessments. The third area was
the support of technical co-operation activities.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Strengthening of Radiation
Safety</I></B></FONT>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Agency began preparation of a set of
internationally agreed publications known
as 'Safety Fundamentals', which form the top level of the
Agency's Safety Series documents and cover
three topical areas: the safety of nuclear installations,
radioactive waste management and radiation
protection. The Fundamentals relating to the safety of nuclear
installations were issued in 1993. In
1995, work was completed on Fundamentals documents relating to
radioactive waste management, and
to radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources (the
latter co-sponsored by FAO, ILO,
OECD/NEA, PAHO and WHO - an important step forward towards global
harmonization in radiation
protection).   
<P>
Radiation protection embodies a set of protection and safety
objectives with corresponding principles for
achieving safety. The principles elaborated in the Fundamentals
publication include: justification of a
practice; dose limitation and optimization of protection;
measures to be taken to enhance operational
safety; the rationale for intervention; and design and
construction that ensure that a source is suited for
reliable, stable and easily manageable operation. Further
principles require governments to establish a
legal framework for the regulation of practices and
interventions, with a clear allocation of
responsibilities, including those of a regulatory authority.  
<P>
During 1995, considerable effort was devoted to ensuring that
appropriate guidance is available for
three important areas of application of the BSS in routine
operation, namely the protection of workers,
members of the public and patients undergoing medical diagnosis
or radiotherapy.  
<P>
Extensive guidance on the protection of patients had not been
issued previously by the Agency. With
the increased emphasis given to this subject in the BSS, and the
introduction of new concepts such as
guidance levels for use in diagnostic radiology, preparation of
general guidance on the interpretation of
the BSS in this important area was initiated and is proceeding in
collaboration with WHO and the
international medical community.  
<P>
To assist in the practical application of the new BSS, the Agency
convened in November 1995 a
seminar on advances in their implementation and experience in
applying the 1990 recommendations of
the ICRP. The technical sessions addressed such issues as: the
protection of workers, patients and the
public; potential exposure situations; emergency and chronic
exposure situations; administrative
requirements; exemptions; interventions; and national radiation
protection infrastructures.   
<A NAME="occupational">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Occupational Radiation
Protection</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Protection of workers is a major issue in every country that uses
radiation for medical and industrial
applications. Preliminary efforts were made in 1995 to prepare
guidance material on how to meet the
requirements stipulated by the BSS so that all aspects of
occupational exposure are covered, and on
aspects specific to the assessment of internal and external
exposures. In the development of this
guidance material, attention is being paid to the recommendations
of the ICRP and the ICRU.   
<A NAME="protection">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Radiation Protection of the Public and the
Environment</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Agency guidance material on the protection of the public by
limiting radioactive discharges to the
environment was revised and brought into line with the BSS. The
new document provides an
explanation on how to develop, through a regulatory system,
authorized discharge limits for various
practices.  
<P>
A conference, organized jointly with the EC and WHO, was  held in
April 1996 to coincide with the tenth
anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. Preparatory work carried
out in 1995 included an Agency
sponsored project to assist scientists in Belarus, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine to collect and
analyse a wealth of scientific data not previously available to
the international community. The results of
this analysis will be presented at the conference.  
<P>
The Agency undertook a review in 1995 of 19 000 km<SUP>2</SUP> of
land in Kazakhstan where
nuclear weapons
were tested over a period of forty years. This region, known as
Semipalatinsk, includes the town of
Kurchatov and a number of other inhabited villages and farms. At
the request of the Government of
Kazakhstan, two Agency expert teams visited the site in 1993 and
1994 to determine the current
hazards from living in the area.   
<P>
Of particular concern were the atmospheric and surface tests
carried out before 1962, five of which
were unsuccessful and resulted in the dispersion of plutonium
rather than a nuclear explosion. The
major sites selected for field work by the teams were the
settlements around the polygon of Dolon,
Sharzhal and Kainar, with the settlement of Akzhar near Kurchatov
as a reference site. Inside the
polygon efforts concentrated on the so-called 'Atomic Lake
Balapan', including the state farm in the
vicinity of the lake, Ground Zero, and other sites of atmospheric
and above ground explosions. Data
collection activities included gamma dose rate measurements, in
situ gamma spectrometry, and the
gathering of soil, grass and milk samples, and biological
indicators such as animal bones, mushrooms
and moss.   
<P>
The dose assessment included consideration of all relevant
pathways, most importantly external
gamma exposure from material on or in the ground, inhalation of
material resuspended from the ground
and consumption of contaminated food. The preliminary conclusions
were that doses to local
populations in the settlements are very low but that restriction
of access to land with high dose rates,
namely the Atomic Lake and Ground Zero, would be useful to
prevent re-occupation. Further systematic
studies are needed on plutonium levels in the soil and on the
levels of radionuclides in drinking water
sources. Overall, the results and dose assessments confirm that
there is no need for concern among
those living in the settlements around this test site.   
<A NAME="safe">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Safe Transport of Radioactive
Material</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
The Standing Advisory Group for the Safe Transport of Radioactive
Material (SAGSTRAM) continued to
advise on the comprehensive revision of the Agency's regulations
on this subject. The incorporation of a
system of radiological protection that is consistent with the BSS
was endorsed, including the
establishment of exemption values. Six specialist meetings
considered such areas as the requirements
applicable to the packaging of uranium hexafluoride, criticality
safety and alternative packaging for low
level radioactive material. Specific provisions will require the
use of highly accident resistant packaging
when large quantities of radioactive material are transported by
air.   
<A NAME="emergency">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Emergency Preparedness</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Work began on updating the Agency's emergency preparedness
guidance material in order to reflect
recent experience, and to provide a harmonized set of emergency
preparedness documents and
opportunities for training. This is being accomplished by
revising Agency guidance on the technical and
programmatic elements of emergency response, developing practices
that can be used to apply the
procedures immediately, conducting training workshops on the
practices, and using the updated
material as a basis for technical co-operation efforts to enhance
the emergency response capability of
certain Member States.   
<A NAME="safety">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Safety of Radiation Sources</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
The Agency's international inventory of major radiation sources,
mainly industrial irradiators and
radiotherapy sources, was further expanded to about 1000 records.
Information on 55 accidents known
to have occurred in radiotherapy centres and 9 accidents at
industrial irradiation facilities has been
analysed and will be published as guidance material to help
prevent future occurrences. All of these
accidents involved human factors, equipment failure and human-
machine interface problems, consisting
of the misinterpretation of conflicting signals and maintenance
errors. In the radiotherapy cases, human
factors problems dominated. Maintenance problems and deactivation
of interlocks also played
significant roles. The systematic incorporation of in-depth
safety principles and feedback into training
courses are measures   that could be adopted to reduce the
likelihood of such accidents.    
<A NAME="radiation">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Radiation Safety Services</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
A review of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) began in 1995 with
the aim of improving the Agency's
ability to fulfill its obligations under the Conventions on Early
Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on
Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological
Emergency. Operating procedures were
critically analysed and steps were taken to modernize the
communication system. Training was
intensified on ERU stand-by and activation mode procedures.  
<P>
Monthly internal exercises were carried out on quickly assembling
a team to respond to the initial
notification of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency.
External exercises involving Parties to both
Conventions, Member States and other international organizations
were held. These included
participation in exercises with Lithuania, Romania and the
Russian Federation, routine external
communication exercises and an exercise to test the capability of
WMO to rapidly provide the Agency
with atmospheric transport predictions. An off-site emergency
exercise in Guangdong Province, China,
was reviewed. Co-ordination continued with other United Nations
organizations that would have a role
to play in responding to a nuclear accident or radiological
emergency.   
<P>
Personnel monitoring and other services, including in-house
training, continued to be provided to
Agency staff involved in safeguards activities and to other
personnel. Such services were also extended
to field experts classified as workers occupationally exposed to
ionizing radiation. Equipment for the
monitoring of external and internal radiation exposure,
comprising thermoluminescence dosimeters and
a whole body counter, was significantly upgraded to meet the
Agency's internal needs. The Agency now
has available a dosimetry laboratory which is equipped with state
of the art technology. In addition, the
Agency's radiation protection rules and regulations were revised
in the light of the revision of the BSS.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> strong and dynamic global nuclear safety
culture continued to evolve and
develop in 1995. This process was characterized by three main
components: creation of binding
international legal instruments; promotion of internationally
harmonized, non-binding safety standards;
and extension of the acceptance of international expert review
and advisory services. The Agency
continued to foster this global nuclear safety culture by
supporting intergovernmental collaborative
efforts: it provided a forum for extensive information exchange;
promoted the drafting of international
legal agreements and the development of common safety standards;
and organized a wide variety of
expert services. These activities were complemented by the
sponsoring of co-ordinated research and
development and the widespread dissemination of information on
safety issues. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Strengthening Basic Nuclear

<P>
The Convention on Nuclear Safety, opened for signature in 1994
and signed by 62 countries by the
end of 1995, binds countries to basic principles covering the
regulation, management and operation of
land based civil nuclear power plants. One of the fundamental
obligations is to establish and maintain
an effective legislative and regulatory framework. A central
requirement calls for national reports
demonstrating the fulfillment of the various obligations at
meetings held at least every three years. Entry
into force of the Convention requires ratification, acceptance or
approval by 22 countries, 17 with
operating nuclear power plants. By the end of 1995, 14 countries
had deposited instruments of
ratification, acceptance or approval. In the light of
expectations of a rapid ratification process and entry
into force in 1996, two informal meetings of representatives of
signatories and other interested States
were convened in Vienna during 1995, focusing on the conduct of
the Meeting of the Contracting
Parties, the structure of national reports and procedures for
review.  
<P>
The International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG),
consisting of leading experts in nuclear
safety, continued to serve as a forum for the exchange of
information and the provision of advice on
safety issues of international significance. The Agency's General
Conference endorsed a proposal for a
common basis on which an acceptable level of safety for all
operating nuclear power plants built to
earlier standards can be judged. In response, INSAG prepared
report INSAG-8. Another report
(INSAG-9) discusses policy aspects, safety assessments, risk
considerations and probabilities, and is
intended to stimulate discussion and promote practical actions to
enhance safety.  
<P>
The comprehensive set of 60 nuclear power plant safety standards
and supporting guides under the
Agency's NUSS programme was first issued in the late 1970s.
Although revised standards and guides
have been published since, many guides are over ten years old.
During 1995, a review of NUSS
publications relating to nuclear power plant design, siting and
operation was carried out and
recommendations on revisions were made for consideration by the
relevant advisory bodies.   
<P>
Efforts continued to strengthen national nuclear safety
regulatory systems by identifying good practices
and structures and providing assistance with their
implementation. Three meetings were held, each
comprising up to seven regulatory bodies, to share experience
obtained from measures used to assess
the safety of existing nuclear power plants and to evaluate the
effectiveness of regulations aimed at
enhancing safety. The need to separate the responsibilities of
regulators and licensees was recognized.
It was also clear that a combination of prescriptive and
performance based approaches to regulation
needed to be used, and that performance based regulation is
simplest when there are quantifiable
objectives. The provision of useful information to the public
from the regulator and licensee was likely to
become increasingly necessary to ensure the continuing acceptance
of the operation of nuclear power
plants.   
<P>
The concept of 'safety culture' is not new to the nuclear
community and, during the past decade, has
been increasingly used in connection with nuclear power plant
safety. The Agency continued to
promote this concept in 1995 by issuing guidance on how to
interpret and assess safety culture, and
offering services in the form of missions and seminars under the
Assessment of Safety Culture in
Organizations Team (ASCOT) scheme. On the basis of the
considerable experience accumulated over
the past two years through 22 ASCOT seminars in 19 countries, the
ASCOT guidelines were revised,
with the emphasis shifted to self-assessment by the respective
organizations. ASCOT now offers
essentially three options: support for self-assessment before and
after the process; support for other
Agency reviews; and standard or expanded topical seminars. In
1995, one ASCOT seminar was held in
Romania in March. In addition, safety culture workshops were
conducted in Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic and Hungary.

Designers, professionals from operating organizations and experts
with experience in seismic safety
assessment are co-operating in co-ordinated research on seismic
analysis and testing of nuclear power
plants in order to enhance the seismic safety of WWER-440/213 and
WWER-1000 type reactors. Within
the scope of these long term studies, full scale dynamic testing
of a reference plant was a key activity
in 1995. The test was conducted for the Paks nuclear power plant
in Hungary. Explosives were blasted
at a safe distance from the plant and 150 experimental records
were obtained at different locations
(e.g. free field, reactor building foundation, floor levels and
major reactor components). A similar
experiment is envisaged for a 1000 MW WWER plant. Shorter term
safety considerations for existing
nuclear installations in relation to external hazards and site
safety of new nuclear power plants are
being reviewed within the scope of the Agency's Engineering
Safety Review Services (ESRS). In 1995,
25 such reviews were conducted for both WWER and other types of
nuclear facilities.   
<P>
With regard to the safety aspects of nuclear power plant ageing,
support continued to assist Member
States in maintaining the required safety margins over the plant
lifetime. This took the form of detailing
guidelines and assisting in their application. A significant
milestone was the organization of a meeting,
in co-operation with the Comisi&oacute;n Nacional Energ&iacute;a
At&oacute;mica of Argentina, on the effectiveness of methods for
the detection and monitoring of age related degradation in
nuclear power plants, held at San
Carlos de Bariloche in October. The meeting was attended by
specialists and managers from nuclear
power plants, regulatory and inspection agencies, and technical
support and design organizations. In
conjunction with this event, Research Co-ordination meetings were
held on the management of ageing
of concrete containment buildings and in-containment
instrumentation and control cables. The Agency's
studies on concrete containment ageing are proving to be
complementary, rather than overlapping, with
those carried out by the OECD/NEA.  
<P>
There was significant progress during the year in the preparation
of guidance material on fire safety at
nuclear power plants. A report on the evaluation of fire hazard
analyses for nuclear power plants was
published. Guidance was also prepared on: the assessment of
overall fire safety arrangements; fire
safety during operation;  the preparation of fire hazard
analyses; and on how to treat internal fires in
probabilistic safety assessments (PSAs). A fire safety review was
conducted at the nuclear power plant
at Karachi, Pakistan, and an interregional training course on
fire safety at nuclear power plants was
held in India.   
<P>
Finally, a CRP was started on accident analysis methodology
validation and verification to provide data
for the development of guidance on severe accident analysis and
accident management.    
<A NAME="operational">

At a conference on advances in the operational safety of nuclear
power plants, held in Vienna in
September, discussions centred on: managing and regulating safe
operation; safety performance and
the lessons learned; improving operational safety through the use
of PSA; and the enhancement of
safety through the dissemination of experience. Consensus was
reached that nuclear power plant
operational safety efforts are not stagnant but are progressing,
and that two categories of tools are
widely utilized: risk analysis tools, such as PSA, and multiple
feedback tools including peer reviews.
Safety culture is well recognized as a prerequisite for the
proper use of these tools. The conference
underlined the fact that learning from experience and fostering
teamwork offer an opportunity for the
further improvement of operational safety.  
<P>
A new computerized database, stored on CD-ROMs, was developed for
the Advanced Incident
Reporting System (AIRS). The database contains reports of safety
significant events from operating
nuclear power plants around the world. The full texts of these
reports, with tables and illustrations, have
now been incorporated and sophisticated query features permit
searches and more effective
dissemination of operational safety experience. The database will
be distributed regularly in electronic
form to participating Member States.  
<P>
The Agency continued its comprehensive, three week on-site
operational safety reviews by its
Operational Safety Review Teams (OSARTs), concentrating on
assessing management practices and
operational programmes along with the performance of plant
equipment and personnel. Work began on
guidelines for plant self-assessment, a process that is gaining
acceptance in Member States for the
evaluation of operational safety performance and the improvement
of operational practices.  
<P>
Within the Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team (ASSET)
service, two new additional options
were offered: peer reviews of self-assessment of safety
performance carried out by the plant, and
topical analysis missions. Peer reviews of plant self-assessment
can be carried out within five days,
thus significantly reducing the duration and costs of missions.
The topical analysis missions focused on
events reflecting safety culture issues. This is intended to
provide an international perspective on the
root causes of problems connected with quality control,
preventive maintenance, surveillance, feedback
and corrective actions.

Of the research reactors currently operating around the world,
more than 40% are over 30 years old.
This has raised some concern and recently particular emphasis was
given to the management of
research reactor ageing. At an international seminar hosted by
Germany in May in Hamburg,
information was presented on in-service inspection techniques and
methods for preventing or mitigating
ageing effects, as well as on ageing phenomena in reactor
components and materials. Questions of
ageing related safety reviews and regulatory involvement were
also addressed. While the general
conclusion was that good progress has been made over recent years
in the management of ageing, the
methods and approaches used could be improved to ensure safety
and efficiency. A CRP was started
in 1995 on non-destructive testing techniques, in-service
inspection and the detection of ageing
indicators.   
<P>
Missions to assess safety at research reactors -  Integrated
Safety Assessments of Research Reactors
(INSARR) -  visited Bangladesh and Viet Nam. Since the inception
of these services in 1972, a total of
123 missions have been conducted at operating research reactors
in 37 Member States. An analysis of
all the findings from these missions, including good safety
practices and practices that required
improvement, was initiated. Within the framework of technical
co-operation activities, assistance was
provided to Ghana and Egypt in the licensing review of the safety
of new research reactor projects.

<P></A>
As a result of the complexity and multidisciplinary character of
a probabilistic safety assessment (PSA),
and because PSA has reached the point where it affects decisions
on nuclear power plant design,
regulation and licensing, there is international consensus that
an intensive peer review by independent
and experienced PSA practitioners should be an integral part of
any such programme. Since the
establishment in 1988 of the International Peer Review Service
(IPERS) to make international expertise
available for reviewing PSAs, 35 review missions have been
carried out. In 1995, IPERS missions
visited three nuclear power plants: Temelin in the Czech
Republic, Bohunice in Slovakia and
Cernavoda in Romania.   
<P>
A review of the findings of past IPERS missions was completed
during 1995. The most critical issues
concern difficulties in acquiring, applying or adopting present
PSA methodologies and techniques, and
specific areas which need further investigation, such as the use
of component data, the treatment of
shared equipment and physical interaction dependencies and
accident sequence quantification. IPERS
can have a major influence on the quality of a PSA, thereby
strengthening the credibility of the PSA in
making safety related plant enhancements. On the basis of the
practical experience acquired over five
years, the IPERS guidelines were revised, with greater attention
being given, in particular, to human
reliability analyses.

A technical document on the development of safety principles for
the design of future nuclear power
plants was completed. The principles are modelled according to
information provided in the publications
INSAG-3 and INSAG-5. For future plants, explicit consideration of
severe accidents and minimization of
the off-site effects of severe accidents in design are stressed.
The broad international response to this
document revealed that the information serves as an impetus for
international harmonization of explicit
safety objectives and principles for future nuclear power plants.

Activities related to the safety of nuclear power plants in the
countries of eastern Europe and the former
USSR continued. A major milestone was the final identification of
safety issues for WWER-440/213,
WWER-1000/320 and the third generation RBMKs, and publication of
the findings. These reports
present a consolidated list of deficiencies (safety issues)
ranked according to their significance, and
contain corrective measures to improve safety. The judgement of
safety significance is based on an
evaluation of the potential degradation of defence in depth.
Plant specific operational safety issues were
identified without ranking. A series of topical meetings was
organized to review the status of unresolved
generic safety issues.  
<P>
For WWER-440/213 plants, the most important improvements relate
to the physical separation of
systems important to safety, in-service inspection and diagnostic
systems and verification of the design
of bubbler condenser containment. For WWER-1000/320 plants, the
issues relate to steam generator
integrity, the reliability of control rod insertion, and the
integrity of the reactor coolant pressure
boundary. A problem common to all WWER nuclear power plants is
inadequate fire protection and fire
fighting capability. Reviews of safety improvement programmes
were organized at Kozloduy Units 5-6
(WWER-1000), Rovno Unit 4 (WWER-1000) and Dukovany
(WWER-440/213).   
<P>
For RBMK plants, the most relevant issues are: the safety culture
as an underlying basis for operation;
void reactivity associated with the loss of coolant from the
channels of the control and protection
system; independent and diverse reactor shutdown; demonstration
of the applicability of the leak before
break concept; volume and procedures for in-service inspection;
and fire safety. In the identification and
ranking of the RBMK issues, the results of an international
project to investigate the safety of design
solutions and the operation of nuclear power plants with RBMK
reactors, funded by the EC and partially
completed in early 1995, were taken into account.  
<A NAME="communication">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Communication with the Public</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
The International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) is a means for
promptly and consistently communicating
to the public the safety significance of events at nuclear power
plants. It is also intended to facilitate
common understanding of events by putting them into a proper
perspective. Armenia, Croatia, Iceland
and Kazakhstan joined the INES information system in 1995, so
that 58 countries are now formally
participating.    
<P>
At their annual review of the system's operation, national
officers of participating countries
recommended the formal adoption of the INES scale for facilities
other than nuclear reactors, and the
preparation of information material, such as videos, to explain
the scale to the general public. In 1995,
a total of 62 events were communicated through the INES
information system, of which 56 occurred in
nuclear power plants and 6 in other facilities. None were at
level 3 or higher. Efforts continued to
simplify the INES rating procedure for events involving
degradation of defence in depth.

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Agency's activities in 1995 in the area
of nuclear power were focused
on several areas: developing improved versions of software for
energy, electricity and nuclear power
planning; assistance in planning studies in developing Member
States using the Agency's software;
on-line services and systematic monitoring of power reactor
information; technology issues on nuclear
power plant life management and the human-machine interface;
revision of quality assurance standards;
technology improvement for advanced nuclear reactors; seawater
desalination using nuclear energy;
and the transmutation of actinides.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Nuclear Power Planning and

<P>
The need for the Agency to provide assistance in nuclear power
programme planning to developing
Member States has increased over the years. In 1995, Belarus,
Brazil and Poland were added to the
list of countries receiving technical co-operation assistance in
applying the Energy and Power
Evaluation Package (ENPEP), which can be used to assess the
nuclear power option. In addition,
Albania, Estonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova and Viet
Nam received assistance in defining a framework for technical
co-operation projects on energy,
electricity and nuclear power planning. 
<P>
The large number of operating nuclear power plants in Member
States makes it imperative that
operation and maintenance personnel receive specific training in
the reliable and safe operation of
these plants. Recognizing this, the Agency in 1995 incorporated a
systematic approach to the training
of operations and maintenance personnel in a revised version of
the Agency's guidebook on nuclear
power plant training.

The adoption of an integrated approach to energy, electricity and
nuclear power programme planning is
assisted greatly by the use of the Agency's Wien Automatic System
Planning Package (WASP). The
newest version of WASP, known as WASP-III Plus, has been fully
documented through the publication
of a user's manual in the Agency's Computer Manual Series. In
addition, a significantly improved version
of WASP, called WASP-IV, was integrated into a single package and
is expected to be completed in
1996-1997.

Information for Member States on the status and operating
experience of nuclear power plants is
provided by the Agency's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS)
database. A new version, called
PRIS-PC, was made available on-line for direct access through the
public telephone network. Internet
access will be possible by the end of 1996. A subset of the PRIS
database for PC users, MicroPRIS, is
now being accessed by 225 users in 54 Member States and 8
international organizations.  
<P>
An extensive revision was carried out during the year of the
complete set of NUSS safety standards
and guides on quality assurance. Through the revision of the Code
and the associated 14 related
Safety Guides, the Agency is seeking to emphasize that managers
and workers both contribute to
ensuring quality and achieving safety. The Code is thus organized
into three functional categories - management, performance and
assessment - to underline that quality assurance is everyone's
responsibility. This performance based approach to quality
assurance serves to correct a common
misunderstanding that quality assurance consists only of
formalistic requirements of limited practical
value. 
<P>
Computerized support systems for nuclear power plants are already
in operation or under development
in several Member States. These systems, based on intelligent
data processing, are increasingly used
for achieving better productivity and improved reliability in
nuclear power plants, along with enhanced
operational safety. Recognizing the significant progress made by
the nuclear industry in developing this
technology over the last 25 years, the Agency initiated a CRP in
1992 on operator support systems in
nuclear power plants, which was completed in 1995. On the basis
of the results obtained, the Agency
completed the development of a database that provides consistent
and updated reference information
on existing operator support systems and related activities in
Member States. In the same area, a
technical report on the verification and validation of software
related to nuclear power plant control and
instrumentation was completed. This document contains
comprehensive information on computer based
systems that play a significant role in the safe operation of
nuclear power plants.  
<P>
An already established database on nuclear power plant life
management, which included results from
a CRP on the optimization of reactor pressure vessel surveillance
programmes and their analysis
(Phase III), was expanded and given the title International
Reactor Pressure Vessel Database.    
<A NAME="advanced">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Advanced Reactor Developments</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Interest in small and medium size reactors (SMRs) for use in
non-electrical applications as well as
power generation is steadily increasing among Member States. The
reactors will most likely find use in
such areas as sea-water desalination, district heating, oil
recovery enhancement, coal gasification and
methanol production. The Agency's activities in the field of SMRs
focused on providing technical support
for these projects. A Technical Committee meeting on small
reactors with minimized staffing and/or
remote monitoring, held in Mississauga, Canada, in May, assessed
the level of interest in small
reactors in various countries and explored potential applications
and technical approaches of common
interest.  
<P>
An Advisory Group meeting on the introduction of SMRs was held in
Rabat, Morocco, in October to
review the experience acquired by Member States during the
deployment of such reactors. The meeting
confirmed that there is a continuing interest in SMR deployment
in North African, Middle Eastern and
Far Eastern countries, that considerable operating experience has
been gained (which can benefit
developing countries), but that more information related to the
deployment of SMRs is needed. Local
participation and technology transfer were recognized as
important elements in the introduction of
SMRs.  
<P>
The large capital costs involved in the development of improved
and advanced nuclear power plant
designs have led to many national and international co-operative
efforts. The Agency's role in this
context is to serve as a forum for information exchange on
national programmes, scientific and
technical issues. In one such international co-operative research
activity, the Agency collected and
systematized a database of thermophysical properties for a broad
spectrum of light and heavy water
reactor materials over a wide temperature range. The
establishment of such a consistent set of
information provides an international source of data for
independent examination of the performance
and safety of various advanced reactor designs.  
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on the design, development and
testing of safety systems for
advanced water cooled reactors was convened in Piacenza, Italy,
in May. The results presented at this
meeting indicated that the basic designs of safety systems for
large evolutionary plants are well
established and have been derived from experience with existing
plants.  
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on the identification of severe
accidents for the design of future nuclear
power plants was convened in Vienna as part of the Agency's
ongoing activities to establish design
safety principles. In addition to agreeing on a consistent set of
severe accident phenomena, there was
consensus that internal and external events should be addressed
and that the resulting design features
should provide prevention and mitigation, with priority given to
preventive measures.   
<P>
At the final Research Co-ordination meeting for a CRP on acoustic
signal processing for the detection
of boiling or sodium water reaction in liquid metal fast reactors
(LMFRs), held in Obninsk, the Russian
Federation in July, it was reported that the CRP had been able to
evaluate different signal processing
techniques with real field data. The results were thus invaluable
to the designers of acoustic leak
detection systems. In the long run, this could help enhance the
economics of LMFRs through better
surveillance of the reactor core and steam generators. Signal
processing techniques developed in this
CRP for anomaly detection (i.e. boiling or leaks) can be used to
detect other types of anomalies in
thermomechanical equipment (such as cavitation and rattling) in
fast and thermal reactors.  
<P>
One of the goals of a CRP on the intercomparison of LMFR seismic
analysis codes was to validate and
improve the codes used for reactor core seismic analysis through
benchmark exercises. At the final
Research Co-ordination meeting for this CRP, which was held in
Bologna, Italy, these codes were
validated on the basis of an intercomparison of experimental and
analytical data. It was noted that the
results derived from this CRP had a broad range of applicability,
since they could be used for different
types of reactors.  
<P>
In 1994, the Agency was requested to initiate the Options
Identification Programme (OIP) with the aim
of selecting a limited set of practical options for nuclear
desalination demonstration facilities. The
options were to be based on reactor and desalination technologies
which were readily available without
any further development. A working group of representatives from
interested Member States and the
Agency selected the following practical candidates for
demonstration projects: a reverse osmosis
desalination process coupled to an existing or newly built water
cooled reactor of medium-size capacity,
and a multi-effect distillation process coupled to a small size
reactor in the 20-50 MW(e) range. Either of
these options could be implemented in the relatively near future. 
 
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on advanced fuels with reduced
actinide generation, held in Vienna in
November, identified reactor/fuel combinations, including thermal
reactors, fast reactors and accelerator
driven systems with fuels or targets from the uranium/plutonium
and thorium/uranium families in order
to reduce actinide generation. This area of work is of
considerable interest for alleviating the problems
of plutonium build-up and long lived wastes.

As part of Agency activities to assist Member States in nuclear
fusion research, three Technical
Committee meetings were held during 1995. The first meeting, on
alpha particles in fusion research,
was held at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, USA, in
April. The proceedings were published
in the 35th anniversary special issue of the journal <I>Nuclear
Fusion</I>. The second meeting, on
<I>H</I> mode physics and also held at the Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory, reviewed <I>H</I>
mode transition physics, theory, scaling, edge localized modes,
active control, and the potential benefits
of <I>H</I> mode operations for reactors. The third meeting, on
research using small tokamaks, was
held in Ahmedabad, India, in December. The topics reviewed
included plasma theory, heating, energy
confinement, MHD activity and diagnostics in 14 tokamaks. 
<P>
The final Research Co-ordination meeting for a CRP on the
development of software for numerical
simulation and data processing in fusion energy was held in
Vienna in November. As a result of this
CRP, better numerical simulation techniques and computer codes
are now available which will help
guide future plasma physics research. Many of the newly developed
codes are already running in
institutes that did not participate in this CRP. 
<P>
A report on the interim design, cost review and safety analysis
for the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER) was produced. This document comes at
the mid-point in activities
concerned with ITER   engineering design. The Agency provided an
atomic and molecular physics
database to the ITER project and published various administrative
and technical documents, including
the ITER <I>Monthly Newsletter</I>.

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>gency activities related to the nuclear
fuel cycle concentrate on: the
availability and market conditions for uranium resources; fuel
technology and performance in reactors;
spent fuel management and information systems for fuel cycle
facilities; and special nuclear materials.
During 1995, comprehensive studies were carried out on the supply
and demand for uranium,
technology associated with the increased burn-up of LWR fuels,
safety guidelines for the storage of
spent fuel from research reactors, the long term storage of spent
fuel, especially under dry conditions
and the disposition of plutonium.

The IAEA-OECD/NEA publication <I>Uranium 1995</I> -  
<I>Resources, Production and Demand</I>
(the 'Red Book'), a standard reference work over the years, has
for the first time become a genuinely
global report of uranium related activities, with information on
54 countries. The latest edition of this
report indicates that while there was no shortage of uranium
resources, there was a substantial
shortage of production capacity and low cost uranium resources.
In 1995, six countries - Australia,
Canada, Kazakhstan, Niger, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan
- produced over 70% of the worlds
total uranium. The 1995 worldwide reactor related requirements
were estimated to be about 61 400
tonnes of uranium per year, which was about 29 000 tonnes greater
than world uranium production.
Thus, only about 53% of the demand was being met by current
production. The balance is being filled
by inventory drawdown.  
<P>
Recent changes in the uranium industry were reviewed at a
Technical Committee meeting held in Kiev
in co-operation with the OECD/NEA. Key issues that were discussed
included uranium deposit
exploration, exploitation, resources, production and the world
supply/ demand relationship. This was the
first Agency meeting dealing with these subjects to be held in
the Commonwealth of Independent
States. Specialists from around the world were able to exchange
information at a time of heightened
interest in the supply of uranium as a result of predictions of
an acute production shortage.   
<P>
A new map of the worlds uranium deposits was published in
co-operation with the Geological Survey of
Canada. It depicts information on 582 uranium deposits, some of
which are active mining operations.
The most comprehensive compilation of such data to be published,
this map includes previously
unavailable information on uranium deposits in eastern Europe,
the former USSR and China. A more
detailed database on the deposits shown on the map is currently
being completed.

At the second Research Co-ordination meeting of a CRP on stress
corrosion cracking of Zircaloy fuel
cladding, held in Buenos Aires, data were presented on
pre-cracked specimens machined at the host
laboratory (AEA Technology, United Kingdom). They were evaluated
by the supervisory group
(comprising developed countries) and, as a result, the test
matrix was modified for the final phase of
the CRP. In addition, details of the equipment developed and the
procedures to be used in further tests
in this CRP were reviewed by the supervisory group, and
recommendations for improvements were
made.   
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on the behaviour of LWR core
materials under accident conditions, held in Dimitrovgrad, the
Russian Federation, concentrated on the properties of structural
and fuel materials and their interaction and behaviour under
various accident conditions, including loss of coolant,
reactivity insertion and severe accidents. The conclusion was
that the available data are not sufficient for high burnup fuel
behaviour modelling for either design basis or beyond design
basis accidents. However, owing to the complexity and high cost
of these experiments, as well as the continuing demand to justify
safe high burn-up fuel behaviour under accident conditions,
international co-operation in this area was viewed as an
important complement to national programmes.   
<P>
Developments in the areas of destructive hot cell examination and
fuel rod refabrication techniques
were reported by 15 institutes at the final Research
Co-ordination meeting of a CRP on examination
and documentation methodology for water reactor fuel (ED-WARF-2).
This meeting was also held in
Dimitrovgrad. As a result of this CRP, a guidebook on destructive
examination of water reactor fuel and
a catalogue of hot laboratories were completed and will be
published in 1996. Together with an earlier
published guidebook on the non-destructive examination of water
reactor fuel (the result of the
ED-WARF-1 CRP), these documents present a complete description of
current water reactor fuel
post-irradiation examination techniques and their availability
worldwide. They will fill a genuine need
among fuel designers, vendors and utilities.

An extrabudgetary initiative under the programme on the safety of
WWER and RBMK nuclear power
plants was   initiated in 1995. One of the first activities was
the convening  of a Technical Committee
meeting/workshop on the selection of dry storage technologies.
The goal was to provide guidance to
experts from eastern European Member States on the methods of
selecting interim dry spent fuel
storage technologies, and to provide a forum for in-depth
discussions on the licensing and safe
operation of these facilities. Follow-up activities include the
organization of a workshop in 1996 on the
licensing and quality assurance of dry storage facilities, as
well as new research on the behaviour of
spent WWER and RBMK fuel, and the modelling of their physical
parameters.  
<P>
Two international programmes currently dominate activities
regarding the management, interim storage
and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel from research and
test reactors. The first is the Reduced
Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) programme, and
the second is the proposed
take-back of spent research reactor fuel by the country where it
was originally enriched. The Agency
supported these two efforts in 1995 by co-operating in the
convening of the 18th International RERTR
Conference in Paris. Other activities focused on obtaining an
overview of spent fuel problems at
research and test reactors by preparing and maintaining a
database. A summary of the database,
presented at the 18th RERTR Conference, identified the need for
research reactor operators to prepare
spent fuel management plans to cover the complete period from
reactor core fuel unloading until
despatch to a reprocessing facility or to a final repository.

The increasing global inventories of separated civil plutonium
are attracting greater international
attention and concern. It now appears that plutonium from
dismantled nuclear weapons will further
increase these inventories. Worldwide estimates of civil
separated plutonium were developed and
published in the <I>IAEA Yearbook 1995</I>. The goal is to
produce reliable estimates of present and
future inventories of separated civil plutonium, which may then
be used to evaluate in an appropriate
manner the safety and non-proliferation issues. Such estimates
may also provide a foundation on which
appropriate plutonium management concepts, including burning and
disposal, can be developed.

<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>lleviating and mitigating the impacts of
human activities on health and the environment, while continuing
to ensure that an adequate supply of electricity is available for
social and industrial development, have become global objectives.
The Agency's activities in the area of the
comparative assessment of nuclear power and other energy sources
thus seek to incorporate health
and environmental aspects, in addition to technical and economic
factors, into policy making for the
power sector.  
<P>
Two studies were conducted jointly by the Russian Federation and
the USA, one on alternative
strategies for power development - the Joint Electric Power
Alternatives Study (JEPAS) - and the
second on the options for nuclear power development - the Joint
Parallel Nuclear Alternatives Study
(JPNAS), both focusing on the Russian Federation. The Agency was
asked to evaluate the possibility of
using the data and methodologies developed in these studies for
similar studies in other countries.  
<P>
The Agency convened a meeting of experts in November 1995 in
Vienna to review the results of these
studies. Also reviewed were a number of other cost-benefit
studies on electric and nuclear power
development, as well as safety studies of older, mainly Soviet
designed, reactors that have been
carried out by the Agency and different international
organizations and national institutes. It was noted
at the meeting that the situation in other eastern European
countries was significantly different from that
in the Russian Federation because most of these countries have
only one or two nuclear sites. The
studies, however, were considered to be useful as reference
material in national or site specific
evaluations. A number of possible future areas for study were
identified, such as the cost efficiency of
safety upgrades for Soviet designed reactors, decommissioning
costs, development of a database,
spent fuel management costs and technical co-operation support to
individual countries.  
<P>
Important contributions were made by the Agency to the work of
the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) during 1995, for example a joint IAEA-OECD/
NEA publication entitled
<I>Nuclear Power: An Overview in the Context of Alleviating
Greenhouse Gas Emissions</I>. The
Agency also participated in the First Conference of the Parties
to the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, held in Berlin in March, as well as in meetings
of various subsidiary bodies
established by the Conference of Parties.  
<P>
The Reference Technology Database was established in 1995. In
addition, a new software package,
DECPAC, for electricity system analysis was developed and an
intensive testing programme was
carried out of the methodology and computer tools developed
within the DECADES project. A parallel
activity was the implementation of country specific databases for
15 countries, covering more than 1500
technologies at all stages of the different energy chains.  
<P>
Under the DECADES project, an international symposium on
electricity, health and the environment
was held in October in Vienna. Organized by the Agency and nine
other international organizations, the
symposium focused on: implementing sustainable electricity
policies; the role of international
co-operation; assessment of health and environmental impacts;
implementation of comparative
assessment; and national case studies. Many studies and analyses
were presented dealing with such
subjects as data acquisition and the development of computer
models for the analysis and assessment
of different energy systems, the risks associated with emissions
of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other
greenhouse gases, the health effects of chemical releases, the
problems of including subjective
perceptions of risk, and the inclusion of external costs.
Significant uncertainties still exist in a number of
areas, for example with regard to the risks of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions and the effects on the
average temperature, and the risks of small releases of chemical
substances. However, the discussion
on external costs led to the important conclusion that if
greenhouse effects are included in the
assessment, hydro power and nuclear power are the only currently
available large scale energy
sources that have relatively low external costs.   
<P>
A project was initiated in 1995 on the comparative health and
environmental impacts of solid wastes
from energy systems and other sources. Five tasks are planned:
compiling and reviewing information
on waste streams and disposal concepts for energy system fuel
chains and other sources; identifying
available methods for the assessment and comparison of the health
and environmental impacts of
radioactive and non-radioactive substances; identifying the
available environmental fate and transport
models that may be used for comparative assessments; documenting
comparative assessments of the
potential health and environmental impacts of radioactive and
non-radioactive solid wastes from nuclear
and other energy systems; and co-ordinating case studies
comparing the health and environmental
impacts of radioactive and non-radioactive solid wastes from
nuclear and other energy systems.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Agency's food and agriculture programme
assists Member States in improving food security through
sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural
development. It does so by enhancing their capacity to use
nuclear methods across a wide range of commodities and
agroecological zones, with emphasis on improving crop and
livestock productivity, food safety and food quality. The
programme is operated jointly with FAO and implemented by the
Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and
Agriculture, and by the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and Biotechnology
Laboratory at Seibersdorf.  
<P>
Restructuring within FAO resulted in the upgrading of joint
activities to the status of a programme within FAO's Agriculture
Department. This offered the opportunity for strengthening the
complementarity and co-ordination of work with other FAO
divisions and, together with the Agency's Programme Performance
Assessment System (PPAS), provided focused strategy, objective
and task setting within each subprogramme. In addition, it
permitted the development of time-frames and milestones for the
attainment of specific objectives. 
<P>
A feature of the work in 1995 was the increasing involvement of
modern biotechnologies, such as nuclear based molecular methods,
in vitro culture techniques and monoclonal antibodies. The value
of including these methods in  sterile insect technique (SIT)
approaches to integrated pest management, mutation plant breeding
programmes and diagnostic tests for animal diseases is already
clear from the successes achieved in Mediterranean fruit fly and
rinderpest control and eradication activities. The continued
transfer of these methods over the past year and their expanded
role in training, analytical and research support activities at
the Agency's Laboratory are helping to improve knowledge and the
capacity in Member States to tackle important issues, and
represent an important investment towards future achievements.   
<H3><I>Soil Fertility, Irrigation and Crop Production</I></H3>  
A major thrust was optimization of the use of plant nutrients and
water for sustainable crop production, with one approach being
the identification of crops to suit the soil and environment.
Under a recently completed CRP funded by the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA), several genotypes of
wheat were identified in Morocco and Tunisia using the neutron
moisture meter technique. These genotypes were highly efficient
in utilizing limited amounts of water. Two of these, 'Massa' and
'Sarif', also had high grain yields. In addition, several
provenances of the gum arabic tree <I>Acacia senegal</I> were
shown to grow well in Sudan, where water availability is limited.
On the basis of these results, a provenance from the Qoz Ashgar
Forest of southern Sudan is now being recommended for
introduction into the gum belt for its rehabilitation.  
<P>
In Kenya, 22 provenances of <I>Acacia</I>, <I>Prosopis</I> and
<I>Casuarina</I> were
screened for drought tolerance in a semi-arid site in Machakos.
The results showed significant differences in water use
efficiency and dry matter yield. For example, <I>Acacias</I> from
the
Middle East and neighbouring north eastern African countries had
greater drought resistance than those from other regions of
Africa, while provenances from Costa Rica and Senegal were the
best for <I>Prosopis</I> and <I>Casuarina</I>. An interesting
feature
demonstrated in this programme was that carbon-13 isotope
discrimination is closely correlated with water use efficiency
and the dry matter yield of a crop. This technique can thus be
used in future research for the rapid screening of crop and tree
species for high water use efficiency and high yield.  
<P>
Another CRP completed in 1995 identified the growth stages of
maize, wheat and cotton that are more resistant to drought. It
was shown that 'water stress' during certain growth stages of
field
crops may not necessarily result in significant yield reductions.
For example, research in Brazil, Egypt and Romania showed that
cutting down irrigation at the vegetative stage did not reduce
the yield of maize. In China and Morocco, wheat produced the same
yields even when irrigation was reduced at tillering or at
maturity. These results have important implications for
increasing the efficiency of water use in crop production, since
by reserving water which would otherwise be used during the more
drought resistant stages, optimum crop growth and yield can still
be obtained with minimum water inputs.   
<A NAME="note_1"><H3><I>Plant Breeding and Genetics</I></H3></A>
Significant results were achieved during 1995 in the use of
radiation induced mutants for increasing crop production. In the
Altiplano of Peru, small farmer fields are located at more than
3600 m above sea level. This is a very stress-prone area
characterized by short vegetation periods, droughts and morning
frosts. Agency supported efforts by the National University of
Agriculture, La Molina, to improve barley, which is the main crop
that is grown there, made use of mutation techniques. A high
yielding, 'naked' grain and extremely early mutant was selected
from gamma ray irradiated seeds. This mutant was officially
released as a new barley variety in May 1995 and its use is
foreseen in large scale commercial production. In addition to
improved adaptability, this variety's naked grains are very well
accepted by consumers for preparing the traditional foods of the
Altiplano.  
<P>
In China, work on radiation induced mutations has been supported
for many years through various FAO/IAEA CRPs. With assistance
provided in 1995 through a technical co-operation project, rice
breeders from the China National Rice Research Institute and
Zhejiang Agricultural University started to grow rice mutant
varieties in five provinces along the Yangtze River - the main
rice growing areas in China. In total, nearly 600 000 hectares of
early season rice were cultivated with mutant varieties, which
gave an increase in rice production of about 263 000 tonnes over
the best varieties grown in certain provinces. The total gain to
farmers was estimated at $50 million, calculated on the basis of
the official price of rice on the international market.  
<P>
African farmers will soon benefit from new mutants of sorghum,
African rice and cassava which were developed through a recently
completed FAO/IAEA CRP supported by the Government of Italy. For
example, in Mali several stable mutants of sorghum were developed
with long panicles and better grain and drought tolerance, along
with white grain mutants of African rice (white grained varieties
have a higher market value than the normal red grain types).  
<P>
The use of in vitro culture techniques for the improvement of
vegetatively propagated crops in combination with radiation
induced mutations has proved to be of immense value for producing
the desired variation and in enhancing the selection of mutants
in a disease-free condition. In Ghana, cassava mutants were
selected for improved cooking quality and production of the
traditional native dish 'fufu'. These mutants have larger starch
granules, higher tuber yields and greater resistance to diseases.

<P>
At an FAO/IAEA international symposium on the use of induced
mutations and molecular techniques for crop improvement, held in
Vienna in June, there was confirmation that radiation induced
mutations followed by the appropriate selection procedures have
been instrumental in improving the performance of germplasm
throughout the world, since by 1995 nearly 1800 mutant varieties
had been officially released in 52 countries. In fact, mutant
induction and the understanding of mutations at the molecular
level and in biochemical terms are now the basis of much present
day research in plant breeding and genetics. As supporting tools
for conventional breeding, molecular techniques therefore have
the potential to assist in increasing productivity, improving
quality and developing new raw materials for industry.    
<A NAME="note_2"><H3><I>Animal Production and Health</I></H3></A>
The results of a recently completed CRP involving 13 Latin
American countries documented the benefits to milk production and
growth of supplementing cattle diets with a variety of
non-traditional sources of protein, such as leguminous trees,
poultry manure and urea-molasses blocks; similar information was
obtained in Asia and Africa. For example, village based systems
were developed in Indonesia to produce urea-molasses blocks which
were distributed to farmers and resulted in weight gains of up to
0.5 kg per week in fattening animals and two to three litres per
week in dairy cows. Similar gains were made in Sudan through
feeding a supplement derived from the residues of sorghum and
groundnuts, while even greater improvements were made in Morocco
through the supplementation of silage with fish waste and
molasses.  
<P>
Support was given to Member States in Africa and Asia for
serological monitoring of mass vaccination campaigns against
rinderpest using an FAO/IAEA immunoassay test for rinderpest
antibodies. This testing has shown that vaccination cover has
produced sufficiently high levels of immunity in the national
herds of most countries to warrant cessation of mass vaccination.
This will lead to annual savings of several hundred million
dollars. These countries will now proceed along an agreed pathway
towards international declaration of freedom from disease, which
will involve surveillance backed up by immunoassay and molecular
based diagnostic tests to identify and stamp out the remaining
few areas where the virus has survived. The tests were
transferred to national veterinary laboratories in 1995 to assist
in the task of final eradication.  
<P>
Trypanosomiasis control and eradication programmes were monitored
in 14 African countries using an enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) test developed by the International Livestock
Research Institute and at the FAO/IAEA Laboratory at Seibersdorf.

On the island of Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania, the use
of this assay has been crucial in supporting the SIT based tsetse
eradication project. The assay provides a sensitive indicator of
the presence of trypanosomes in the blood of cattle in the
sterile fly release area, and hence of the presence of tsetse
flies which, at low density, cannot be detected by present
trapping methods.  
<P>
Pilot quality assurance programmes were initiated by the FAO/IAEA
Laboratory at Seibersdorf in 1995 to monitor the reliability of
the results obtained through the use of radioimmunoassay (RIA)
and ELISA tests provided to Member States. A high level of
competence was shown by most participating laboratories.   
<A NAME="note_3"><H3><I>Insect and Pest Control</I></H3></A>
Substantial progress was made in the eradication of the tsetse
fly from the island of Zanzibar. Activities within a CRP and
research at the FAO/IAEA Laboratory at Seibersdorf to improve the
sterile tsetse fly rearing system, as well as the completion of
the second phase of the refurbishment of the Tanga mass rearing
facility on the Tanzanian mainland, led to an increase in the fly
colony from only 40 000 at the beginning of the year to over 400
000 at the end of 1995. In addition, the laboratory at
Seibersdorf continued monthly shipments of pupae in support of
the project. These intensified releases of sterile flies over the
southern part of the island, where the highest tsetse fly
populations are located, had the effect of drastically increasing
the sterile to wild fly ratio to over 200:1. Most wild females
trapped now show signs of induced sterility and the wild
population is rapidly disappearing. Sterile fly releases are
being extended to the central part of the island and, when
refurbishment of the third insectary of the Tanga facility is
completed, releases of sterile flies can be expected to cover the
entire island.  
<P>
An SIT Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) eradication project in
Chile culminated in the eradication of this pest from that
country, with benefits to the economy estimated at $500 million
per year. Although the southern and central regions of Chile were
already free of fruit flies and the country had developed a very
successful fruit export industry, its produce was still being
restricted from certain markets because of a fear of outbreaks as
a result of the presence of the medfly in the Arica region of
northern Chile. After a decade of unsuccessful attempts to
eradicate the fly using insecticides in this region, the Chilean
Agricultural Service requested technical support from FAO and the
Agency to establish an SIT eradication programme. As a
consequence, a medfly mass rearing facility with a production
capacity of approximately 60 million sterile flies per week was
completed in 1993, when sterile fly releases were initiated. No
wild medflies have been detected in the Arica region since the
first half of 1995. In addition, the pest has been suppressed in
Tacna, the southernmost valley of Peru. Future collaboration
within an expanded FAO/IAEA bi-national Chile-Peru project
foresees enlarging the eradication and control activities to
other fruit producing valleys in southern Peru.   
<P>
The year also saw the introduction of genetic sexing strains into
large mass rearing facilities for SIT control of the medfly. This
represents significant progress in the use of these strains,
which were developed at the FAO/IAEA Laboratory at Seibersdorf
over the last ten years. The white pupal colour sexing strain was
introduced into the eradication programme in Argentina, with
large scale releases planned for early 1996. Support activities
for a medfly SIT programme in Guatemala also gathered momentum
with the supply of the temperature sensitive genetic sexing
strain.    
<A NAME="note_4"><H3><I>Agrochemicals and Residues</I></H3></A>
Assistance continued to be provided to regions where agriculture
has been affected by radionuclide contamination from the
Chernobyl accident. In Belarus, research has shown that rapeseed
oil essentially free of caesium-137 can be produced on land
contaminated to a level of 0.5-1.5 TBq/km<SUP>2</SUP>. Some 10
000 hectares
were sown with rapeseed in 1995 to produce oil for lubricant
manufacture and it is intended to increase the area by three to
four times in 1996. This will provide a valuable cash crop for
areas where the production of food with acceptable levels of
radionuclides is uncertain. In Ukraine, assistance was given to
improve the facilities for monitoring radionuclide contamination
at a milk canning factory.   
<P>
Experimental protocols for studying the effects of pesticides in
non-target organisms in tropical agroecosystems, developed at the
FAO/IAEA Laboratory at Seibersdorf and the Swedish University of
Agricultural Sciences and funded by SIDA, were validated through
a CRP involving African research institutes. The focus of efforts
was on the insecticides lindane and endosulfan which are the two
most commonly used organochlorine compounds. Both were shown to
dissipate much faster in hot, moist tropical environments than in
temperate conditions and it was probably for this reason that
there was no evidence of serious environmental impacts resulting
from their use (e.g. on natural enemies of pests). Soil organic
matter breakdown was reduced, but this was not likely to
influence long term soil fertility. These results are highly
relevant for pesticide regulatory authorities in the
participating countries who normally must depend on information
generated in Europe or North America which may not be appropriate
to African conditions.    
<A NAME="note_5"><H3><I>Food Preservation</I></H3></A>
Through a seminar convened by the International Consultative
Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI) and the Secretariat of the
Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a unified
position was recommended to individual ASEAN governments for
consideration regarding the regulation of food irradiation and
acceptance of this technology to overcome trade problems in the
region.  
<P>
Among the tasks of a workshop convened by the ICGFI, with the
endorsement of the World Trade Organization, was clarification of
the implications of the trade in irradiated food, the various
provisions of the Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT), adopted during the GATT Uruguay Round. On the basis of
earlier recommendations by the ICGFI, the United States
Department of Agriculture announced in 1995 that it will issue a
new regulation to take effect in 1996 permitting irradiation as a
quarantine treatment of fresh fruits and vegetables against major
fruit fly species without a restriction on host commodities. Such
a regulation should facilitate wider international trade in
irradiated fruits and vegetables.  
<P>
Results from a recently completed CRP showed that if irradiation
is combined with other processes (e.g. low pH, low water
activity, and a modified atmosphere), the radiation dose can be
reduced and significant improvements made to the safety and
quality of treated products. In addition to individual food items
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, meat, and seafood), composite foods
such as sausages, kebab and prepared meals also benefited
significantly from the combined treatment. In some instances,
combined treatment resulted in shelf stable products which were
not only highly palatable but had modest energy requirements for
production, storage and distribution.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>gency activities in the area of human
health focus on the common
concerns of developing Member States that can be most effectively
addressed using nuclear
technologies. The programme promotes the diagnosis as well as
palliative and curative treatment of
cancer, the accurate evaluation of nutritional deficiencies in
women and children, the timely detection of
infections and communicable diseases, and radiation dosimetry.
Advances in molecular biology
facilitated the introduction in 1995 of a new area of work
centred on genetic disorders which, together
with other programme components, such as nutritional studies, is
giving increasing emphasis to aspects
of preventive medicine.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Nuclear Medicine</I></B></FONT>
<P>
Agency efforts to adapt nuclear medicine technology to the needs
and local conditions in Member
States and to significantly reduce the costs of procedures have
included the introduction of bulk
methodology and the indigenous production of reagents for
radioimmunoassay (RIA). These techniques
give a four fold to six fold cost reduction per assay in many
developing countries. Similarly, the
hardware interfaces and applications software developed by the
Agency to link gamma cameras to
personal computers for digital data and image processing -
obviating the need for costly hardware -
make possible a three fold to five fold cost reduction in data
processing systems. A limited field trial that
started in 1995 is seeking to document these savings.  
<P>
The Agency has also served indirectly as a catalyst in promoting
the production by commercial firms of
simple, low cost gamma cameras and single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) systems,
fitted with updated technology, to suit the needs of developing
countries. The benefits are increased
availability of equipment to Member States and lower costs for
technical co-operation projects.  
<P>
In related work, an inexpensive on-line circuit for field
uniformity and photon energy correction has been
used to upgrade and restore old, non-operational, analog gamma
cameras to working condition. Efforts
were initiated in 1995 to repair three 10-15 year old gamma
cameras of this type in Argentina, India and
Myanmar as part of a plan to upgrade to digital technology or to
restore as many old analog gamma
cameras as possible. It is estimated that there are about 500
such instruments (more than 65% of
which are in developing countries) which can benefit by this
upgrading. 
<P>
Technical co-operation projects were initiated in Ethiopia, The
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Uganda in 1995 for the production of radiopharmaceutical kits
in hospitals. The goal of these
projects is to help reduce costs and increase self-reliance.  
<P>
A randomized clinical trial comparing strontium-89 and
phosphorus-32 for the treatment of painful
cancer deposits in bone is being conducted to find out whether
phosphorus-32 (which is inexpensive
and easily available) can replace strontium-89 (which is
expensive and not easily available). This study
underlines Agency efforts to promote relevant, cost effective and
applicable techniques for use in
developing countries. The same philosophy is at the root of a
recently completed CRP comparing
scintigraphy and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of liver
diseases.  
<P>
The Agency has adopted a two level approach to improve the
technical skills of nuclear medicine
professionals. At one level, a pilot distance training programme
for nuclear medicine technicians is
being carried out in countries of the RCA region (i.e. India,
Indonesia and Malaysia). When completed
in 1996, the training materials will be translated into various
national languages and will be utilized by
more than 3000 technicians presently working without any formal
training at nuclear medicine
departments in developing Member States. The materials can also
be used to complement existing or
planned training courses conducted by Member States.   
<P>
At another level, the Agency has served as a catalyst in the
establishment of the Ibero-American Board
for the Certification of Nuclear Physicians by the Latin American
Association of Societies of Nuclear
Medicine and Biology (ALASBIMNM), as well as in the
implementation of the first certifying examination
in November 1995. The examination was simultaneously carried out
in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Ecuador, Portugal and Spain. The creation of this Board served as
a stimulus for the setting up of the
European Board of Nuclear Physicians. At present, the Agency is
promoting the foundation of a similar
board for the Asia and Pacific region by the Asia and Oceania
Federation of Nuclear Medicine and
Biology. In the future, it is expected that the three regional
Boards will be bound together by a single
international body dedicated to developing common question papers
that will increase the fairness and
validity of examinations for nuclear medicine professionals.  
<P>
The diagnosis of genetic diseases using radionuclide based
molecular techniques is acquiring greater
importance as a result of changes in disease patterns observed in
many developing countries.
Improved socioeconomic conditions have led to a decrease in
infant and childhood mortality rates,
which in turn have resulted in an increase in the incidence of
genetic (hereditary) diseases. A CRP
initiated in 1995 concentrated for the first time on diagnostic
methods for common hereditary diseases,
such as thalassemia, fragile x-syndrome and certain neurological
diseases.  
<P>
A CRP on nuclear investigations of cerebral function was
completed during the year. One beneficial
result was that it helped to rationalize the use of certain
drugs, such as Nicerogoline, Indobufen and
Tanakan, for patients with cerebrovascular disease. It also
provided scientific documentation of changes
in regional cerebral blood flow following acupuncture.  
<P>
An international symposium entitled <I>Tomography in Nuclear
Medicine - Present Status and Future
Prospects</I> was held in August in Vienna. The symposium
highlighted the increased use of SPECT
to obtain data on patients which was hitherto only possible using
the much more expensive technique
of positron emission tomography. The proceedings will be
published in 1996.

Special emphasis is being placed on increasing the efficiency and
improving the cancer cure rate in
radiotherapy units in developing Member States. Since up to 80%
of new cancer cases in these
countries are detected at the advanced disease stage, the
following three converging avenues were
selected for attaining these goals: 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- Developing a standardized programme on quality assurance,
including every step in the clinical
procedure from patient selection to radiation dose delivery;     
<P>
<DD>- Evolving optimal protocols for the treatment of advanced
cancer types common in developing
countries by twinning radiotherapy departments in developing
countries with corresponding departments
in developed Member States;   
<P>
<DD>- Implementing randomized clinical radiotherapy trials
combined with other treatment modalities
for different types of advanced cancer.  
</DL>
<P>
Significant cost reductions in radiation therapy have been
achieved as a result of the Agency's
mediation with commercial manufacturers in the production of
simple, inexpensive, after-loading
systems for low, medium and high dose rate brachytherapy,
combined with updated technology to fit
the needs and conditions in developing countries. Efforts are
being made with other firms for the
production of low cost teletherapy cobalt-60 equipment.  
<P>
In an attempt to solve common problems affecting the practice of
radiotherapy around the world, and in
developing countries in particular, a new CRP was initiated on
the use of radiotherapy in advanced
cancer. Because the majority of the approximately 10-11 million
new cases diagnosed worldwide every
year occur in developing countries, the aim of this CRP is to
interface radiotherapy departments in
developed and developing countries in order to formulate optimal
therapeutic approaches to the
treatment of common cancers. Three protocols are undergoing
trials in this CRP: one for half-body
irradiation techniques, and one each for cancer of the uterine
cervix and intraluminal brachytherapy for
carcinoma of the oesophagus.  
<P>
There was also emphasis on encouraging quality assurance
programmes in clinical radiotherapy
departments. A new CRP on quality assurance in radiotherapy was
started in Latin America on the
basis of a protocol recommended by a team of Agency experts. It
is expected that the experience from
this project will assist the Agency in defining a standardized
programme on quality assurance which
could be adopted by interested radiotherapy departments among
Member States and, in particular, by
the participants in 65 ongoing technical co-operation projects on
the subject.  
<P>
A CRP was initiated in 1995 on the application of heavy charged
particles in cancer radiotherapy. Only
a few centres, mainly located in developed countries, currently
possess such facilities. This CRP is
expected to provide a much needed <I>international</I> forum for
the review and co-ordination of
national programmes on the use of heavy charged particles in
radiotherapy.   
<A NAME="dosimetry">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Dosimetry</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Radiation dosimetry and medical radiation physics are fundamental
in ensuring a patient's radiation
safety and in optimizing radiation therapy practices. The main
emphasis in the field of dosimetry was on
continuing and improving the services provided to Member States. 

<P>
Following the establishment of facilities and a syllabus for a
national training programme in medical
physics in Mexico, these activities were upgraded in 1995 to the
category of a model project for Latin
America. The aim is to replace simpler professional training with
postgraduate university degrees in
medical physics. The lessons learned during the implementation of
this project will be applied in other
Member States.  
<P>
The number of IAEA/WHO Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories
(SSDLs) rose in 1995 to 73
laboratories and 6 SSDL national organizations in 58 Member
States; it also includes 14 affiliated
members, mainly Primary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories (PSDLs),
the International Commission for
Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and other international
organizations. Support to
laboratories in Member States included calibration of their
secondary standards for radiation
measurements and quality audits of their services, mainly to
radiotherapy installations.  
<P>
As the central point of the network and as the link to the
international measuring system, the Agency in
1995 provided calibrations of 22 reference ionization chambers
and dosimeters for 12 SSDLs. A total of
59 ionization chambers belonging to SSDLs and hospitals were
calibrated (i.e. 410 calibration points at
different radiation qualities). The quality audit system based on
mailed thermoluminescence dosimeters
(TLDs) was used for 6 SSDLs to verify their calibrations of
cobalt-60 therapy units and medical
accelerator radiation beams.   
<P>
A new service was begun in 1995 to develop procedures for the
calibration of radiation sources used in
brachytherapy and related measurement equipment, first at the
Agency's dosimetry laboratory at
Seibersdorf and later at SSDLs. This unique service is meant to
extend the traceability of does
delivered in brachytherapy treatments to international standards. 

<P>
The IAEA/WHO TLD postal service distributed 425
thermoluminescence dosimeters to radiotherapy
centres in developing Member States. These dosimeters are used
for dose quality audits of photon and
electron beams for cobalt-60 therapy units and medical
accelerators. In addition, results from 100
cobalt-60 beams and 134 accelerator photon and electron beams
were processed during the year.  
<P>
Testing of the new method of using TLD dose checks of electron
beams was completed in 46
radiotherapy institutions in Europe and the USA, and procedures
were developed to expand the TLD
postal service to routinely include electron treatment beams.
Part of this work was carried out in
collaboration with the SSDLs of Argentina and India using Agency
technical expertise. Procedures for
the follow-up of hospitals that are outside the acceptance limits
now include a user-blind repetition of
the exercise. Experts are now being recruited to resolve
confirmed deviations.  
<P>
The International Dose Assurance Service (IDAS) for industrial
dosimetry in radiation processing
facilities was continued. A new batch of alanine-ESR dosimeters
was calibrated with traceability to the
National Physical Laboratory, the PSDL in the United Kingdom.
Sixty-eight dosimeter sets were
distributed to 20 participating institutes from 16 Member States.
This service has, since its initiation,
been limited to cobalt-60 radiation. However, following the
recommendations of a CRP on electron
dosimetry, a transfer dosimetry system for electrons with energy
higher than 4 MeV based on
alanine-ESR is being implemented to extend the IDAS to electron
beams. In related work, a study is
being conducted to evaluate the therapeutic use of the
alanine-ESR dosimetry system, which is already
being used very effectively in industrial applications.  
<P>
An intercomparison of gamma ray irradiation beams between nine
calibration laboratories, organized in
collaboration with the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures,
was completed. The last such
intercomparison was held about ten years ago. The standard
deviation of the population was 2.1% at
15 kGy and 2.4% at 45 kGy. The Agency's  value agreed with the
mean value to within 1% for both
dose levels. In practice, this means that variations between the
nine calibration laboratories are very
small and that their overall deviation from the Agencys mean
value is even smaller.  
<P>
A new Agency Code of Practice for the calibration and use of
plane parallel ionization chambers in
therapeutic electron and photon beams was submitted for
publication. This document complements and
updates the 'IAEA Protocol' for the calibration of clinical beams
used in external radiotherapy (Technical
Reports Series No. 277), which is the Code of Practice most
widely used in Member States.   
<A NAME="nutritional">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Nutritional and Health Related Environmental
Studies</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Malnutrition afflicts more than 800 million people in developing
countries, with children and women
during pregnancy being most affected. Nutrition is therefore one
vital area of human health where
nuclear techniques can be applied to prevent disease and help
people achieve their full potential. An
essential component of any intervention seeking to improve
nutritional status is the ability to perform
accurate evaluations. Isotopic tracer techniques are unique in
that they can be used to measure
peoples nutritional stores and predict long term outcomes, such
as school performance, worker
productivity, pregnancy outcome, morbidity and mortality. Their
growing use should increase the cost
effectiveness of intervention programmes, because programmes can
be adapted and corrected during
the early phases to the results of the early predictors. In
addition, they can reduce the population
sample size to obtain statistically significant information
because the coefficient of variation of isotope
measurements is considerably smaller than that of conventional
measurements.  
<P>
Nuclear techniques are being used for the first time to measure
vitamin A reserves in people at risk of
deficiency. This programme has led to a major collaborative
effort involving the Agency, WHO and two
Member States. Another project is under way in Peru to evaluate
the nutritional impact of a national
school breakfast programme which is delivering breakfasts each
school day to 500 000 children over a
four year period.   
<P>
Significant progress was achieved in 1995 through improved
quality management in environmental
programmes using nuclear analytical techniques, particularly in a
regional RCA programme supported
by UNDP. New quality assurance materials and proficiency testing
procedures have been developed
with the assistance of the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf,
and a comprehensive new database on
certified analytical reference materials has been created (which
will shortly be made available on the
Internet). For air pollution studies, a standard design air
sampler is now operational in more than 30
Member States. This will, for the first time, allow accurate
comparative data to be obtained on pollution
levels and sources in a large number of developing Member States. 

<P>
A gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass spectrometer was installed
in 1995 at IAEA-MEL. This
instrument is being used to 'fingerprint' non-nuclear pollutant
sources and to search for novel chemical
markers of pollution.  
<P>
Within the framework of an umbrella project with UNEP, IAEA-MEL
provided  comprehensive technical
support in the assessment of marine pollution. Regional training
courses were held in Morocco, Peru,
the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Courses in Monaco were
conducted on the analysis of trace
elements and organometals, organochlorine compounds and petroleum
hydrocarbons. Twenty advisory
and technical missions were carried out in 13 countries.
Instrument maintenance services were also
provided to ten Mediterranean Pollution (MEDPOL) laboratories in
seven Mediterranean countries.  
<P>
The preparation of IAEA-UNEP-IOC reference methods and technical
bulletins for marine pollution
studies was given high priority. Thirteen methods were revised,
eight new methods were issued, two
methods were translated and one technical bulletin was prepared.
The series now includes over 65
volumes.  
<P>
Activities in the Analytical Quality Control Services programme
included the distribution of a sea plant
homogenate (IAEA-140) to 207 laboratories worldwide for the
intercomparison of organic contaminants.
In addition, two intercomparison samples for the determination of
trace  elements in biota and
sediments (MA-MEDPOL-1/TM and SD-MEDPOL-1/TM) were distributed to
80 laboratories in the
Mediterranean Sea area. They were specifically organized for
MEDPOL laboratories in order to test the
reliability of procedures and the viability of analytical data,
as well as to target future areas of technical
support.  
<P>
A report on worldwide and regional intercomparisons for the
determination of organic contaminants in
Mussel Homogenate (IAEA-142) was completed. In total, 93
laboratories reported results for
organochlorine compounds and petroleum hydrocarbons, and 12
laboratories reported results for the
quantity of total mercury and methyl mercury. On the basis of the
data evaluation, the IAEA-142 sample
can now be considered for certification as a Reference Material
for the above analytes.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>gency activities in 1995 in the area of
industry and earth sciences
concentrated on applications of nuclear and radiation techniques
in the industrial sector and on the
utilization of isotope hydrology in water resources development
and environmental management. In
industrial applications, emphasis was placed on process control
optimization, development of materials
with improved performance, quality assurance modalities of
materials through non-destructive testing,
environmental mitigation using radiation technology and
monitoring of industrial pollution. The increased
importance given by Member States to the use of isotope
techniques in water resources development
and management has provided fresh momentum to Agency efforts. The
management of water
resources in regions suffering from scarcity, the assessment of
the human impact on water resources,
such as water pollution, and the proper use of geothermal water
resources were all important areas of
activity. Complementary studies on climate change were also
pursued.   
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Industrial Applications</I></B></FONT>
<P>
Radiation processing is being recognized as an 'environmentally
friendly' technique because it replaces
other processes that create pollution and actively contributes to
the protection of the environment. This
is well demonstrated by the use of electron beam radiation to
clean flue gases from coal and oil
burning electrical and heat generation plants. The technique has
been effectively demonstrated in
several countries, some with support from the Agency (e.g. in
Poland). The main accomplishment in
1995 was a feasibility study and the selection of basic
irradiation equipment for a full scale electron
beam industrial facility in Poland. This facility is expected to
be in operation by 1998 to meet the
regulatory requirements in effect at that time. In addition, a
pilot electron beam radiation plant and a
larger scale model project plant in Poland were being used for
training activities.   
<P>
The stability of plastics under irradiation has been under study
in a CRP that started in 1994. The
subject has importance for the safe operation of nuclear power
plants, in industrial radiation facilities,
space exploration, sterilization of medical products and other
fields. In 1995, a Research Co-ordination
meeting focused on several aspects of polymer irradiation, in
particular the stabilization of plastics used
by the medical products industry and in radiation sterilization
(i.e. of syringes, needles, blood and
infusion sets). New techniques for the characterization of
polymer surfaces (atomic force microscopy)
were presented at this meeting, as were new formulations that
remain stable under irradiation.   
<P>
The substantial role that nuclear technology can play in
environmental conservation is illustrated by the
variety of nuclear techniques now being used in the exploration
and exploitation of natural resources
such as coal, oil, gas and minerals. For example, the significant
economic benefit that can be derived
from being able to subdivide large quantities of waste materials
into a class of usable materials was the
guiding principle behind a CRP which was concluded in 1995. This
CRP examined the use of gamma
measurements as an aid in separating usable waste material from
non-usable products. Other topics
investigated were the removal of heavy toxic metals from liquid
industrial wastes, the validation of the
containment of solid wastes, separation processes for the
efficient removal of toxic compounds from
bulk wastes, and monitoring of process wastes to determine their
eventual reuse or method of storage.
The results of these investigations will be published in an
Agency technical document.

<P></A>
The Agency's symposia on isotope hydrology, usually held every
four years, play a major role in
disseminating new achievements in the development and application
of isotope techniques in
hydrology, water resources management and associated
environmental disciplines. The ninth
symposium was held in March in Vienna with an emphasis on the
practical applications of isotope
techniques in managing groundwater resources. Two-thirds of the
papers and posters presented at the
symposium were related to such subjects as the origin and
recharge of groundwater, groundwater
dynamics, groundwater pollution, modelling approaches, and
geothermal and palaeowater resources.
The remaining contributions dealt with surface water and
sediments, unsaturated zones and
methodological aspects.   
<P>
In order to maintain the requisite level of training for the
proper implementation of water resources
development projects, the Agency has been convening group
fellowship training courses every two
years for scientists from developing Member States. The fifth
such course was held in Vienna from
August to October and the participants received training in the
principal fields of isotope hydrology.
Special emphasis was placed on practical training in laboratory
and field work, carried out in Vienna,
Graz and Munich, as well as in the use of computers for
mathematical modelling and data processing.  
<P>
In regard to progress achieved in implementing model projects in
isotope hydrology, a project in
Venezuela identified the sources of groundwater recharge in the
Caracas Valley and assessed the
vulnerability of the groundwater to pollution. On the basis of
these studies, 15 new locations for drinking
water wells were identified and successfully commissioned.  
<P>
Within the framework of a regional model project for Africa on
the use of isotopes in groundwater
resources development (involving Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and
Senegal), field investigations were
carried out and water samples collected. These samples are being
analysed in laboratories at the
Agency and in India, France and the United Kingdom. First results
from Moroccan isotope data indicate
the prevalence of palaeowater, disproving the assumption that the
groundwater system was recently
replenished. This is a clear indication that continued overuse of
this water will exhaust the available
groundwater store, leading to a rapid decline of the water table.
This has direct implications for
decisions on water management practices.  
<P>
The rising water level of the Caspian Sea is of considerable
concern to the five states bordering this
body of water. A technical co-operation programme involving a 15
day cruise was carried out in
September, during which ten participants from the littoral
states, three outside experts and two Agency
staff members carried out studies pertaining to oceanographic,
isotopic and chemical parameters of the
water at different locations and at various depths. Close
technical collaboration was established
between the littoral states. Laboratory analyses are in progress
and detailed evaluation of the data
generated is expected to pave the way for a better understanding
of the rise in water level and eventual
remedial measures.  
<P>
Several United Nations agencies and other specialized
organizations are engaged in the study of global
climate change. The Agency has been a pioneer in this area for
more than 30 years, with a worldwide
network that collects precipitation data and provides information
on the isotopic composition of
precipitation. In order to strengthen the foundation for
collaboration between the various international
organizations, the Agency convened a meeting in November at which
a new framework for the
involvement of various organizations was discussed. A newly
established interagency steering
committee is expected to co-ordinate activities and provide the
necessary resources for the 'Global
Network of Isotopes in Precipitation' (GNIP).   
<P>
Considerable efforts have been directed towards improving
predictions of climate changes induced by
human activities and their impact on the global environment. One
promising approach is the study of
past climate changes through isotope investigations of climate
archives. Isotope techniques have
proved to be indispensable as proxy indicators of the climate and
a dating tool for past climatic events.
Substantial progress has been made in this field through a CRP on
the use of isotope techniques in
palaeoclimatology, with special reference to continental isotope
indicators of palaeoclimate. 
<P>
At the final Research Co-ordination meeting held in November in
Munich, new data were presented on
the concentration of noble gases dissolved in the groundwater of
regional aquifer systems in North and
South America, Europe and Africa. The evaluation of the data in
terms of the air temperature difference
between the Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum provided a
value of about 5&#176;C for the
tropical regions. This result challenges the widely adopted
climatic reconstructions  for low latitude
regions and has important implications for global climate
modelling studies. Isotope studies of lacustrine
sediments from several lakes located in the Tibetan plateau
provided evidence of large scale changes
in the intensity of the Indian monsoon and associated rainfall
during the Holocene period. This confirms
the vulnerability of the climate in southeast Asia to relatively
small changes in the physical parameters
of the atmosphere.

The Agency's Statute was approved on 23 October 1956 by
the Conference on the Statute of the IAEA held at United Nations
Headquarters, New York; it entered into force on 29 July 1957.
The Headquarters of the Agency are situated in Vienna. Its
principal objective is  "to accelerate and enlarge the
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity
throughout the world".

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Director General approved an action plan
designed to improve the
status and representation of women in the Secretariat. A
statement was delivered at the United Nations
Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, outlining the
Agency's commitment to the
advancement of women. The percentage of women at the end of 1995
among the Professional staff
was 17%. Developing countries provided 32.1% of the staff subject
to geographical distribution.  
<P>
A comprehensive programme was implemented under which
approximately 600 staff members received
training to improve their job related skills, with particular
emphasis on communication and managerial
skills. Four Junior Professional Officers from developing
countries received on-the-job training in
administrative and scientific/technical areas in the Secretariat
designed to enable them to apply for
regular positions or use the experience gained in their home
countries.  
<P>
Studies were initiated on the costing and effective use of human
resources in the Secretariat. Some of
the studies provided a basis for determining the human resources
requirements for the 1997-1998
budget proposals. Others will focus on the impact of office
automation and the use of temporary
assistance.  
<P>
<I>Legal</I>
<P>
The Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage continued
its examination of the revision of
the Vienna Convention and elaboration of an instrument for
supplementary funding. The Committee
adopted, with the exception of liability amounts, and
reservations to some provisions, a full set of draft
texts for an amending protocol to the Vienna Convention. The
draft amendments cover important areas
where a need for improvement was recognized, such as: the
geographical scope of the convention; its
application to military installations; the concept of nuclear
damage; increase of operator liability and
provision for an Installation State tier; and extended time
limits for the submission of claims.  
<P>
On the question of supplementary funding, two basic approaches
were under consideration. One
provides for a convention that will operate within the legal
framework of the Vienna and Paris
Conventions and cover both transboundary and domestic nuclear
damage. The other approach
envisages a free standing convention which is open to adherence
irrespective of participation in the
Vienna or Paris Conventions and is dedicated to transboundary
nuclear damage only. As there was no
consensus on either approach, efforts were made to reconcile them
into a single draft. Thus, there
would be a free standing instrument whose system is supplementary
to national legislation that (a)
implements the Vienna or Paris Conventions, or (b) would be
consistent with the requirements set out
in an annex to the draft convention which restate the major
liability norms of the two conventions. A
single supplementary fund would cover domestic and transboundary
damage on the basis of a specified
ratio. Contributions by States parties to the fund would be based
on a formula which takes into account
their nuclear capacity and their rate of assessment to the United
Nations regular budget. The position of
non-nuclear States was also taken into account. A convergence of
views appeard to be possible on the
form and many provisions of the new draft. Also, in informal
consultations, elements of the structure of
the supplementary fund were identified as a basis for further
work.  
<P>
On the basis of the progress made, the Standing Committee at its
13th session concluded that it
seemed feasible to prepare texts for the amending protocol to the
Vienna Convention, as well as a
convention on supplementary funding to be submitted at a
diplomatic conference. The goal of the
Committee was to complete its preparatory work before the end of
1996.    
<A NAME="technical">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>Technical Co-operation Servicing and
Co-ordination</I></B></FONT>
<P></A>
Efforts in the technical co-operation area were focused on
consolidating recent experience and
initiatives to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the
programme. Five key activities now
provide a more strategic orientation to co-operation with Member
States:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-  Model projects
<P>
<DD>-  Country planning frameworks 
<P>
<DD>-  Sectoral planning
<P>
<DD>-  Expanded co-ordination with other multilateral and
bilateral organizations
<P>
<DD>-  Streamlining of management practices and procedures.
</DL>
<P>
These initiatives resulted from discussions in the Board of
Governors and as an outcome of the Policy
Review Seminar in September 1994. A new and unifying goal was for
the Agency to establish a
'partnership in development' with Member States. This goal has
required a significant emphasis on
planning and assessment, which dominated technical co-operation
activities during the year.  
<P>
Over the last two years, the Agency has gained valuable
experience in transferring the benefits of
nuclear technologies to end users through 'model' projects. The
implementation of 11 new projects of
this type began in 1995, bringing the total number to 23. One
lesson learned is the need to identify
clear objectives and develop verifiable indicators of project
performance. Such indicators have now
been established for each model project and project objectives
have been reviewed. The introduction of
performance indicators in most technical co-operation projects
proposed for the 1997-1998 programme
is an important step toward a systematic evaluation methodology,
and a clear example of how model
projects have already influenced overall project design.  
<P>
Project management was the focus of attention in 1995 as a new
approach for the model projects on
upgrading radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure
was established. A review of the status of
these two model projects indicated that a more effective system
of accountability and responsibility
would be necessary to help Member States achieve the minimum
requirements of the Agency's Basic
Safety Standards by the end of the century. Two new management
elements were singled out as being
essential to making the new system function effectively: a
clearly identifiable focal point for the entire
effort and a firm commitment to time limited objectives.  
<P>
The year provided an opportunity to institute a major change in
programming that will ensure that the
Agency's technical co-operation activities are linked directly to
a countrys sectoral or national
development objectives. Twenty-seven Country Programme Frameworks
(CPFs) were initiated. The
strategic importance of the CPF is that it forms an agreement
between the Agency and governments to
concentrate technical co-operation activities on a few priority
areas that can produce significant national
impacts. The CPF mechanism focuses on identifying key activities
or the opportunities for model
projects that would form the centrepiece for national efforts to
utilize nuclear technologies.   
<P>
Efforts were increased to systematically plan technical
activities. The concept of thematic or sectoral
planning is being elaborated in radioimmunoassay activities,
which have achieved significant results in
most of the countries evaluated in 1995 owing to well defined
objectives, sound design and effective
integration of components, such as training, experts and
equipment. Work also began on identifying
capabilities in Member States for certain nuclear techniques,
such as nuclear instrumentation. This
effort is tied to both the CPF process and resource mobilization
efforts. The feasibility of a specific
technique, along with the capacity of a particular country to use
the technology, are important
benchmarks for planning technical co-operation activities with
Member States.  
<P>
An important development during the year was the effort to
develop regional approaches that apply
model project criteria and objectives. This task was aided by the
results of an external report on
possible future directions for regional programming which was
released in December 1995. Several
proposals emphasizing 'bottom up' solutions and technical
co-operation among developing countries for
animal disease and insect and pest control, animal production and
isotope hydrology are being
reviewed and assessed against model project criteria for the
1997-1998 technical co-operation
programme. One project in rinderpest eradication would
consolidate the various national and regional
initiatives under a single global project to improve
co-ordination and effectiveness.   
<P>
In connection with the issue of predictable and assured financing
for technical co-operation activities,
and as a result of concern over the lack of growth of resources
available to finance the increasing
demand for these activities, the Board of Governors encouraged
the Agency to undertake a more
structured approach to the mobilization of additional resources.
It was suggested, in particular, that
non-traditional sources, such as the bilateral development
organizations and multilateral financial
institutions, could be approached. Experience in 1995 with model
projects showed that supplemental
financing can be obtained if projects are of sufficiently high
quality, and if beneficiary countries are also
prepared to take action to gain funding. With these lessons in
mind, closer links were promoted
between the programme and project objectives of the Agency and
those of bilateral development
organizations.  
<P>
Increased emphasis on project completion resulted in over 300
closures, bringing the total for the last
two years to almost 600 projects  - a significant reduction in
routine work for project and technical
officers. Communications and the flow of information were also
enhanced by access to the Internet
service.   
<P>
Operationally, new records were established in 1995 for financial
implementation and performance. For
the second year, the amount of unobligated resources carried
forward between years was significantly
reduced  - by some 35% -  as a result of a high implementation
rate of 75%. The policy of maintaining
a higher level of programme commitments than of resources ('over-
programming') was largely
responsible for the overall increase in implementation, but the
higher rate for model projects (84.3%)
reflects the greater 'implementability' of projects that are more
realistically planned and budgeted, as well
as the impact of strengthened project management and procedural
streamlining. In every area of
project implementation, delivery was higher than in previous
years.

<I>Public Information</I>
<P>
Public information efforts in 1995 were marked by an initiative
on the role of Agency safeguards in the
context of the NPT Review and Extension Conference. A new film
entitled <I>International
Safeguards</I> was produced (in addition to printed material) and
shown at the Conference in New
York. Other film related projects included a lead role in
producing a film for visitors to the Vienna
International Centre, the shooting of sequences for a new Agency
corporate video and market research
on the feasibility of providing short video features on Agency
related topics to television outlets.  
<P>
The Agency embarked on a major new initiative to meet electronic
information needs through the
Internet, where a range of user friendly services were developed
and offered on the Agency's <I>World
Atom</I> Web site.   
<P>
The series of Public Information Seminars continued, with events
in Brazil, Cuba, Japan, South Africa
and Viet Nam.  
<P>
<I>International Nuclear Information System</I>
<P>
Armenia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Tunisia and Uzbekistan
joined the International Nuclear
Information System (INIS) during 1995. The number of
participating Member States thereby rose to 94
(together with 17 international organizations). A total of 79 021
records of published literature were
added to the database and announced in the abstracting journal
<I>Atomindex</I>, bringing the total
number of records stored to 1 856 206. A new version of the FIBRE
software was put into use for the
preparation of input for the database.   
<P>
The INIS Clearinghouse microfilmed the full text of 4455
non-conventional literature documents (such
as reports, conference proceedings, dissertations and laws)
containing 15 652 cited references (367
575 pages). By the end of 1995, the collection of
non-conventional literature on microfiche was
approximately 305 000 documents.  
<P>
The Clearinghouse also completed a pilot imaging project to
demonstrate the feasibility of electronic
storage of non-conventional literature on CD-ROM. During the
study, the Clearinghouse produced six
CD-ROMs containing 51 416 pages of non-conventional literature
and related bibliographic data, and
retrieval software.   
<P>
The 23rd Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers was held
in Vienna in May. The officers made
recommendations on: partnerships with primary and secondary
publishers designed to obtain
bibliographic records more cost effectively; the phasing out of
the printed <I>Atomindex</I>; delivery of
the full text of non-conventional literature in electronic form;
improvements in the timeliness of the
database; and the production of the INIS database on CD-ROM.  
<P>
In May, INIS celebrated its 25th anniversary, recalling the key
role that it has played in providing access
to nuclear information to support activities worldwide.

<I>Library</I>
<P>
Work at the Vienna International Centre Library on the second
phase of installation of <I>VICLION</I>,
the integrated library automation system, was completed with the
installation and startup of the
acquisitions and serials control modules. This concluded the
process, begun three years ago, of moving
the Library's files from the mainframe system to a distributed,
networked system.  
<P>
<I>Data Processing</I>
<P>
In 1995, central computer services completed a four year effort
to implement a standard technology
architecture to support the Agency's decentralized computer
environment. Over 1400 PCs have been
converted since 1991 to a standard Agency-wide hardware and
software configuration. The speed
capability of most of the Agency's local area networks (LANs) was
upgraded from 4 to 16 Mbits per
second and a new, advanced technology operating system,
<I>Windows NT</I>, was installed on most
of the LAN server computers to provide improved services and more
powerful capabilities.  
<P>
The Agency's initial Internet information service technology was
expanded and a more secure
computing environment for the Agency's services was provided.
Standards and guidelines for World
Wide Web developers were released and a sample database for
official records of the Board of
Governors was created.  
<P>
A six month pilot project was carried out with the purpose of
evaluating the technical, economic and
organizational aspects of enhanced electronic communication of
information and documentation
between the Agency and Member States.  
<P>
CD-ROM production systems and services were initiated in support
of the Advanced Incident Reporting
System (AIRS) and the activities of the United Nations Security
Council 687 Action Team for Iraq.  <P>
<I>Publishing and Printing</I>
<P>
Over 170 books, reports, journal issues or booklets were
published in English during 1995. In addition,
there were 11 publications in French, 8 in Russian and 6 in
Spanish. Of particular note were:  
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-  <I>International Basic Safety Standards for Protection
against Ionizing Radiation and for the
Safety of Radiation Sources</I>
<P>
<DD>-  <I>Nuclear Techniques in Soil-Plant Studies for
Sustainable Agriculture and Environmental
Preservation</I>
<P>
<DD>-  <I>Energy from Inertial Fusion</I>
<P>
<DD>-  <I>The IAEA Yearbook 1995</I>
</DL>
<P>
During the year, facilities for direct electronic transfer of
material to digital printing were established and
put into operation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>F</FONT>or 1995, the General Conference
appropriated an amount of about
$212 million for the Agency's Regular Budget on the basis of an
exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian
Schillings to one United States dollar, of which $206 million was
related to Agency programmes.
The latter amount was adjusted to $251 million to account for the
average United Nations exchange
rate (10.03 Austrian Schillings to one US dollar) actually
experienced during the year.  
<P>
The Regular Budget for 1995, at an exchange rate of 10.03
Austrian Schillings to one US dollar,
amounted to some $258.5 million, of which $248 million was to be
financed from contributions by
Member States on the basis of the 1995 scale of assessment, $7.5
million from income from
reimbursable work for others and $3 million from other
miscellaneous income.  
<P>
The actual expenditures for the Agency's Regular Budget in 1995
amounted to some $253 million,
of which $245 million was related to the Agency's programmes. The
unused budget from the
Agency's programmes amounted to $5.8 million, while the total
unused budget was $5.3 million
when account was taken of reimbursable work for others.
Expenditures for programme activities
deferred from 1994 amounted to some $10 million from a total of
$13 million related to the Agency's
Regular Budget.  
<P>
The target for voluntary contributions to the Technical
Co-operation Fund for 1995 was established
at $61.5 million, of which $47.7 million was pledged by Member
States.   
<P>
A total of about $57.9 million in extrabudgetary funds was
provided by Member States, the United
Nations, other international organizations and other sources
during 1995. Of this amount, $14
million was in support of safeguards, $9.1 million was for
technical co-operation projects, $2.6
million for projects in food and agriculture, $3.8 million for
nuclear safety and $5.6 million for
implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687
on Iraq. An amount of some
$17.2 million (supplemented by the Agency's contribution of $1.7
million) was available for the ICTP,
and $1.5 million (supplemented by the Agency's contribution of
$3.3 million) for IAEA-MEL. The
remaining $4.1 million was in support of various other projects
implemented by the Agency.  
<P>
The sum of $0.75 million was provided in 1995 by Member States
for technical co-operation
activities as funds-in-trust. Furthermore, a total of $1.2
million was administered on behalf of
research institutions and $2.4 million for the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER).  
<A NAME="note_1"><P>
<I>Staffing</I>
<P></A>
At the end of 1995, the number of staff members in the
Secretariat was 2295 - 890 in the
Professional and higher categories and 1405 in the General
Service category. These figures
represent 1673 regular, 214 temporary assistance and 308
extrabudgetary staff, as well as 76 cost
free experts and 24 consultants. Among the 629 staff members in
posts subject to geographical
distribution, 90 nationalities were represented.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>osnia and Herzegovina became a member of the Agency by
depositing
an instrument of acceptance of the Agency's Statute.  The application of Georgia for
membership
was approved by the General Conference, but the instrument of acceptance has not yet
been
deposited with the Government of the USA in accordance with the Agency's Statute. 
The
application of Moldova was recommended by the Board of Governors and will be
submitted to the
General Conference in 1996.
<P>
A new scheduling of Board meetings was approved in February 1994.  This schedule,
and a
redistribution of agenda items between the different session so that specific session
would focus on
particular issues, were successfully put into operation in 1995.
<P>
There were some positive developments in the discussions in both the Board of
Governors and the
General Conference on the revision of Article VI of the Agency's Statute as a whole. 
After many
years a formal proposal was submitted for the consideration of the Board and the
General
Conference and, although it was not approved, it helped to focus the debate.  At the
request of the
General Conference, the Board re-established a successor informal open-ended
consultative group
on the issue and this is expected to submit recommendations to the General
Conference in 1996.
<P>
Also, following an extensive debate, a decision was taken to set up an informal
open-ended
consultative group to consider the criteria for designating members to the Board of
Governors.
<P>
The General Conference requested the Director General to study all of the implications
of a
proposal  which was before it at its 39th session relating to the classification of
Member States into
the eight area groups specified in the Statute.  The Director General was requested to
submit a
report on this matter for the consideration of the Board of Governors, which will
subsequently report
to the General Conference.
<P>
The long standing issues of the financing of technical assistance and of safeguards
were
considered in detail.  Two separate working groups established by the Board at the
request of the
1994 General Conference decided, in view of the interdependent nature of the tasks,
to formulate a
compromise.  Subsequently, a package merging the two issues was adopted by the
Board and later
by the General Conference.  Since the compromise did not resolve all related issues, it
was agree
that a further review of the financing of safeguards would be undertaken before the
year 2000,
while other unresolved issues regarding the financing of technical assistance may be
discussed in
the Board in the near future.
