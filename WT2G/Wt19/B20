</P>
<P>Americans want a clean, healthy environment. They also want  a strong
economy. But environmental protection is enormously  expensive, costs jobs, and
stifles economic opportunity. On the  other hand, before government stepped in,
robust economic activity  such as manufacturing led to a deteriorating and
unhealthy  environment. The challenge is how to achieve both a strong economy 
and a healthy environment. After all, what Americans actually want  is a high
overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Three decades ago, as people perceived that their quality of  life was
beginning to deteriorate, they began to support  aggressive policies to reduce
pollution. These policies frequently failed to  live up to their sponsors'
claims; they also became increasingly  and unnecessarily expensive. But the
environment did improve,  especially in the early years. Now, however, Americans
are  becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that,  even
when they work, they result only in small improvements at a  heavy cost in jobs
and freedom. Americans also are beginning to  recognize that there often is no
sound scientific basis for assertions  of environmental harm or risk to the
public. The pendulum  finally has begun to swing the other way. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives, like Americans generally, have no wish to return  to the days
of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks. But they  do believe common sense
can be brought to bear in dealing with  the environment: that it is possible to
protect the environment  without sacrificing the freedoms for which America
stands.  Conservative candidates and legislators therefore should stress the 
following themes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Examples of regulatory abuse.</B> It is important to show
that  &quot;good intentions&quot; often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless
 regulations.
</P>

<P><B>An ethic of conservation.</B> Candidates need to explain that 
conserving  or efficiently using  natural resources is not in dispute.  The
debate is over how best to do this: through markets or  through government
controls.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Economic freedom.</B> Candidates need to point out that many  government
&quot;solutions&quot; to environmental problems conflict with  basic economic
freedoms.

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  equally means fewer lives are

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While pollution levels have fallen dramatically since 1970,  most reductions
were achieved early and at relatively low cost.  From 1970 to 1990, total
emission levels fell 33.8 percent. Over  the same period, lead levels in the air
fell 96.5 percent, and  carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 40.7 percent. But
reductions  have slowed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As recently as 1985, the annual cost of environmental  protection was $82
billion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $171  billion, while
environmental gains have slowed to a trickle. The  estimated $171 billion spent
in 1995 represents about 3 percent  of America's gross domestic product (GDP).
Put another way,  these poorly crafted environmental regulations cost each 
American household almost $1,800 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The pattern is consistent: What economists call the marginal  rate of return
on investment falls dramatically as government runs  out of easy fixes and then
attempts to eke out minuscule  improvements in the environment at skyrocketing
extra cost. The resulting  drain on the economy is both enormous and
unnecessary.

<P>Environmental regulation does more than just cost too much.  Candidates also
should use the growing litany of horror stories to  demonstrate how
ill-conceived environmental regulations, while  deliv

unintended consequences for  businesses  especially small businesses, which are
disproportionately  minority-owned and minority-run.

<P>
</P>
<P>Regulatory abuses like these usually are a direct result of the  way
government bureaucracies attack environmental problems.  Typically, these
agencies regulate without regard to the cost  imposed on individuals and
businesses. Yet it makes no sense to issue  a regulation for which the burden
far outweighs any benefit  that might be conferred. In fact, it often is unclear
whether there will  be any benefit at all because the science on which many 
regulations are based is so poor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also, instead of setting realistic performance standards and  giving
businesses the freedom to develop innovative ways of  meeting them, agencies
typically rely on inflexible  command-and-control regulations that, for example,
specify what technologies  companies must use. Since businesses differ in their
operating  structures, this one-size-fits-all approach rarely leads to
cost-effective  solutions compared to more flexible and dependable performance 
standards. Moreover, by eliminating the incentive for companies  to seek out
these cost-effective solutions, it stifles innovative  technologies or
techniques that reduce costs. In the end, of course,  the consumer is the one
who pays.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of current  environmental policy is the
fact that bureaucrats and liberal lawmakers  generally consider regulation the
only option. Creative solutions shown to  be less expensive, more effective, and
more respectful of human  liberty are rejected out of hand. Instead of setting
up a system of  incentives to lure businesses into operating with environmental 
impact in mind, the system relies on punishment regardless  of whether this
accomplishes the desired goal or creates  unintended consequences. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rejecting Property Rights</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulations have become increasingly unfair. The  Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior (DOI),  Army Corps of Engineers, and
other federal agencies operate on  the premise that property should be used to
satisfy government's  needs and objectives without regard to who owns the
property or the  financial burden imposed on them. It is this mentality that 
leads government reflexively to reject the creative solutions advanced  by
free-market advocates, including incentive-based approaches  to protecting
endangered species. By ignoring property rights,  establishment
environmentalists, bureaucrats, and liberal legislators  also ignore the
benefits to be derived from free trade and free markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most unfair and burdensome hardship inflicted by  government &quot;regulatory
takings&quot; is that property owners are not  compensated for their losses. For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife  spend a large portion of their
retirement savings to buy land on which  to build their dream home and that land
subsequently is designated  a wetland, they lose the value of their property as
well as their  savings. They are stuck with property they cannot use and the 
government does nothing to reimburse them for their loss.  Unfortunately, tales
of financial hardship caused by government designation  of land as wetland or
endangered-species habitat have become  common. For instance:

industrial value  up to $72,000 annually. As a result, this  fifth-generation
farm family may lose its life savings. The government,  however, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  appears unmoved. Stamp relates
what one Army Corps of  Engineers enforcement officer told him: &quot;We know
that this is  rape, pillage, and plunder of your farm, but this is our  job.&quot;

the Army  Corps of Engineers that one-third of its land, on which it planned to 
build a parking lot, was a wetland and could not be used. Part of this 
so-called wetland is a bone-dry hillside which almost never  collects water.
Says Reverend Murray Southwell of the Freewill  Baptists, &quot;this obvious
misinterpretation of wetland law made it  necessary for us to purchase an
additional lot [for $45,000, which] has been  a heavy financial burden on this

he might disturb: $93,950 per snake. Says Oates, in an  age of &quot;depleted

tough pill to  swallow.&quot;

<P>Hundreds of such stories have surfaced over the past few  years, and many
analysts suspect that far more are never made  public. According to Bob Adams,
Project Director for Environmental  and Regulatory Affairs at the National
Center for Public Policy  Research, &quot;the stories we have compiled are just
the tip of the  iceberg, but many people are simply too scared to come forward 
or feel powerless against the government.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ironically, federal agencies and the Clinton Administration  argue that it
would cost too much money to compensate  landowners. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  Leon Panetta, then Director of the
Office of Management  and Budget, told the House Committee on Public Works  and
Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the  Environment on May 26,
1994, that paying compensation for  wetlands regulation would be &quot;an
unnecessary and unwise use of  taxpayer dollars&quot; and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Property owners counter that regulatory takings are a drain on  the family
budget. Nancie Marzulla, President of Defenders of  Property Rights, points out
that &quot;what people don't realize is that  these landowners typically are not
wealthy and powerful  corporations, but normal Americans  schoolteachers and
elderly couples   whose lives are destroyed by stretched interpretations of a 
single environmental law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#8">8</A></B></TT>
 Moreover, the federal government  already owns about one out of every three
acres in the country (with  even more owned by state and local governments).
<A HREF="ftnt4.htm#9">9</A>  If the federal  government can
afford to maintain one-third of the nation's land,  it should be able to pay
landowners for regulatory confiscation  of their property. If not, maybe it
should consider selling the  least ecologically sensitive land from its vast
holdings to pay for  the land it wants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lost Opportunities, Lost Lives</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ask the average American how much a human life is worth,  and the answer
likely will be that &quot;no amount is too much.&quot;  This  is how Congress
and federal agencies justify imposing  sometimes staggering costs on businesses
to reduce the risks of death by  infinitesimal amounts. What policymakers fail
to understand is  that wasting resources in this way means not being able to use
them  in other ways that might well produce better results and save  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  more lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If lawmakers ever did consider which environmental policies  actually save
the most lives, they would scrap many existing  rules, freeing up resources to
be used in other ways. This  commonsense approach would lead to regulation that
is very different, in  its scope and fundamental assumptions, from that which 
burdens America today. In fact, as the following charts illustrate, if  the
private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to  be left with the
industries or individuals concerned, or used in  other ways in the local
economy, in many cases Americans would  benefit more, and far more lives would
be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ill-conceived environmental regulations designed to  &quot;protect&quot;
people may even cause deaths. The best example is the set of  Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to  conserve energy and encourage lower
oil prices. The only way  auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building
lighter  cars. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, however, lighter cars 
are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. The result: more  highway
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham  of the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis have found that 2,500  highway deaths should be
expected as a result of CAFE's impact  on the weight of cars made in the 1989
model year  alone. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#10">10</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some environmental regulations may cause deaths indirectly.  Statistical
analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs  the government imposes
on the economy, lower overall living  standards cause one additional statistical
 death. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>  When
this formula 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  is used to compare the number of
lives &quot;saved&quot; by a  particular environmental regulation with the
number lost through lower  living standards, it becomes obvious that many
regulations  actually increase the death toll. For example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Spending $178 million</B> may avert one death under the

</P>
<P><B>What America Thinks About the Environment</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When asked by the media, pollsters, or politicians, Americans  routinely
answer that they want a clean and healthy environment.  Indeed, the majority of
Americans consider themselves  &quot;environmentalists.&quot;  This does not
translate, however, into automatic  acceptance of the environmental lobby's
agenda. Conservative  candidates need to make this clear to discourage voters
from  supporting policies they do not believe in simply because they are 
portrayed as &quot;pro-environment.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dichotomy in public opinion shows up in polling data.  When respondents
are asked general or theoretical questions that  involve little personal
sacrifice, or that do not identify those  burdened, government intervention
fares well. In one poll, for instance,  60 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  percent of respondents agreed
that we must protect the  environment even if it costs jobs in the  community.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#13">13</A></B></TT>  In another,
72 percent of respondents said they would pay somewhat higher taxes  if the
money was used to protect the environment and prevent  water and air pollution.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#14">14</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, when respondents are asked questions that  are more
specific, that involve greater sacrifice, or that identify  the people losing
jobs, government intervention is less popular.  When respondents are asked to
pay much higher taxes to protect the  environment, support drops by almost half.
By the same token,  only one-third would be willing to accept cuts in their
standard of  living. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>
 When asked to pick between spotted owls and  Northwest workers who stand to
lose their jobs because of efforts to  protect the owls, respondents choose jobs
by a margin of 3 to  2. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#16">16</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More Americans than not believe that environmental  organizations are too
extreme  a perception that is partially responsible for  recent significant
declines in membership among these groups.  Perhaps the most consistent finding
is that Americans think EPA  is doing a poor job: More than two-thirds think the
country gets  poor value for its investment in environmental  protection. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most refreshing change in attitudes in recent years  is the
recognition that the country can have economic growth  and environmental
protection simultaneously. Vice President Al  Gore has made the point that
economic growth and environmental  protection are not incompatible. This is
true, but only if  America's environmental laws are structured correctly to
encourage  responsible behavior as part of the business decision-making 
process. Gore advocates stringent command-and-control regulations  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  are inconsistent with growth and
lead to little real gains in  environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Whenever this question comes up, Americans must be told  that the way to
promote both environmental protection and  economic growth is to allow them to
work hand in hand. The  government must stop regarding them as mutually
exclusive and stop  pitting economic freedom against the environment. Laws must
be  based on, and work with, a free market. Only then can Americans  maximize
their economic and environmental quality of life.
</P>
<P>The Need for Common Sense 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given Americans' ambivalence on the question of  environmental protection,
it is all the more important for conservatives to  approach the issue in a
commonsense way. People must  understand that environmental protection need not
come at the expense  of jobs, but will cost jobs if the socialist model of
centralized  control for protecting the environment is not set aside. It doesn't
 work. Rather, the country should adopt a reasonable, commonsense  approach to
environmental protection that is based on:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Freedom with Responsibility.</B> Conservatives
traditionally  have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of 
environmental problems. Thus, they have fought  environmentalists step by step
and have lost step by step. The reason, while  unpleasant, is not complicated.
Environmentalists have had the moral  high ground, even though they typically
have not provided the  most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have
been on  the wrong side of an emotional issue. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<P>Two lessons demonstrate why. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> leftists and the public at large understand that
 publicly owned goods, free of constraints on usage, will be depleted  over
time. Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at  the University of
California, in his seminal 1968 work 
<I>The Tragedy of the Commons</I> showed that when a good is publicly owned, 
or &quot;owned&quot; in common, no one has an incentive to conserve or  to
manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the  good inefficiently
 to deplete it. This fact is at the heart of most  environmental problems, such
as air and water pollution and  species extinction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people  will
conserve out of self-interest. People with a vested interest in  providing
environmental benefits  through property ownership  or other positive incentives
 will provide them voluntarily,  without coercion.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>When it came to certain resources like air and water,  conservatives tended
to ignore the first lesson, and consequently lost the  opportunity to implement
the second. In this one area, conservatives  have been inconsistent with the
principles that define their  movement: that decisions should be left to
individuals who are accountable  for their actions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Freedom with responsibility for one's actions&quot; should be the 
conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful  behavior. Ironically,
the old environmentalist slogan &quot;Make the  polluter pay&quot; is consistent
with this message. But when they say this,  conservatives and liberals mean
different things. As Al Cobb,  then Director of Environment and Energy at the
National Policy  Forum, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  has said, &quot;What the
environmental lobby means by that phrase  is that corporate polluters should be
punished severely for any  pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean,
however, is that  polluters should bear the full cost of environmental
degradation,  but no more.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#19">19</A></B></TT>  At the same time,
individuals and corporations  also should be rewarded for conservation and other
 environmentally sound practices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Conservation Through Property Rights.</B> The free
market  reflects the conservation ethic better than any command-and-control 
regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however,  only when private
citizens engage in trade, and people can trade  only what they own: some form of
property. Thus, property is the  cornerstone of a free market. If property

Some  critics misleadingly call this &quot;market failure,&quot; but it is
really a failure  to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a 
result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. A  resource
that is not owned will deteriorate or be depleted  because neither protection of

process. Others, however,  are still forced to bear the consequences.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In the decade from 1979-1989, East
and Central African  elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million
to less  than half that. Yet, in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased 
dramatically. The difference is that hunting in Zimbabwe is  permitted as a
property right. Small villages that own the land on which  elephants live and
graze charge safari operators to conduct  hunts. Since the villages profit
directly, they have an incentive to  promote herd growth to increase their
income. In surrounding  African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to
curb  incessant poaching; in Zimbabwe, however, villagers are constantly on  the
lookout for poachers because poaching means lost income.  Zimbabwe and a few
other countries reward the conservation of  elephants by allowing the
conservationists themselves to profit  from their protective behavior. In each
country that has adopted  this approach, herd sizes are increasing.

wants  to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, the  owner
conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and  prevents pollution
from entering his stretch of the river. If a  municipality pollutes the water
upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can  sue

<P>Instead of merely responding to tabloid claims or politically  motivated
studies by federal agencies and environmental  organizations trying to justify
their budgets, regulations should be based on  credible scientific findings open
to public scrutiny. For instance,  agencies should use consistent methodologies
to determine risks.  Currently, they use different methods. Thus, for example,
risk  assessments by different agencies may turn up different answers as  to
whether a chemical at a particular dose level causes cancer.  Theoretically,
exposure to some level of a chemical could be found  to be both deadly and
perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government assessments also should reveal the assumptions  and uncertainties
in their analyses. Typically, because of missing  data, most studies use certain
assumptions to estimate these  uncertainties. These assumptions, sometimes
unreasonably gloomy,  usually determine the conclusion reached. For instance,
sometimes an  estimate of the likely risk from some chemical is multiplied 
thousands, or even millions, of times just to be &quot;conservative.&quot;  Yet 
the analyses used to justify these enormously expensive  regulations often are
obscure as to their assumptions. Moreover, the  reports 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  rarely reveal the level of
uncertainty involved in arriving at  their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Whenever regulations that address risks are considered,  each agency should
be required to conduct risk assessments  if only  to aid in intelligent
decision-making  that are consistent, that  are transparent to public scrutiny,
and that fully detail their  assumptions and levels of uncertainty. Moreover,
each study should  be reviewed before a regulation is pub-lished to ensure that 
scientific guidelines are strictly followed. If federal agencies cannot  meet
even this very limited standard, it is unconscionable for them  to impose costly
standards on others.

disease. Misguided and excessive  regulation can cost lives, so it is critical
that regulators recognize the costs  of their actions. Spending enormous amounts

<P>This is why it is essential that policymakers develop a priority  list of
environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible  risk each appears

 Certainly the country and planet have environmental  problems that need to be

the planet more than otherwise would be the case,  and that this change could

land, its value disappears. We've got  to turn it around to make the landowner

 Landowners that find, say, a listed plant on  their property sometimes pull the
plant rather than lose their life  savings. Even when landowners take no hostile
move against  species, few have any incentive to provide what endangered species
 need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  most: habitat. As Larry McKinney,
Director of Resource  Protection for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
says, &quot;While  I have no hard evidence to prove it, I am convinced that more
 habitat for the black-capped vireo, and especially the  gold-cheeked warbler,
has been lost in those areas of Texas since the listing  of these birds than
would have been lost without the ESA at  all.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#39">39</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the harmful effects from confiscatory  regulations,
encouraging the willing cooperation of landowners has led to  some striking
successes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps the most notable success story was the recovery of  the wood
duck which was rapidly headed for extinction early in  the century due to a loss
of nesting habitat and over-hunting.  Friends of the wood duck, in the best
tradition of voluntary association  and private conservation, spent the rest of
the century asking  the nation's private landowners to allow them to erect
artificial  nest boxes for the birds,&quot; says R.J. Smith, Senior 
Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. &quot;Most 
landowners were more than willing to help. There was no downside. If  the ducks
utilized the nest boxes, the landowners would not be  prevented from using their
lands. If we had had an ESA in 1920,  the wood duck would likely be extinct
today  instead of the  second most common duck in the eastern flyway. Similar
efforts  have worked for... bluebirds, screech owls, barn owl kestrels  (sparrow
hawks), purple martins, and even prothonotary warblers [as  well as] wild
turkeys, ruffed grouse, prairie chickens, and many  species of quail.&quot;

<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous controversies surround ESA, such as whether it is  appropriate or
worthwhile to protect endangered sub-species that  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  almost identical genetically to
other non-endangered  sub-species. But these are side issues. As currently
enforced, ESA forces  landowners  without compensation  to surrender many of 
their property rights if listed species are found. If the incentive  problem
that pits landowners against species instead of aligning their  interests was
eliminated, the threat to species would likely become  a thing of the past. But
this would occur only if the fear of  punishment for having habitat was replaced
with the promise of  reward for providing habitat. Issues such as which species
need the  most protection could be debated dispassionately with a view to 
getting the maximum return for public funds spent to preserve these  species.
Since federal wildlife managers would be forced to  implement the most efficient
and beneficial uses of those funds,  species most needing protection would be
the most likely to benefit.

<P><B>Wetlands</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been  disappearing at
a rapid rate during this century, primarily  because they are unique ecosystems.
They are valued by many  Americans for the very practical reason that they can
act as a buffer  against flooding and can purify streams and rivers. Others
despise  wetlands as &quot;mosquito-infested swamps,&quot; and they typically 
are breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. While  most Americans
historically have fallen into the latter group,  increased public recognition of
the positive qualities of some wetlands  in recent decades has led to demands
for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the confusing and onerous nature of wetland  policy has made
wetland protection a politically contentious issue.  In practice, the Clean
Water Act has been used as the legislative  ve
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  hicle to restrict any disturbance
of wetlands even though  wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation. The EPA
and Army Corps  of Engineers rely on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to 
regulate landowners that wish to disturb wetland on their  property. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#41">41</A></B></TT>  There are four principal
problems with current wetland policies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> the statutory authority itself is questionable.
Indeed, for  isolated wetland, known as &quot;non-adjacent&quot; wetland,
federal  authority seems clearly lacking. Obviously, federal agencies should not
 pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor any statute  allows them to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the definition of what constitutes a wetland is 
unnecessarily broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual now in  force, a
wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  It must be
inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least 7  consecutive days and 5
percent of the growing season, and more  than 50 percent of the dominant plant
species found are found  in marshes and swamps regardless of whether they are
found  elsewhere as well. This language is so unnecessarily inclusive  that land
which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed  a wetland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the nation already has achieved the Bush-Clinton  wetland
goal of &quot;no net loss&quot; in a given year. In recent years, the nation 
has been increasing its wetland stock. In 1994, the likely net gain  was more
than 100,000 acres; the expected loss rate was 102,000  acres, while the
expected &quot;creation&quot; rate due to federal programs  was 195,000 acres.
Additionally, wetland restoration is taking place  on public land and through
strictly private initiatives. In 1994,  for example, Ducks Unlimited alone
restored or enhanced  51,260 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  acres.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the financial resources of many Americans are being 
destroyed as owners are forced to surrender, without  compensation, their right
to use their property. Because many affected  individuals make their living or
pay their mortgages from income  derived from the land, their savings can be
wiped out.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, this legislation has led to often absurd results. Based  on
questionable legal authority, federal agencies can force  landowners to
sacrifice their life's savings to protect land with little  ecological value

</P>
<P>One of the onerous aspects of pesticide regulation is Section  409 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, known as  the Delaney Clause, enacted in
1958 to ban any additive in  pro-cessed food that has been shown to cause cancer
in humans or  laboratory animals. The Delaney Clause seemed reasonable at the
time  because scientists could test for traces of chemicals only in  quantities
of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements  in technology,
they can test for many of these chemicals in  quantities of less than one in a
quadrillion (a billion million). Some  chemicals can be detected almost down to
the level of a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This means that extremely small trace quantities that were  undetectable 37
years ago  and thus allowable  now form the  basis for a court order requiring
EPA to eliminate dozens of  pesticides. Many of these same pesticides are
completely safe up to  certain levels, according to EPA's own findings, but the
law requires  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  they be banned. Under Section 408
of the same Act, which  relates to raw foods, EPA has issued regulations setting
the tolerance  level deemed safe for consumption. Thus, under Section 409   the
Delaney Clause  EPA will ban pesticide residues in  processed foods that it
allows and proclaims safe in raw foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change  in the law: &quot;We
have gotten to a point where we have to say  we know a lot more about these
chemicals than we did 35 years  ago when the law was passed.&quot;  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#42">42</A></B></TT>  Unfortunately, the 
environmental lobby applied severe pressure on the Clinton Administration,  and
Browner backpedaled from her position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue is not simply cutting costs. Pesticides are responsible  for an
explosion of food production in this country and around  the world while the
land use has remained relatively constant. As  the <a href="envir_4.gif">chart</a> below shows, if
pesticides were eliminated, the amount  of land used for agriculture to produce
the same amount of  food would triple. Moreover, pesticides are directly related
to  lower world food prices. This increases food consumption, including  the
consumption of fruits and vegetables, which in turn lowers  cancer rates. In the
words of Bruce Ames, Professor of Biochemistry  and Molecular Biology at the
University of California at Berkeley  and perhaps the world's foremost expert on
cancer risk, the best  known way to prevent cancer is to &quot;eat your 
veggies.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#43">43</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the fact that some chemical pesticides test positive  for cancer
when huge doses are fed to test animals is not  necessarily cause for alarm.
After all, says Ames, of the 22 chemicals found  in coffee that have been tested
in animal cancer tests, &quot;17 are  carcinogens. There are 10 milligrams of
known carcinogens in a  cup 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  of coffee and that's more
carcinogens than you're likely to  get from pesticide residues in a year....
We're eating natural  pesticides, which are chemicals that plants use to try to
kill off insects that  try to eat them. And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of
them per  day. We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues. So  we're
talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides,  and yet the same
percentage [roughly half] of natural chemicals  come out positive&quot; when
tested for cancer. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#44">44</A></B></TT>

<P><B>Superfund </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act
(CERCLA), the program for cleaning up  hazardous waste sites, is up for
reauthorization. Superfund, as CERCLA  is known, not only is one of the most
complex laws now in force,  but also is widely regarded as the most wasteful and
ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not  work.
Despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30  billion, Superfund has
cleaned up only a small fraction of the  nation's worst hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund was enacted after widespread press attention to the  exposure of
residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals at  Love Canal near Niagara
Falls, New York. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately, the  law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the
Carter  Administration, so many provisions are ill-considered. Much of  the
money has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal fees and  other &quot;transaction
costs,&quot; and while program costs have  ballooned, cleanups have proceeded
slowly. Only 291, or 24 percent, of  the 1,238 &quot;worst&quot; hazardous waste
sites  sites placed on the  National Priorities List (NPL)  have been cleaned
up. To clean up the  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  maining sites now on the NPL will
cost an estimated $40  billion. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#46">46</A></B></TT>  If the cost of cleaning
up federal facilities is added to the  equation, the total could exceed $750
billion, or $7,800 per U.S.  household. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four basic flaws in the Superfund program:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The law as written is designed to reduce the level of 
chemicals in the ground, not to reduce risks to people.</B> Yet fully one-third 
of the sites pose only hypothetical future risks based primarily on  the
assumption that residential housing will be built, thus  exposing future
residents to these chemicals. It is utterly unrealistic to  assume any
residential housing will be built on any  untreated Superfund site; no developer
would attempt it, or get permits if  he did.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The program's unreasonable standards require that  hazardous waste
sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what  the location, resulting
in a poor return on the investment.</B> For  instance, polluted soil at
industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a  level that makes it essentially
clean enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems,  but
listings, cleanup decisions, and program authority are run by a  federal
bureaucracy.</B> If there is any federal environmental law  for which a
legitimate case can be made for devolving authority  back to the states, it is
CERCLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. The law's retroactive, strict joint and several liability  scheme
results in endless legal battles as potentially responsible  parties (PRPs)
fight EPA, then each other, and then their insurers to  shoul
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  der the costs of cleanup.</B> It
is little wonder that the program is  derisively called the &quot;Super
scholarship fund for lawyers' children.&quot;   The liability scheme is designed
to find someone with &quot;deep  pockets&quot; to pay the cost of cleanup
regardless of how much  or  how little  that individual may have contributed to
the waste  problem. This forces individuals and small businesses to pay 
enormous sums for what most people would consider innocent acts, some  of them
committed generations ago.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>All of these characteristics drive up costs while blunting  the program's
effectiveness. Moreover, all have led to numerous  horror stories of people
caught in the Superfund liability web.  For instance:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a
Superfund site at a car  battery cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His
contribution  to the problem?  He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of 
seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the  items. Since the
checks had been issued by the now-bankrupt  company that had owned the battery
cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as  a PRP by another company caught in the
Superfund liability  scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he
should settle  to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed to pay $3,500  even
though he had nothing to do with the matter.  <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The entire town of Triumph, Idaho, located just
a few miles  away from the famous ski resort town of Sun Valley, has suffered 
terribly under EPA's administration of the Superfund law. The  town, which had a
silver mine until 1957, has plenty of lead in  the ground. So the EPA put the
mine on the Superfund list, with  the highest &quot;worst&quot; Superfund score
ever  almost half again as  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  as the nuclear production site at
Hanford, Washington. As a  result, banks red-lined the town, and homeowners
cannot sell their  homes because banks refuse to lend on them. EPA officials
summoned  an emergency meeting at which they told the 50 families their 
children might have extremely high levels of lead in their blood.  EPA conducted
tests for lead contamination but refused to disclose  the results, so the town
did its own tests. It turns out that lead  poisoning was not a problem because
the well water in Triumph was  not contaminated. In fact, lead levels in
Triumph's water are below  the national average, well within safety limits. Now
the  townspeople are unified against the federal government's treatment of 
their community. In March 1995, a resident, Donna Rose, testified to  a House
Commerce subcommittee that EPA &quot;terrified us. They  committed atrocious
acts on our community.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately for  Triumph, however, the suffering caused under Superfund 
continues. Rose, who like many of her townsfolk believes Triumph was  chosen for
designation as the worst of the worst sites because  EPA needed a trophy as
Superfund came under attack, testified  that &quot;We can't sell our houses.
We're trapped there forever until this  is resolved.&quot; <TT><B><A

<P><B>CAFE Standards </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  were enacted in
response to the oil crisis in 1973 and were designed  to stabilize oil prices at
lower levels. Today, support for the  program comes primarily from the
environmental lobby, which sees  the standards as a way to preserve fuel, and
perhaps to drive up  the cost of autos. The program currently requires that cars
 average 27.5 mpg (miles per gallon) and that light trucks average  20.7 mpg.
Now the Clinton Administration is considering tightening  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  standards. The problem is that
this law costs both lives and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it  bluntly, is that
they kill people. According to economists Robert  Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the  Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model
cars are about 500  pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5
mpg  economy standard. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#51">51</A></B></TT>
 They estimate that this weight reduction is  responsible for 2,500 additional
deaths and 25,000 additional serious  injuries per model fleet year. This is too
high a price to pay for any  government program. Raising the standard would only
increase  the death toll. Raising standards to 40 mpg, for example, would 
likely mean another 4,800 to 8,600 deaths per  year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#52">52</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other problem with CAFE, especially with raising the  standard, is that
it makes little economic sense. A study by  Charles Rivers Associates has found
that increasing standards would  raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and
the average price of  trucks by $2,100. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#53">53</A></B></TT>  This would lead
consumers to retain their older  autos longer, thus minimizing the very
decreases in fuel  consumption regulators hope to see and increasing pollution
by an estimated  4 percent by the year 2010 (assuming a 30 percent increase in 
the mileage standard). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#54">54</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Finally, raising CAFE standards would be devastating to  average families.
The reason the traditional full-size family station  wagon no longer is made is
that car manufacturers found it difficult  to meet the 27.5 mpg standard with
these gas-guzzlers in their  fleets. Thus, the market for even less
fuel-efficient minivans  exploded, since they only had to meet the light truck
standard of less than  21 mpg. If standards for light trucks were raised, then 
manufacturers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  would be forced to raise prices
dramatically to cut sales of  the minivan so their fleet average could remain in
compliance.  Thus, most families no longer could afford the only vehicle
designed  for families.

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

<P>
</P>
<P>Slowly, methodically, and steadily, the Clinton Administration  has been
pushing a consistently liberal environmental agenda.  The most prominent aspect
of this agenda is its high-flown  rhetoric, especially since the advent of the
104th Congress. While much  of this rhetoric has little to do with reality, the
attack has been  quite effective against a Congress that seems to lack  the
Administration's unified sense of purpose. Vice President Al  Gore, EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, and Interior Secretary  Bruce Babbitt all have been
heavily engaged in criticizing the new  Congress, with Gore dismissing
Congress's attempts at  environmental reform as a &quot;jihad.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>The Superfund reform advocated by the Administration in  1994 and 1995, for
example, partially addressed some of the most  egregious aspects of this law,
but created perhaps as many problems  as it solved. Thus, the Administration was
able to claim that it  wanted to eliminate some of the worst aspects of the law,
such as joint  and several liability, while attempting to substitute provisions 
that were not much better, such as the allocation scheme it  devised. Meanwhile,
it insisted on seemingly innocuous provisions  that would have created an
environmental welfare program by  diverting up to 4 percent of Superfund's money
to environmental  activists. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#56">56</A></B></TT>

<P>The Administration's environmental agenda is one of  increased government
control and production mandates. Steered by  Vice President Gore, author of <I>Earth
in the  Balance</I>, the Administration has fought for numerous regulations,
executive orders, and  international agreements that are anti-business,
anti-growth, and  ultimately anti-consumer. One common theme among these 
regulations is the seeming lack of any serious consideration of their  relative
costs and benefits.

so that it would not require  that greenhouse gas production be scaled back to

to reconstrue the language of the treaty to mean exactly that,  and later
proposed costly actions to achieve this end. Even  though most countries will

troublesome  were its recommendations that fuel economy (CAFE) standards  be
raised so that cars would average 45 mpg (and light trucks  34 mpg) by the year
2007 and 75 mpg and 56 mpg by the year  2025. These recommendations, if
implemented, would have  increased the death toll on the road by many thousands
every year, since  cars meeting these standards necessarily would have to be
lighter to  be more fuel efficient, and thus would be less crashworthy. 
Fortunately, the committee was unable to issue a consensus report  because the
auto and oil industries refused to support its  recommendations, which wound up
being presented as the so-called  Majority Report by other members of the

While its plan to stop global  warming stopped short of a carbon tax, for
example, it does include a  Climate Change Action Plan that will impose a $60
billion burden  on the economy  a burden that may well be wholly unnecessary. 
The plan is widely thought to be an inadequate response to the  problem of
greenhouse gas emissions; thus, even if one assumes  global warming to be a real

<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 103rd Congress, which left office in 1994, accomplished  very little
with respect to the environment. The House and Senate  leadership failed either
to reauthorize any of the major  environmental laws up for reauthorization or to
pass any new ones (with the  exception of the California Desert Protection Act).
 Environmental lobbyists worked successfully to block any reauthorization  that
included one or more of three reforms: compensating  property owners for losses
caused by environmental rulings, giving  states relief from unfunded federal
environmental mandates, or  requiring that risk assessments be conducted before
expensive  regulations designed to alleviate some hypothetical risk are put into
place.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Environmentalists so feared passage of these reforms (which  they called the
&quot;unholy trinity&quot;) that they decided it was better to  have no
environmental legislation adopted at all. But conservatives  kept offering the
amendments, which also were supported by  many 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  moderates, so the Democratic
leadership refused to let the  reauthorization bills come up for a vote  even a
bill that would  have raised EPA to Cabinet level as the Department of the 
Environment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the 104th Congress accomplished little more in  the
environmental area during its first session, although it did pass  the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), one part of  the &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;
 While this Act covers regulation generally,  the most burdensome mandates on
local governments typically  have been environmental regulations. For instance,
prior to the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, regulators continued to issue  new
prescriptive regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act  that imposed
enormous costs on local communities by requiring  what some local officials
called gold-plated solutions. After passage  of UMRA, the Senate voted
unanimously for a bill that would  allow smaller communities to develop and use
less costly  alternative standards on condition that they protect the public 
health. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While property-rights and risk-assessment bills have been  debated

on them, and President Clinton has threatened  to veto them if they reach his
desk. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#61">61</A></B></TT> 
Congress also has failed  to reauthorize the major environmental laws. The
reason: Few  reforms of the current laws could avoid a veto by the President, 
and the leadership does not have the votes to override a veto.  Moreover, as of
publication, Members so far have failed to embrace  an environmental vision of
their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As of publication, EPA appropriations for FY 1996 have not  become law.
Congress passed the EPA appropriations bill as part  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  the Veterans Affairs, Housing and
Urban Development, and  Independent Agencies appropriations bill on December 14,
1995,  but President Clinton vetoed the bill four days later. His main 
objection was that EPA's funding level of $5.7 billion was too low,  especially
in the enforcement area. While EPA's funding under  the bill would have been
reduced by 21 percent as a necessary  incident to balancing the budget, it is
unlikely this would interfere  seriously with EPA's mandate. Although no new
major environmental  laws have passed  and only one has been amended since  1989
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#62">62</A></B></TT>  the level of
funding that Clinton vetoed as too deep a cut is almost  10 percent higher than
when President Bush took  office. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#63">63</A></B></TT>  In reality, EPA's growth
has far outstripped growth of both the economy  and the federal government; the
funding of $5.7 billion merely  reflects an attempt to rectify this imbalance.

<P>If the science of climate change were more precise than it is,  and the
evidence more consistent with the dire predictions of  some proponents of the
global-warming theory, it could make sense  for the United States and other
countries to take urgent,  expensive action to deal with the potential threat.
But the science is far  from certain. Rather than rush to &quot;do something&quot;
at huge cost, the  wiser and more mature course would be to try to find out more
 precisely what actually is happening to the Earth's atmosphere. Yet 
environmentalists are trying to redirect funding from research on  climate
change to research on its effects  on the assumption that  global warming
definitely will happen. As noted by Jeffrey Salmon,  Ex
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  ecutive Director of the George C.

landowners and species fostered by the current Act.  If landowners, who are
closest to the species needing protection,  had an incentive to provide habitat
or encourage reproduction on  their property, there is little doubt these
species would flourish. Just  as the country pays auto makers to produce Jeeps
for the Army,  it should pay landowners to produce members of endangered 
species that need protection. Not only would this reform allow the Act  to work

<P><B>Reform Superfund.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be  completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments,  municipalities, and the
private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,  unnecessary, and
expensive burdens of this program. Specifically,  the reformed CERCLA should at
least:

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Turn</B> authority for current NPL sites over to the
states  with  the necessary funding. To qualify for funds, states should be 
required to meet two conditions:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>1.</B> That they prioritize sites and expenditures based on real 
risks, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>2.</B> That they eliminate joint and several liability and end 
retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites  cleaned with
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Allow</B> states to use funds for any of their most
serious  hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred from the federal 
government. These conditions would have to apply, or states would  be tempted
simply to spend the money on sites for which they  were responsible rather than
on those that are most dangerous.

capacity. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#66">66</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted,  Superfund will
continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on  the American economy. But
if proper reforms are instituted,  Congress can achieve its original goal of
protecting Americans from  hazardous wastes at reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Save lives by ending the CAFE program.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only should CAFE standards not be raised further, but the  program
should be eliminated. It costs lives and jobs and  provides only questionable
benefits. Reducing oil consumption may  help lower oil prices and reduce
pollution, but it also costs 2,500  lives. The trade-off simply is not worth it.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't regulatory reform mean rolling back regulations  that protect
our environment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform means introducing common sense  into the
equation when decisions are made about whether, for  instance, a chemical should
be banned or regulated. At its most basic,  regulatory reform means making sure
the government knows what it  is doing before it does it by requiring agencies
to analyze  realistically the risks and compare the costs and benefits of their
actions.  It means making sure the process is open to scrutiny by making  it &quot;transparent&quot;
so that shoddy procedures or wildly unrealistic  assumptions used in risk
analysis, and thus in making decisions,  do not go unchallenged. Also, by
requiring these agencies to  estimate the likely risks  not just the most
extreme conceivable risks   the country can have a better idea of what it is
buying with its  scarce economic resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Currently, federal agencies typically use only worst-case  assumptions
multiplied by other worst-case assumptions. The likely  risk of chemicals, for
example, is multiplied millions of times.  Thus, the risk is artificially
inflated to seem unacceptable. By that  mathematical logic, leaving your house
in the suburbs to pick up a  carton of milk from a convenience store would be
deemed an  unjustifiable risk because of your chance of dying from a falling 
airplane. Without accurate risk assessments, federal agencies such as  EPA
promulgate costly regulations which yield few or no benefits,  and many of which
probably would not be seen as desirable if  the agency were adequately
self-informed about the likely risks  and benefits of its actions.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the federal government compensate property  owners for the
loss of property rights? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are plenty of good reasons. For one, the Fifth  Amendment
states, &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public  use, without just
compensation.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Supreme  Court has interpreted this to
apply primarily only when the  government physically takes your land.
Bureaucrats exploit this legal fine  print by allowing people to retain title to
their property  and pay  taxes on it  even as they take away the owner's right
to decide how  his property should be used. Nor are property owners reimbursed 
for their losses. This is both unfair and economically devastating.  For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife spend a large portion  of their
retirement savings to buy property on which to build  their dream home and that
property then is designated a &quot;wetland,&quot;  the value of their property 
and their savings  is destroyed.  Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship
caused by government  designation of land as wetland or endangered-species
habitat have  become common. This is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the public benefits, then the public  not some hapless  landowner  should
pay to provide that benefit. Thus, if the  government takes away your right to
determine for yourself how to  use your $100,000 property, it should compensate
you for the loss  in value it created by taking away that right. The fundamental
 question is whether they took away your right to use your  property; how much
they should pay is merely a function of how much  that right was worth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives often fight regulations that encourage  energy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  conservation. Why? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives are not against conserving energy when it  makes
sense to do so, but responsible adults who must weigh the pros  and cons of
their actions  and who must pay for the energy  are  the best judges of when it
makes sense to conserve or expend  energy in their daily lives. The fact is that
federally mandated energy  conservation is costly in terms of money, human
suffering, and  increased deaths, and sometimes is even counterproductive. For 
instance, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  are now supported
primarily by the Clinton Administration and  environmentalists as a way to
preserve fuel. The most serious  problem with CAFE standards is that the weight
reductions necessary  to meet them make cars less safe because lighter cars are
less  crashworthy. In fact, about 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000  additional
serious injuries occur per model year. Although raising  the standard would
raise the death toll even more, that is exactly  what Clinton wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Energy conservation mandates also cause other unintended  consequences.
Increasing CAFE standards would raise the average  price of cars by as much as
$1,500. And with higher priced autos,  many people would keep their autos on the
road longer, thus  minimizing the very decreases in fuel consumption regulators
are hoping  to achieve. On top of that, older autos kept on the road longer 
would mean increased pollution, not lower pollution. Saving some  oil hardly
justifies the death and suffering imposed by  ill-considered command-and-control
federal regulations such as CAFE.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't cutting EPA's funding just a backdoor attempt by  conservatives
to gut the enforcement of environmental laws they  don't 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  like? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> A.</B> No. The simple truth is that our country cannot afford  ever
more expensive government if we are to eliminate the budget  deficit that
threatens the economic future of our children.  Balancing the budget requires
tough choices, and all federal agencies   even the IRS  will be forced to
streamline their operations.  EPA should not be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The administration of environmental laws will not be affected  adversely by
the budget. EPA still will have a bigger budget than  it had when President Bush
took office, so charges of gutting  EPA's ability to enforce the law are
specious. The fact is that EPA,  instead of concentrating on how we can protect
our  environment under the law, has pushed for ever more paperwork and  control
over the private sector. It uses these new costly programs to  justify its
requests for ever greater funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What these cuts do is require EPA, just like any business  in America, to
evaluate its procedures to cut the fat from its  programs while simultaneously
improving the environment. For  instance, EPA currently does an expensive but
very poor job of  sporadically monitoring factory air and water emissions. It
should allow  companies to hire independent certified contractors to certify
that  they have met certain compliance requirements, much as  accountants
certify tax law compliance. With EPA maintaining a  spot-checking function,
independent contractors would be motivated to  provide honest reports, and &quot;cheating&quot;
and pollution would likely be  reduced considerably. The government also would
save  enormous sums.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives talk about reducing costs and saving jobs,  but what
about saving lives by controlling toxic chemicals? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> How many dollars or jobs is a child's life worth?  Who can  put a
price tag on human life?  These are impossible questions,  but they are not
really the issue. The issue is how to structure our  laws so that we get the
highest quality of life, which includes a long  and healthy life, but at
reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reducing costs and saving jobs actually saves far more lives  than many
federal &quot;risk reduction&quot; regulations. Money wasted on  ineffective
programs is not available for more beneficial  purposes, including saving more
lives. Recent studies have made this  point crystal clear. Scholars have
recently discovered that, for every  year of life extended, the average cost for
federal toxin regulations   the kind for which EPA is renowned  is $2.8 million;
by  contrast, the average cost for medical treatments is $19,000, and the 
average cost for injury reduction efforts is $48,000. Thus, the average  toxin
control program costs roughly 58 times more for every year of  life extended
than the average injury prevention program and  146 times more than the average
medical program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The question thus is not whether $2.8 million is too little or  too great.
The question is whether we want to save the most lives  possible with our
economic resources or squander those scarce  resources in an attempt to
eliminate what are often hypothetical  risks while ignoring that real people
still will die from some other  cause. If lawmakers seriously considered which
environmental  policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many
costly  rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more 
lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  regulation that are radically
different from those that  burden America today. In many cases, if the private
resources used  to comply with federal mandates simply were left in the 
industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy,  Americans
would benefit far more  and far more lives could be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Experts and governments from all over the world have  concluded in
the last year or so   that industrial activity adds to  global warming. When
will conservatives take their heads out of the  sand and admit it?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Actually, scientists and experts all over the world have  been
coming to a very different conclusion. Fears of global  warming have been
reduced as knowledge has increased, and the dire  predictions of global warming
are beginning to resemble the dire  predictions of the coming Ice Age  also
supposedly man-caused   that was supposed to turn the planet into a frozen
wasteland.  President Bush jump-started serious scientific research on  climate
change a few years ago, increasing the annual budget 25  percent annually. The
results of these billions of dollars are that we  have consistently  vastly 
overstated the risk. Now that we are  armed with much more information, it is
clear the models predicting  global warming were fatally flawed and biased to
show  warming when in reality the planet is cooling. The truth is that despite 
the hysterical language often associated with this issue, we know  the planet
has not warmed at all since we started keeping highly  accurate satellite data
in the late 1970s. Yet environmentalists  now claim even the blizzard of '96 is
an example of global  warming. While it might be nice to dismiss the climate
change theory  altogether since environmentalists are so inconsistent about 
whether the temperature will soar or plummet  although it will be  man's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  fault either way  this would be
unwise. The wise thing to  do would be to continue funding so that we know what
is really  happening. What gives the environmentalists away is that many  of
them are now calling for elimination of research on whether  and how climate
change is occurring in favor of research on what  effects global warming will
have, based on the assumption it  will happen.

<P>
</P>
<P>American labor law is largely a product of the conditions and  perspectives
of the 1930s. It needs to be reformed. Today's  economy, labor market, and
labor-management relations are very  different from the time when most of
America's major labor laws  were passed. Instead of modernizing labor law in
recent years,  however, the federal government has continued to place more 
regulations, mandates, and taxes on employers and workers. The result:  fewer
job opportunities and slower real wage growth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a  manufacturing to
a global service economy, competition has  increased, and more American women
are working than ever before.  Workers are demanding more flexible hours,
working conditions,  compensation packages, and workplace involvement than
current laws  and regulations allow. Employers are straining under 
unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Reform of America's labor laws is long overdue. The  primary objectives of
this reform should be to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Reduce</B> excessive burdens on businesses, job
opportunities,  and real wage growth while maintaining workplace health and
safety;
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improve</B> labor-market flexibility while maintaining basic  employment
protections; and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen</B> and expand workers' rights to work at home, to join  or
not join unions, and to form employee-employer committees  to improve
productivity, quality, and customer service.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Fundamental changes that focus on these objectives would  free workers and
employers to create a family-friendly labor  market, increase productivity, and
improve real wage growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reforming the administration and enforcement of America's  archaic labor
laws, moreover, could save taxpayers $10.5  billion over five years.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#1">1</A>  This could be accomplished by
closing the  Department of Labor as a Cabinet-level department and moving 
certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or  other
departments. Other functions that are not national in scope  should be devolved
to the states, or in some cases to the private  sector. Obsolete, ineffective,
and wasteful rules and programs should  be repealed or closed down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992 the main issue was the economy. Specifically, it was  the jobless
recovery that resulted from President Bush's tax and  regulatory increases.
Although job security continues to concern  many workers, since the end of the
recession the resilient  American economy has created over 8 million jobs and
the major labor  issues have shifted to wage growth and income inequality. The 
idea that workers are falling down the economic ladder and no  longer can afford
to raise families has become conventional wisdom.  The debate also has developed
a disturbing class warfare tone  that clouds the issue and unnecessarily
polarizes Americans. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative candidates need to deal with these issues  head-on. They must
reject class warfare arguments as economic  nonsense. And to the extent that
real wages are falling for some  workers, candidates must point out that the
solution is not higher  taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the
minimum  wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and  reforms
that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities  for Americans
through such things as improving basic education  and encouraging more
investment.

<P><B>The Impact of Regulations, Mandates, and Taxes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal regulations, mandates, and taxes have slowed  productivity and real
wage growth, and have limited job opportunities.  Since 1970, the expansion of
federally mandated benefits and  worker protections has taken a heavy toll.
Several studies point to the  job-destroying effect of the regulatory and
mandate explosion in  recent years.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#3">3</A>
 For example:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     There are at least three million fewer jobs in the 
American economy today because of the growth of regulations over the  last 20
years.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#5">4</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone  had
caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than  it otherwise
would have been.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#5">5</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>With each Congress, Washington has placed tougher  requirements 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  and restrictions on employers and
the labor  market.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#6">6</A>  Although
current workplace policies and regulations are well  intentioned, their benefits
are outweighed by their negative consequences  for both workers and employers.
Further, the growing regulatory  burden has made federal workplace inspectors as
feared as IRS  auditors, and most businesses very cautious about hiring 
additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1994, legally required benefits<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#7">7</A> accounted for 8.9 percent  of total
employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5  percent in 1951.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#8">8</A>  These mandated benefits are not &quot;free&quot;
to  the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies  indicates that, on
average, the cost of 88 percent of all legally required  benefits or payroll is
shifted to workers in the form of reduced  cash compensation.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Mandated requirements, such as family and medical leave, add  to the
cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect  an employer's decisions
about whether and when to hire a  worker, which worker to hire, how much cash to
pay the worker, and  how long to keep that worker. The rise in nonwage labor
costs is one  of the most important forces leading employers to lay off workers,
 as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract  labor.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A decline in average real cash wages since 1973 falsely suggests  a decrease
in the American standard of living. Some politicians  are using this narrow
definition of economic well-being to promote  the failed redistribution and
regulatory policies of big  government. Most workers are better off today
because their real  compensation and real per capita income continue to
increase. Real  compensation is a more accurate measure of the &quot;pay&quot;
American  workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and 
pension payments, as well as cash. The reason for this is that  workers are
taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free  benefits than ever
before. Employee benefits accounted for 41.3 percent  of payroll costs in 1993,
up from almost 18.7 percent in 1951  and 36.6 percent in 1979.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#16">16</A>  Stagnating cash wages are a
concern,  but government should be focusing on policies that increase 
productivity and economic growth to raise take-home pay instead of  imposing
mandates, taxes, and regulations that limit employment  opportunities and wages.

occurred in all industries. Real  average hourly earnings in the service,

long-run increase, however, hides  significant growth differences in the
intervening years and  between states. For example, average annual pay decreased
3.0  percent from 1978 to 1980, then increased 5.9 percent from 1980 to  1988,
and then declined 1.7 percent from 1988 to  1994.<A

annual pay has increased in 13 states and the  District of Columbia and declined
in 37 states.

<P>As noted, hourly wages do not account for the increasing  frequency with
which employees receive their &quot;pay&quot; in the form  of untaxed fringe
benefits. Further, hourly wage data are limited  in the types of employees they
cover (68 percent of all  payroll jobs).<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#20">20</A>
 Compensation  or wages plus benefits  is a more  complete measure of the pay
American workers receive. Real  compensation, by any measure, continues to
increase.

 Since 1973, real hourly  compensation has increased an average of 0.4 percent
per year. The  problem is not that the average wage has declined, but that total
&quot;pay&quot;  has grown more slowly since 1973. This can be attributed to the
 slowdown in the growth of productivity, resulting in part from  the growth of
government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes   all of which reduce the net
value of a worker's output, leading to  a slowdown of wages. 
</P>

<P>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an  extraordinary

has been all but ignored in the  recent minimum wage and declining wage
controversy. The  notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed
mostly  of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income  mobility
reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The  comparison of average
incomes by group would be meaningful only  if America were a caste society in
which the people comprising  one group remained constant over time. This is one
reason why  Americans with modest incomes tend to resist &quot;soak the rich&quot;

the hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 over  two years. Although the
President and other proponents of an  increase argue that a higher minimum wage
is needed to achieve &quot;a  minimum decent living wage&quot; for working
Americans, a  minimum wage hike in fact will destroy entry-level job 
opportunities<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#35">35</A> for the very
unskilled Americans proponents claim to be helping.  Further, it will do nothing
to increase the income of nonworking  families, while raising prices for both
the poor and non-poor. Instead  of considering a minimum wage hike, Congress
should focus on  tax and regulatory reforms to increase take-home pay and reduce
 the cost of creating jobs. Doing that will promote economic  growth with low
inflation, and increase employment opportunities  and wages for all Americans.<A

consider reducing or eliminating  pay raises and bonuses for their other

<P>The Clinton Administration declared that its labor policy was  to improve
job prospects and to &quot;reinvent&quot; the Department of  Labor. In practice,
these well-intentioned themes resulted in higher  government spending on
ineffective programs, more mandates on  employers, and reinvention rhetoric.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Family Leave.</B> The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 
enacted in 1993, requires businesses employing more than 50  people to provide
12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for sick family  members or a newborn child.
Although well intentioned, even  unpaid leave can hurt workers in ways that are
not so apparent, since  there is a real cost to employers that is passed on to
workers.  Federally mandated benefits result in lost job opportunities and a 
reduction in real wages or other benefits  the opposite of what mandates  are

develop new assessment  and

<P><B>Striker Replacement.</B> Under the striker replacement executive  order
(E.O. 12954), issued in March 1995, any federal  contractor who hires permanent
striker replacement workers is subject to  termination of the contract or
debarment from bidding on future  contracts. The $100,000 annual threshold<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#50">50</A> effectively extends  coverage to
contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts  and will raise the cost
of federal contracts as these employers  are forced to take into account the
potential cost of settling labor  disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation
estimates the  annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 
million and $2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#51">51</A> 
Further, the order increases the likelihood  of strike activity at federal
contractors, hurting both union  workers and employers through lost wages and
output, and may  discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal
contracts.  By increasing the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion 
subsidiaries and encouraging the use of nonunion subcontractors, it  ultimately
hurts union workers' income and job opportunities.

HREF="ftnt5.htm#53">53</A>  Further, in response to
congressional initiatives to reform the  Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, President  Clinton announced additional OSHA reinvention
activities in May  1995. According to the White House, OSHA will &quot;fundamentally
 change its operation from one of command-and-control to one that  builds
partnerships among regulators and business. Secondly, OSHA  will eliminate or
fix out-of-date and confusing standards and  instead identify clear and sensible
priorities. Finally, OSHA will target  the most serious hazards and dangerous
workplaces.... &quot;

<P>Unlike the White House, Congress has been addressing labor  law reform
vigorously. The 104th Congress has dealt with a variety  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  bills to reform and update
America's labor laws, addressing  issues that have been neglected for years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Job Training.</B> Both the Senate and the House passed
legislation  to consolidate over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs 
into state block grants and reduce overall spending by almost 20  percent. The
legislation gave states the flexibility to design  unified employment,
education, and economic development programs  that meet the needs of their
workers. It also significantly improved  federal and state performance
accountability. The Senate and  House versions of the legislation are
significantly different, and  those differences are being reconciled in a
conference committee. A  final version of the job training legislation is
expected to go to  the President for his signature this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pay and Hours.</B> Both the House and Senate have introduced bills  to
reform the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This is the  statute that sets the
minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor  standards affecting more than 113
million workers. The bills  would allow workers and employers to reach voluntary
agreements  concerning flexible work schedules and pay. For example, a  mother
would be able to work 45 hours one week in exchange for  working 35 hours the
next week so that she could have time to take  her child to the doctor.
Currently, the FLSA bars employers from  providing this flexibility, even to
salaried workers, by requiring  the payment of overtime and prohibiting the
shifting of hours  from one week to the next.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#59">59</A>  Both houses are planning
additional  hearings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Workplace Health and Safety.</B> A number of bills were  introduced in
the House and Senate to reform workplace safety and  health programs. The
leading House bill is H.R. 1834, introduced  by Representative Cass Ballenger
(R-NC). In the Senate, the  leading bill is S. 526, introduced by Senator Judd
Gregg (R-NH). Of  these two bills, H.R. 1834 represents the more comprehensive 
OSHA reform. It would focus more of OSHA's resources on  compliance assistance
instead of enforcement, give employers a  reasonable time to fix hazards before
a penalty is issued, and restore  common sense and sound science to the way OSHA
writes its standards.  It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative
overhead  and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA. S. 526 
essentially proposes to codify many of OSHA's reinvention  initiatives.
Although, the Senate Labor Committee has reported out  S. 526, the House has not
yet marked up H.R. 1834. In  February, Vice President Al Gore promised the
AFL-CIO that  President Clinton would veto either bill this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Davis-Bacon.</B> Both the Senate and the House have introduced  bills to
repeal the Davis Bacon Act. Davis-Bacon was enacted  during the Depression
explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion  workers  chiefly blacks and
Hispanics  from competing for  federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately
for these workers, it  has succeeded. This Depression-era law promotes racial 
discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions
 of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special  interests.
Moreover, states are beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted
data that inflate U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#60">60</A>  The Senate Labor Committee
reported out  its Davis-Bacon repeal bill last year, but the House has not yet 
acted on its version. Additional House hearings on Davis-Bacon  are scheduled
for 1996.  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Collective Bargaining.</B> Both the Senate and the House also  have
introduced bills to reform the National Labor Relations Act.  The House-passed
Teamwork for Employees and  Management (TEAM) Act would enable businesses to
establish  employer-employee involvement committees as a way to give workers a 
voice in business operations to help improve productivity, safety,  and customer
service. Currently, the only discussions of  workplace issues between employers
and workers that are clearly legal  are those that occur during traditional
collective bargaining;  businesses that establish employee-employer committees
risk  litigation and significant legal costs. The Senate is expected to vote on 
its version of the TEAM Act in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The National Right-to-Work Act (S. 581 and H.R. 1279) seeks  to preserve and
protect the free choice of individual employees  to form, join, or assist labor
organizations, or to refrain from  such activities. Congressional hearings on
this bill are planned for  1996, and the bill faces strong opposition from
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>ERISA.</B> The Employee Retirement and Income Security  Act (ERISA) was
enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in  employee pension and welfare plans<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#61">61</A> that provide workers with 
retirement benefits promised by their employers. Reform legislation in  the
104th Congress has focused on the regulation of health  insurance benefits. In
the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL)  introduced a bill (H.R. 995)
which would provide for health  insurance portability between jobs, increased
participation, and other  consumer protections for workers. In the Senate, Nancy
 Kassebaum (R-KS) has introduced S. 1028, which incorporates sections  of H.R.
995 dealing with increasing access to health care  benefits, providing for
greater portability of health insurance between  jobs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  increasing the security of health
care benefits for workers,  and increasing the purchasing power of individuals
and small  employers. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee in 
October 1995. It is highly likely that health insurance reform will  be enacted
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions also were  introduced in
Congress. The most comprehensive (H.R. 2037 and  S. 1006), introduced by
Representative Rob Portman (R-OH)  and Senator David Pryor (D-AR), would
simplify pension  provision and distribution rules and improve access to pension
plans  for small employers. It is highly likely this pension law reform will  be
enacted by the 104th Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Labor Department Reforms.</B> Congress also used the budget  process
last year as a vehicle for reform. The House voted to reduce  FY 1996 DoL
discretionary spending by 13.8 percent and  instituted several important
reforms. Among these, the House budget  prohibits the issuance of two
unnecessarily burdensome OSHA  regulations on ergonomics and fall protection,
and bars DoL from  promoting &quot;economically targeted investments&quot; by
private  pension plans.  Both the Senate and House most likely will pass a 
continuing resolution that will fund DoL for the remainder of FY  1996 with a 15
percent spending cut from FY 1995.

<P><B>Close down the Department of Labor.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to achieve reform is to close down the  Cabinet-level
department and move its legitimate national functions into  sub-Cabinet agencies
or other departments. Other functions that are  not national in scope should be
devolved to the states, or in some  cases to the private sector. Obsolete,
ineffective, and wasteful rules  and programs should be repealed or closed down.
The Department  of Labor has gone far beyond its original  mandate<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#63">63</A> and has become a burdensome and
feared regulatory agency that presents  significant barriers to creating jobs
and increasing real wages. The  proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace
requirements  makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring 
additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy  of American
business and the American worker. Congress should  do what the Clinton
Administration promised but failed to do   reform this overgrown and intrusive
bureaucracy.
</P>

<P><B>Devolve the unemployment insurance system to the states. 
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moving the unemployment insurance system to the states  should be part of
the closure strategy. This would enable states to  take action to decrease the
duration of unemployment, reduce  payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution
should include the  Veterans Employment Service, labor market information
projects, the  one-stop career center concept, and the administration of 
unemployment insurance. Congress also should devolve the Federal  Extended
Benefit program, repeal Trade Adjustment Assistance,  and provide incentives for
states to overhaul and integrate  employment services and to reduce the duration
of unemployment payments  by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Consolidate more job training programs into state block grants  and

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress recently consolidated over 70 of 163 job training  programs into
state block grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#64">64</A>  Although
this was a good  first step, more programs should be consolidated and the
funding  focused on job placement assistance. Conventional wisdom says  that
most job training programs work. Unfortunately, they do  not.65  Rather than
consolidate ineffective programs, Congress  should recognize that federal job
training programs simply do not  work and end them.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#66">66</A>  One thing is clear from the few
rigorous  studies that have been done: Government can do little, if anything, to
 alter the effect of its citizens' neglecting their first 12 years of 
education. The billions of dollars spent on government job training  and public
assistance programs are too much too late. What is  needed is fundamental reform
of the school system so that young  Americans enter the workforce with the basic
skills and attitudes  they need to succeed.

workplace safety and health and &quot;refocus the responsibility  for ensuring
worksite safety and health on the  workplace.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#67">67</A>  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA
is a sensible first step toward  improving workplace health and safety, limiting
unnecessary  government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful 
government spending. Businesses already have much stronger financial  incentives
than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost  productivity, workers'
compensation, and liability claims, to maintain and  continually improve the
safety of their workplaces. Thus, the role  of the federal government should be
redefined from that of  heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner.
Congress  also should spin off the &quot;new&quot; OSHA as a separate 
sub-Cabinet agency.

<P>The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression  explicitly to prevent
low-skilled nonunion workers  chiefly blacks  and Hispanics  from competing for
federally funded  construction jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#68">68</A>
 This Depression-era law contributes to racial  discrimination in the
construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers  billions of dollars a year,
stifles productivity, and subsidizes  special interests. Moreover, states are
beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted data that inflate
U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations and drive up the cost of federally
funded  construction projects.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#69">69</A> 
If Davis-Bacon were not already law, it  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  never be passed today. Proponents
would be denounced as  supporting discrimination; it would be pointed out that
the  bill's worker protection provisions are unnecessary because they exist  in
other statutes; and lawmakers would object to the heavy,  unnecessary budget
costs imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost  of federal
service contracts by as much as $500 million per year  and, like Davis-Bacon,
creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled  entry-level workers, who tend to
be poor and minorities. DoL  has long been criticized for the way it operates
under this law.  Despite two amendments,<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#70">70</A>
the SCA continues to suffer from  statutory ambiguity, administrative problems,
arbitrary requirements,  and capricious enforcement.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#71">71</A>  The General Accounting Office 
has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's &quot;inability  to
administer the act efficiently and effectively&quot; and because &quot;it  is
impractical, in our opinion, to make `prevailing wage'  determinations under the
act in a consistently equitable  manner.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#72">72</A>  Outdated by extension of the Fair

<P><B>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to  offer

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect  unskilled,
low-pay workers. But in today's economy, where  both parents are likely to be
working, its rigid and inflexible  provisions hurt more than they help. The FLSA
deprives workers of the  right to order their daily lives, both on and off the
job, to meet the  responsibilities of work and home. For example, a worker  who

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  wants to work 35 hours one week
in exchange for working  45 hours the following week to attend a child's
parent-teacher  conference must forgo five hours of pay or else have an employer
 willing to pay overtime for working more than 40 hours the second  week.

Sherman Antitrust Act, makes union-free  employment contracts unenforceable in

organized labor and  should be repealed.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#74">74</A>
 If there are to be antitrust laws, they ought to  apply equally to all
combinations in restraint of trade, whether by  employers or by workers. The
right of workers and employers to  enter voluntarily into union-free contracts
should not be abridged,  and workers and employers should be able to petition

<P>Employer-employee involvement (EI) committees are a way  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  give workers a voice in business
operations to help improve  productivity, safety, and customer service. Under
current law,  however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly
 legal between employers and employees are those that occur in  traditional
collective bargaining arrangements. In practice,  employers can listen to their
nonunion employees but cannot respond to  their views without risking litigation
and significant legal costs.  The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management 
Relations<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#75">75</A> has recommended &quot;removing
the legal  uncertainties&quot;<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#76">76</A>
on the EI committees that take a broader, more systemic approach to 
participation that the evidence suggests has the greatest long-term  positive
effects on economic performance. Congress should reform  the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) to exempt EI  committees formed to address issues of
quality, productivity, safety, and  customer service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Section 7 of the NLRA limits the right of workers to refrain  from union
activities if there is a collective bargaining agreement  that requires union
membership as a condition of employment.  Forcing a worker to join or pay dues
to an unwanted union amounts to  deprivation of the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of  association. According to the NLRA, a worker has full freedom of 
rights except when compulsory unionism enters the picture. The  exception clause
in Section 7 should be repealed.

<P>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that unions, as  exclusive bargaining
agents, may not use proceeds from dues to pursue  political or ideological goals
over the objections of affected  employ

employees, said the Court, are to  be used strictly for collective bargaining
and contract  administration, including grievance adjustment.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Dues are mandatory even for employees who are not members  of the union but
who may be required, under the NLRA principle  of exclusive representation, to
support it. Federal legislation  is needed to require the written authorization

Such  legislation should place the burden on unions to prove that no funds  are

<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to the practitioners of class warfare, employers do not   indeed,
cannot  unfairly keep down the wages of their  lower-skilled and entry-level
employees. Employers, as well as  employees, operate within a competitive labor
market in which wage  rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers  
<I>less </I>the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with
employing  a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that  worker will
be paid. Congress should focus on policies that will  increase wages and job
opportunities for Americans by improving  labor productivity and reducing the
cost of employing workers.  Specifically, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Balance the budget.</B> This will increase total domestic
saving,  lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital 
per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in  labor
productivity.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut the capital gains tax.</B> This will increase investment in the 
U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms  to put their
capital to work here with American workers. A  capital gains tax cut also will
make more venture capital available  for emerging technologies and for research
and development that  will improve future productivity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increase the skills of the workforce.</B> What is needed is  fundamental
change aimed at improving basic education through  school choice, strengthening
core curricula, and enabling local  educators to improve discipline and set high
expectations. Congress  also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education
savings  accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling  states
and individuals to use lump sum unemployment insurance  benefits for education
and training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact significant regulatory reform.</B> The explosion of new 
regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital,  created
barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and  raised the cost of
employing Americans. This higher cost of  employment in turn means that in a
competitive economy, the return to labor  in the form of wages is reduced. The
regulatory burden needs to  be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but
also to  decrease the cost of hiring workers.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The White House also should take action. Specifically, the  President
should:
</P>
<P><B>Rescind the striker replacement executive order. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive Order 12954, signed by President Clinton in  March 1995, was an
attempt to bypass Congress and establish new  labor 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  policy by executive fiat: a gift
to a constituency that could not  get its way through the legislative process.
The order will drive up  the cost of federal contracts and hurt workers. The
$100,000  annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving
 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal  contracts
as employers take into account the potential cost of  settling labor disputes.
The economic cost of implementing the order  will be between $520 million and $2
billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#78">78</A>  Further, the order 
will increase the likelihood of strike activity that hurts both  union workers
and employers through lost wages and output, and  may even discourage unionized
employers from bidding on federal  contracts in the future. It also will
increase the incentive for  businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and
encourage the use of  nonunion subcontractors  both of which ultimately hurt
union workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia unanimously
set aside President Clinton's striker replacement  executive order,<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#79">79</A> the President has instructed the
Justice  Department to take all appropriate steps to have the decision
overturned.  The President should not waste Justice Department resources on 
this appeal and should rescind E.O. 12954.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should the government do to create and keep jobs in  this
country?  What do you say to the millions of Americans  looking for work?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  Outdated labor laws, mandates, and heavy taxes lock  workers out
of jobs the private sector otherwise would create.  Congress needs to balance
the budget, cut taxes, and eliminate  unnecessarily 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  burdensome regulations. This will
improve economic growth,  create more job opportunities, and increase the
take-home pay  of American workers. Government mandates and wasteful rules  are
strangling job creation, making employers think twice before  hiring additional
workers. Americans want jobs, and employers  want to hire them. Red tape and
taxes get in the way.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Compared with the 1980s, the burden of higher taxes and  more regulations
has limited job growth significantly. Since the  1990 and 1993 tax increases,
manufacturing jobs have declined by  6.0 percent. We need to reduce government
spending, cut taxes  for American families, and reduce the capital gains tax to 
increase investment, productivity, wages, and jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support cutting taxes and regulations on big  business
when wages are falling, corporate profits are up, and  executive pay is
excessive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>The problem is not that profits are too high; profits are  needed
to invest in new ventures which create jobs and raise  productivity  and wages.
The problem is that taxes, mandates, and  regulations are keeping workers' pay
too low. Cutting individual taxes  will increase the take-home pay of working
Americans. If you look  at your paycheck, you'll see that the real culprit is
the  government, not your employer. Cutting taxes boosts take-home pay  without
cutting job opportunities. For instance, Congress's  $500-per-child tax credit
would put $22 billion per year back into family  budgets so that working parents
can provide for their children in a way  no government program can. The other
key to higher wages is  productivity. Lowering the capital gains tax will
increase  investment, improve productivity, and increase wages. Balancing the 
budget 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  and cutting taxes will help poor
and middle-class Americans  more than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The minimum wage is too low. You can't make ends meet  unless you
work two jobs; what's the harm in raising the  minimum wage?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  It's a job killer and will hurt the very people it is suppose 
to help. The reason: Telling an employer that he or she must  pay higher wages
to low-skilled, entry-level workers simply means  the employer will hire fewer
such workers. Minimum wage laws  presume that politicians are morally justified
in destroying  some people's jobs and their opportunity to begin living the 
American dream in order to inflate other people's wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't allowing companies to use replacement workers  during strikes
just a ploy to break unions?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is striker replacement law that ultimately hurts union 
workers and drives up the cost of federal contracts. Outlawing  replacement
workers will simply increase the incentive for businesses to set  up nonunion
companies and encourage the use of nonunion  subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Most conservatives said that NAFTA would be a good thing  for U.S.
workers. What do you say now to those Americans who  have lost their jobs to
cheap Mexican labor?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Policies that cause the economy to change and grow  always mean
some jobs are lost while many new ones are created.  Some jobs indeed have been
lost because of NAFTA, but many  more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  have been created. NAFTA is good
for American workers  because free trade creates jobs, increases wealth, and
offers  consumers more and better goods at lower prices. It is protectionism
that  ultimately destroys jobs, reduces wealth, and limits consumer  choice.
Free trade may lead to the demise of some businesses and jobs,  but so does
local competition. What is most important is that free  trade fosters higher
productivity, and higher productivity  generates higher wages, more wealth, and
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't curbing OSHA mean more worker injuries and deaths?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Everyone wants better workplace safety and health. The issue  is
how you get there. A new approach is required to improve the  incentives for
workplace health and safety. The role of the  federal government needs to be
changed from that of heavy-handed  regulator to that of cooperative partner.
Today's army of OSHA  inspectors focuses on fines and penalties. That does not
mean  work. Instead, the government should work cooperatively with  businesses
and employees to improve workplace safety. OSHA's  own Maine 200 program has
proven that emphasizing compliance  assistance over enforcement can improve
workplace safety  and health dramatically. If we take this course, Americans
will  get more workplace health and safety for their tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't somebody who has worked all his life and is  suddenly laid
off deserve help with some job training?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes. The problem is that today's federal job training  programs
are ineffective. The 104th Congress is working on legislation  that consolidates
over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs  scattered across 15 agencies
into state block  grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#80">80</A>  This
will help, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  because states will have the
flexibility to design unified  employment, education, and economic development
programs that  meet the job training needs of their workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to close down the Department  of Labor? 
Who will protect workers' interests in Washington?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American labor law is largely a product of the conditions  and
perspectives of the 1930s and needs to be reformed.  Today's economy, labor
market conditions, and labor-management  relations differ significantly from
those that existed when most  of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers
are  demanding more flexible hours, pay, and working conditions than current 
laws and regulations allow. Employers are straining under  unnecessarily
burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes.  American labor laws
should be reformed to empower workers to  protect themselves. The problem is
that the whole philosophy and  organization of the Department of Labor is
steeped in the 1930s and  resists modernization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives are not calling for the elimination of  everything DoL does.
Instead, they are calling for functions to be carried  out elsewhere. Some of
DoL's key national functions, like  workplace health and safety, would remain at
the federal level. Other  functions that are not national in scope should be
turned over to  the states, or in some cases to the private sector where they
can be  run more effectively. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful 
bureaucracies, however, should be closed.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are increasingly anxious about the breakdown of the basic social
institutions of society.  Nowhere is this more visible than in the breakdown and
disappearance of neighborhoods. Many once-friendly  and peaceful neighborhoods
are now threatening and dangerous. Particularly alarming is the breakdown  of
marriage and the family. Marriage and the stable two-parent family form the
centerbeam of society,  but soaring rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births
are destroying this crucial institution and weakening  the development of the
next generation. This means more welfare dependence, more crime, more health 
and behavioral problems, lower educational achievement, and the prospect of
daunting obstacles in later life  for millions of young Americans. Some 92
percent of children on welfare today are from broken  families. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm">1</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To a significant extent, government programs and policies have contributed
to this collapse. The  incentives within welfare programs over the last 30 years
have discouraged two-parent families among the poor.  These programs also have
discouraged work and responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Families also have come under assault from the tax system. Today the federal
income tax takes  one-fourth of the income of the average married family with
children  and state and local taxes increase the  total government take to 38
percent. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm">2</A></B></TT>  This
compares with just two percent in federal taxes paid by a  similar family just
after World War II. The rise in taxation is due in large part to the erosion,
through inflation, of  the personal exemption and the sharp rise in payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The next generation is already under assault from the present government's
spending habits. The  national debt is a $70,000 mortgage on the back of every
child under 18. Instead of allowing Americans to pass  a patrimony of wealth on
to their children, entitlement programs are eating their future earnings.
Children  have become not dependents, but providers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The collapse  almost extinction  of two-parent families in many
neighborhoods has contributed heavily  to the collapse of those neighborhoods.
The absence of fathers means there is no adult male financial  support, guiding
hand, or protection for children. The result: gangs of young men driven by a
destructive credo  in place of paternal guidance, young girls vulnerable to
abuse, children having children, and mindless,  violent crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, institutions in poor neighborhoods that once provided help and
guidance to those lacking it  at home have been crowded out by the burgeoning
welfare state. Caring and knowing local people have  been replaced by armies of
professional social workers and bureaucrats who emphasize rights and rules,  not
freedom and responsibility. Effective faith-based solutions to educational and
social deficiencies are  barred from receiving government funds to carry out
their work  and if they are able to receive support, it is  often only by giving
up their religious message.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain these elements in the decline of American
society, declines already well  ad
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vanced in the inner cities and
growing in our suburbs, and they must warn electors that it will take  many
years to rebuild the social fabric because so much long-term damage has been
done. The key to  rebuilding society is rebuilding the family and unshackling
the institutions that complement the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rebuilding society by rebuilding the family, however, requires reversing the
harmful effects of decades  of government social engineering. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The increase in illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, illegitimate births hovered at low rates. In recent decades,
however, this pattern has  changed radically. According to the most recent
statistics released by the Center for Health Statistics at the  U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, illegitimacy continues to rise rapidly and
marriage continues  to decline across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recently released HHS data show that out-of-wedlock births represented 31.0
percent of all births  in 1993, up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. For
certain groups and parts of the country, the rates  are alarmingly high  as high
as 82 percent in one state. For all groups in all parts of the country, the
trend is  the same: steadily upwards at similar rates of increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among whites in 1993, 23.6 percent of births were out of wedlock, up from 11
percent in 1980.  Among blacks, 68.7 percent of births were out of wedlock in
1993, up from 58 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most useful tool in measuring the decline in marriage and the growth in
illegitimacy is the illegitimacy  rate (more formally called the illegitimacy
ratio). The illegitimacy rate or ratio measures the number of  out-of-wedlock
births in a given year as a percent of all births in that year. Thus, if there
were 100 births, and 30  of those births were out of wedlock, the illegitimacy
rate or ratio would be 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The illegitimacy rate is important because it measures the extent to which
illegitimacy is displacing  marriage in our society. Moreover, it is widely
recognized that illegitimacy is a profound underlying factor  contributing to
most other social problems. The illegitimacy rate is the best possible tool for
indicating the  potential magnitude of a wide array of future social problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="soc_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the illegitimacy rate in the U.S. has increased rapidly
over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The continuing rise in the illegitimacy rate is propelled by three factors:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     A decline in the portion of women

</P>
<P>While the breakdown in family is occurring across the whole age spectrum, it
is most graphic in what  has happened among teenagers over the last 35 years, in
illegitimate births, in the flight from marriage, and in  the practice of
abortion.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Abortion and sex outside of marriage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In terms of family breakdown and the threat to children not growing up in a
family once conceived,  the different rates of abortion within and outside of
marriage contribute to the severing of society's  former linking of children,
marriage, and sexual intercourse. There is only one large sample survey,
reported in  1989 by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which gives a snapshot of
the rates of abortion within and outside  of marriage. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<P>If this ratio is applied (as the best approximation we have from research)
to the incidence of abortion  since 1973, then the following picture emerges:
The vast proportion of abortions occur among those  committed neither to the
child nor to a spouse  in other words, among the unattached. The best way to 
reduce abortion is to reduce sexual intercourse outside of marriage. This means
a cultural change that  depends primarily on the effectiveness of the family,
the church, and schools at their tasks; such a change is  not possible through
government action alone.

</P>
<P>If one adds the number of children entering broken families, either through
out-of-wedlock births or  through divorce, every year and plots them as a
proportion of the total entering life that year, one gets a fair  picture of the
proportion being affected by broken family life. This proportion has grown from
12 percent in  1950 to over 60 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Effects of Family Breakdown
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Illegitimacy and divorce result in a disastrous emotional injury rate for
children, which means a  massively weakened future America. Even if the
illegitimacy rate declined sharply and permanently next year,  the effects on
children now being raised in broken families would be felt for generations to
come. Children  born out of wedlock or raised in a broken family suffer from:

</P>
<P><B>Five Stages in the Development of a Serious Criminal </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The five stages in the development of most serious criminals most frequently
have their beginnings in  the abandonment of the child by the father. Add abuse
and neglect in early childhood, and the child is on  his way to a serious life
of crime.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Stage One: Parental neglect and abandonment in early home
life</B> are characterized by different  combinations of the following:
fatherlessness, absence of a mother's love, parental fighting and domestic
violence, lack  of parental supervision and discipline, rejection of the child,
parental abuse and neglect, or criminal parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Two: The embryonic gang</B> emerges as young, unsocialized,
aggressive children, rejected by their  more normal peers, seek and find other
alienated children, fail at school, lose interest in education, and begin  to
run wild.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Three: The embryonic gang of grade school changes into a gang</B>
of tough, exploitative teenagers  who gradually become more and more expert in
crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Four: Violence emerges as a way of life</B> within the gang as the
more expert learn to do their  crime without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Five: A new baby is born</B> to the now-criminal young father, who
stays with the child's mother for  a while before abandoning her and her child.
The mother comes from a background similar to the  young criminal father's.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The more single-parent families we put in place, the more likely it is that
increasing numbers of children  will experience this pathway to crime. Overall,
a 10 percent increase in illegitimacy leads to a 17  percent increase in serious
violent crime (see <a href="soc_8.gif">Chart 8</a>). With the continued rise in illegitimacy, we will
see more  and more violent criminals coming onto our streets as they reach their
mid-teenage years. And with the  appearance of these criminals, we will lose
more and more of our everyday freedoms, and will be forced to  pay other huge
social and economic costs.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>There has been a sharp increase in the proportion of young
people using marijuana. These [increases]  are specific to American adolescence.
We are seeing a rate now that is two and a half times what it was  among the
eighth graders just four years ago; two times as high among the tenth graders
and half again as  high among the twelfth graders.... Certain attitudes and
beliefs and norms among our young people are critical  to the containment of use
of these drugs. And those are in erosion.... And the fact that a much larger
pool  of youngsters are now marijuana experienced creates a greater danger that
they will go on to use other drugs.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The number of Americans using illicit drugs plunged from a peak
of 24.7 million in 1979 to 11.4 million  in 1992. The so-called casual use of
cocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and 1992, while  monthly cocaine use
fell 55 percent between 1988 and 1992 alone, from 2.9 million to 1.3 million
users. Now  these reductions were dramatic and unprecedented and represented
nothing less than a cultural revolution  in attitudes towards drug use. Now
we're in danger of giving back all the ground we have won.

<P>
</P>
<P>Jim Burke, chairman of Partnership for a Drug-Free America, stated that
roughly one in thirteen of  those who take drugs become addicts: &quot;In 1962
less than 4 million Americans had ever tried an illegal drug in  their lifetime.
In 1992, one generation later, 80 million had tried illegal drugs.... Of the 80
million we now have  6 million addicts.... If you go back to 1962 we only had
300,000 addicts. The numbers are very clear:  twenty times more triers, twenty
times more addicts.... We know what works. Children are just as rational  as
adults. If they believe that the risk goes up in using drugs, their usage goes
down. Social disapproval  and perception of risk are the two drivers.&quot;

<P>
</P>
<P>Coupled with this increase in the use of drugs is the &quot;baby-boomerang&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the next ten years we will have a 23% increase in the

really concerned. I think this is the calm before the storm.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>I think it's a matter of supervision...one of the important elements that we
are not talking about....  For example at this point 57% of the children in this
country do not have full time parental supervision....  Almost 45% of the
juvenile violent crimes occur between 3:00 in the afternoon and dinnertime.

<P>Jim Burke also stated: &quot;If you go back to the epidemic before [1978]
when we normalized drugs,  the average age of trial [first use] in that period
was around 16. The average age of trial today is 13....  The current marijuana
is three to five times stronger.&quot;
</P>
<P>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Tax System Hurts Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to the cultural onslaught on family life, the tax burden on
families with children has raised the  cost of having children and forced many
couples to endure a trade-off between time at home and time spent  at work
earning money to support the family. More and more couples function like a tag
team, with one  at home with the children while the other works, or work
concurrent shifts while the children are at school or  in day care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last few decades, the tax system has removed much of the help it
once gave to parents  raising young children. Rather than defend the family and
encourage marriage, the tax code now does almost  the opposite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median-income family of four paid 2 percent of its gross annual
earnings to the federal  government in income and payroll taxes. Today, it pays
24 percent. In addition, state and local taxes on  average take another 14
percent from the family's gross  income. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>  The main reasons this
burden has risen  so sharply, other than the general increase in taxes, are that
the personal exemption has been eroded  by inflation and payroll taxes have
risen.

</P>
<P>Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American family
with children paid only  3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today, the same
family pays 24.5 percent. The average family  now loses $10,060 of income due to
the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family  income.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#49">49</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax code is riddled with other anti-family, or anti-marriage, or
anti-mother-at-home inequities.  For example, there is a child care allowance
for parents who work but not for those who stay at home with  their children. If
two fathers both earn $20,000, for example, and the mother in one family goes
out to work,  that family not only has her extra income, but also can deduct up
to $1,600 for child care expenses. But if  the mother in the other family
sacrifices the extra income to stay home to look after her children, that 
family receives no tax break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Moreover, the spouse who stays at home to look after the children is
penalized by the tax code in  her savings for old age. While a working mother is
allowed to invest $2,000 a year in a tax-deferred IRA,  a stay-at-home mother is
allowed to invest only $250 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The 1995 Congressional Tax Credit Proposal of $500 per Child </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the budget process of 1995, Congress passed a tax credit of $500 per
child to help alleviate  the financial stress on families with children.
President Clinton, by contrast, offered a $300 tax credit that  is phased in at
higher income levels, phased out at lower income levels, and does not apply to
children  over the age of 12.

Congress's plan will cut the income tax burden of  a family of four earning

$40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000

<P><B>The Effect of Debt on America's Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The welfare state, with its ever-expanding appetite for taxes and
expenditures, has misdirected and  wasted a huge portion of the money in the
nation's economy. The deficit has soared as a direct result of this  unbridled
appetite, jeopardizing not only present income, but also the future incomes of
many generations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At present, America has 70,020,000 children under 18 and a deficit burden of
$4.887 trillion, or  $70,000 per child under 18. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#50">50</A></B></TT>  This means that even if
Congress balanced all future budgets and kept up with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  interest payments, every child
under 18 still faces a future mortgage of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> To appreciate the effect this has on the economy, consider the opposite:
Rather than a mortgage  of $70,000 on each child, assume an investment of
$70,000 in each child at birth. This investment would  yield huge benefits.
Indeed, $70,000 invested at birth would grow to over $11,000,000 (in future 
dollars) <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#51">51</A></B></TT> by

<P>The national debt, however, will have the opposite effects on our children:

<P>In solid families with good traditions, parents strive to add to the
patrimony (inheritance) they leave  their children, expecting them to do
likewise for the grandchildren. Parents who not only would leave nothing,  but

profligate spending incur  appropriate scorn and are seen as economic pariahs.
The welfare state is doing this to our children.

<P><B>Themes for Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's often disparaged, traditional two-parent family is the principal
social institution by which the  work ethic, self-discipline, intellectual
motivation, and moral character are passed on to the next generation.  The
traditional family is the foundation of American society, and when it is
weakened, the nation is weakened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades, the government has pursued policies which help assure the
collapse of the family. To  change course, fundamental changes are required in a
wide range of policies. These changes embody five themes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 1: Reducing the government financial burden on working families. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The traditional family is the original department of health,
education, and welfare, but government  for decades has engaged in punitive
policies which discourage marriage and make it difficult for the  traditional
family to carry out its functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the
federal government in  taxes. Today, that figure has risen to 24 percent; when
state and local taxes are thrown in, the typical family of  four now pays 38
percent of its income in taxes to the government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the War on Poverty
has been borne in  large measure by the middle class, especially by parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when they have married, have put off having  children
and reduced the number of children they raise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ironically, even as its punitive tax policy discourages child rearing by
traditional middle-class families,  the government continues to subsidize child
rearing by never-married women who generally are ill-prepared  to act as
parents. The results of this disastrous policy are only too apparent. Current
government policy,  which places punitive and crippling financial burdens on
traditional two-parent families while subsidizing  illegitimacy, is a recipe for
eventual social collapse. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 2: Reforming welfare to control costs and require work to improve
the lot of the &quot;welfare family.&quot;  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Today's welfare system crushes low-income families by placing
anti-family requirements on mothers as  the price of receiving welfare, as well
as by discouraging employment. The steps needed to change this  destructive
incentive system are outlined in the accompanying chapter on welfare reform.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 3: Reducing illegitimacy. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Societies through the ages have recognized that it takes the
efforts of at least two persons, a father and  a mother, to provide the economic
and psychological support needed to raise children. Women who  have children out
of wedlock invariably impose a heavy financial burden on the society around
them. A  father's absence also threatens the psychological well-being of his
children. Thus, societies historically have gone  to great lengths to encourage
marriage and, conversely, to discourage illegitimacy. In the recent past,  the
United States has experimented with reversing this common wisdom by aggressively
subsidizing  single parenthood and penalizing marriage. The results of this
experiment have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the well-being of American children and the safety of society, a moral
sense of responsible  parenthood must be restored, based on the commonsense
principle that it is immoral to have children unless one is  fully prepared to
raise those children. To be fully prepared to raise children means three simple
things. First,  the mother and father must be married and committed to a life
together. Second, they must be mature  and psychologically ready for the
difficult task of raising the young. Third, they should be economically 
productive and self-sufficient, able to sustain a family without large amounts
of ongoing financial support from  the larger community.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 4: Reforming divorce law and strengthening marriage. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the past 40 years, government policy has made divorce
easily available, and welfare has  subsidized family breakup. The principal
victims have been children. These trends should be reversed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While divorce and marriage law should remain under the control of state
legislatures, it is clear that levels  of divorce and marital instability have
direct repercussions on the federal welfare system and on the  overall
well-being of America's children. Thus, the federal government should use the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; to urge  reforms at the state level.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 5: Revitalizing civil society. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#58">58</A></B></TT></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While reforms in taxes, divorce law, and welfare are necessary
steps in dealing with the problems of  family disintegration and the underclass,
they are not sufficient in themselves. Welfare programs in particular,  by
subsidizing self-destructive behavior, have played a huge role in promoting
underclass problems. But  welfare is not the sole cause of these burgeoning
problems: Changing cultural values and norms concerning  sexual behavior,
marriage, work, respect for others, and self-control have played a heavy  role.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#59">59</A></B></TT>  Members of
Congress and others seeking a comprehensive solution must look beyond reforming
welfare programs  and into the broader culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government leaders seeking to reestablish sound norms and virtuous behavior
within vulnerable  groups would do well to look to the past. Few people realize
that 19th century America fought several wars  on poverty which, in contrast to
the 20th century version, were quite successful. These historic  anti-poverty
efforts were headed by non-governmental institutions, primarily churches, which
saw poverty as  emanating from behavior and individual  character. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>  They took as their
central task the molding of character and  self-discipline within vulnerable
low-income communities. For example:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)
was established to combat urban crime. Seeing  its mission as molding the moral
character of the young, the YMCA successfully undertook a struggle to  win the
hearts and minds of inner-city youth, leading to a major drop in juvenile crime.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Catholic parochial education is a dramatic instance of long-lasting
private voluntary endeavor. In  founding Georgetown University in 1792, Bishop
John Carroll argued for the necessity of a &quot;pious and  Catholic education
for the young.&quot;  Carroll hoped that Georgetown's graduates would supply a
pool of teachers  for the Catholic schools of local parishes. Today those
schools provide superior education, open to children  of all faiths, and of
tremendous importance to poor inner-city parents seeking an alternative to
public  education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) gave a chaperoned place
to live to young  women migrating to the cities from rural areas. The stability
immediately available to them permitted them  gradually to find the community
life in which they felt comfortable, and safe fellowship after leaving their
families  and original communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Red Cross is a massive private-sector organization which runs the
world's largest blood collection  and distribution system as just one of its
projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The temperance movement of the mid-1800s, a response to the growing
alcohol addiction of the  time, resulted in massive reductions in alcohol
consumption and a change of attitude toward the abuse of alcohol. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dealing with social problems by placing greater reliance on non-governmental
social institutions is  therefore nothing new. It is a return to the fundamental
political philosophy upon which the American Republic  was established. The
Founders, because they understood the dangers inherent in looking to government
as  a cure for social ills, relied instead on civil institutions such as the
family and church.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This wisdom is reflected in the writings of one of the most astute observers
of American politics and  society, Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville
emphasized the crucial role in American society of such  &quot;private
associations&quot; as religious institutions, private philanthropies, clubs,
fellowships, voluntary civic  associations, and private moral and educational
institutions. According to de Tocqueville, these private associations  or civil
institutions were more important than America's political and economic
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the functions of private civil associations was to affirm, renew, and
sustain social virtues. It was  their task to inculcate into Americans the basic
virtues and norms which make civilized life possible.  Without these
value-affirming and renewing institutions, Americans would soon lose their
capacity to maintain  healthy families, to work honestly and diligently, to
educate and govern themselves, and even to live next to  one another without
murder and mayhem. In other words, civil institutions provided the moral
foundation  which made the political and economic superstructure possible, and
their ability to shape individual character  and to inculcate individuals with
the virtues and norms necessary for social life was essential to the 
continuance of society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last hundred years, however, government has usurped much of the
role of civil associations.  One social function after another  education,
charity, and, increasingly, child-rearing  has passed from  civil institutions
into the hands of government bureaucrats. By arrogating to itself more and more
of those  functions, and by monopolizing an ever-larger share of the financial
resources needed for operation of  civil institutions, government decisively
undermines private civil associations. By diminishing and  shouldering aside
value-affirming institutions, government wages war on society's natural immune
system. The  growing underclass and the collapse of the family are only two of
the many problems which stem from this assault.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Crucial Role of Religion.</B> In grappling with the burgeoning
problems of family disintegration, crime,  and dependence, Americans must
utilize all the vital resources within society. History, common sense,  and
research all show that there is one neglected institution ideally suited to lead
this struggle of moral renewal  in low-income communities and across the nation:
the church. Efforts to tackle underclass problems in the  19th century succeeded
largely because they were spearheaded by value-laden religious institutions. By 
contrast, efforts to fight urban poverty in the 20th century frequently have
failed because of their reliance on  value-free government programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Research by Dr. Richard Freeman of Harvard University

<P>Echoing this research, criminologist John DiIulio sees moral decay at the

deprivation  not by material poverty, but by &quot;moral poverty.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Moral poverty is the poverty of being without loving, capable,
responsible adults who teach you right  from wrong. It is the poverty of being
without parents and other authorities who habituate you to feel joy  at others'
joy, pain at others' pain, happiness when you do right, remorse when you do
wrong. It is the  poverty of growing up in the virtual absence of people who
teach morality by their own everyday example  and who insist that you follow
suit.... In the extreme, moral poverty is the poverty of growing up surrounded 
by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in abusive, violence-ridden,
fatherless, Godless, and jobless  settings. In sum, whatever their material
circumstances, kids of whatever their race, creed, or color are most likely  to
become criminally depraved when they are morally  deprived. <TT><B><A

<P>
</P>
<P>DiIulio sees help for these morally deprived children not in bigger
government, but in a revitalization of  civil society: of De Toqueville's
private associations. In particular, DiIulio views the church as society's last 
hope, the final dam which separates us from the onrushing tidal wave of violent
&quot;super-predators.&quot;

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has said some very good things on the family and on the
breakdown of family and  marriage. However, he frequently contradicts himself,
and his actions have been very different from his  rhetoric. For instance, in
addressing the National Governors' Association, the President said that &quot;There
are  almost no poor children in families with two parents in the home.&quot; 
And on abstinence, he has said that &quot;we need  to send a strong signal that
it is essential for young people to delay sexual activity, as well as having 
children, until they are ready to accept the responsibilities and consequences
of these actions. It is critical that we  help all youth understand the rewards
of...deferring childbearing until they are  married.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#66">66</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala has been
vehement in her opposition  to such programs. Commenting on her elimination of
Title XX (abstinence) funds from the Clinton budget  in 1994, she said that &quot;abstinence
only messages provide no hope of protection at all against the risks  of
pregnancy and disease.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#67">67</A></B></TT>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President has never reinstated Title XX in his budget, not even since
announcing his Teen  Pregnancy Initiative in January 1996. Instead of standing
for marriage as the traditional place for sexual  expression, President Clinton
has pushed for the enshrinement in public policy of homosexual sex as equal to
sex  in heterosexual marriage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On abortion the President has repeatedly said: &quot;I believe abortion
should be safe, legal and  rare.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#68">68</A></B></TT>  However, on January 22,
1993, two days after his inauguration, his first four executive orders were all
directed  at liberalizing American abortion regulations: To make foreign aid
money available for use in providing  abortions in other countries; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#69">69</A></B></TT> to speed up the granting
of FDA approval to RU-486, a drug designed to  make abortion a very easy form of

to permit the spending of Title X monies for abortion  counseling; <TT><B><A

practice of abortions at military  hospitals.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#72">72</A></B></TT>  While the
views of the President  were well known and an open part of the debate, even he,
aware of the need for delicate handling of this  issue, has stated: &quot;If
people in Washington spent less time in using abortion to divide the country for
their  own political ends....&quot; <TT><B><A

<P><B>Taxes and the Family</B>

<P>
</P>
<P>During his presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton promised a tax
credit of $800 per  child. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#74">74</A></B></TT>
 But in 1993, he gave families the biggest tax hike in history, which also means
he has taken more money  and parental time away from the family than anyone in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Congress included a $500-per-child tax credit in the Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1996,  President Clinton opposed it as giving money to the
rich even though almost 90 percent of the monies went to  middle-class and
poorer families. However, as Table 2 shows, the relief to the poor was higher at
every stage in  the congressional plan than in the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Illegitimacy:</B> In the welfare reform package which passed the
House and Senate and which was part  of the budget reconciliation package sent
to the President in November 1993, Congress moved to reduce  the welfare rewards
and reinforcements for increased numbers of children out of wedlock. Congress 
forbade states to spend federal monies for increased welfare payments for new
children born out of wedlock  while the mother was on welfare. (States could
spend their own money for these increased payments.)  The President vetoed the
bill.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Abortion:</B> Congress outlawed the use of partial birth abortions, a
procedure involving cranial collapse  of the seven to nine month old fetus
followed by dismemberment and suction removal. The President  has promised to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fatherlessness:</B> Congress toughened the child support provisions in
the welfare bill which was part of  the reconciliation package vetoed by the
President in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pro-family tax changes:</B> Historically mothers who stay at home to
care for young children have been  penalized in the regulations covering
individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Congress, in the budget  reconciliation
bill, removed the discrimination against these mothers. President Clinton vetoed
the bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to arresting America's moral decay is to restore the historic
balance between the state and  civil society  to revitalize those private
institutions which are society's natural immune system.  Destructive policy
influences must be reversed, and the beneficial effects of non-governmental
institutions must  be allowed once again to play their full role in rebuilding
civil society.

<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress but vetoed by

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The current welfare system heavily penalizes marriage between a
mother and a working man. This  marriage penalty should be reduced through
creation of a tax credit for lower-income parents who are married  and working
rather than living on welfare. The pro-marriage tax credit should be available
to  low-income married couples who are living together and supporting dependent
children; the family should have  the equivalent of at least one adult working
full time. The credit should be refundable and should have a  maximum value of
$1,000.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>One simplistic solution to the anti-marriage and anti-work
effects of welfare would be to allow a  welfare mother to retain all or most of
her benefits after she has taken a job or married a fully employed male.  But
this approach would be unfair to working single mothers and to low-income,
working married couples  who never went on welfare in the first place. Moreover,
it would give low- and moderate-income parents a  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  incentive to enroll in welfare,
at least briefly, to become eligible for the long-term continuing benefits. Such
 a system would degenerate inevitably into one in which the majority of low- and
moderate-income single-  and two-parent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost of welfare by hundreds  of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic reformers must seek to alter welfare incentives in a
more  practical manner.

 more information on how to say &quot;no&quot; to a boyfriend's requests for sex
without losing the  boyfriend. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#80">80</A></B></TT>

<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should pass a $5,000 tax credit for couples who adopt a child,
fundable (that is, those who  do not pay $5,000 in federal taxes still should
receive $5,000 support) so that poorer families will be  encouraged to adopt and
not be left out of the pool of adopting parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the numbers of children born out of wedlock have been increasing
massively, the practice of  adoption has been decreasing.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The benefits of growing up in a two-parent family are illustrated again
among adopted children.  Adopted children do as well as or better than their
non-adopted  counterparts. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#82">82</A></B></TT>

on indicators of school performance, social competency,  optimism, and
volunteerism.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#83">83</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single
parents and less involved in  alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police
trouble, weapon use, and  theft; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#84">84</A></B></TT> they score higher on
self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directness, positive view of
others, and feelings of security within  their families. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#85">85</A></B></TT>  On health measures,
adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high  scores,
and both groups score significantly higher on these measures than children
raised by single  parents. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#86">86</A></B></TT>
 Adopted children do well at school. In 1988, only 7 percent of children adopted
in infancy repeated  a grade. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#87">87</A></B></TT>
 By contrast, 33 percent of children whose mothers had never married repeated a
grade.  Adoptive parents also are less likely to divorce. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#88">88</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better then
unmarried teen mothers who  choose to become single parents. Unmarried teen
mothers who choose adoption have higher educational  aspirations and are more
likely to finish school than mothers who keep their children; are less likely to
live in  poverty and receive public assistance; are more likely to marry
eventually; are more likely to be employed  12 months after the birth and less
likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy; and are no more likely to  suffer
depression or other negative psychological consequences than mothers who rear
children as single  parents. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#89">89</A></B></TT>
 Thus, all goals of liberal government programs such as job training,
supplemental education,  and family planning services are attained with greater
ease, and a lower cost, through adoption.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
These barriers include  anti-adoption bias in pregnancy counseling, with most
counselors not even raising the option of adoption;  misuse of the family
preservation principle in social work, which prolongs the danger to severely
abused  children instead of rescuing them and placing them for adoption sooner;
overload and confusion of social  service roles, with the work of preserving
families sometimes in seeming conflict with that of rescuing children  in danger
(most social service agencies do not resolve this dilemma and leave the burden
to the child);  unsatisfactory protections of confidentiality, which inhibit the
adoption option; unknown, uninvolved, or  unmarried fathers who increasingly, at
local court levels are permitted to block adoption processes; and the race of 
the child and the adoptive parents, with many social workers against transracial
adoptions even if parents of  the same race as the child are not readily
available to adopt (which puts the burden on the child rather than  on the
community).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enforce statutory rape laws at the state level.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Male accountability is needed. In many inner-city communities, when 16- or
17-year-old girls  become pregnant, the father is often four or five years older
than the girl. Such cases often involve statutory rape,  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  serious criminal offense.
Congress should hold hearings to emphasize the role of statutory rape in 
contributing to pregnancy among young girls, and the states should act
vigorously and visibly to enforce their  statutory rape laws in such cases as a
way to deter such predatory male behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce at the state level and require waiting
periods, mediation, and counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In most states today, it is easier to terminate a marriage contract than a
contract to purchase a new  washing machine. Marriage is America's most
important social institution; steps must be taken to restore its  sanctity and
the seriousness of marital commitment. State governments immediately should
eliminate no-fault  divorce for couples with children. In the future, the major
share of the costs of divorce, as well as the future costs  of raising the
children, should be borne by the parent who is at fault (or by the party who
initiated the divorce  if no fault is found). Couples seeking a divorce who have
children should be required to undertake  counseling, and states should
establish a six-month waiting period for completion of any divorce action.
During  divorce proceedings, children should be represented by a separate
attorney tasked with representing their  interests (which often may be for the
parents to remain together).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage pre-marriage counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Marriage is a legal and social institution designed to enforce the binding
commitments of a man and  a woman to one another, and to provide the best
environment for the raising of children within society.  Society has an interest
and obligation (to children not yet born) to seek to ensure that marriages which
are  formed will have a good chance of not only enduring, but flourishing.
States should insist that individuals  receive some form of pre-marital
counseling as a condition of receiving a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of counseling should be an evaluation to inform prospective spouses of
the probability that their  marriage will end in divorce. Modern evaluation
devices such as the PREPARE (Premarital Personal  and Relationship Evaluation)
questionnaire can predict with an accuracy of over 80 percent whether a 
marriage will end in divorce. PREPARE already is offered by thousands of
churches across the nation. It is in the  best interest of all concerned
(especially the children yet unborn) that the fiancees be informed of their 
prospects for marital success before they have embarked on what should be a
lifelong  commitment. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#90">90</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fight moral decay through school choice at the federal and state levels.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The plight of the underclass is rooted in behavior; behavior in turn is
molded by the cultural values  and norms of low-income communities and the
larger society. For the problems of the underclass to be  solved, there must be
a dramatic change in behavior, which in turn will require an enormous shift in
underlying  norms and values. Policymakers must seek to reanimate within
low-income communities the ethical  principles which are the foundation of a
successful society. To combat the growing problem of the underclass,  Americans
need a multi-dimensional policy which harnesses all the vital forces in our
society. But in the war  against poverty and violence, the most effective social
weapon  the church  lies dormant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to harnessing the church's untapped social strength is another
crucial public policy issue:  school choice. Poor parents should be given
vouchers equivalent to the sum which is spent educating their  children in the
public schools. These parents would be free to use the voucher to place their
children into a school  of their own choice, including private religious
schools. If voucher plans were put in place in large cities,  dozens of
high-quality private religious schools would spring up immediately in each city,
operating as adjuncts  of urban churches. Many low-income parents, struggling to
save their sons and daughters from the social  tide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  of violence, drugs, and sexual
promiscuity, would be overjoyed to place their children under the firm  moral
tutelage of such church-related schools, each one of which would function as a
focal point of moral  renewal emanating into the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson (and many Members of 
Congress), <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#91">91</A></B></TT>
who are wealthy enough to send their children to private schools, poor parents
are left with the inert monopoly of the  public schools, institutions which no
longer can adequately teach simple reading, let alone serve as the focal  point
for moral transformation within underclass communities. In grappling with the
problems of dependence  and the underclass, education voucher programs for
low-income parents are an indispensable complement  to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals will argue that providing parents with vouchers which can be used
in religious schools violates  the First Amendment prohibition on establishment
of religion. This is untrue. The Supreme Court has  clearly ruled, in <I>Mueller
v. Allen</I> and <I>Witters v. Washington State Department of Services for the 
Blind</I>, that vouchers or tax credits can be spent for religious education
without creating constitutional problems. Just  as a widow can place her Social
Security check in the collection plate of a church or synagogue, or a  veteran
can use funds from the GI Bill to go to seminary without violating the
constitutional provisions against  state-established religion, a poor parent may
use education vouchers to place a child in a religious school. As  long as the
parent, not the government, decides where the voucher funds will be spent, the
government  has neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion, and there
is no violation of the religious  establishment clause of the First Amendment.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#92">92</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The church is thus America's strongest weapon in the war against family
disintegration, crime, drugs,  and despair in low-income communities. Churches
can succeed in tackling these problems where  government has failed. Instead of
relegating the churches to the social periphery, policymakers must unleash their
 energy, permitting them to play a much greater role in molding the character of
youth and adults.  Specifically, Congress should redirect a substantial portion
of federal aid to primary and secondary education into  model voucher programs
for poor parents in inner cities.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what their moral
values should be? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Government is not the fundamental moral teacher; that is the duty
of the church or synagogue and  the family itself, the first and most intimate
source of moral instruction. But government does have a  profound responsibility
to inform American taxpayers about the costs and consequences of personal 
behaviors, including violations of the marriage contract, child abuse, or the
dramatic growth in out-of-wedlock  birth, precisely because of their profoundly
negative social impact on the character and quality of American  life:
increasing numbers of psychologically damaged children, rising crime and
juvenile delinquency,  substance abuse and welfare dependency. Americans are
free to live by any moral code they wish, or none at all.  But they should not
expect taxpayers to pick up the tab, without imposing any conditions, for what 
traditionally has been understood to be immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what form of family
they are to have?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> From time immemorial, government in every civilized society has
recognized marriage and the family  as the basic and most venerable institutions
of the social order. Indeed, government has always had a  direct 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  interest in both the
establishment and maintenance of the traditional marriage contract and the
family,  the mutual obligations of a husband and wife and of parents to their
children. To that end, an entire body  of domestic law has been established,
governing everything from the state's issuance of marriage licenses to  the
preservation of family property and inheritance and the protection of children.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, Americans are free to experiment and to have any &quot;alternative
family arrangements&quot; they  wish. But the empirical evidence is overwhelming
that the intact, two-parent family is superior to any other  arrangement.
Children thrive and do better in stable married families than anywhere else.
Their health,  their learning, their income, their mental and emotional
well-being, and their avoidance of drugs, crime,  welfare dependency, and
illegitimacy are much lower than those of children in single-parent families.
America  is stronger because of married families and weaker when families are
broken or unformed. As a matter  of public policy, therefore, it is perfectly
reasonable to promote and preserve the traditional family. As a  matter of
public policy, it is perfectly unreasonable to do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What has been the record of federal drug treatment (as opposed to
enforcement) programs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Poor. Federal drug treatment spending almost tripled between 1988
and 1994, but the number  of persons treated actually declined from 1.5 million
in 1989 to 1.4 million in  1994. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#93">93</A></B></TT>  Most addicts have been
through treatment more than once. As summed up by John Walters, deputy director
of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Bush
Administration, &quot;The harsh fact is that drug  addicts like taking drugs,
even though most of them also dislike some aspects and consequences of their
drug  use. They sometimes admit themselves to treatment programs, not to stop
using their drugs, but to regain  greater control over their drug use; but the
overwhelming majority of addicts entering treatment with the goal  of ending
their drug use are coerced to do so by the courts, family members, or employers.
That is why  the liberals who discuss treatment as if it were the opposite of
enforcement show a profound ignorance of  the reality of drug treatment.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#94">94</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would conservatives fashion a policy on drug treatment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Congress should combine federal anti-drug support to states and
localities (estimated at $3.5 billion  in FY 1994) into anti-drug block grants
for states and local communities. In this way, states and local  communities can
use these funds for anti-drug treatment and rehabilitation programs that work
best. At the  same time, it is essential that Congress establish performance
standards so that organizations receiving  funds demonstrate that they are
effective in treating addicts. Interestingly, some of the best drug and  alcohol
treatment and rehabilitation programs in the nation are those that are connected
with religious or  faith-based institutions. They are successful precisely
because they are able to effect a deep internal or spiritual  commitment on the
part of addicts to resist the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since World War II, Presidents and Members of Congress  have promised
American taxpayers that they would reform, in a  serious way, America's failed
welfare system. The reality, however, is  that the system keeps growing, new
programs are introduced  when earlier reforms do not work, and the level of
spending on  federal and state welfare programs continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is a growing consensus that the current welfare system is  a disaster,
not only for taxpayers who are required to pay ever  larger amounts of money to
maintain and expand the system, but also  for the poor who supposedly are being
helped by it. While liberals  and conservatives agree that the current welfare
system is badly  broken, only conservatives have been prepared to take the steps
 to achieve structural reform  in 1995, liberals actually fought  to block
reform. In the election of 1996, conservative  candidates need to articulate the
clear choice. In particular, they must  remind voters that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>President Clinton promised serious welfare reform, but when  Congress
sent him legislation that would have accomplished this,  he vetoed it.</B>
Welfare reform remains a major domestic issue for  the President and Congress.
While the President promised in 1992  &quot;to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  end welfare as we know it,&quot;
the Clinton Administration's bill  did nothing of the sort. It did not stop
exploding welfare costs. It  did not establish meaningful work requirements. And
it did not  address the persistent problem of additional out-of-wedlock  births
among women who are getting welfare benefits. While  the President's bill
proposed a two-year time limit on welfare, a  reading of the fine print revealed
that it merely placed a few  welfare recipients in government &quot;make work&quot;
jobs while allowing  them to remain on welfare. Moreover, the work requirements
were  truly weak. The bill required only 7 percent of the welfare population  to
enroll in the work program by 1999, and would have  required those enrolled to
work for only 15 hours per week. Worse,  instead of controlling spending, the
Clinton plan would have continued  the automatic and rapid growth of welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, Congress passed a serious welfare reform  bill that
establishes serious work requirements, addresses the  problem of illegitimacy,
and slows the growth in federal welfare  spending. The President vetoed this
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Current welfare costs are rising, and without some fiscal  discipline
imposed by Congress, taxpayers will be saddled with  enormous future tax
burdens.</B>  There are 77 overlapping welfare programs  to assist Americans
officially designated as poor. Total  welfare spending in the United States
exceeds $324 billion, or over  $3,400 for each taxpaying household in the United
States. Of this  spending, 72 percent is federal and 28 percent is state. About
90  percent of all state welfare spending is on federally designed welfare 
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress strongly support federal welfare  programs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  defend the current rate of
spending for these programs, and  oppose even modest reductions in the rate of
growth of welfare  spending. At current rates, the United States will be
spending $500 billion  on welfare by 1999, or a full 6 percent of the gross
national  product (GNP). Under current federal spending scenarios, this would 
mean $2 on welfare for every $1 we now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most important, serious welfare reform must address the illegitimacy
crisis.</B> In 1959, 28 percent of poor families with  children were headed by
women. By 1991, 61 percent of poor families  with children were headed by single
women. The illegitimate birth  rate among white high school dropouts is now a
stunning 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Aside from its relationship to federal welfare policy,  America's overall
rate of illegitimacy is a social catastrophe. The social  science literature on
the subject is unambiguous and  indisputable: Children born out of wedlock do
not have the same chances in  life as do children born into intact two-parent
families. Children  born out of wedlock have lower levels of educational 
achievement, lower economic achievement, increased psychological and  behavioral
problems, and a greater propensity to substance abuse,  juvenile delinquency,
and crime. For the President and Congress,  the key relationship between the
growing problem of illegitimacy  and welfare policy is this: Should illegitimacy
be the basis of a  government entitlement to benefits?  Americans either are or
are not  going to subsidize illegitimacy. There are no compromises on  this
point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Needed: A Serious Policy for Welfare  Reform.</B> In overhauling this
failed system, policymakers should be guided by the  following four themes: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  Reduce illegitimacy.</B> First, and most important,
welfare  reform must seek to reduce the illegitimate birth rate and promote the 
formation of stable two-parent families. Any &quot;reform&quot; that does  not
dramatically reduce the illegitimate birth rate will not save  money and will
fail to help America's children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Demand reciprocity and work.</B> Reform must convert  welfare from a
one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility  in which welfare
recipients are given aid but also are expected  to contribute something to
society for the assistance given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Get costs under control.</B> Reform must control soaring  welfare
costs, which are slowly bankrupting the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Promote moral renewal.</B> Halting the growth of the  underclass
ultimately will require not only welfare reform, but also moral  and cultural
renewal. The government can assist in the process  of moral rebuilding by
allowing private social institutions, such  as churches and other community
institutions, to play a far  greater role in educating and shaping the moral
code of young  people. Among other steps needed to do this, parents must be
given  far greater choice in how their children are educated, including  the
right to use government vouchers to send their children to  religious schools.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A> </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social collapse over the last 30 years has coincided with growth  in the
welfare state. The U.S. welfare system may be defined as  the total set of
government programs, federal and state, explicitly  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  signed to assist poor and
low-income Americans. Current  welfare assistance has three ostensible
objectives: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1) Sustaining</B> living standards through cash and non-cash transfers, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) Promoting</B> self-sufficiency, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3) Aiding </B>economically distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most welfare programs are individually means-tested.  Means-tested programs
restrict eligibility for benefits to persons with  non-welfare income below a
certain level. Individuals with  non-welfare income above a specified cutoff
level cannot receive aid. Thus,  for example, food stamps and Aid to Families
with Dependent  Children (AFDC) are means-tested, and thus constitute welfare, 
but Social Security benefits are not. Some 94 percent of total  welfare spending
takes the form of means-tested aid given directly to  individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other welfare programs are community-targeted or  categorical.
Community-targeted programs provide assistance to  communities which contain a
high percentage of poor and low-income  persons or are economically distressed.
Some 5.2 percent of welfare  spending is directed through programs of this kind.
Pure categorical  programs provide aid to specific disadvantaged or generally 
needy groups, such as migrant farm workers, homeless persons, or  abandoned
children, without a formal means test. Only 1.2 percent  of total welfare
spending is dedicated to simple categorical programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Size of the Welfare System
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently runs 77 major interrelated  and overlapping
welfare programs. Many states also operate their  own independent programs. This
federal and state welfare system  now includes cash aid, food, medical aid,
housing aid, energy aid,  jobs and training, targeted and means-tested
education, social  service, and urban and community development programs. A list
of the  80 major federal and state welfare programs covered in this study  is
provided in the Heritage Foundation  monograph<I> America's Failed $5.4
Trillion War on  Poverty</I>.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1993, 48 percent of total welfare spending was devoted
to  medical programs. Cash programs took 22.1 percent. Food,  housing, and
energy programs comprised 18.8 percent of the total,  while education aid, job
training, social services, and urban and  community aid accounted for 11.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Total federal and state spending on welfare programs was  $324.3
billion in FY 1993. Of that total, $234.3 billion (72 percent)  came from
federal funding and $90 billion (28 percent) came from  state or local funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is so large it is difficult to comprehend. One  way
to make it more tangible is to recognize that, on average, the  cost of the
welfare system amounted to $3,357 in taxes from  each household that paid
federal income tax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Federal and state welfare spending is now the third largest  category
of total government spending, ranking below the first  (combined Social Security
and Medicare) and second (total  government spending on general education) but
above the fourth (national  defense).

<P><B>How the Welfare State Has Grown</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#2">2</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the first 150 years of U.S. history, the government played  little role
in welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#3">3</A>  Charity or welfare
was conducted largely by  private religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As late as 1929, before the onset of the Great Depression,  federal, state,
and local welfare expenditures were only $90 million.  Adjusted into 1993
dollars, this would be $813 million.  Public-sector welfare spending in 1929
amounted to $6.68 per person in  1993 dollars. (Unless noted otherwise, all
spending figures in this  section have been adjusted for inflation into constant
1993 dollars.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth in welfare since 1929. The  Great Depression,
which threw nearly a quarter of the labor force out  of work, led to a dramatic
change in government welfare  spending. Expenditures for work relief welfare
programs such as the  Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress
Administration, and  Civil Works Administration grew rapidly. By 1939, welfare
spending  hit a peak of $46.6 billion  compared with less than $1 billion  in
1929 (expressed in 1993 dollars). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In inflation-adjusted terms, welfare spending would not return  to the 1939
peak until the onset of the War on Poverty a  quarter-century later. The major
Great Depression anti-poverty programs  were terminated at the beginning of
World War II. In the post-war  period, welfare spending remained low relative to
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, total welfare spending by federal, state, and local  governments
was $18.8 billion (in 1993 dollars), less than the cost of  the food stamp
program alone in 1993. During the 1950s and  early 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  1960s, welfare spending grew
slowly, reaching $34.9 billion  in 1964 at the onset of the War on Poverty. In
1964, welfare  absorbed 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as compared
with  1.1 percent in 1950.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Explosion in Spending.</B> In his 1964 State of the Union  address,
President Lyndon Johnson announced the &quot;War on Poverty.&quot;   New
legislation and spending initiatives began to take effect  by 1965. Between 1965
and 1970, over two dozen separate  federal welfare programs were created.
Eligibility for older  programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children
and food  stamps, was expanded. In three years (1965-1968), welfare spending  in
constant dollars more than doubled, rising from $38.3 billion  to $80.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the first decade of the War on Poverty, there was  explosive growth in
all categories of welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1965 and 1975, measured in constant dollars, cash  aid nearly
tripled, social service spending tripled, medical aid  almost quintupled, food
aid did quintuple, housing spending  increased sevenfold, and job training funds
increased fifteenfold. By  1975, total welfare spending had reached $119.4
billion (in  constant 1993 dollars), almost a fivefold increase compared with
1965  levels after adjusting for inflation. While total welfare spending 
absorbed 1.3 percent of GDP in 1965, just ten years later, some  3.8 percent of
the economy was devoted to welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since 1975 welfare spending has continued to grow rapidly,  although not at
the record pace of the 1965-1975 decade.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, federal, state, and local welfare
spending  rose from $158 billion in 1975 to $324 billion in 1993. After

1965 to the present.

<P>
</P>
<P>Charts <a href="welf_1.gif">1</a> and <a href="welf_2.gif">2</a> also belie the political myth that President  Reagan slashed
welfare spending. As the charts clearly show,  welfare spending grew during
Reagan's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-      Total welfare spending was $199 billion in 1980 when 
Ronald Reagan was elected President. By 1988, his last year in  office, welfare
spending reached $230 billion. Cash, food, housing,  and energy spending rose
from $89 billion to $102 billion over  the same period (all figures in constant
1993 dollars). Ronald  Reagan did not reduce welfare spending; he merely slowed
its  explosive growth rate.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Claims that Reagan cut welfare spending utilize the simple trick  of
selecting one or two programs in the list of 80 welfare  programs and
deliberately not counting the rest. By selecting one or two  programs that have
been reduced while ignoring the rapid growth  in the other 78, it is possible to
&quot;prove&quot; in every single year that  welfare has been &quot;slashed&quot;
when in fact aggregate spending  continues to increase.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While Reagan slowed the growth of welfare spending, it  exploded during the
Bush presidency at rates that rivaled those of the  late 1960s. In constant 1993
dollars, total welfare spending rose  from $224 billion in 1988, when Bush was
elected, to $324 billion  in 1993, when Clinton assumed the presidency: a $100
billion  increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Per Low-Income Person. </B>A second way of  examining the
growth of welfare spending is to compare spending  increases with the growth of
the U.S. population. Chart 3 shows total  welfare spending divided by the number
of persons in the lowest  income quarter of the population. This calculation
provides a  reasonably accurate picture of the level of welfare resources 
available relative to the pool of potential  recipients.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#4">4</A>  Chart 3 reveals a now-familiar
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Welfare spending per low-income person was nearly zero in
 1929 but shot up during the Great Depression, reaching a peak of  $1,419 per
low-income person (in 1993 dollars). After World War  II, spending fell to low
levels and remained relatively constant  until the start of the War on Poverty
in 1965. Between 1965 and  1975, spending exploded, growing from $789 per person
to $2,938  (both figures in 1993 dollars). Spending grew moderately during  the
Carter years, leveling off during the Reagan presidency and  then exploding
again during the Bush era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     By 1993, total welfare spending per low-income person  reached $5,023.
In constant dollars, this was three times higher than  the peak level in the
Great Depression.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><a href="welf_4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the same trends in per capita spending but  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  welfare spending figures to cash,
food, housing, and energy  aid. As in the <a href="welf_3.gif">previous chart</a>, welfare spending (in
this case cash,  food, housing, and energy) is divided by the number of persons
in  the lowest income quarter of the population. The chart clearly  rebuts the
claim that the growth in welfare spending has been limited  to medical programs.
The pattern is identical to that of the  previous charts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, welfare spending for the limited
basic  programs peaked during the Great Depression, remained  relatively low and
constant during the 1950s and 1960s, exploded upward  at the onset of the War on
Poverty, and remained in a nearly  vertical climb until the mid-1970s. Spending
leveled off during the  Reagan years and spiked sharply upward again in the late
1980s and  early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In constant dollars, cash, food, housing, and energy aid per  person
is nearly five times higher today than at the beginning of the  War on Poverty.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare Spending as a Share of GDP. </B>Another way to assess  the
growth in welfare spending is to measure the share of the  total economy which
is absorbed by welfare. Chart 5 shows total  federal, state, and local welfare
spending as a percentage of gross  domestic product. The data match the patterns
shown in Charts  1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     During the Great Depression, welfare spending rose to
around  4 percent of GDP, peaking at 4.8 percent in 1939. The growth  of
spending as a share of GDP was driven both by increases in  real spending and by
shrinkage in the size of the economy due to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Depression. It is also important
to note that most welfare  spending during the Depression was for work relief
programs, such as  the Civilian Conservation Corps, which bear little
resemblance  to most of today's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     After World War II, welfare spending fell to 0.5 percent of GDP.  It
rose to slightly over 1 percent in 1950 and remained at that  level through the
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     With the onset of the War on Poverty, a massive share of  the economy
was rapidly diverted to welfare programs.  Welfare spending rose to over 4
percent by the mid-1970s. During  the Reagan years, a slowdown in the growth of
spending, coupled  with a growing economy, led to slight declines in welfare as
a share  of GDP. By 1988, welfare spending was 3.75 percent of GDP.  The Bush
era quickly reversed this trend; by 1993, welfare  constituted 5.08 percent of
GDP, a new record level exceeding the  previous peak set during the Great
Depression.

<P><B>Comparing Welfare with Other Government Programs.

<P>
</P>
<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar  spent on
primary, secondary, and post-secondary education by all  levels of government.

and training programs cost $215 billion. An additional $227  billion

<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="welf_8.gif">Chart 8</a> also shows, the $5.4 trillion cost of the War on  Poverty nearly
equals the entire cost of the private-sector industrial  and business
infrastructure of the U.S.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">8</A>  For
$5.4 trillion one can  purchase every factory, all the manufacturing equipment,
and  every office building in the U.S. With the leftover funds, one could  go on

every power company, every hotel, and  every retail and wholesale store in the

</P>
<P>It is interesting to note the total cost of the many peripheral  programs
which often are ignored in calculating the cost of welfare  or the War on
Poverty. For example, the $172 billion spent on  urban and community development
is nearly enough to buy the  entire plant and equipment of every auto
manufacturer, every airline,  and every trucking company in the U.S. The $445
billion price tag  for job training and social services for low-income Americans
 would purchase all the steel plants, all the factories producing new 
industrial equipment, all the electronics manufacturing plants, and  all the
furniture plants in the U.S., as well as the whole U.S.  commer
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  cial maritime fleet. With the
$440 billion which the  government has spent in housing and energy aid, one
could purchase the  entire U.S. construction industry, all the hotels in the
U.S., and the  entire chemical industry.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Two Kinds of Poverty.</B> The growth of the welfare state has had  a
huge impact on U.S. society. In order to unravel its  effects, policymakers must
begin by understanding two separate  concepts: &quot;material poverty&quot; and &quot;behavioral
poverty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Material Poverty.</B> Material poverty means, in the simplest  sense,
having a family income below the official poverty income  threshold, which was
$14,763 for a family of four in 1993. To the  man on the street, to say someone
is poor implies that he is  malnourished, poorly clothed, and living in filthy,
dilapidated, and  overcrowded housing. In reality, there is little material
poverty in  the U.S. as the public generally understands the  term.<A

<P>Children living in poverty today, far from being  malnourished, actually
grow up to be one inch taller and ten pounds heavier  than the average child of
the same age in the general population in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  late 1950s.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#13">13</A>  The principal nutrition-related
problem facing  poor persons in the U.S. today is obesity, not hunger; the poor
have  a higher rate of obesity than do members of other  socioeconomic groups in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, poor Americans have more housing space and are  less likely to be
overcrowded than is the average citizen in  Western Europe.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#14">14</A>  Nearly all of America's poor live
in decent housing  that is reasonably well-maintained. In fact, nearly 40
percent of  the households defined as poor by the U.S. government actually  own
their own homes.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#15">15</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Behavioral Poverty.</B> Behavioral poverty, by contrast, refers to  a
breakdown in the values and conduct which lead to the  formation of healthy
families, stable personalities, and self-sufficiency.  Behavioral poverty
incorporates a cluster of severe social  pathologies, including eroded work
ethic and dependency, lack of  educational aspiration and achievement, inability
or unwillingness  to control one's children, increased single parenthood and 
illegitimacy, criminal activity, and drug and alcohol abuse. While  material
poverty may be rare in the United States, behavioral poverty  is abundant and
growing at an alarming pace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The core dilemma of the welfare state is that prolific spending  intended to
alleviate material poverty has led to a dramatic  increase in behavioral
poverty. In welfare, as in other government  policies, you get what you pay for.
The current welfare system heavily  subsidizes illegitimacy, divorce, and
non-work. The past 25  years have seen dramatic increases in all three
behaviors. The War  on Poverty may have raised the material standard of living
of a  few Americans, but it has done so at the cost of creating whole  com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  munities where traditional
two-parent families have  vanished, work is rare or nonexistent, and multiple
generations have  grown up dependent on government transfers. The disintegration
of  the family encouraged by the current welfare system has led in turn  to
other severe social problems, particularly a dramatic increase  in crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The anti-marriage and anti-work effects of welfare are simple  and profound.
The current welfare system may be conceptualized  best as a system that offers
each single mother with two children  a &quot;paycheck&quot; of combined
benefits worth an average of  between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the 
state.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#16">16</A>  The mother has a
contract with the government. She will continue to receive  her &quot;paycheck&quot;
as long as she fulfills two conditions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #1: She must not work.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #2: She must not marry an employed  male.</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#17">17
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the current welfare system provides heavy incentives  for individuals
to work less or leave the labor force entirely and  rely on the taxpayers for
support. Even worse, welfare has made  marriage economically irrational for most
low-income parents; it  has converted the low-income working husband from a 
necessary breadwinner into a net financial  handicap.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#18">18</A>  It has transformed marriage from
a legal institution designed to protect and  nurture children into an
institution that financially penalizes nearly  all low-income parents who enter
into it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare also engenders long-term inter-generational  dependence. Of the over
4.5 million families currently receiving  assistance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  through Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC),  well over half will remain dependent for over ten
years, many for  15 years or longer.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#19">19</A>
 Moreover, dependence passes between  generations; children raised in families
that receive welfare assistance  are three times more likely to be on welfare
than other children  when they become adults.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#20">20</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This inter-generational dependency is a clear indication that  the welfare
system is failing in its goal to lift the poor from poverty  to self-sufficiency
and is trapping many families in a repeating  cycle of debilitating and
self-destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare's Effect on Work</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of the welfare state has coincided with a decline  in labor force
attachment. In 1960, among the lowest income  quintile of the population, nearly
two-thirds of households were headed  by persons who worked.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#21">21</A>  By 1991, this figure had fallen
to  around one-third, and only 11 percent were headed by persons  who worked
full-time throughout the year.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#22">22</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of this decline in employment can be attributed to the  increasing
number of retired elderly households in this income group,  but an equally
important factor is the decline in labor force  participation among non-elderly
heads of households.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For a growing number of poor Americans, the existence of  generous welfare
programs makes not working a reasonable  alternative to long-term employment.
During the late 1960s and early  1970s, social scientists at the Office of
Economic Opportunity  (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to
examine the  effect 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  of welfare benefits on work
effort. The longest running and  most comprehensive of these experiments was
conducted between  1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver and became known as the 
Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or  &quot;SIME/DIME.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#23">23</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME  and similar
experiments conducted in other cities would prove  that generous welfare
benefits did not adversely affect work  effort. Instead, the SIME/DIME
experiment found that each $1.00 of  extra welfare given to low-income persons
reduced labor and  earnings by an average of $0.80.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#24">24</A>  The significant anti-work effects
 of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including  married women,
single mothers, and husbands. They were  particularly pronounced among young
unmarried males; the number of  hours worked per week declined 43 percent for
those who remained  unmarried throughout the experiment and 33 percent for those
 who married.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#25">25</A>  The results of
the SIME/DIME study apply directly  to existing welfare programs: Nearly all
have strong anti-work  effects like those studied in this experiment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of New York's Baruch  College, now
Director of the Congressional Budget Office,  confirms that higher welfare
benefits increase the number of  individuals who leave the labor force and
enroll in welfare. A 50 percent  increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit
levels was  found to lead to a 75 percent increase both in the number of women 
enrolling in AFDC and in the number of years spent on  AFDC.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#26">26</A>  In other words, increases in
benefit value cause a dramatic  expansion in welfare caseloads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An extremely important research discovery by O'Neill is that  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  AFDC benefits reduce the
employment of young adult men  even though few, if any, of these men benefit
directly from AFDC  payments. High AFDC benefits were found to reduce the 
employment of young adult men in a community by some 50 percent.  High benefit
levels apparently affect the work behavior of young men  in two ways. First,
they reduce the probability of marriage  and thereby reduce the necessity for a
young man to work to support  a family. Second, it is likely that many young
single men who  are boyfriends to single mothers on AFDC indirectly share in 
the mothers' welfare benefits; higher benefits thereby reduce  their need for
work.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#27">27</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Effects of Welfare on Family Structure</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The onset of the War on Poverty coincided with the  disintegration of the
low-income family  the black family in particular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the outset of World War II, the black illegitimate birth rate  was
slightly less than 19 percent. Between 1955 and 1965, it  rose slowly from 22
percent in 1955 to 28 percent in 1965.  Beginning in the late 1960s, however,
the rate of black illegitimate births  skyrocketed  reaching 49 percent in 1975
and 69 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If current trends continue, the black illegitimate birth rate  will reach 75
percent within ten years.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rapid increases in illegitimacy also are occurring among  low-income whites;
the illegitimate birth rate among white high  school dropouts is 48 percent.
Overall, 30 percent of American  children are born to single mothers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Across the nation, the welfare system has all but destroyed  family
structure in low-income communities. Welfare establishes  strong financial
disincentives which effectively block the formation  of intact two-parent
families. Suppose, for example, that a young  man has fathered a child out of
wedlock with his girlfriend. If  this young father abandons his responsibilities
to the mother and  child, government will step in and support the mother and
child  with welfare. If the mother has a second child out of wedlock, as  is
common, average combined benefits will reach around  $13,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the young man does what society believes  is morally
correct (marries the mother and takes a job to support  his family), government
policy takes the opposite course.  Welfare benefits are almost completely
eliminated, and if the young  father makes more than a modest salary, the
federal government  begins taking away his income through taxes. The federal
Welfare  Reform Act of 1988 permits the young father to marry the  mother and
join the family to receive welfare, but only as long as he  does not work. Once
he takes a full-time job to support his family,  welfare benefits are eliminated
and the father's earnings are subject  to taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single  parenthood have become
the conventional &quot;lifestyle option&quot; for raising  children in many
low-income communities. As <I>Washington  Post</I> reporter Leon Dash has shown
in his  book<I> When Children Want Children,</I> most unwed teen mothers
conceive and deliver  their babies deliberately rather than  accidentally.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#29">29</A>  While young women do not
necessarily bear unwanted children in order to  reap windfall profits from
welfare, they are very much aware of the  role 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  welfare will play in supporting
them once a child is born. Thus,  the availability of welfare plays an important
role in influencing  a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single  mothers
contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. Recent  research by Dr.
C.R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found  that half of the increases in
black illegitimacy in recent decades  could be attributed to the effects of
welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#30">30</A>  Research by  Mikhail
Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  shows that
childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by  6 percent in response to
a 10 percent increase in monthly  welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase
may be as high as 10  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#31">31</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another study of black Americans by Dr. Mark Fossett and Dr.  Jill Kiecolt
finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates  of marriage and greater
numbers of children living in  single-parent homes: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In general, in the Fossett study, an increase of roughly $100 in  the
average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found  to lead to a drop of
more than 15 percent in births within  wedlock among black women ages 20 to 24.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the  University of
Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200  per month in welfare benefits
per family causes the teenage  illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by
150  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#33">33</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dr. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  wide range of other variables
such as income, parental  education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50
percent increase in  the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits leads to
a 43  percent increase in out-of-wedlock births.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in  St. Louis shows
somewhat lower but still strong effects: An  increase in AFDC benefit levels of
$100 per child per month leads  to roughly a 30 percent increase in
out-of-wedlock births to  women age 19 and under.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, high benefits discourage single mothers from  remarrying.
Research by Dr. Robert Hutchens of Cornell University  shows that a 10 percent
increase in AFDC benefits in a state will cause  a decrease in the marriage rate
of all single mothers in the state by  8 percent.<A

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton, at the outset of his presidency, promised &quot;to  end
welfare as we know it.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Administration's  actions and
proposals on welfare contradict the President's  public statements. As recently
as April 1995, President Clinton  stated: &quot;[I]n 1992 I was elected to end
welfare as we know it. That  was part of my New Covenant of opportunity and
responsibility....  And I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform the
country  had ever seen.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#37">37</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Elsewhere, the President has said that &quot;You could not design  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  program that would be too tough
on work for  me.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#38">38</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the welfare reform bill the President submitted to  Congress had the
following characteristics:
<ul>
<P><li>Virtually no welfare recipient was required to work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>There were no time limits on welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Only 7 percent of the AFDC caseload was required to work  even by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Even the small number of recipients required to work were  required to do so
only for a few hours per week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>WORK (the name of the new work program) participants were  to be paid an
effective wage rate of $16.00 per hour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The bill limited useful work and the filling of government  job openings
with former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The minimum work requirements were wrongly targeted at  the mothers of
preschool children rather than the mothers of  children at school. (This
provision expanded the welfare system to  provide child care to these mothers of
young children.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The administrative cost alone for running each WORK person  was $4,000.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#39">39</A>
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President's plan, called the Work and Responsibility Act  of 1994,
turned out to be more public relations than reform; if  enacted, like so many
other welfare reform measures of the past,  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  would do nothing but forestall
serious systemic change  of America's welfare system. When the rhetoric is
removed,  the Clinton Administration plan represents little more than a 
continuing rapid expansion of the current destructive  system.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress passed a significant reform of  America's failed welfare
system based on three themes:
</P>
<P>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> the growth of illegitimacy;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Limiting</b> the elements of reform in the legislation.
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among the many elements of reform in the measure, seven  are crucial:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1) The bill ends the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC  spending, with
states that increase their welfare caseloads no longer  rewarded by an automatic
increase in federal funding. This  change imposes a fundamental fiscal
discipline at the state level that  is essential to real reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>2) The bill establishes a family cap. Mothers already enrolled  in AFDC will
not receive an automatic increase in federal benefits  if they give birth to an
additional child while on welfare.  (However, states will be permitted to enact
legislation to &quot;opt out&quot; of this  requirement.)
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states  which reduce
out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>4) The bill provides $75 million per year for a new block grant  for
abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill  establishes serious
work requirements for welfare recipients. Up to 40  percent of the AFDC caseload
will be required to work or become  self-sufficient by the year 2002. Unlike all
previous work  requirements in the AFDC program, those in this legislation are
real.  Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to 
perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a  &quot;pay
after performance&quot; rule. Recipients will not receive benefits  until the
required work has been performed satisfactorily. If they fail  to perform the
required hours of work, benefits will be reduced  pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>6) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of workfare is to  reduce
welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to  maximize the number of welfare
recipients in make-work public service  jobs. It recognizes that the best road
to self-sufficiency is to reduce  the number of persons who become dependent on
welfare in the  first place. Unlike President Clinton's plan, which rewards
states  for expanding welfare addiction, Congress for the first time focuses  on
rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who  get hooked on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>7) The bill establishes a firm time limit for receipt of  federal AFDC
funds; an individual may receive federal AFDC aid for  not more than five years.
States may exempt 15 percent of the  AFDC 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  caseload from this limit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President vetoed this welfare reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Relief for Families. </B>In tandem with comprehensive  welfare
reform, Members of Congress have recognized the need to  reward work, especially
among lower and middle-income  families<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>Congress thus enacted a $500-per-child tax credit in its  balanced budget
package. For the average family with two children, that is  a significant break,
as <a href="welf_t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
</B>The 104th Congress affirmed the continuing expansion of the EITC enacted in 
previous years, passing a budget which would have raised the basic  EITC rate
for a working family with two children from 36 percent  of earnings in 1995 to
40 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress correctly rescinded Clinton's 1993 expansion of  EITC coverage to
individuals who were not parents. Single persons  who work full-time at the
minimum wage automatically have  incomes above the poverty level; expanding the
EITC to include single  persons therefore was both expensive and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress did change the EITC formula for parents with  children so that the
value of the credit would phase down more quickly  as family earnings rose above
$18,000 per year. However, parents  in this income range also would be eligible
for the new  $500-per-child tax credit. Overall, under the congressional plan,
95  percent of parents with children would see their incomes rise. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed these changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rebuilding the Good Society.</B> The reform of America's  welfare system
should be animated by a broader social vision.  Candidates running for the
presidency and the Congress should be clear,  in this area, about what kind of
society they wish to see for  current and future generations of Americans. This
vision of the better  life should not be confined simply to the need to reform
public  assistance to low-income Americans. It extends to the broader  society.
The chief object of conservative social policy should be  nothing less than the
restoration and support of the traditional  two-parent family. The traditional
family is the foundation of American  society: the principal social institution
by which the work ethic,  self-discipline, intellectual motivation, and moral
character are  passed on to the next generation. When the family is weakened,
the  nation is weakened. (For a discussion of how to make specific changes  to
improve America's social order, see Chapter 6, &quot;Social  Breakdown.&quot;)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades the federal government has pursued policies  which promote the
collapse of the family. Vast changes are required in  a wide range of social and
welfare policies. These changes  should include reducing the government's
financial burden on  middle-class families with children; reforming welfare to
control costs  and require work; promoting policies to reduce illegitimacy  and
thereby improve the quality of life for America's children;  reforming divorce
law and strengthening marriage; and revitalizing  the institutions of civil
society.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The traditional family is the original department of health,  education, and
welfare. But for several decades the government has  pursued policies which
discourage marriage and make it difficult  for the traditional family to carry
out its functions. In 1950, the  median family of four paid just 3 percent of
its income to the  federal government in taxes. Today that figure has risen to
24  percent; when state and local taxes are thrown in, the total is even 
higher: 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Welfare to Require Work and Control Costs.</B> A  considerable
portion of those taxes supports a welfare system which,  with its huge costs and
harmful consequences, requires immediate  and drastic reform. Since most of the
funding for the current system  is provided at the federal level, it follows
that the basic structure  of reform should occur at the national level. Reform
should  promote individual responsibility by converting welfare from a  one-way
handout into a system in which recipients are expected to  contribute something
for temporary aid received. In addition, it must  be undergirded by firm
budgetary controls on the growth of  future spending. Welfare bureaucracies are
prolific in inventing new  programs which allegedly promote self-sufficiency but
 accomplish nothing or actually draw more people into dependence.  Without
definite limits on the amount of money flowing into this  system, such
counterproductive &quot;reforms&quot; are difficult to block.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the  War on
Poverty has been borne largely by the middle class,  especially parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when  they have married, have put off having
children, reducing the  number 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  of those they do raise.
Ironically, even as it discourages child  rearing by traditional middle-class
families, government  aggressively subsidizes child rearing by never-married
women who  generally are ill-prepared to act as parents. The results of this 
disastrous policy are all too apparent. Any government policy which  places
punitive and crippling financial burdens on traditional  two-parent families
while subsidizing illegitimacy is a recipe for eventual  social collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specific policies needed include the following: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The government must realize that healthy families are the  foundation of a
successful society; it must seek to strengthen marriage  as the crucial
institution in which future generations of  Americans will be raised. The most
obvious step it can take in this regard is  to reduce dramatically the current
crippling tax burden it places  on young working and middle-class parents with
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress  and vetoed by
President Clinton is only a first step. This tax  credit should be enacted now
and followed in the near future by  larger tax cuts for families with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cap the growth of welfare spending. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No matter how frequently policymakers supposedly end  welfare, the costs
continue to rise. Welfare absorbed around 1.5 percent  of GNP when Lyndon
Johnson launched the War on Poverty in  1965; it rose to over 5 percent by 1993.
With a $324 billion price  tag, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  welfare spending now amounts to
$8,300 for each poor person  in the U.S. Worse, Congressional Budget Office
figures show  total welfare costs rising to $500 billion, about 6 percent of
GNP,  by 1999. To the Clinton Administration, ending welfare has  meant spending
even more.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The long history of bogus welfare reforms, all of which  promised to save
money but did not, leads to one obvious conclusion:  The only way to limit the
growth of welfare spending is to do just  that: limit the growth of welfare
spending. The entitlement nature  of federal welfare programs which permits
unlimited  automatic spending increases should be repealed, and the future
growth  of federal means-tested welfare spending (excluding medical  programs)
should be limited to 3 percent per  annum.41  Most non-medical means-tested
programs should be folded into a single  welfare block grant to the states, with
funding permitted to increase  at 3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By slowing the outpouring from the federal welfare spigot,  this spending
cap would gradually reduce the subsidizing of  dysfunctional behavior:
dependency, non-work, and illegitimacy. It  would send a warning signal to state
welfare bureaucracies, most  of which, cushioned by a steady and increasing flow
of federal  funds, have found no reason to grapple with the tough and 
controversial policies needed to reduce illegitimacy and dependency. With a  cap
on future federal funds, state governments for the first time  would be forced
to adopt innovative and aggressive policies to reduce  the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish serious workfare. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although liberals often talk about requiring welfare recipients  to work,
existing welfare law makes it extremely difficult for  states to require this.
Similarly, the welfare &quot;reforms&quot; proposed by  President Clinton would
have made it impossible for states to  operate efficient work programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should establish serious work requirements for  able-bodied
recipients in federal welfare programs. The key to  successful workfare is the
number of welfare recipients who are required  to participate. Real reform would
require all fathers in the  AFDC-UP program to perform 40 hours of community
service work  per week. It also would require able-bodied single persons in the 
food stamp program to work. Finally, half of all single mothers  on AFDC should
be required to perform community service for  benefits by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a serious workfare program, recipients would be required  to look for
private-sector jobs. If a recipient cannot find a  private-sector job, he or she
should be required to perform  community service in exchange for welfare
benefits according to a &quot;pay  for performance&quot; rule. Under a &quot;pay
for performance&quot; system,  the recipient would not receive benefits until
the required work  had been performed satisfactorily; if the recipient failed to
perform  the required hours of work, welfare benefits would be reduced 
pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of serious workfare is to reduce welfare dependence  and caseloads,
not to maximize the number of recipients in  make-work public service jobs. A
properly designed system must be based  on an understanding that the most
important effect of any work  requirement is to separate recipients who truly
need assistance  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cause they cannot find employment
from those who do not but  are willing to take a free handout if it is offered.
Thus, a properly  designed workfare program has its greatest impact by 
dramatically shrinking the number of individuals who apply for welfare in  the
first place. Serious workfare recognizes that the best road to  self-sufficiency
is to reduce the number of persons who become  dependent and &quot;get hooked&quot;
on welfare initially.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish sensible workfare priorities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Workfare programs should be efficient and low cost.  Workfare should be
established first for those who have the least  justification for being out of
the labor force: able-bodied, non-elderly  single persons on welfare, followed
by fathers in two-parent families  on welfare and absent fathers who fail to pay
child  support.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#42">42</A>  After workfare
has been put in operation for the preceding groups,  single mothers on AFDC who
do not have pre-school children should  be required to work.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High day care expenses mean that putting a single mother with  a young child
to work in a community service program  costs roughly two to three times as much
as requiring a mother with  an older child to work. Because work programs
inevitably  operate within fixed budgets, an emphasis on workfare participation 
by mothers with younger children leads to a sharp reduction in  the total number
of persons who will be required to work. One  little-understood aspect of the
debate is that liberals often attempt  to focus workfare programs on mothers
with very young  children precisely because they understand this quickly soaks
up  available funds and thereby limits the number of recipients required to 
participate. Liberal welfare advocates also try to undermine the  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  eral concept of workfare by
claiming that all workfare  programs cost more than they save; they promote the
least  cost-effective programs (that is, those with a heavy emphasis on mothers 
with young children) precisely for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Around half of AFDC single mothers have no pre-school  children under age
five. Workfare should be imposed on single  mothers with children under age five
only after most mothers with  older children have been required to work.
However, if an  AFDC mother gave birth to another child after her enrollment in 
AFDC, that should not exempt her from work requirements even if  the child is
under age five. This rule is needed to prevent  mothers from having additional
children to escape the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Recognize the limits of job training. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A perennial panacea in the welfare debate is that education and  job
training will enable single mothers to obtain good jobs and  become
self-sufficient. Unfortunately, despite over three decades of  experience,
government-run training programs have failed to raise  the wage rates of welfare
recipients by more than a tiny amount.  For example, the U.S. Department of
Labor in 1993 completed a  controlled scientific evaluation of its massive Job
Training  Partnership Act (JTPA) program. This evaluation showed that the 
average hourly wage of female trainees was raised by 3.4 percent;  the hourly
wages of males were not increased at  all.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The failure of government training programs is especially  salient given the
very low cognitive ability levels of many welfare  mothers. A recent study by
Child Trends, Inc., finds that mothers in  the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program have  signifi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  cantly lower math and verbal
abilities than other women of  the same ethnic group who are not enrolled in
welfare  programs. When all U.S. women are ranked according to basic math and 
verbal skills, over half of welfare mothers are found to have  cognitive skill
levels placing them in the bottom 20 percent of the  overall population. The
study states: &quot;The average aptitude or  achievement scores of welfare
mothers are significantly below the  mean of even the lowest of the occupational
 classes.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>  Government can do
little if anything to alter these cognitive skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The very low cognitive abilities of welfare mothers, coupled  with the
impotence of government educational and training  programs and the cost of child
care, underscore the futility of  reform schemes aimed narrowly at making unwed
mothers employed  and self-sufficient. What is needed is more fundamental change
 aimed at reducing illegitimacy and restoring marriage. To repeat the  basic
historical lesson: Raising children is a difficult and  expensive task which
generally requires the efforts of the mother and  father bound by the commitment
of marriage. It is very difficult for  a single parent to find the time and
emotional resources needed  to raise a child while also working to support the
family. The  importance of marriage and the contribution of both parents is 
intensified in the case of parents with low personal skills and  earning
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The well-being of American children requires policy changes  that not only
will reduce illegitimacy and promote marriage, but  also will encourage
potential parents to defer child-bearing until  both the mother and the father
have acquired the education, job  skills, and personal maturity needed to
support a family and nurture  their children properly. Above all, it is
imperative to eliminate the  wide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  array of programs which subsidize
and encourage young,  poorly educated girls to have children out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Replace food stamps with commodities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major historic expansion of the welfare state occurred when  the food
stamp program replaced older aid programs which  distributed food commodities
directly to the poor. The current food  stamp program gives individuals food
coupons which they can use  to purchase food in stores. Unlike food commodities,
food  coupons can be sold on the black market and converted into cash. 
Replacing the older food commodities programs with food coupons was  a serious
mistake that further encouraged rapid increases in  welfare dependence and
illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should reverse this mistake. Families on AFDC and  other persons
receiving food stamps (excluding the elderly and  disabled) should be given a
carefully selected basket of food commodities  in lieu of food stamp coupons.
Each basket should be carefully  balanced to provide the proper levels of
proteins, calories,  vitamins, and minerals for the family or individual
receiving aid. This  policy can ensure that no family receiving aid will be
malnourished  or hungry. It also can be operated at a lower cost than the 
current program. Moreover, this policy would eliminate food stamp  fraud by
restricting the beneficiary's ability to sell food stamps on  the black market;
there would be little or no black market for the  donated commodities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More important, replacing food stamps with commodities  would reduce
dependence and out-of-wedlock births by reducing  the overall attractiveness of
welfare. Assuming that substituting  food 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  commodities for food stamps would
reduce the consumer  &quot;utility&quot; of food benefits by a third and the &quot;utility&quot;
of the overall  AFDC/food stamp benefit package by 15 percent, it also could 
reduce illegitimate births by more than 5 percent and the AFDC  caseload by over
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Limit cash benefits to young unmarried mothers. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It has been a tragic mistake for the government to pay money  to 14-year-old
girls on condition that they have children out of  wedlock. The government
should begin to address the  illegitimacy problem by ending its disastrous
policy of giving direct AFDC  and food stamp benefits to unmarried young
mothers. This almost  certainly would lead to a sharp and substantial drop in
illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's welfare system mainly involves failed attempts to pick  up the
pieces for an ever-increasing number of individuals who  have violated the above
rules. But from the perspective of society  and the child, to have a baby you
cannot support either financially  or psychologically is profoundly
irresponsible. Government  policy not only must stop subsidizing and promoting
such  irresponsible behavior, but must actively discourage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Serious welfare reform must focus on the root behavioral  problems of
illegitimacy and divorce, not merely on the superficial  symptom of welfare
dependence. Despite rhetoric pledging to &quot;end  welfare as we know it,&quot;
President Clinton is unwilling to take the  serious steps needed to deal with
the crisis of illegitimacy. The  Clinton Administration seeks to devise schemes
to help individuals  leave welfare rather than to reduce the self-destructive
behavior that  led to dependence in the first place. This approach is
self-deluding.  No 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  array of government programs is
going to make a  20-year-old woman who has had one or two children out of
wedlock  self-sufficient. Nor, despite her best efforts, is that single mother
likely  to be able to provide a truly healthy emotional environment for  her
children as they develop.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By paying young women to have children out of wedlock,  the present welfare
system encourages them in a course of action  that in the long term proves
self-defeating to the mothers and  harmful to both the children and society.
Placing millions of single  mothers in work and training programs will have
little positive effect  on society as long as the illegitimate birth rate
remains over 30  percent. Congress must go to the heart of the dependency
problem  by seeking to reduce the number of illegitimate births. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the same time, government should not abandon all aid to  children born
out of wedlock; federal AFDC and food stamp  funds currently given directly to
unwed mothers under age 21 should  be converted into block grants to the states.
State governments  could use the funds to develop innovative policies for
assisting  teenagers who continue to have children out of wedlock. Such policies
 could include providing in-kind benefits, promoting adoption and  orphanages,
or supporting the mothers in tightly supervised  group homes; but federal funds
should no longer be used to provide  direct cash welfare benefits to teen
mothers. The limitation on  benefits should apply to all children born to unwed
mothers age  21 and under one year or more after the date of enactment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Do not provide increased AFDC and food stamp benefits to  mothers who
bear additional children while already enrolled in  the AFDC program. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 --></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the current welfare system, if a mother enrolled in  AFDC bears
additional children, she receives an automatic increase  in AFDC and food stamp
benefits. No other family in America  receives an automatic increase in its
income by having more  children. There is no reason to provide expanded welfare
benefits  to single mothers who have additional illegitimate children  while
already dependent on welfare. A limitation of this sort already  has been put
into effect in the state of New Jersey by Democratic  Assemblyman Wayne Bryant.
Evidence from controlled  scientific experiments designed to determine its
effects show a 10  percent decrease in illegitimate births to mothers on AFDC as
a result  of the family cap.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#46">46
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the establishment of paternity for children  receiving AFDC. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current law requires that an AFDC mother make a &quot;good  faith&quot;
effort to identify the father of her child in order to receive  AFDC. This law
is ignored. The government should require, for  children born prospectively,
that the mother identify the father in order  to receive any federally funded
welfare aid.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#47">47</A>  Exceptions to this
 rule in a few hardship cases could be made, but they should not  exceed 10
percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's real  father with
absolute confidence. Once the mother has identified the  father and paternity
has been established, the father can be required  to pay child support to offset
welfare costs. If the father claims  he cannot pay any child support because he
cannot find a job,  the government may require that he perform community service
 to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  fulfill his obligation.
Experiments with this approach in  Wisconsin have led to surprising increases in
the ability of absent fathers  to locate private-sector employment and pay child
support.  Moreover, the definite expectation among young men that they will  be
identified and required to pay child support for their children  may put an end
to the ethos in some communities where young  men assert their masculinity by
fathering children they have no  intention of supporting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage state-based &quot;faith and families&quot; programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The &quot;faith and families&quot; program created by Mississippi  Governor
Kirk Fordice is one of the most innovative and interesting  welfare reforms in
the U.S. today. This program seeks to link single  mothers on AFDC with church
congregations throughout the state,  placing at least one welfare family under
the tutelage of each  church. The congregation effectively becomes the case
worker for the  welfare mother, providing mentoring, moral authority, life
skills  training, and contact with employment opportunities. The  recipient
continues to receive her welfare check from the government  bureaucracy, but
most other aspects of managing the case are  under church control. The program
also is voluntary in that any  recipient can choose to have her case handled by
welfare bureaucrats  rather than a church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Striking a theme which would have been common in earlier  generations but
has been painfully absent in American discourse  for over half a century,
Governor Fordice has declared that &quot;God,  not government, will be the
savior of welfare recipients.&quot;  This  new policy should be copied in other
states.

<P>
</P>
<P>There is widespread recognition that government welfare  has failed  indeed,
that government is the least effective institution  in aiding the poor. Yet,

Americans are spent on  government welfare programs in which the people no
longer have  confidence.

<P><B>Q. Why are conservative welfare reforms punishing single  parents and
their children?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Nothing punishes single parents and their children more  than the
current welfare system. For millions of children and their  parents, this system
is the proverbial free ticket to a bus going  nowhere. The reason: It is riddled
with perverse incentives that  discourage work and marriage while encouraging
illegitimate  birth and long-term dependency. Precisely because single-parent 
family life is much harder on the children, as well as their mothers and  the
broader society, it is no kindness for government to make  either single
parenthood or long-term dependency easier and more  common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the perverse incentives of the system, millions of  parents and their
children cannot escape to a better life, but will be  locked instead into more
of the same. It is a condition that not only  undermines their upward economic
mobility and eventual  independence, but also robs them of hope for the future
and reinforces  spiritual despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative welfare reform aims to discourage single  mothers from having
more children out of wedlock while helping  them through the transition to a
life in which it is economically  rational to marry or get a job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress want to cut welfare?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress are not proposing to cut  welfare.
Under the Republican proposals aggregate welfare spending  on non-medical
programs will grow at roughly 4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress generally oppose serious welfare reform  and, as
evidenced during the debate on school lunch programs, do  not even favor
reducing the rate of welfare spending. Total  welfare spending in the United
States is $324 billion, 72 percent of it  federal and 28 percent of it state
spending. Moreover, nine-tenths  of all state welfare spending amounts to a
state contribution to  federal programs. At the current rate of spending,
assuming nothing  is changed, the United States will be spending $500 billion on
 welfare by the year 1999, or 6 percent of the gross national  product (GNP). To
put this in perspective, at the current rate,  taxpayers will be shelling out $2
in welfare spending for every $1 we  now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives in Congress simply want to impose some  discipline on welfare
spending, just as they do in other areas of  federal spending. They are prepared
to let already high levels of  welfare spending grow, but only at some
reasonable rate, not at the  explosive rate at which it has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But didn't conservatives in Congress propose to cut  school lunch and
women, infants, and children (WIC) programs last year?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Congressional appropriators last year attempted to convert  the
federal school lunch and breakfast programs into a block  grant, which would
grow at 4.5 percent per year. Liberals  complained that the original baseline
for growth in the program was 5.1  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  cent, and thus that reducing the
growth in spending amounted to  a &quot;cut.&quot;  It is patently dishonest to
call a growth in spending a  cut, but even with this modest change, Congress
still would be  wasting federal funds by providing school lunch subsidies to 
middle-class families and even to the children of millionaires instead of 
targeting them exclusively to poor children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As for WIC, it was not cut. It was folded into a block grant with  a few
other programs. The money available for WIC, like the  money available for
school lunches, was to increase. Incredibly, under  the traditional WIC program,
benefits were available to families  earning up to $28,000 per year even though
a family in that  income range pays about $6,000 per year in federal taxes. 
Conservative policy for middle-income families is not to give them welfare 
benefits, but to cut their taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't spending reductions in existing federal welfare  programs and
block grants jeopardize poor families? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Few, if any, welfare programs have operated as expected,  so poor
families have not benefited as expected. The largest  federal program, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),  was designed in 1935 to support widows
and orphans. Only 1.5  percent of the beneficiaries today are widows and
orphans. Instead,  AFDC has served as the financial mainstay of single
parenthood  among low-income persons. Likewise, there are nine different federal
 jobs and training programs for low-income persons, costing an  estimated $5.3
billion.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#48">48</A>  After three decades of
federal job  training programs, the wage rates of beneficiaries have hardly been
 affected. A Labor Department study of the impact of the Job  Training
Partnership Act, for example, showed that female  trainees' 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  wages increased by a mere 3.4
percent and that male  trainees' wages did not increase at all. Five recent
scientific studies of  federal jobs programs for poor people showed that none of
 them worked. Few federal jobs programs ever lead to real,  permanent jobs in
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By combining dozens of federal welfare programs into  block grants to the
states, eliminating tens of thousands of pages of  federal regulations, and
letting governors and state legislators  take direct responsibility and do what
they think is best for their  communities, welfare reform can serve low-income
people more  efficiently. States and local communities, working with  dedicated
people in private organizations in these communities, are likely  to have the
best ideas about what works in preventing teen  pregnancy or in setting up day
care and jobs programs to help lift poor  people out of poverty and dependency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives want to lift low-income families out of  poverty,
how do they propose to help them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to keep a mother and her children out of  poverty is
to help make sure they have a working father with a regular  paycheck who comes
home every night. Right now, if a young  man marries the mother of his child and
makes anything over $6.50  per hour, we tax his  income. For persons currently
on welfare,  this does not encourage either marriage or upward economic
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But by making serious tax changes, particularly by giving  low-income
families generous tax relief, a conservative social  policy would reward work,
increase disposable family income, and  help keep families together. Under
Representative Dick Armey's  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  posal to replace the current tax
code with a flat tax, for  example, any family of four with an income of $33,000
per year or  less would pay no income tax at all.49  Moreover, by eliminating 
outdated penalties on savings and investment, conservative tax  policies would
stimulate more investment and economic growth,  and thus create more real jobs,
open up new opportunities, and  generate higher wages for family breadwinners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives in Congress want to help low-income  working
families, why didn't they support President Clinton's family  tax relief
proposal rather than pass a balanced budget plan that  would gut the popular
Earned Income Tax Credit and raise taxes on  families earning less than $30,000?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Even after changing the Earned Income Tax Credit, the  Balanced
Budget Act of 1995, with its $500-per-child tax  credit, would benefit 5.4
million more low-income working families  with children than the Clinton
Administration tax proposal with  its $300-per-child tax credit. In fact, the
congressional proposal,  vetoed by President Clinton, would allow a low-income
family  to take a $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the  full
value of the EITC on top of the child credit. Under the  Clinton plan, a
low-income family would have to deduct EITC  benefits from income tax before
taking the less generous $300-per-child  tax credit. Thus, a family with two
children would have to  earn $24,000 a year before becoming eligible for the
Clinton  credit. Worse, because the Clinton tax credit is available only to 
families with children under the age of 13, families are denied tax relief  for
children precisely when the cost of raising them becomes  even more expensive.
Under the Clinton tax credit plan, 2.8  million children in families earning
less than $30,000 per year would  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  denied eligibility for tax
relief. Under the congressional plan,  a family would be eligible for a more
generous tax credit at  roughly $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What steps can the government take to reduce illegitimacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> First, unlike age, disability, or veterans status,  illegitimacy
should not be the basis of a legal entitlement to a  government check. Unwed
mothers can and should be assisted in other  ways, including the establishment
of group homes for unwed mothers  or maternity homes. Young men and women may be
entitled to  a mistake, but taxpayers cannot afford to subsidize further 
mistakes through automatic increases in benefits to women who continue  to have
additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, sexual abstinence programs should be incorporated  into welfare
reform measures, particularly at the state level. The  data show that such
programs work,<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#50">50</A> much as the Just
Say No  campaigns against illegal drugs in the 1980s worked. Teenagers are  not
stupid. They can see the difference between a young man's  lifelong commitment
to the mother and their baby and the  momentary enjoyment of sexual pleasure
with life-changing consequences  and without the commitment of marriage. All the
proposals to  make marriage more attractive also help to reduce illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Third, it is time to get serious about cracking down on  statutory rape. In
a significant percentage of illegitimacy cases, the  mother is well below the
age of consent and the father is in his  mid-twenties. It is past time that such
adult males, taking advantage of  teenage girls, face charges of rape.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Fourth, toughen child support enforcement. Policymakers  should inflict
financial pain on men who sire children and then  abandon the mothers. Men
should be made to take responsibility for  the upbringing of their children.
Tough enforcement of child  support also helps get the message across that the
costs of  illegitimacy must be borne by the father as much as by the child and
mother.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But don't congressional conservatives want to consign  poor children
to orphanages?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> For neglected, unwanted, or physically or sexually abused 
children, state or local authorities might determine that an  orphanage is not
an unreasonable solution. In some cases, it is the only  viable option. And,
regardless of the negative images conjured up by  liberal opponents, sound
policy should include this possibility.  While Hillary Rodham Clinton ridiculed
the concept as &quot;absurd,&quot;  under persistent questioning from
Representative Bill Archer of  Texas, Chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, HHS  Secretary Donna Shalala admitted that even under the Clinton 
Administration welfare plan, orphanages would be an option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't conservatives expecting too much of private  charities when
the government cuts back on the spending increases in  social services? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. First, under real welfare reform, with new 
incentives to work and get off the welfare rolls, there will be a drop in  the
welfare rolls even as there is a simultaneous increase in total  welfare
spending. In other words, there will be more money,  rather than less, for those
in need. Second, under the congressional  block grant approach, state and local
governments will work  directly 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  with local charitable
organizations, not only to provide social  services, but also to help poor
people become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After decades of painful experience, Congress and the federal  bureaucracy
must admit that neither they nor the programs they  have designed over the past
half century have been effective in  reducing the welfare rolls, curbing
illegitimacy, or making  low-income Americans economically independent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beyond the promise of welfare reform, Congress can assist  private charities
even more directly in helping the poor. Senator  Daniel Coats (R-IN), for
example, has introduced a bill that would allow  a tax credit of as much as
$1,000 for donations to charities that  directly help the needy poor. This will
increase the ability of  charities to help these people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't conservative cuts in social programs increase the  number of
hungry children?  HHS says that over 1 million people will  be thrown into
poverty. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The HHS study is flawed. It assumes that the conservative 
congressional reforms, just like the several previous  and  notoriously
unsuccessful  liberal attempts to &quot;end welfare as we know  it,&quot; will
fail and that welfare rolls will continue to increase at about  3 percent per
annum. But there are dramatic differences, both in  assumptions and in policies,
between liberal and conservative  welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past, liberals have attempted to make the welfare  system work. For
the future, conservatives want to make welfare  recipients work. Conservative
policies can assume a decrease in the  wel
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  fare rolls precisely because they
introduce serious work  requirements into welfare reform. For example, in
dealing with  married AFDC families, states that have introduced serious work 
requirements for welfare recipients have registered significant drops  in the
welfare rolls ranging from 50 to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In speaking of the HHS study, American Enterprise Institute  Senior Fellow
Ben J. Wattenberg remarked that &quot;The assumptions  of these studies
strangely do not take into account the very purpose  of the bill  to encourage
young people to have children after  marriage, not before, thus sharply
improving children's economic  circumstances. Studies that assume welfare reform
will not work  are the work of those who believe that welfare reform will not 
work. Hence, the studies are useless and  misleading.&quot;<A

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES 
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On October 15, 1995, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD),  was mugged outside
her home in Baltimore. Robert Eugene  Perlie, charged with the crime, was on
probation for possession of  cocaine and resisting arrest. He also had been
convicted in the past  for other drug offenses, as well as for theft and
insurance fraud.  Moreover, at the time of the inceident, Perlie was scheduled
for  four separate trials on charges of illegal transportion of a handgun, 
violation of probation, drug possession, and malicious destruction  and theft.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#1">1</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Mikulski mugging represents in microcosm both the  problem and the
politics of crime in America: A relatively small,  hard-core group of repeat
offenders commit most crimes, especially  violent crimes. Federal lawmakers talk
about &quot;getting tough on crime&quot;  and then pass laws that affect only
the tiny minority of  hard-core criminals that come under federal jurisdiction,
leaving the  vast majority unaffected. Press releases tout federal efforts, 
even though career criminals remain on the streets. The public  becomes more
cynical and more alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should explain the short-term solution  to America's
crime problem: putting repeat offenders behind  bars 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  and keeping them there. This is
not the whole solution, but it is  the essential first step in ridding America
of the menace of  violent crime. And the evidence shows that it works. This
means,  however, that federal lawmakers must stop posturing for the  cameras and
recognize that, because most violent street crime is under  the jurisdiction of
state and local governments, most of the changes  in policy need to be made at
the state and local levels. The  President and Congress should review all
current federal laws,  determine which impinge upon or undermine the authority
of state and  local law enforcement, and repeal them.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#2">2</A>  The President and  Congress can and
should provide leadership and policy assistance, but  the real solution to the
problem of street crime lies at the state  and local levels.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the long term, lawmakers at all levels must recognize that  the real
reason for America's decades-long crime wave is not  poverty, as some have
believed. Nor is it race, as others have intimated. It  is family breakdown.
Nothing could be clearer from the social  research than that fatherless children
 from whatever  socioeconomic or racial background  are the most likely to
commit  violent crimes as teenagers and adults. The rising rate of  illegitimacy
means that teenage crime also will continue to rise. This  point must be driven
home, repeatedly, and long-range economic  and social policies that encourage
the formation of stable,  two-parent families must be developed. At the same
time, Americans  must face the fact that some existing government policies 
encourage illegitimacy and family breakup. To curb crime, these  anti-family
policies must be ended.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public awareness and state and local efforts already are  affecting the
crime rate, which is dropping in many states and  localities. According to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's 
<I>Uniform Crime Reporting</I> figures, there was a 1 percent decrease in  &quot;serious
crime,&quot; a measure of violent crime and property crime, reported  by law
enforcement agencies for the first six months of  1995.3  It is important to
realize that the recent decline is a reduction from  a huge statistical base,
and that much violent crime is not even  reported to law enforcement agencies.
That is why America's  crime rates are still unacceptably high. For example,
according to  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a crime occurs every 2 
seconds:<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#4">4</A>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While crime rates have declined somewhat this past year, they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  still very high compared with
1960. In 1960, there were 160  violent crimes for every 100,000 Americans; by
1994, there were  715 for every 100,000 Americans, down slightly from 1993. 
Overall, there were 23,310 murders, 102,100 rapes, 618,820 robberies,  and
1,119,950 aggravated assaults in 1994. Since 1990, violent  and property crime
have declined by 2.2 percent and 8.5 percent  respectively, per 100,000
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While still devastating in its impact on American society, the  recent
downturn is both welcome and, according to John  DiIulio, Professor of Politics
and Public Affairs at Princeton  University, &quot;can be explained in part by
policy-driven law enforcement  efforts that capitalize on community
crime-fighting initiatives and  take the bad guys off the streets.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives therefore should welcome the debate over  crime. Liberals, on
the other hand, continue to look to social programs  to reduce crime even though
these programs have proved  ineffective. The fact is that recent success in
reducing crime is largely  attributable to conservative policies which emphasize
tougher and  more effective law enforcement and incarceration of violent 
criminals. Crime is still a politically powerful issue throughout the  nation,
and in few areas are the political lines clearer. The  American people have had
enough; they are demanding tough,  sweeping changes that will slash the crime
rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The effectiveness of good police work and extended  incarceration of
hardened criminals is beyond dispute. Crime rates would  drop even more
dramatically if more state and local officials  initiated tougher and more
effective law enforcement on America's  streets, as Professor DiIulio suggests,
and made violent criminals  serve 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  longer prison terms. Examples:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Jacksonville, Florida. State Attorney Harry L. Shorenstein  beefed up his
prosecutorial team in 1992, got tough with dangerous  juvenile offenders, and
started to prosecute them as adults and  send them to prison. The result: By
1994, Shorenstein's program  had sent hundreds of juveniles to jail. With fewer
young criminals  on the streets, arrests of juveniles declined 30 percent, and
the  number of juveniles arrested for weapons offenses fell by 41  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Houston, Texas.</B> Police Chief Sam Nuchia started a &quot;citizens
 patrol program&quot; to beef up the city's increased police presence. The 
result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal  activities to
the police, arrests have increased, and police response  to emergencies has
improved, increasing the productivity of the  police and the safety of Houston's
citizens.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#7">7</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Oxnard, California.</B> By using sophisticated crime analysis and  an
advanced gang-tracking computer data base, and by using  a telemarketing
computer system to issue crime alerts to residents  in high-crime areas, police
have helped to reduce violent crime by  38 percent, including a 60 percent drop
in the murder rate.  Oxnard has reduced crime to its lowest level since the 
1960s.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>New York City, New York.</B> Taking over the police department  in
January 1994, Commissioner William J. Bratton declared a  real war on crime,
promising in Churchillian fashion to &quot;fight for  every house in the city;
we will fight for every street; we will fight  for every block. And we will win.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">9</A>  Bratton took command of  the city's
demoralized 38,000-member police force, held the 76  precinct police commanders
directly accountable for their  perfor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  mance in decreasing the crime rate
in their precincts,  computerized the precinct data system to track the crime
problem daily, and  dismissed high-level police officials who failed to get in
tune with  his tough new program.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#10">10</A>
 In 1994, while major felonies  nationwide fell by 2 percent, in New York City
they fell by 12 percent. In  the first nine months of 1995, they fell another 18
 percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#11">11</A>  Over the past two
years, declines in most major felonies, including an  almost 40 percent drop in
murder, have been dramatic.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>But first-rate police work should be combined with a serious  sentencing
policy for violent criminals. According to  Professor DiIulio, &quot;Not
surprisingly, therefore, studies show that from  1980 to 1992 the 10 states
where incarceration increased the most  saw violent crime decrease by 8 percent.
In the 10 states with the  lowest increases, violent crime soared 51  percent.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#12">12</A>  If more state and local officials
pursued such policies, more of America's streets  and homes would be much safer
places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should encourage such efforts at  every opportunity,
and not just because it will do well at the polls.  While recent reductions in
crime rates are encouraging, the  statistical base of violence upon which those
rates are calculated from  year to year is huge. The tidal wave of crime, which
began in the  1960s, continues to roll across America. During the 1960s alone, 
crime rates more than doubled (see Tables <a href="crime_t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="crime_t2.gif">2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's violent crime rate soared 47 percent from 1975 to  1994, rising
from 487.8 to 716.0 per 100,000  inhabitants.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#13">13</A>(see <a href="crime_1.gif">Chart 1</a>)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan  commission
chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Heritage Foundation Distinguished
Fellow William J.  Bennett, over 400,000 Americans have been murdered since 1977
  almost seven times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam  War.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#14">14</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The FBI's crime index rate, which includes the violent crimes  of murder and
non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape,  robbery, and aggravated assault and
the property crimes of burglary,  larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson,
rose 1.4 percent  (5,298 per 100,000 inhabitants to 5,374 per 100,000
inhabitants)  from 1975 to 1994.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#15">15</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From 1985 to 1994, violent crimes rose 28.6 percent;  property crime, 0.2
percent; murder, 13.9 percent; rape, 5.7 percent;  robbery, 14.0 percent; and
aggravated assault, 42.0 percent.  However, as state and local communities
continued their efforts to  combat crime through tougher truth-in-sentencing
laws in 1993 and  1994, the overall crime rate decreased. The FBI crime index
fell 2.0  percent. Violent crime was down 4.1 percent; property crimes,  1.7
percent; murder, 5.3 percent; rape, 4.6 percent; robbery, 7.1  percent; and
aggravated assault, 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Juvenile Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most ominously, if the present disintegration of family and  social life
continues, Americans will see an unprecedented  acceleration of the already
horrendous levels of juvenile criminal  violence. Current data trends clearly
indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Violent crime among juveniles has soared by about 300  percent since 1965.
From 1981 to 1990, juvenile arrests for murder  increased by 60 percent, while
adult arrests increased by just  5.2 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  percent. In 1990, juveniles
committed more than a third of all  murders in the country.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#16">16</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sharp rise in juvenile crime presents a formidable  challenge for future
law enforcement. (see <a href="crime_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). There has been a  staggering increase in
juvenile arrest rates (see <a href="crime_t3.gif">Table 3</a>), as well as  in the number of arrests for
such heinous crimes as murder (see <a href="crime_t4.gif">Table 4</a>). From 1985 to 1993, the number of
juveniles aged 13 and  14 arrested for murder increased 162 percent. The murder
arrest  rate increased 207 percent for 15-year-olds, 197 percent for 
16-year-olds, 146 percent for 17-year-olds and 119 percent for  juveniles aged
18 to 20.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#17">17</A>  The numbers of
juveniles involved in  aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies also are rising
dramatically. If  trends continue, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation,  arrest rates for violent juvenile crime will double by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Relationship Between Crime and Family Breakdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The insufficiency or absence of government social programs  does not fuel
violent crime. The social science literature is  conclusive on one all-important
point: The real root cause of violent crime  is the breakdown of family and
community, especially in  America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The professional literature shows that the failure of fathers  and mothers
to care for the children they bring into the world is at  the heart of violent
crime. Absent fathers, absent mothers,  parental fighting and domestic violence,
lack of parental supervision  and discipline of children, patterns of parental
abuse, neglect or  rejection of the child, and criminality among the parents

<P><B>Race and Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While serious crime is highest in socially disorganized,  largely urban
neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function  of race. The
determining factor is the absence of marriage.  Among broken families, with
their chaotic, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;  relationships, whether white or black,
the crime rate is very high; among  married, two-parent families, whether white
or black, the crime rate  is very low. The capacity and determination to
maintain stable  married relationships, not race, is the pivotal  factor.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#19">19</A>  The chaotic, broken community
stems from these chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an
important factor in crime is the  prevalence of wide differences in marriage
rates among ethnic  groups. A report from the state of Wisconsin further
illustrates this.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1980 and 1993, according to the latest available data,  the number
of black inmates rose from 46.5 percent to 50.8 percent  of the total prison
population, from 140,600 to 445,400. Justice  Department findings show that, at
the end of 1993, blacks were  seven times more likely than whites to have been
incarcerated in a  state or federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per
100,000  black residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were 
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31,  1993.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#20">20</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The fact that crime rates are much higher for blacks than  whites has
tempted some to cite race as a factor in overall crime. It  is therefore
important for candidates to explain that the  evidence does not support this
view. When social scientists control for  fam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ily structure, the rates for
blacks and whites are not  significantly different. Broken families are most
closely correlated with  violent crime, regardless of race. In other words,
family structure,  not race, is the leading indicator of criminal behavior.
There is  a higher rate of crime among blacks only because black  communities
have higher rates of illegitimacy and family breakup.

injustice sent fewer criminals to prison for shorter terms. The  number of
offenders imprisoned for every 1,000 violent crime  arrests plummeted by almost
50 percent, from 299 in 1960 to 170  in 1970.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#31">31</A>  Tougher law-enforcement policies
began to return in  the 1970s, and the crime rate slowed as the rate of

policies were adopted.

increasing by 219  percent. In 1980, there were 329,821 federal and state
prisoners; by  1990, there were 773,919. By 1994, the total number of people

<P>Liberals in Congress and elsewhere often bemoan the fact  that there are
more than 5 million persons in the United States  under &quot;correctional
supervision.&quot;  While it is true that the U.S.  prison population is at an
all-time high, however, most of those  incarcerated are violent criminals or
repeat offenders. Moreover,  while approximately 1 million persons are
imprisoned, an  overwhelming majority of convicts  another 3.5 million, or 72
percent  are  not in prison, but on probation or parole,<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#33">33</A> and the disparity  between the
rate of imprisonment and the rate of release on probation  or parole has been
growing in recent years. Between 1980 and  1994, while the prison population
increased by 184 percent, the  parole and probation population increased by 204 
percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A large proportion of America's crime problem derives from  the fact that so
many criminals, including violent and repeat  offenders, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  are out on the streets. According
to Professor DiIulio, nearly  one-third of parolees imprisoned for violent
crimes, and nearly  one-fifth of those imprisoned for a crime against property,
are  re-arrested within three years of their release for committing a  violent
crime. Among convicted felons on probation alone, 54 percent  are arrested once,
24 percent are arrested twice, and 22 percent  are arrested three or more times.
<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#35">35</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data from the bipartisan Council on Crime in America show  that &quot;On any
given day, seven offenders are on the street for  every three who are behind
bars. During 1994 about 4.2 million  cases were handled on probation and 1.1
million were processed on  parole. On any given day, there are about 1.5 times
more  convicted violent offenders out on the streets on probation or parole 
than behind bars.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#36">36</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and federal and state policymakers  should encourage
innovative leaders at the state and local levels,  like Governor George Allen of
Virginia, who are stopping the abuse  of probation and parole and eliminating
these options for violent  offenders. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#37">37</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One major flaw in current criminal justice policies is the degree  to which
convicted criminals are sentenced to probation with  no prison time at all, or
to jail terms of one year or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that, in 1990, state  courts (where
95 percent of crimes are prosecuted) sentenced 29  percent of all criminal
offenders to probation without incarceration.  Another 25 percent were sentenced
to jail terms of one year or  less. Thus, over half (54 percent) of criminals
convicted in state  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  received either no incarceration
or sentences of less than one  year in jail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For violent offenses, 20 percent of convicted criminals  received probation
with no incarceration, while 21 percent received  jail terms of less than one
year, leaving 41 percent of all  convicted violent offenders in these two
categories. Even for the crime  of murder, 5 percent of convicted criminals
somehow received  only probation, and 4 percent received one year or less in 
jail<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#38">.38</A> For the crime of rape, 14
percent received probation, and 19 percent  were imprisoned for one year or
less, leaving one-third of  convicted rapists with little or no serious
incarceration (see <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table 5</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While on probation, hard-core repeat offenders continue to  commit crimes.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 43  percent of those on
probation between 1986 and 1989 were arrested  at least once on felony charges
within three years of being placed  on probation. During that same period, 46
percent had been  committed to prison or jail or had disappeared, skipping out
on their  probation.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#39">39</A>  Of those
receiving probation for murder, 5 percent  were re-arrested for murder, and 16
percent were re-arrested for  some felony within three years.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to another Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, 35  percent of
state prison inmates in 1991 were convicted of a new  offense committed while
they were on probation or parole.  Probation and parole violators comprised 30
percent of all offenders in  state prisons for a violent crime, 56 percent of
inmates incarcerated  for property offenses, 41 percent of those convicted of
drug  offenses, and 85 percent of those in prison for public-order offenses. 
Collectively, probation and parole violators committed 90,639  violent 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  crimes while being supervised
within the community (based  on reported convictions).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More than 25 percent of probation and parole violators were  in prison for a
violent crime. Fifty-five percent of probationers  and parolees reported that,
in the month before their current  offense, they were using drugs. An estimated
41 percent were using  drugs daily. Of probation and parolee violators
imprisoned for a  new offense, 21 percent reported using a firearm while under 
supervision. Of those possessing a firearm in the month prior to  arrest, almost
75 percent were armed when they committed their  current offense. Between 1975
and 1991, the number of parolee and  release violators entering state prisons
increased from 18,000  to 142,000  twice the rate of growth among offenders
newly  committed from the courts.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#41">41</A>

<P><B>How Light Prison Sentences and Parole Lead to Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that criminals generally serve only a  fraction of their
sentences, even as sentences themselves are often  too short. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of parole and early release programs, sentences  handed down by
state courts do not indicate time actually served. <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table  5</a> shows the estimated
average time that will be served under  sentences imposed in state courts in
1990, given past trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data collected from the states by the Bureau of Justice  Statistics indicate
that for violent crimes, the average time served is  three years and seven
months (43 months) or 48 percent of the  original sentence (89 months). For
murder, the average is only five  years 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  and 11 months (71 months) or 48
percent of the original  sentence (149 months); for robbery, three years and
eight months  (44 months) or 46 percent of the original sentence (95 months);
and  for rape, five years and five months (65 months) or 56 percent of  the
original sentence (117 months).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#42">42</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These short prison terms for violent repeat offenders do more  than trigger
a sense of injustice among victims. They also mean  more crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1985, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that  approximately 28
percent of all male convicts, and 46 percent of recidivist  convicts, still
would have been in prison for their first crimes at  the time of their admission
to prison for a second crime if, instead  of being paroled, they had been given
sentences in the  maximum range for their original convictions. These
percentages would  be substantially higher for those who committed another crime
 within their original sentence than they would be for those  apprehended,
prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned during that  time.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In another study released in 1987, the BJS estimated that 69  percent of
parolees 17 to 22 years old were re-arrested within  six years of their release
and that about 29 percent of new  arrest charges occurred before these parolees'
original sentences  would have ended.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#44">44</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the bipartisan Council on Crime in America,  &quot;In 1991, 45
percent of state prisoners were persons, who, at the  very time they committed
their latest crimes, were on probabtion  or parole. While free in the community,
they committed at  least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders
and11,600  rapes

</P>
<P><B>Federal Courts Still Gutting Truth in Sentencing Laws</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recognizing the tendency of early-release prisoners to  commit crimes, more
and more states are adopting &quot;truth in  sentencing&quot; laws to keep
criminals incarcerated for as much of the full  sentence as possible. Under the
most common formulation, a  criminal convicted of a violent crime is required to
serve at least 85  percent of the full sentence. This is perhaps the most
effective  judicial remedy for violent crime devised so far, because it
eliminates  probation and parole for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, liberal jurists, apparently more concerned with  protecting
the rights of prisoners than with protecting the rights  of law-abiding citizens
victimized by violent crime, are trying to  gut these laws. This is particularly
true of federal judges who, to  relieve prison overcrowding, often order that
even violent  criminals be released back to the streets. Few states and
localities can  avoid this federal intervention: Some 39 states and 300 of the 
nation's largest jails operate under some form of federal court  direction.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#46">46</A>  The 1994 crime bill inadequately
addressed the issue, and  the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ostensibly to eliminate &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of 
prisoners have been released onto the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot;  has
never been defined, so each judge is free to determine it on a  subjective
basis. Far from the popular image of groups of  prisoners crammed into single
cells, it has come to mean, as arbitrarily  defined by several judges, simply
more than one prisoner to a  cell. Some federal judges even refuse to allow
convicted felons to  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  sent to prison, citing &quot;overcrowding,&quot;
and just release them   even violent criminals and repeat offenders. These
released felons  have been responsible for tens of thousands of additional
violent  crimes. For example:

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dramatic performance of the New York City Police  Department in
combating violent crime and the innovative  community policing methods employed
in Houston, Texas, provide  ample models for effective police management.
Unfortunately,  however, a few men and women who should represent the best in

accounts from around the nation detailing alleged police  brutality, corruption,
and incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the recruiting and staffing of state and local police forces is  done to
select the best in terms of professional competence,  personal courage, and
moral character, the value to society is beyond  calculation. When Americans are
threatened by violent criminals,  they want the very bravest and the very best
to rescue them and  their loved ones. They want police officers capable of
excellent  judgment, as well as physical courage, who can make  split-second,
life-and-death decisions without violating the parameters set  forth by the U.S.
Constitution. Moreover, they want police officers  and detectives who are
shrewd, intellectually capable of cracking  the most difficult cases, and able
to work with the prosecution team  to advance the best case against criminal
defendants in court.

<P>
</P>
<P>The most egregious failures in police effectiveness invariably  have been
failures of personnel management: the deliberate  imposition of lower
intellectual and physical standards in recruitment  and hiring, reduced
background screening, the substitution of  &quot;politically correct&quot;
racial or ethnic or gender &quot;diversity&quot; for strict  standards of
competence or merit, poor supervision of officers in  the field, and a lack of

economic damage in loss of funds and property.  They also experience pain,
suffering, cruelty, temporary or  permanent physical impairments and even loss
of life. Potential victims  suffer fear, inconvenience, and loss of freedom and
pay an economic  cost for extra locks, bars, guns, and other equipment in trying
to  avoid crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime also imposes huge costs on neighborhoods and  communities.
Neighborhood businesses lose sales when customers  fear crime while shopping.
Neighborhood workers lose jobs when  businesses and investors are scared away by
fear of crime.  Children lose the opportunity to learn when their schools are
dominated  by gangs and drug dealers who make it impossible to maintain  a
learning environment. Governments lose tax revenue when  sales, businesses,
jobs, and property values decline in crime-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several studies have attempted to quantify these costs:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, crime victims  in 1992 lost
$17.6 billion in direct costs. These direct costs  include items such as losses
from cash, property theft or damage,  direct medical costs, or lost income from
loss of time at work. It does  not include indirect costs, including the costs
of long-term health  problems, higher insurance premiums resulting from changed 
health status, or the pain and suffering, the non-economic damage,  that
afflicts victims of violent crime, which would make the  economic costs of crime
signifcantly higher.

<P>One consequence of the disproportionate incidence of  crime against black
Americans is that black and other minority  neighborhoods face greater losses in
economic opportunity and growth  as small entrepreneurs are crippled and jobs
are destroyed. With  their schools so often undermined by crime, black and other
 minority children are often denied the basic educational opportunities  enjoyed
by white children in equivalent neighborhoods. Crime  and its associated costs
constitute a high extra tax on businesses  and households in low-income minority
communities. As discussed  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Chapter 6, poverty is not the
root cause of crime in these  neighborhoods; crime is a root cause of poverty.
Until crime is  drastically reduced in America's inner cities and low-income and
 minority communities, social programs or other efforts to revive their 
economic fortunes cannot succeed.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While state and local officials have primary responsibility  for combatting
crime, there has been a noticeable weakening of  federal enforcement in areas
directly under federal jurisdiction.  Federal narcotics prosecutions dropped 25
percent from  1993-1994, for example, and prosecutions for firearms violations
dropped  20.5 percent. Since the enactment of President Clinton's Violent  Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the 1994 crime  bill), the Clinton
Administration has initiated no significant  legislative efforts on the problem
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $30 billion omnibus crime bill is itself a huge expansion  of federal
authority into functions traditionally performed by  state and local officials.
Key provisions include $8.8 billion worth  of funding for the hiring of police;
$9.7 billion for prisons and  other correctional initiatives; $6.9 billion for
crime &quot;prevention&quot;  activities, largely social programs; and $4.8
billion for several  other measures, including a 10-year ban on the sale,
manufacture,  and importation of 19 types of assault weapons, the creation of 
state registries for violent sex offenders, and the expansion of the  death
penalty to dozens of new federal crimes. Of course, 98 percent  of violent
crimes fall under state and local, not federal,  jurisdiction 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  and are subject to state and
local, rather than federal, policy  initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Funding for Local Police. </B>The Clinton Administration is  promising
to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America's  cities. The reality
is that the 1994 crime bill funds only $8.8  billion for police over six years,
far less than the full amount required  to put such a number on the streets on a
permanent basis. But  more important than the number of police is their
function, their  specific tasks, and where, precisely, they are assigned. To
fund police  to fight crime would seem to be simple: Send the money directly  to
state or local government according to a straightforward  formula that reflects
population, crime rates, or a combination of both.  That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Based on the level of violent crime, it is clear from <a href="crime_7.gif">Chart  7</a> <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#66">66</A> that high-crime cities were
underfunded and low-crime cities  were overfunded. Worse, police funding has
become yet another  extension of the Clinton Administration's politically
correct  &quot;diversity&quot; agenda, a classic liberal program of social
engineering in  which local police departments are required to establish racial
or  gender-based quotas under the guise of crime-fighting in order to get 
federal funding. Under the Clinton Administration formula, local  police
departments must submit analyses of &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women and
minorities in accordance with &quot;community labor  statistics&quot; (broken
down by race, sex, gender, and job category);  outline &quot;affirmative action&quot;
plans that include &quot;goals&quot; and  specific steps to achieve &quot;goals&quot;
for correcting the &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women; and transmit
quarterly reports, plus a copy, to  official Washington on their progress in
implementing these federally  approved plans. So onerous is compliance (within
30 days) of  these 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  bureaucratic requirements
unrelated to reducing violent crime  that Oklahoma City Chief of Police Sam
Gonzales recommended  that the city turn down the monies from the Department of

<P>By December 1995, the Clinton Administration's program  has been able to add
26,000 additional police to local forces  throughout the country, still far
short of the goal of 100,000 cops on  the streets. Over 600 localities have
turned down the program,  largely because they could not afford the 25 percent
financial match  requirement for participation in the program. Moreover,
according  to an analysis by the General Accounting Office, 7000 local 
jurisdictions did not even apply for the Clinton Administration's  grant money
overwhelmingly because of the cost of participation,  but cited other factors as
well, including the absence of need,  restrictive regulations and excessively &quot;burdensome&quot;

passed six crime-related bills in 1995. These  measures included solid
provisions governing truth in sentencing of  violent criminals, good faith
exemption to the exclusionary rule in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  gathering of critical evidence by

prosecutions. H.R. 666 would  allow such evidence to be considered if the
officers who improperly  obtained evidence did so in the &quot;objectively
reasonable belief&quot;  that their actions complied with the protections of the
Fourth  Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1983, the Justice Department estimated that up to 55,000  serious
criminal cases were dropped every year because  exclusionary rule restrictions
eliminated the evidence needed for  prosecution. By 1992, an independent report
concluded that the number  had grown to 120,000, including 30,000 violent crimes
and  90,000 serious property crimes. This figure does not include the tens  of
thousands of crimes that could have been prevented, or the  cases that never

requirements.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#69">69</A>  This House

<P>Congressional action on habeas corpus is long overdue. Under  an 1867

for review of their cases. Prisoners abuse  this right by filing endless
frivolous petitions that raise no valid  claims, often delaying application of
the death penalty until every  conceivable legal loophole has been exhausted.
Petitions in many  state courts are similarly abused.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What is really needed is for each state to adopt legislation  providing for
only one habeas petition, to be filed within a year of  the last appellate
decision, which raises only issues that could not  have been raised in previous
state proceedings. It also should be  specified that changes in the law will not

in federal  courts, who often clog the system with endless and frivolous
appeals.  The Senate Judiciary Committee also has approved the  House-passed
victim restitution bill (H.R. 665).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should:
</P>
<P><B>-     Restrict the ability of the federal judiciary to impose prison 
caps.</B> Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress  attempted
to bar federal judges from imposing prison caps   restrictions on the number of
prisoners that can be incarcerated at a  particular prison which result in many
violent criminals being  released long before their terms have been served. With
the  legal assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),  liberal
lawyers and federal judges quickly found ways to evade this  provision.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therefore, the first major initiative of the new Congress should  be to
define clearly the scope of federal judicial authority over  state and local
prisons and &quot;abide by federal laws governing the  limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of  confinement.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#71">71</A>  New Members of Congress should
reassert their clear and  indisputable constitutional authority under Article
III, Section 2, and define  for the federal courts the &quot;exceptions&quot;
and &quot;regulations&quot; that  should 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  apply to federal judicial action
over state prisons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reduce federal intrusion into state crime-fighting activities  and
help the states fight crime by letting them keep more of their  own money.</B>
Congress should affirm the division of authority  between the federal government
and the states in combating violent  crime. Federal officials have enough to do
in fighting the illegal  narcotics traffic and enforcing federal laws against
powerful  organized crime syndicates without trying to get involved in fighting 
street crime. Therefore, Congress should undertake a systematic  review of every
federal law dealing with violent crime, determine  which provisions interfere
with or undermine legitimate state and  local law enforcement authority, and
then repeal them. Congress  also should review Department of Justice advocacy
before the  Supreme Court to determine whether the department is adequately 
supporting state and local law enforcement officials in criminal cases,  and
should examine the impact of the Supreme Court's Miranda  rules governing
confessions to make sure that these restrictions do  not unreasonably limit the
ability of police officers to question  criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, if Congress wants to assist state and local  law
enforcement authorities, it should rebate up to two percent of  the federal
personal income tax taken from the residents of any  state on the condition that
the state raise an equivalent amount to  combat violent crime within its
territory. Representative  James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) in 1994 offered a similar
proposal  under which these rebates would have amounted to $55 billion in 
constant dollars over a five-year period, a reliable stream of  funding for
anti-crime initiatives.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Hold hearings on the real root causes of crime.</B> Given the 
disconnect between official Washington's thinking, embodied in the  social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994, and reality,  Congress should
conduct a series of hearings on the real root causes   the long term causes  of
crime, particularly on the importance  of family structure, including marriage
and religious practice, in  preventing violent crime. The professional
literature, the most  recent scholarship, and particularly the experience of
private  organizations involved in crime prevention, all are wide and deep on 
this point.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.</B> 
Congress should review all national social programs, particularly  those which
are supposed to help prevent or reduce crime, with the  director of each program
required to present both the evaluation  data on the program's effectiveness and
national trend data on the  problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal federal restrictions on prison labor.</B> All federal
statutes  restricting prison work should be repealed. These include  the
Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, which authorizes states to ban  commerce in
prison-made goods within their borders; the  Sumners-Ashurst Act of 1940, which
prohibits transportation of  prison-made goods within a state for private use;
and the  Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, which prohibits prison work on government 
contracts exceeding $10,000.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#72">72</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) introduced a bill  (S. 930) to
accelerate the reform of prison operations. The bill  requires inmates in
federal prisons, and in the prisons of states  receiving federal money under the
1994 crime bill to help them  build 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  new facilities, to work 48 hours
and study 16 hours per week.  The legislation also repeals the social work
requirements of the  1994 bill; significantly reduces prisoners' &quot;free time&quot;
to enjoy a host  of amenities; and requires that the food prisoners receive is
not  superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to  enlisted
personnel in the United States Army.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and  punishment has
swung back and forth in the penology literature for  over a century. The appeal
of the Shelby proposal is that it  combines rehabilitation, education, work, and
punishment in one  package. Nor is it really all that stringent; all it requires
is that a  prisoner's life be similar to that of a hardworking young taxpayer
who  holds a job and goes to college at night.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assert political leadership by speaking out on the real causes  of
crime.</B> The President can promote volunteer community  efforts, including the
efforts of religious institutions, which prove  successful in combatting the
social pathologies, particularly broken  families, at the root of much violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods,  there are stunning
examples of successful efforts to turn around the  lives of young people
previously immersed in crime. These efforts  invariably possess two features: a
strong system of rules within  an organization that is characterized by the love
and firm  guidance most often seen in a supportive family and a strong spiritual
 dimension, most commonly a profound religious commitment  to living a good
life. Examples abound.

gang is like a religious commitment: There are codes of conduct  and service to
a higher good than oneself. Watkins shows gang  members how to be true to all
that attracts them to the gang and still  be true to themselves and the society
around them. As the  spiritual inspiration behind his efforts becomes clear to
the youth, they  also become aware of the spiritual dimension of their own
lives.

hundreds of young men returning from prison. It is a place to  stay where the
rules are straight and the goal is clear: Contribute  to society, be committed
to someone, work, and stay out of  trouble. However, despite the good
accomplished, and the good will  of these difficult young men towards the House
of Umoja and  its style of working with them, it has suffered from the  &quot;helping
hand&quot; of government. Regulations and local government  requirements have
become such obstacles to its work that it has been  unable to thrive and grow as

<P>One thing is common to all these efforts: giving people a place  to belong.
This involves deep and often long-term personal  relationships with &quot;at-risk&quot;
teens or children. These relationships do  not take money. They do take a
generous commitment of  personal time, the kind of commitment found in programs
like Big  Brothers and Big Sisters. Government cannot purchase these efforts. If
 it tries, it vitiates them by turning moral relationships into  monetary ones.

<P><B>-     Heed the recommendations of law enforcement organizations  on the
fitness of judicial nominees.</B> The American Bar  Association has become
highly politicized in recent years. Its leaders have  resorted to inflammatory
political rhetoric in attacking the  leadership of Congress, and its liberal
ideological bias has long since  compromised its integrity as an independent
reviewer of the  professional qualifications and fitness of candidates for
judicial office.  The President should dispense with the ABA's advice and seek
an  alternative source for measuring the professional fitness of  judicial
candidates. At the very least, he should give equal consideration  to the views
of constitutional experts selected by law  enforcement associations,
particularly with regard to the sensitivity of  judicial nominees to public
safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Order the Justice Department to issue an annual  state-by-state
report card on key indices of crime prevention and reduction.</B>  The key to
reducing crime is for state and local officials to  identify repeat offenders
and keep them in prison for long terms so  they cannot continue to prey upon the
public. In 1992, former  Attorney General William Barr produced a thorough
report detailing  the changes that need to be made to accomplish this  goal.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#73">73</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most of these changes need to be made at the state level, where  98 percent
of all crimes are prosecuted. The Attorney General  could issue an annual report
card based on reductions in violent  crime and the adoption of specific
crime-fighting remedies. Rankings  on crime reduction could be based on current
FBI and Bureau of  Justice Statistics data. Rankings on crime-fighting could be
based  on a state's adoption of specific remedies. Therefore, the  states
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply restrict pre-trial release for dangerous defendants.</B> 
States should enact legislation and, if necessary, amend their  constitutions to
allow for detention without bail pending trial for  defendants who pose a proven
threat to victims, witnesses, or the  community at large. Legislation to grant
judges this power in  federal courts was adopted in 1984. Under this law, a
judge who finds  that release will endanger the safety of any other person or
the  community, and that no combination of conditions on a release can 
reasonably assure such safety, may deny bail and order the  defendant detained
until trial. Any defendant convicted within the past  five years of a violent
crime committed on pre-trial release is  automatically presumed to be a danger
to the community. An  additional sentence of two to 10 years also applies to any
felony  committed while on pre-trial release.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This law has worked well at the federal level and provides a  model that
should be adopted by every state to prevent repeat  offenders from committing
crimes pending trial, which remains a  significant problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply limit probation.</B> Probation should be prohibited for 
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  following serious offenses:
murder, rape, armed robbery,  felonies involving the intentional or knowing
infliction of serious  physical injury, or a second conviction for any felony.
Probation  leaves these classes of criminals free to threaten law-abiding 
citizens. Limiting it is a commonsense way to keep serious repeat  offenders off
the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Adopt strict state sentencing guidelines.</B> A comprehensive  and
complex set of guidelines developed by the U.S. Sentencing  Commission has been
adopted to govern sentencing for federal  crimes. These guidelines specify a
narrow range of sentences for  each crime which vary according to the
seriousness of the crime,  the prior record of the defendant, whether a weapon
was used,  how much bodily injury or financial loss was caused, and other 
factors. Federal judges must impose sentences within this narrow  range, except
in cases where the judge believes special  circumstances warrant a departure.
The prosecution or defense may appeal a  sentence departing from the guidelines,
and such departure will not  be upheld without a strong and valid justification.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If states adopted such sentencing guidelines, liberal or  lenient judges
would be hard pressed to evade them. This is one of  the most important reforms
state officials could adopt to get  repeat offenders off the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abolish parole for violent offenders.</B> Under federal 
sentencing guidelines, parole has been all but abolished. Early release is 
allowed only for &quot;good time credits,&quot; which may reduce the  imposed
sentence by no more than 15 percent. If states adopted  this standard, it could
be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep  violent repeat offenders in prison.
Virginia Governor George Allen  made 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  this reform a central theme in
his criminal justice reform program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Acquire adequate prison space.</B> No reform aimed at 
incarcerating repeat and violent criminals can succeed without sufficient 
prison space. In most jurisdictions, including the federal system,  this means
constructing or otherwise acquiring additional capacity.  As former Attorney
General Barr has said, &quot;The choice is clear:  More prison space or more
crime.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#74">74</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers can justify this expenditure by noting that the cost  of acquiring
additional prison space is offset not only by the  far larger savings to society
from reducing crime, but also by the  incalculable benefits derived from
protecting the lives and  property of American citizens. Costs also can be
reduced significantly  by contracting out the construction and operation of
prisons to  private firms which have a proved they can build and operate 
additional prison space at substantially less cost than government 
bureaucracies. With private owners and operators, government also need  not
provide full financing of construction costs up front  a  severe constraint in
most states. Financing could be obtained by  the owner in private capital
markets and recouped over time  through fees paid by the government for use of a
facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Private firms have proved they can construct and bring into  operation new
facilities much more quickly than the  government, thereby reducing capital
costs. Competitive market incentives  produce more cost-effective construction,
management, and  operation design on the part of private firms. Private
construction of  prisons is much more common than private operation, but there
still  are dozens of successful prisons operated privately with higher  quality
and at much lower cost.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#75">75</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to work.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to require inmates to work full-time while in prison. Any net  earnings should
go first to the victim as restitution, after which at least  half should go to
the prison to finance incarceration costs. In  addition to generating funds for
these purposes, required work would  teach discipline, mold positive social
attitudes, and develop work  skills that enable the prisoner to obtain gainful
employment after  release. A 1991 federal study found that convicts who worked
in  prison were less likely to commit crimes after release and much  more likely
to be gainfully employed.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#76">76</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Requiring prisoners to work also can reduce operating costs  by using at
least part of the resulting products and services to  offset prison budgets (see
below). Texas A&amp;M economics  professor Morgan Reynolds points out that in
the past, many prisons  were self-financing thanks to required work by  inmates.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#77">77</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to study.</B> Training, education, and 
counseling sessions should be offered to prisoners in the evenings and  on
weekends  the same time non-criminal working adults  outside prison must attend
classes. Requiring such extra effort to  obtain the benefits of higher
achievement would teach better social  attitudes and build self-respect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     End furloughs and other temporary release programs.</B>Violent  or
repeat offenders should not be released from prison on  unsupervised furloughs,
work/education release, or other temporary  or conditional release programs.
Nearly 60 percent of prisoner  escapes in 1990 occurred during furlough or
work/education  releases,<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#78">78</A> and
many crimes are committed by prisoners during  such 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  furloughs or releases.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#79">79</A>  Violent or repeat offenders also
should  not be released pending appeal of a conviction, as this merely  allows
them the further opportunity to flee and commit additional crimes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Impose the death penalty for heinous crimes.</B> The death 
penalty should be imposed for several particularly serious offenses:  murder of
law enforcement officers, murder committed during  commission of a serious
felony, murder committed in prison, or  other murders in which the jury finds
aggravating factors that  outweigh any mitigating factors and result in a crime
sufficiently heinous  to justify death as the penalty. In fact, the death
penalty is used  sparingly in the United States. According to the Bureau of
Justice  Statistics, of the 4984 prisoners sentenced to death during the  period
1973 to 1993, 226, or 4.5 percent, were  executed.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#80">80</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The death penalty deters potential murderers, permanently  prevents repeat
offenders, and exacts appropriate justice for the  most heinous crimes.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#81">81</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Guarantee victims' rights.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to establish clearly the following rights of victims: the right to  be present
and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial  proceedings parallel to the
rights of defendants, including bail and other  hearings, plea negotiations,
sentencing, and any other public  proceedings; the right to present a &quot;victim's
impact statement&quot; at the  time of sentencing, with surviving family members
exercising the  deceased victim's rights; the right to full restitution out of
any  assets or earnings of the defendant, including the full rights of 
collection as enjoyed by any other creditor, with exemption from discharge  if
the criminal files for bankruptcy; the right to be fully informed  of all
proceedings against the defendant, as well as the  defendant's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  incarceration; and the right to
mandate HIV testing of  defendants in sexual offense cases before trial, and
periodic tests to catch  a latent HIV infection. In addition, every prosecutor's
office  should have a victim-witness coordinator to inform victims of their 
rights and help them exercise those rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each state also should establish in its criminal statutes a clear  right of
self-defense that allows the victim of a crime to use  deadly force to protect
himself from bodily harm and to protect his  home or business. The same right of
self-defense &quot;without  retreat&quot; should apply elsewhere when the victim
is not at fault in  causing an altercation. Innocent victims should not be
subject to legal  second-guessing of the snap  and usually frightened  
judgments they make under extreme distress in exercising their right to 
self-defense, though use of excessive force must remain illegal.  The law also
should exempt from civil liability any action  committed in self-defense that is
not a violation of criminal law, as well  as any other injury suffered by a
criminal while committing  a crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#82">82</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reform the juvenile justice system.</B> While overall crime rates 
have declined, the major criminal threat to civil society is the rapid  increase
in juvenile crime. Yet juvenile criminals generally are  exempt from the
criminal justice system until they reach age 18;  instead, they are often
covered by juvenile delinquency systems  that impose little if any real
punishment, typically granting  probation for crime after crime or holding
offenders for relatively short  periods in ineffective juvenile detention
centers. Gaining control of  the crime problem therefore requires thorough
reform of the  juvenile justice system.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> states should enact legislation that allows adult charges 
for juveniles 14 or older who commit murder, rape, kidnapping,  armed robbery,
or assault with a firearm, or who intentionally inflict  serious physical
injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> all offenders who remain in juvenile delinquency  systems
should be required to pay restitution to their victims. For  every serious
offense, the juvenile also should be sentenced to  extended, mandatory
participation in a highly structured community  service or public works program
after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> an extended sentence to an institutional boot camp  should be
required for repeat offenders, juvenile offenders who fail  to comply with
sentenced participation in community service or  public works programs, and
juveniles under the age of 14 who  commit violent crimes. Such boot camps should
be operated with  military-style regimentation and discipline, providing
education and  requiring work on a highly structured schedule. Young offenders 
generally come from single-parent families, with many of their  neighbors and
even parents involved in drugs, alcohol abuse,  prostitution, or other crimes.
Their moral development can be  achieved only by removing them from this
environment and keeping  them in one that requires moral responsibility for
several years.  Sentences to such boot camps until adulthood at 18 should be 
common for those whose crimes qualify them for such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> records of juvenile convictions for crimes of  violence
should be carefully maintained and made available at  sentencing for any future
crimes of violence committed in juvenile years  or adulthood. Studies show that
juvenile crime records are one of  the strongest predictors of repeat adult
crime. Considering these  ear
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  lier convictions will lead to
stronger sentences for repeat  offenders at an earlier age, thereby further
reducing  crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#83">83</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Clean up the police departments and make greater use of  community
policing.</B> Most police officers are solid members of their  communities, but
the failure of the criminal justice system to  incarcerate repeat and violent
offenders demoralizes even the best of  them. Beyond this political failure, too
many cities have made  matters worse by deliberately lowering service standards
and  imposing racial and gender quotas on a job that should be filled only on 
the basis of individual merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The absence of effective screening for criminal misconduct,  poor starting
salaries, poor supervision by commanders in the  field, atrocious personnel
management, failure to recruit personnel  of outstanding character as well as
ability  all these factors  have combined to encourage patterns of brutality,
corruption, and  demoralization in too many police departments in American 
cities. Charges and revelations of corruption, brutality, and  tampering with
evidence in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los  Angeles have undermined public
confidence in the police. There is no  substitute for character and moral
integrity in a police officer: A  bad person cannot be a good cop. From the
standpoint of  personnel management, recruiting, and hiring, the acquisition of
good  police officers should be the first order of business. And while  officers
should be recruited from every sector of the community, only  the best should be
hired  and only on merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>State and local officials also should return to an older tradition  of
policing. The police in most communities operate by patrolling  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  police cars, waiting for calls
for help and then responding  as quickly as possible. An alternative strategy
now developing  is known as community policing. Under this approach, officers 
are assigned to small neighborhoods and are responsible for  getting out of
their cars and spending most of their time walking the  beat. By visiting local
businesses, talking to residents, attending  community meetings, and learning
first-hand what is going on  and what the citizens are concerned about, they
gain a far more  detailed understanding of the people and their neighborhoods. 
Police-citizen community activities include organizing citizen  crime-watch
patrols, canvassing local businesses and private  security guards to glean
information, and instructing all citizens on  what they must look for to assist
the police and avoid becoming  victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The community policing strategy has proven quite successful  in deterring
crime, apprehending criminals, and removing fear  from communities.84  State and
local governments should use this  approach more widely, substantially
increasing police personnel  and assigning them to high-crime areas where they
can provide  a strong police presence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are conservatives more interested in sending more  young men to
prison than in keeping them out?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The first task of government is to protect its citizens.  That
means putting more violent criminals in prison and keeping  them there.
Rehabilitation programs have not delivered on their  promise to reduce violent
crime, and citizens should not be asked to  put 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  their hopes in rehabilitation for
these kinds of criminals.  Innocent citizens are not protected by such hopes.
This is not to say  that long-term prevention strategies should be abandoned. To
the  contrary, conservatives affirm prevention strategies, including  many now
operating in the private sector, that work and are  solidly grounded in the
institutions that can best prevent crime: the  family, the church, and the
school. In the meantime, a sound  conservative social policy would aim to
strengthen these institutions. This is  the best way to keep young men out of
prison. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#85">85</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't crime going down?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes; overall, violent crime is going down slightly. That is  the
good news. Nevertheless, it is still 350 percent higher than just  30 years ago.
Further bad news is that teenage violent crime is  going up and shows every sign
of continuing to rise for the next 16  years at least unless there is a major
cultural change in the United  States. This is so because the rise in violent
crime is directly related to  the breakdown in family and community, and
Americans have yet  to see an increasing number of out-of-wedlock children grow 
up without parental supervision, love, or discipline. If  Americans somehow
could turn the deteriorating family structure  around, strengthening the
nation's families and recording no more  out-of-wedlock births from today
onwards, we still would have to  wait for this psychologically damaged and
potentially violent group  of young offenders to work their way through the
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is wrong with imposing uniform federal sentences?   Shouldn't a
crime receive the same penalty in any part of the US.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We have state and local judges and juries to evaluate the  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  cumstances and the level of guilt
in each case. Judges ought  to have descretion to impose different sentences;
but, at the  same time, criminals should be required to serve at least 85
percent  of these sentences. Truth in sentencing is just that: If you do  the
crime, you do the time. Everybody is clear: the judge, the  jailer, the
criminal, and  last but not least  the citizen. But that is  a policy decision
best left to the states. Local communities can  best assess the effectiveness of
their local judges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress oppose federal assistance  to police
in the President's crime bill?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress don't oppose federal assistance  to
local law enforcement. Under the proposal enacted by the  House of
Representatives, Congress can continue to do the very best  that the Clinton
Administration program can do, but can do it  even better. With the
congressional block grant approach, passed by  the House of Representatives and
threatened with a veto by  President Clinton, local police can get even more
money, may be able to  hire even more personnel, and they will have even more
flexibility  to use these funds in a fashion that best suits local needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the Clinton Administration funding for police is at  the
discretion of the President. There is solid evidence that  Administration
funding does not go to localities hit hardest by  violent crime. For example,
Portland, Oregon, which accounts for 56  percent of all violent crime committed
in the state of Oregon, got  less than one percent of the funding awarded to 
Oregon.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#86">86</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't America's prison population exploding because law  enforcement
is cracking down on minor drug offenses?  
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America  reports, since
1974, over 90 percent of all inmates in state prisons  have been either violent
offenders or repeat felons. Between 1980  and 1993, the number of persons
imprisoned for violent crimes  grew by 221,000, or 1.3 times the growth of those
imprisoned as  &quot;drug offenders.&quot;  Furthermore, 80 percent of federal
and state drug  offenders are drug traffickers with a history of repeat
offenses.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>American education continues to be in crisis. Government  spending on
education has skyrocketed even as school performance  and student achievement
have remained static, leaving young  Americans ill-equipped to function in
today's increasingly  competitive world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The liberal solution, as always, is more money, more  bureaucracy, more
regulation, more federal intrusion. Candidates need to  emphasize that America's
education crisis cannot be solved by  central government decree. Schools will
not be improved by letting  Washington run them. The crisis can be solved only
by taking  power away from centralized bureaucracies and empowering  parents,
teachers, principals, and local school boards to take charge  and make things
better for their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most important education goal of the 1990s is to put  parents and
teachers in charge of education  at the local level. In  the nation's large
cities in particular, public schools have  become faceless monopolies,
insensitive or indifferent to parental  and teacher concerns about quality,
standards, and discipline.  Public schools must be made fully accountable to the
parents and  children they are meant to serve. That means parents  especially 
low-in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  come parents  must be given the
power to transfer their  children to, and the public funds to educate their
children, in other public  or private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High academic standards lie at the heart of effective  education. But
standards must reflect America's tradition of local  control: They should be
locally adopted and adapted to local needs  and capacities. While education is a
national issue, it is a local  responsibility. Federal &quot;remedies&quot; are
barriers to needed innovation  and reform, not the solution. Indeed, the
original genius of the  federal system was that the states were &quot;laboratories
of democracy.&quot;   Each state, and each local school district, can learn from
the others.  The federal push to establish fashionable outcomes-based 
education, and the reaction it has precipitated, should remind us that the 
federal role should be minimal and non-interventionist.  Decisions need to be
made in local schools and the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, since the time of the ancient Greeks, schools have had  a central
mission which embodies but goes beyond academics:  character formation. Students
should become better people by virtue  of attending school; habits of hard work,
honesty, self-respect,  and respect for others are essential to democratic
capitalism,  and schools should support their development as ardently as they 
support mastery of mathematics and English. The public school  in America once
proudly carried out that function  now  many schools undermine it. There is, as
well, a pressing practical  issue: Schools must be safe and secure learning
environments for  students, teachers, and other members of the education 
community. The lesson should be clear: Learning is important, self-discipline 
is important, and standards of behavior will be enforced, just as  academic
standards will.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopting institutional reforms centered around school choice  for parents,
autonomy for teachers and principals, and genuine  teacher professionalism can
change the system's fundamental  incentives. Today's government- and
union-controlled monopoly can be  replaced with a diverse and flexible system
controlled by  parents. The result will be freedom of choice for parents,
teachers, and  students, greatly improved school performance and student 
achievement, and a vastly improved working environment for teachers  and
principals.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's public schools once provided citizens with a  common culture and a
sound basic education. In recent decades,  however, the public school system has
failed utterly to provide  Americans with these essentials.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>SAT scores have dropped nearly 60 points in the past three  decades  even
though the test has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  The  same answers in 1992 as
in 1960 score between 18 and 30 points  higher than three decades ago. Thus, the
real loss is somewhere  between 98 and 110 points.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a classic example of denial, the Educational Testing Service  has
responded to this crisis by &quot;re-centering&quot; SAT scoring for  1995 and
beyond. To disguise the poor performances of American  students, all SAT scores
are now reported on a higher scale. The  test also has been renamed. No longer
the Scholastic Aptitude Test,  it is now the Scholastic Assessment Test: same
acronym, less utility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But trying to make the picture look better by altering SAT  scores fools
nobody. The school system is failing. In 1969, Congress  created the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  to survey student achievement
nationwide on a regular basis.  Over the years, these assessments have found
that:

<P>
</P>
<P>The latest results show that there has been little if any  improvement. The
1994 NAEP history assessment showed that more  than half of American high school
seniors lack a basic knowledge  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. history. The test, composed
of multiple choice and  essay questions, was given in early 1994 to a national
sample of  22,500 fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in both public and private 
schools. The results:

<P>The information gets worse. A 1995 NAEP study revealed that  the best
writing students produce as part of their classroom work is  not very good.
Writing samples collected from a nationally  representative sample of more than
3,000 4th and 8th graders showed that:

<P><B>States vary widely.</B> In its <I>Report Card on American  Education

50 states and the District of Columbia, the  American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC) found that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Nationwide, student performance did not improve 
significantly from 1992-1993 to 1993-1994. SAT scores remained  unchanged, 35

1.3 percent from 1980.  ACT<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#8">8</A> and

rates): Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana,  Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Utah, Wisconsin, and  Wyoming (see Table 5).

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending at Record Levels</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While education performance has been mediocre at best,  education spending
is now at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the 1994-1995 school year, total education spending in  the United
States was estimated to be $508.3 billion, up 178  percent from the 1980-1981
school year (see <a href="educ_t1.gif">Table 1</a>).This amounted  to about 7.5 percent of GDP for
1994-1995, almost double the  spending on national defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Total spending on public elementary and secondary schools for  the 1994-1995
school year was $283.9 billion, an increase of 173  percent from 1980-1981 in
nominal terms. From 1972 to 1992,  public school spending rose 490 percent in
nominal terms (see <a href="educ_t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, the federal government spent $35.2 billion in  constant 1994
dollars on education in 1994-1995, up from $29.7 billion  in 1980 (see <a href="educ_t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending per pupil in the public schools has soared: $6,857  in 1994-1995,
up 150 percent from 1980-1981 in nominal terms  and 44 percent in 1994 dollars.
Since 1970, per-pupil spending  has risen 554 percent in nominal terms and 73
percent in  constant 1994 dollars (see Table TK).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ALEC's report card clearly supports conservative arguments  that student
performance measures, compared with per-pupil  expenditures, average teacher
salaries, and other education spending  variables, indicate no direct or
systematic relationship between  spending and student performance. 
</P>
<P>None of the ten top-performing states in terms of student  achievement
ranked among the top ten in per-pupil education spending  in 1993-1994; most
spent less than the national average per pupil.  In addition, none of these
states ranked among the top ten in  average teacher salaries last year (eight
actually paid less than the  national average); nine held per-pupil spending
increases below the  national average during the last 11 years; and seven did so
during  the preceding 21 years as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="educ_t5.gif">Table 5</a> shows, Iowa scored first in SAT scores and tied  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  first on the NAEP test, yet its
spending per pupil was below  the national average; Utah spent the least per
pupil, yet scored  second on the SAT and eighth on the NAEP test; and North 
Dakota ranked 36th in spending but tied for first on the NAEP test  and scored
fourth on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, New Jersey spent the highest amount per pupil  and scored 37th
on the SAT and 14th on the 1992 NAEP test; the  District of Columbia ranked
second in spending per pupil and  scored 49th on the SAT and 42nd out of 42
states on the NAEP test;  and ninth-ranked Rhode Island scored 43rd on the SAT
and 23rd  on the NAEP test.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     According to ALEC, report card, New Jersey spent
more per  student ($9,429) than any other state in the nation during the 
1993-1994 school year. New Jersey also held the same per-pupil  spending rank in
1992-1993 and still increased per-pupil spending  significantly more than the
national average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Teacher salaries also increased nationwide last year, rising a
 modest 0.1 percent after inflation. Connecticut paid the highest  average
teacher salaries last year ($49,500); South Dakota, the  lowest ($25,199).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     By the year 2005, the total cost of public education will have
 increased substantially. Using Census Bureau population  projections, and
assuming per-pupil spending trends continue:

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Total education spending will rise more than 47 percent 
(almost $125 billion in constant 1994 dollars), and per-pupil spending  will
increase almost 32 percent to $7,942. As a result, the  per-capita 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  education tax burden will rise by
one-third, and the typical  family of four will face an average annual education
tax increase  of $1,340.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>That there is no correlation between spending and performance  has been
demonstrated by a wide variety of studies, perhaps most  notably in the
exhaustive study of the performance of  America's schools for their landmark
1990 book, 
<I>Politics, Markets and America's Schools,</I> conducted by Brookings
Institution  Senior Fellows John Chubb and Terry Moe. The evidence showed 
clearly that increased spending and resources do not translate into  better
school or student performance. The relationship between  resources and
performance has been studied extensively by social  scientists, who agree that
financial resources are of less consequence  that other variables. Most
important is &quot;school climate,&quot; the extent  to which a school offers a
safe and disciplined learning  environment with staff and students motivated by
a shared commitment to  academic excellence. The performance problems of the
public  schools cannot be corrected solely by digging deeper into the  public
purse.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#9">9</A>  Many studies make this
point.

statistically significant relationship between student  achievement and any of
the school characteristics that are often  thought important: teacher-pupil
ratios, teacher education,  teacher salaries, and per pupil expenditures. This
should come as  no great surprise. Over the last two decades, as school 
performance has deteriorated and stagnated, per-pupil spending  in schools has
increased nearly 100 percent after inflation,  class sizes have shrunk more than
20 percent, and most  teachers have acquired master's degrees.<A

</P>
<P>International Comparisons
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the home front, there is some modest good news. Black  test scores have
made small gains, and women's have as well.  More students are taking more
demanding courses. The number of  them taking advanced placement courses and
tests continues to rise,  as does the number of higher scores. But these are
just a few  bright spots in a gloomy picture. The bottom line for conservative 
candidates is that all American children could be doing  significantly better,
as indeed all must if we are to have confidence in the  future. Academic
performance in America is not world-class,  and offers no promise of becoming
world-class by the year 2000  except in a few isolated schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reasons for this huge discrepancy between America's  schools and our
international competitors are not hard to fathom.  American public schools are
not designed to succeed. Pony Express  institu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  tions in the electronic age, they
are hopelessly out of date.  The issue is not money (see <a href="educ_2.gif"
>chart</a>), but standards,
organization,  and accountability. Too little is expected of American students;
as  a consequence, they give too little. There are few rewards for  success and
fewer penalties for failure. A system designed and  run without incentives and
rewards ineluctably panders to the  lowest common denominator, as American
education has done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Where Teachers Send Their Children to School</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public school teachers are sending their own children to  private schools
rather than allow them to become lost in a public  school system in disarray.
This was reported in a May 1995 study by  The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>,
prepared under the  auspices of the Indiana-based Hudson Institute and published
and  distributed by the Washington-based Center for Education  Reform.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#13">13</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This study, drawn from the 5 percent household sample of  the 1990 Census,
shows that, taken together, public and private  school teachers nationwide are
only slightly more likely than the  general public to choose private schools
(17.1 percent to 13.1 percent).  In America's most troubled cities, however, the
results are quite  different:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In troubled cities, public school teachers are two to three  times more
likely than the general public to use private schools. For  example, in
Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of public school  teachers who make less than
$35,000 send their children to private  school. This is more than double the
national average; among  public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll
some or all of  their children in private school. The trend continues in cities
like  Boston 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  (24.4 percent), New York (21.4
percent), Miami (35.4  percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, &quot;in our nation's cities, where the schools are 
arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the  institutions in
which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools.&quot;   This
includes teachers of all races.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Black public school teachers use private schools more than  white public
school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and  Hispanic public school
teachers use private schools more than  non-Hispanic public school teachers
(16.5 percent to 11.9 percent).  Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more
likely than nonwhite parents  to send their children to a private school. In the
United States as  a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white 
parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of  other
races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent  of Hispanic
parents send their children to private school, compared  to 10.1 percent of all
non-Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, then, black public school teachers are almost as likely  as the
public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent to 13.1  percent). This
means that &quot;black teachers who can afford a  choice exercise it: they are
50 percent more likely than black parents  in general to enroll their children
in private school. This might  explain the high support for publicly funded
school choice  programs among minorities  they are often in the worst school
districts  and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when 
they can afford it.&quot;  Across the United States, &quot;teachers  public  and
private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low  income, middle income,
and high income  know how to address  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  nation's education crisis: they
vote with their feet and their  pocket books. They choose private schools for
their children when  they think it serves their interests best.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Teacher Unions Obstruct Reform </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the larger  National Education
Association (NEA) have become the  bane<U> </U>of school reformers. They are
big and well funded, and they have  a major presence in Washington and most
state capitals.  Teachers are, in fact, the most heavily unionized segment of
the  American work force, and the NEA is particularly opposed to serious 
education reform. But teachers are not necessarily synonymous  with their
unions. They vote for Republicans as well as Democrats  and are concerned with
many of the same issues that concern  reformers. The tide could begin to turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One sign that teachers recognize the need for reform, as  noted above and in
the following table, is the extent to which they  enroll their own children in
private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another encouraging sign is the willingness of AFT  President Albert Shanker
to champion high academic standards and  school discipline.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#14">14</A>  At the same time, however,
Shanker's opposition  to innovations such as school choice remains implacable.
The  education establishment fears that public schools as we know them  will
disappear, but this is all the more reason to adopt a more  innovative approach
to public education. This fear of change is  narrow and self-serving. Preferring
the known to the unknown, the  education establishment reveals its limited
vision and how little it  actually cares about the welfare of children.

<P><B>The Federal Takeover</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The attempted federal takeover of American education,  launched with fanfare
and good will during the Great Society 30 years  ago, has been revealed for what
it is: a prolonged and serious  mistake. It is now abundantly clear that
Washington both  over-promised and overreached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Programs intended to improve the education of the poor and  dispossessed
have borne bitter fruit, emerging by and large as  self-serving employment
programs for educators. Student test  scores have remained largely static, and
the promise of public  education as a way out of the mire of social pathology
has not  materialized. Instead, inner-city public schools themselves have become
 trapped in the pathology of the inner city. Almost without exception,  the only
schools which have escaped, and whose students have  done well, are private
denominational schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dismal state of American education is deeply troubling  to those who
have examined it most closely. As Chubb and  Moe write:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     Whether the criticisms have come from average  citizens,
business leaders, public officials, or educators  themselves, they have had a
common thrust: the schools are failing  in their core academic mission,
particularly in the more  rigorous areas of study  math, science, foreign

<P>If local and state officials really wish to improve the education  of our

American public school teachers are asked  to work and teach.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Vouchers Are Needed</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The main difficulty in addressing the sorry state of  America's schools lies
in the fact that those in charge have a vested interest  in resisting change.
The efforts of those most concerned about  falling test scores  usually parents,
but many teachers as well   usually meet with a discouraging combination of
bureaucratic lethargy  and outright resistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the first order of business for reformers must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  wrest enough control from the
bureaucracy to effect  serious change. Several promising policy solutions have
been put  forward to accomplish this. One of the best is the concept of school 
choice, which would end the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to the public
 education system by opening up options for students to attend  higher-quality
private schools. The best way to make private  schools more accessible to the
parents of children currently enrolled  in public schools is also the simplest:
through government vouchers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice vouchers are transfer payments from the  government to
families of school-age children which permit these  children to attend the
school of their choice, whether public or  private, secular or religious. The
practice is widely followed in the  developed democracies and is spreading
rapidly in the former Iron  Curtain countries. America is, in fact, the only
developed nation  that denies its children this form of assistance to help them
attend  non-public and denominational schools. It may well be that the  last
truly deprived minority in the United States is made up of  poor children whose
families prefer a religious education but  cannot afford to pay for it out of
pocket.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#28">28</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous opinion polls show broad public support for  school choice,
especially among inner-city minorities and the poor,  who suffer the worst
schools under the current system with no  feasible alternatives. School choice
offers conservative candidates a  powerful opportunity to attract strong support
from this traditionally  liberal constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The opposition, by contrast, comes from the education and  union
bureaucracies  the only people who gain from the current  monopoly. School
choice is a threat to them because it would  give 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  parents and teachers the power
and control enjoyed for decades  by a professional managerial elite increasingly
out of touch with  the communities they are supposed to be serving.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Role of Charter Schools</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two other promising innovations are the charter school and a  related idea,
private contracting for school services. Charter  schools are public
institutions in terms of mission and funding, but are  run autonomously by the
signatories of a charter. They can be run  by an association of parents,
teachers, business leaders, or any  combination of these. While the charter
school movement is both  new and small, varying significantly from state to
state, the idea  is promising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The basic concept of charter schools is simple: &quot;Allow a group  of
teachers or other would be educators to apply for permission  to open a school.
Give them dollar for dollar what a public  school gets for each student but
without any strings attached. Free  them from the regulations that cripple
learning and stifle innovation  at so many public schools.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#29">29</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the four years since the first charter schools opened their  doors in
Minnesota, 18 other states have passed charter laws in  various forms, and 234
of these schools are up and running around  the country.<A

Arizona's comes closest. Lawmakers revised the law in 1995.

charter schools.</P>
<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> Yes, if  the school is nonsectarian, but
it must become a public school and  no longer accept tuition.</P>
<P><B>Hiring:</B> Schools are not required to hire  certified teachers.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>MINNESOTA:</B> The state that pioneered the charter concept  revised its
law to strengthen it in 1993 and 1995. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cap:</B> Increased  to 40 schools in 1995 after being set
originally at eight and later at  12 schools. </P>
<P><B>Schools open:</B> 17. </P>
<P><B>Approval:</B> Only licensed teachers  can operate a school. Charters
must first be approved by a local  school board, community college, state
university, or technical  college, with the state board of education granting
final approval. Such  an approval process is more limiting than Arizona's, but
in 1993,  lawmakers amended the original law so that charter applicants 
rejected by the local school board can appeal to the state board  if two members
of the local board voted to approve the  charter.</P>
<P><B>State/local control:</B> Schools are exempt from state laws and local 
district policies except those regarding health, safety, civil rights, and 
children with disabilities or special needs. They also have  complete control of
the money they receive from the state.</P>

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> No.</P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most thoroughly developed example is Yvonne Chan's  Next Century
Learning Center in Los Angeles, and the most  promising state legislation for
Charter Schools is Arizona's which is  wide-ranging and flexible. In most
jurisdictions, however,  charter schools are poorly developed and kept on a
short leash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The education establishment  notably the National  Education Association and
various school board associations at the state  and national levels  give lip
service to charter schools but offer  no real support. The reason: Charter
schools are a very real threat  to the status quo. Once in place, they could
revolutionize  American education. They combine the best aspects of a
functioning  public school system  public support, public access and
accountability   with much of the flexibility of private schools. They are an 
important and useful first step to freeing teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Contract Management.</B> Still in its infancy as a way of  operating
schools or school districts, contract management of various  aspects 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  of education is a
long-established practice. School cafeterias,  busing, business services,
textbook acquisition, purchase of  supplies and materials, janitorial services,
and the like have been  turned over to private contractors and run efficiently
in many districts  for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What remains is to begin trying the concept in curriculum  areas such as
reading, math, and foreign languages, as well as in  running whole schools or
school districts. There is no conceptual barrier  to contract management; it is
used in almost all other areas of  government services, from national park
concessions to military  training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The idea behind contract management is simple: Pay an  independent
contractor to perform an assigned task and devise  measures that will determine
whether that task has been performed  successfully. Interestingly, one of the
most difficult tasks school  districts face in contract management is &quot;specifying&quot;
the terms of the  contract; since many schools do not have a clear sense of 
mission, they find it very difficult to specify what they want to  accomplish in
the language of a contract. The exercise, however, is useful,  and education
establishment opposition to such a straightforward  idea is both
anti-intellectual and inflammatory. The issue is subject  to analysis and
validation, and should be welcomed as another way  to improve education
performance.

also can play a critical role in  helping schools set priorities, identify
measurement tools,  improve communication with and between schools and the
larger  community, and help develop performance measures that will  rationalize
pay for teachers and administrators. Perhaps most important of  all, business
leaders can help school boards behave in a more  businesslike fashion. In
particular, business can help school boards  end &quot;micro-management&quot;
and support candidates for school  boards who are both responsible and
effective.

<P>The 1995 legislative session once again brought school choice  to the
forefront of the education debate at the state level. State  legislatures
debated numerous voucher and charter school bills over  the 1995 session, and
several states have passed or improved  their charter school laws. In two
states, Ohio and Wisconsin,  first-in-the-nation school choice programs were put
into  place.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#33">33</A>  Several other
states debated the issues and some proposals cleared the  relevant committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The main changes enacted into law:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Charter Schools.</B> Both chambers of the Florida legislature  passed
charter school bills in 1995. Legislators are consolidating the  bills, and
Governor Lawton Chiles is expected to sign. The  Louisiana Senate passed a
charter school bill that is now being considered  in the House.

legislation. In Oregon, the House narrowly defeated a  charter school bill by a
vote of 31-29. The bill has been sent to  the Legislative Rules Committee, where
it could be amended and  returned to the full House for another vote in 1996.
Connecticut  is considering many education reforms, including both a  voucher
proposal and charter schools.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Voucher Update.</B> According to Marquette University's Blum  Center for
Parental Freedom in Education, choice and voucher  initiatives were pursued in
the following states during 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*    Ohio.</B> Governor George Voinovich in June signed
into law a  two-year budget package creating a $5.25 million pilot voucher 
program in Cleveland, to become effective in September 1996.  With his
signature, Governor Voinovich enabled Ohio to become  the first state in the
nation to complete the enactment of school  choice that includes religious
schools. The proposal included in the  budget package was approved by the
House-Senate Conference  Committee on June 23, 1995, and will allow parents of
2,000  Cleveland students to redeem vouchers at private or religious schools. 
With this new legislation, Cleveland becomes only the second city in  the
country (the first being Milwaukee) to allow private school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Wisconsin.</B> In June, Wisconsin's legislature passed genuine 
school choice legislation, which, along with the rest of Governor  Tommy
Thompson's budget proposal, was signed into law on July  25, 1995. The
legislation called for the expansion of the  Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
to include religiously based  schools (MPCP currently allows students to attend
non-sectarian  private schools in Milwaukee).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governor Thompson's earliest version of the choice proposal  had set the
voucher amount at $3,300 per pupil and raised the  number of eligible students
to 3,500 in the fall of 1996 and 5,500 in  the next year, after which the
enrollment limitation would have  been eliminated. Before the package was
approved by the Joint  Finance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Committee, Representative Annette
&quot;Polly&quot; Williams, the  original sponsor of MPCP, called for a larger
expansion proposal  which increased enrollment to 7,000 in the fall of 1996,
after which  it would be limited to 15,000. This expanded proposal was  approved
by the Senate on June 29 after having been approved by the  State Assembly on
June 21.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, on August 25, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court  issued an
injunction halting the expansion of the Milwaukee  Parental Choice Program to
include religious schools. This action  left more than 2,300 children stranded
after having already signed  up for classes in the religious schools of their
parents'choice. In  an astonishing display of community support, private funds
have  been raised to offset the loss of public funding. Oral arguments  have
been set for February 27, 1996, and a final decision is not  expected from the
Wisconsin Supreme Court until spring. According to  the Landmark Legal
Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, &quot;the  Milwaukee school-choice
litigation will ultimately result in a  major U.S. Supreme Court decision
allowing school-choice  programs that include religious programs.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Massachusetts.</B> In November, Governor William Weld  announced a
statewide program to provide tuition vouchers to  low-income families who wish
to send their children to religious as well  as non-sectarian private schools.
According to a summary of  Governor Weld's proposal, his plan would make
vouchers available  at public and non-sectarian private schools during the first
phase  of reform. During the second phase, an amendment to the  Massachusetts
Constitution would be proposed to expand the program  to include religious
schools. Governor Weld planned to introduce  the voucher program in the
Massachusetts House early in 1996.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Minnesota.</B> Previously only a supporter of public school 
choice, Governor Arne Carlson in July announced his intention to  introduce in
1996 a pilot program for genuine school choice in  Minneapolis, St. Paul, and
Brooklyn Center, a Twin Cities suburb.  Recently, Carlson's staff revealed that
the proposal would likely  offer vouchers worth approximately $500 to $3,000, to
be given on  a sliding scale according to income. A family of four  earning
$40,000 could still qualify for the vouchers. Carlson insists  a voucher program
will create more competition, which in turn  will spawn excellence.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     New Jersey.</B> Governor Christine Todd Whitman delayed until 
1996 the introduction of a school choice proposal, originally to be  introduced
at the end of 1995, and has appointed a panel to  examine school choice in the
wake of promised legal challenges from  the New Jersey Education Association, a
powerful coalition of  groups opposing vouchers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, a staunch  advocate of school
choice, has announced the introduction of a  privately funded voucher program
for the city to begin in January 1996.  The idea initially gained massive
financial backing from  Pepsi-Cola and the Bodman Foundation, but Pepsi-Cola
recently withdrew  its support in the wake of local teachers' union opposition
and talk  of product boycotts.

reforming&quot; America's  schools, he actually has slowed the process of
change. While creating  new government bureaucracies, increasing federal
regulations,  and boosting the rate of spending at the federal level, the 
Administration also has resisted real efforts to reform America's  education
system. The President has chosen to ignore academic &quot;outputs&quot;   real
results  and has focused instead on spending more  taxpayer dollars on &quot;inputs.&quot;
 The Administration also has seriously  undermined the relationship of students
and their families to the  education process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Federal Takeover of School Districts (Goals 2000).</B> The  Goals
2000 legislation, enacted in 1994 as President Clinton's most  important
education program, has been a failure. Instead of  &quot;revolutionizing,
revitalizing and reforming&quot; America's schools as  President Clinton
promised, Goals 2000 has proved a barrier  to change.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#34">34</A>  It has created new government
bureaucracy and  boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to
undermine progress  to improve American education performance by encouraging 
schools to ignore real results and focus instead on obtaining federal  dollars
by showing Washington that more money is being spent on  &quot;inputs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only  strengthen the federal
government's power to control local reform efforts  and hamper grassroots
reform. It is time for Congress to terminate  the program and divert the money
to real reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Building Bureaucracies.</B> Under Goals 2000, three new  government
bureaucracies would have been created: the National  Education Goals Panel, the
National Education Standards and  Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National
Skills Board. While  NESIC will not be empaneled, the philosophy behind these 
bureaucracies continues the command-and-control approach that keeps control  of
schools in the hands of education bureaucrats rather than  parents, teachers,
and students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federalizing Education.</B> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to  local
control, it came dangerously close to mandating a  watered-down national
curriculum designed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying  national
history standards  a well-meaning attempt by  then-National Endowment for the
Humanities Chairman Lynne Cheney  to make educators teach real history again 
backfired last year  when the committee assigned to formulate them unveiled
standards  that were rife with political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The incident reveals one of the inherent dangers in the Goals  2000
approach. Had its members been appointed, NESIC would  have become a de facto
national school board whose 19 members  could have imposed a standard curriculum
of politically correct  revisionism on the entire nation. This central authority
would have  approved or disapproved all state-developed plans to meet goals  set
by the Education Goals Panel, another bureaucracy created  under Goals 2000.
Such attempts to federalize state and local  education discourage real
innovation and inhibit the most important  school 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  reform initiative of the decade,
the movement toward  privatization and school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The states, meanwhile, on their own initiative already have  begun to reject
federal interference in schooling. In particular,  outcomes based education, a
favorite idea of the education  establishment, has offended and alienated
thoughtful teachers and parents  across the country and has mobilized opposition
to the federal role.  Four states  Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Alabama
  have turned down or returned Goals 2000 funding, refusing to  permit more
federal intrusion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Another Middle-Class Subsidy:</B> AmeriCorps. Hailed by the 
Administration as an innovative effort to expand education  opportunity through
volunteerism, AmeriCorps, President Clinton's  national service program, has
evolved into a big-government  pork barrel. Although supporters maintain
AmeriCorps  &quot;encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to
college  and disperses decision-making power from Washington to  the states,&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#35">35</A> the rhetoric contrasts sharply
with reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The AmeriCorps program does little to help American  families pay for
college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, removes  participants from local
communities where they are needed most  and uses them to enlarge the federal
bureaucracy, and  improperly funds partisan political activities. Most
important,  AmeriCorps costs the taxpayers too much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An August 1995 General Accounting Office report found  that AmeriCorps costs
$26,654 per participant to run, or more than  40 percent more than the
Administration's most recent  estimates. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Some 93 percent of the funding
for the program comes out of  taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000  &quot;volunteers&quot;
described as &quot;working all over America, helping people   person to person.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#36">36</A>  In reality, a significant number
of these highly  paid &quot;volunteers&quot; are working in federal or state
bureaucracies,  government-funded programs, or political action organizations.
Of  the 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot; currently participating in the program, 
2,053 are working in federal bureaucracies on programs funded by  the federal
government. <a href="educ_t8.gif">Table 8</a> presents a breakdown of  AmeriCorps participation within the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Student Loans.</B> While the Clinton Administration has portrayed  its
direct lending program for college students as essential to the  education
future of young Americans, the evidence suggests  otherwise. The program appears
to be bad for taxpayers, bad for  students, and bad for schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided  through
private institutions. But under the direct lending plan, the  federal government
borrows the money needed to provide capital for  the loans. This would require
the federal government to borrow  an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each
year. According to  Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to
direct  loans could add as much as $348 billion to the national debt by the 
year 2014. The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to  handle the new
program, hiring 600 new employees to administer it  and anticipating need for
another 20,000 contract employees by  the time the program is fully operational.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are other worries about the direct lending program.  Currently, some
75 percent of all available college financial aid  comes from the federal
government. If the government takes  complete control of the loan program,
colleges and universities in effect  will become dependent on a single lender to
support their students.  The Education Department's power to control loan
revenue, along  with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, 
will give the government vast influence over post-secondary  education. Such
financial power could enable the federal government to  influence or force
curriculum changes, or to mandate such things  as politically correct &quot;diversity
standards.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is little support for a government takeover of the  guaranteed lending
program. The solution is not to nationalize  the multibillion-dollar student
loan program. That would mean  new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans
believe strongly  that student loans should continue to be provided through
private  financial institutions, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The actions taken so far by the 104th Congress have  produced mixed results.
For the first time in 40 years, there was hope  for serious change in America's
education system. The Contract  With America, however, included little
discussion of education  reform or of countering President Clinton's hindering
of legislative  actions. After the first legislative year of the Republican 
majority, despite attempts to introduce far reaching reforms, liberal 
strangleholds and repeated filibusters have caused the 104th Congress  to fall
far short of implementing any serious reform. At the  same 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  time, however, conservative
actions within Congress have  helped make education one of the key issues in
1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming schools in the Nation's  Capital.</B> At the request of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on  D.C. Schools and Representative
Steve Gunderson (R-WI) developed  a plan that would have laid the foundation for
serious reform in  the District of Columbia public school system. Fundamental to
 these reforms was a scholarship proposal that would have put the  federal
government on record as supporting the concept of choice.  The proposal was
added as an amendment to the D.C. FY 1996  appropriations bill in the House.
Unfortunately, due to intense  objections by Democrats and liberal Republicans
in the  House-Senate Conference Committee, the entire set of education reforms 
remains in limbo as both sides refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson amendment authorized the establishment of  independent public
charter schools which would have used  existing D.C. public and private schools
as well as new schools  created with the help of the universities within the
District. It also  would have authorized many federal institutions within D.C., 
including the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Library of  Congress, and
the Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public  charter schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson legislation would have given scholarships of up  to $3,000 for
students whose family incomes were at or below  the poverty level and up to
$1,500 for students whose family  incomes were not more than 185 percent above
the poverty level.  These scholarships would have allowed low-income D.C.
families to  escape the failing D.C. public schools by giving them the 
resources 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  needed to send their children to
any private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the
District of Columbia or  the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and
Maryland.  They would have covered the cost of fees and other expenses for 
tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs  of
transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia  public school,
public charter school, or private school participating  in the tuition
scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also included in the legislation was language to expand local  literacy
programs for the District from two programs to 20 in  the third year of the
initiative. These programs are instrumental  in helping to build reading skills
for children and their parents.  The legislation also would have helped
establish a panel to develop  a high expectations, academically challenging
curriculum and  assessment system for the D.C. school system.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Title I.</B> For more than 30 years, since 1965, Washington
has  spent over $90.5 billion on the Title I program, which still cannot  show
any long-term academic gains for children, even after being  &quot;reformed&quot;
five times. The House offered to cut funding for this  remedial education
program by $1.1 billion, from its current level  of $6.6 billion to $5.554
billion. The President is seeking $7  billion. Funding for the program is tied
to the Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
appropriations  bill, which passed the House but had not been brought to the
floor  of the Senate for a vote by the end of the 1995 session because  of
opposition by Senate Democrats.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Head Start.</B> While it is clear from several studies that any  success
for disadvantaged preschoolers gained through the early stages  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  Head Start is eroded by the time
the children reach the  primary grades, over the past 30 years Washington has
spent over  $31.2 billion on the program. Unfortunately, Congress has decided 
to continue its funding. The House passed a $3.39 billion grant  for preschool
health and education for FY 1996, which returns  Head Start funding to slightly
more than was allocated in 1994.  Again, the Senate has yet to take up the
appropriations for the  program. President Clinton is seeking an increase in
program funding  in order to extend services to 50,000 or more children by the 
year 2002.

acted to  cut this program, a &quot;black hole&quot; in federal funding, by more
than  half, from $441 million to $200 million. The rationale is that  the
program's funds are spread too thin, with some districts  getting only a few
hundred dollars. This program has shown no  effectiveness in reducing drug usage
in high schools, and there have  been no specific performance-based evaluations
of it since its  inception. Furthermore, a program evaluation report has shown
that  training sessions are &quot;more likely to focus on providing information 
about the use of various drugs than teaching resistance and  decision-making
skills.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#37">37</A>  The President has

school autonomy must go hand in hand with parental choice.  This will give
schools the ability to change. School autonomy  means that the principal,

parents as representatives, would  be free to run their school as they choose:
to select their own  curriculum, textbooks, staff, and teachers (which means
that teacher  certification requirements must be relaxed or abolished 
outright). Regulation of private schools also must be relaxed to the  absolute
minimum. In this way, parental choice can create an effective  market that
controls and regulates schools in accordance with the  preferences of parents

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Congress at the request of President Jimmy Carter  in 1979, not
yet two decades old, the U.S. Department of  Education is doing precisely what
its severest critics envisioned:  usurping local and state control by slowly and
steadily introducing  federal controls. Although it accounts for about six
percent of total  public funding of education, its influence is out of all
proportion to  its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education inserts 
itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the  nation's
15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and  intrusive, it is a
metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful  and meddlesome domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet the most alarming aspect of the growing federal control  of education is
not administrative interference, but its adverse  impact on academic
performance, equally the product of sins of  omission and commission. The
increasing power of special interests,  the burgeoning size of school districts,
the refusal of the  public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening
 community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of  education,
general permissiveness, family dissolution  all have played  a role. At no time
in American history has academic  performance been more important. Yet as the
federal role increases,  education performance declines. The new federal role in
education  obviously was not intended to impair academic performance, but, 
steadily and almost without interruption, student academic  performance
nevertheless has fallen, and the Department of Education has  done nothing to
stop the downward spiral. While cause and effect  may be elusive, and the
department's supporters assert a variety  of causes to explain the decline in
student performance,  these changes occurred during, and as a part of, the
federal  ascendancy in American education.

District's schools.

<P>It is essential that this education proposal not tell D.C.  residents what
schools they must have. Rather, it must create the  conditions and incentives

institutions to take advantage of this  opportunity.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't education choice mean the brightest and most  affluent
students will escape, leaving the poorest and most difficult to  educate trapped
in bad public schools?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The exodus of the brightest and richest students happens  under
the current system because only they have the ability to  choose. Comprehensive
school choice gives poor inner-city children  the same freedom to choose their
schools that wealthier children  already enjoy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice improves all schools and benefits all children,  not just
those who change schools. The reason?  Competition forces  all schools to strive
to perform better in order to survive. This  has been the experience in East
Harlem, for instance, where  school choice proved especially beneficial to poor
minority  inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we need the public schools to teach all students a  common set
of basic values, beliefs, and democratic principles?   Doesn't choice leads to
diverse, fragmented philosophies  and views?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The public schools are not teaching a common set of  values,
beliefs, and principles. Many are teaching moral relativism  and
multiculturalism. Under comprehensive school choice,  schools must reflect the
values, beliefs, and principles common to  parents in order to attract students
and funds. The parents of each  child, not government bureaucrats and
politicians, should have the  final say over what that child is taught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't school choice encourage extremists or fanatics to set  up
bizarre &quot;cult&quot; schools and possibly even lead to such abuses as  the
indoctrination of students in Satan worship or racial supremacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Under a program of school choice, schools would have to  meet
minimum certification requirements, just as private schools  do today. Such
requirements effectively preclude extremist or  cult schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With vouchers, wouldn't private schools receive  government money,
and so private schools would face heavy regulatory  control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No private school is required to participate in any school 
choice program. Private schools which receive no state funds today  would be
free to forego state funds under choice programs, leaving  them no worse off
than they are now. One of the fundamental  principles of comprehensive school
choice is autonomy, with each  school free to operate as it chooses. Choice
means reducing the  regulation of public schools to the minimum level now
applied to  private schools, not increasing regulation of private schools.

<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are keenly aware of what is right with America's  health care
system. They are overwhelmingly impressed with the  quality of medical services
they get from doctors and hospitals and  other health care providers; they
appreciate the fruits of modern  medical science and technology that are
available to them; they are  often satisfied with their own insurance plans, and
with the level of  benefits and services available to them through these plans.
At  the same time, however, Americans are concerned about the  current and
future costs of health care, the gaps in insurance coverage  that still
characterize the system, and the fact that too many  Americans are uninsured.
Moreover, they want the frustrating paperwork  and administrative costs of the
system reduced, both in the public  and private sectors, and the laws governing
medical malpractice  improved. And while they want to see certain aspects of the
 health care system reformed, Americans want reform that preserves  personal
choice and the quality of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the past year, Congress has made the country aware of  the growing
financial pressures and instability of the  government's two huge health care
programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Failure  to modernize these programs means
having to drain an ever  larger portion of funds from existing government
programs,  contributing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  to higher deficits and taxes, and
compromising the level and  quality of care available for the next generation of
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Given the magnitude of these issues and concerns, the health  care debate
during the next election should revolve around three  central goals:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  The crises in Medicare and Medicaid must be resolved.</B>  Medicare
is facing bankruptcy. Absent structural reform, the program  is projected to be
insolvent by 2002. This financial crisis is  hitting Medicare just before the 77
million baby boomers, the  largest bulge in America's population pipeline, begin
to retire in  2010. The program needs to be reformed so that it can pay benefits
to  the next generation of retirees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress enacted sweeping Medicare reform in 1995 as part of  its Balanced
Budget Act. But President Clinton blocked this  reform by vetoing the
legislation and argues  wrongly  that no  tough decisions are needed to preserve
the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Likewise, Medicaid, which serves the poor and the indigent and  is financed
jointly by the federal and state governments, is  experiencing explosive rates
of growth. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing segment of the
federal budget, with costs  increasing at annual rates as high as 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Medicaid is out of control because the federal government  curbs state
initiative through expensive mandates, preventing the  states from integrating
health care into other services. Medicaid must  be moved to the states.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Americans must be freed from the fear that they will  become
uninsured.</B> The main political pressure for changing the health  care system
comes not from those who are uninsured, but from  those who fear they will lose
their health benefits in the future.  Candidates need to recognize that most
insured working  Americans know someone who has lost his or her insurance and
has  faced financial hardship or disaster as a result. They do not want to  join
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain that this anxiety flows directly  from today's
employer-based health system. Americans can get tax  relief for health insurance
only on one condition: that they get  it through their employer. It is not
surprising, then, that this tax  bias in favor of health insurance through the
place of work has  created an employer-based health insurance market to the
practical  exclusion of often better alternatives. The employer-only system 
means that if workers lose or change their jobs, they also lose their  health
insurance. This anxiety about losing health benefits gives rise  to the twin
problems of a lack of &quot;portability&quot; and &quot;job lock.&quot;   The
portability problem is caused by the inability of Americans  to transfer their
health insurance from job to job. The related  phenomenon of job lock occurs
when an employee or family  member does not move to a more attractive job for
fear of losing  health benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This tax penalty against paying for health care directly or  obtaining
insurance from any source other than an employer must  be ended. Americans
should no longer be penalized for wanting  the security of owning and
controlling their own health care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Health care costs for working people must be brought  down 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  without sacrificing choice.</B>
While corporate premiums have  dipped during the past two years, health care
costs are still too high.  As employers try to control costs, they often simply
make  workers and their families pay a progressively larger share of the  health
insurance premiums, or else enroll them in managed care  plans which are far
more restrictive than traditional indemnity plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain to the public that the way to  bring down health
costs is not to provide less, but to improve the  efficiency of the health care
system by stimulating much greater  consumer choice and competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The movement to reform the health care system gains much of  its momentum
from the spiraling cost of medical care in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>National health expenditures reached 13.9 percent of gross  domestic product
($884.2 billion) in 1993 and reached  approximately 15.6 percent ($1.1 trillion)
in  1995.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#1">1</A>  This compares with
$251.1 billion in 1980, when national health expenditures were just  under 10
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While few Americans even know how much the country as  a whole spends on
health care, they do worry about the rising cost  to them personally, as
individuals or as business owners.  Typically, people mistakenly blame rising
costs on drug manufacturers,  insurance companies, physicians, and hospitals.
But the rapid growth  in medical expenditures actually is attributable to the
rising  demand for medical services and new technologies and, more 
significantly, to the peculiar way in which the tax system treats health 
insurance, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  which leads to an artificial
employer-based system for most  working Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major factor in determining access to health insurance  coverage is
employment. 
</P>
<P>Overwhelmingly, working Americans receive their health  benefits through
their employer. The reason: For most working  Americans to obtain any tax relief
for health care costs, they must ask  their employer to earmark part of their
worker's compensation to  pay for a health insurance policy that the employer 
not the worker   then owns. This tax break ties health insurance to the place of
 employment. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explains:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     Tying health insurance to employment causes further 
inefficiencies. Workers who are sick or who have a sick  family member can get
trapped in their jobs because most new  insurance policies will not cover the &quot;preexisting
condition.&quot;   Finally, because insurance is tied to one's job, it is 
inherently insecure. Employees can lose their insurance if they lose  their jobs
or if their employer stops carrying  insurance.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#2">2</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax benefit for having employment-based coverage (and  thus the penalty
for not obtaining a plan in this way) is huge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     In 1996, the federal treasury will lose
approximately $93 billion  in foregone revenues, given the tax-exempt status of
employer  contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care. 
Households with income of $50,000 or more will share  approximately $53 billion
in tax relief on health care, compared to  households earning $20,000 or less,
which will receive only $5.4 billion in  tax relief.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#3">3</A> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Lower-income employees normally receive no tax relief for  any
out-of-pocket expenses (such as deductibles and copayments);  nor, except in
very unusual circumstances, would they receive tax  relief or subsidy for a
health insurance policy obtained from any  other source.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Only health insurance is tied to the place of employment in  this way. Other
major forms of insurance, such as  automobile, homeowner's, mortgage, and life,
are not normally tied to  an individual's place of employment. This constricts
the market  and eliminates a worker's personal ownership of an insurance plan. 
It also has other serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     The current tax treatment of employment-based health  insurance
fuels higher health care costs.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the CBO:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Employment based health insurance is valued by  businesses
through tax subsidies. Yet those subsidies exacerbate the  high cost of health
care as well as some of the problems of the  uninsured people. Because the
amount of the subsidy  increases with the size of the health insurance premium,
the subsidy  not only encourages employers to provide insurance but also 
encourages them to provide the most expensive health  insurance policies.
Employees who have a choice among health  insurance options are more likely to
choose more expensive  plans because they have to pay only part of the
additional  costs.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Lower-income individuals and families are helped least by  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  current system of tax relief for
employment-based health  insurance.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO points out that individuals and families at the upper  end of the
income scale receive far greater tax relief under the  current tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance. Those  who need the most assistance 
middle-income and lower-income  earners  benefit the least. In some cases,
lower-income wage  earners realize no benefit at all. The CBO states that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>[F]amilies with higher incomes receive larger tax  subsidies
because they are in higher income tax brackets. Thus,  the reduction in taxable
income that the exclusion produces  is worth more to them on average than it is
to families in  lower tax brackets. Because the income tax is progressive, 
people with relatively high incomes (and higher tax rates), who  may need the
least assistance in getting health insurance,  benefit the most from the tax
exclusion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#5">5</A>
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, households with incomes of $50,000 or over will  receive
approximately $53 billion in tax relief on health care, while  households
earning $20,000 or less will receive only $5.4  billion.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#6">6</A>  In short, this means that the
value of the tax exclusion is  heavily skewed towards upper-income groups at the
expense of  middle-income and lower-income groups. Lawmakers must explain to 
the American people why they favor perpetuating a government  policy which gives
little or no help to those lower-paid working  Americans who find it hardest to
afford medical care.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Employment-based health insurance hides not only the  true cost of
health care, but also who pays for this benefit.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major misperception that conservative candidates must  explain to the
American public is that employment-based health  insurance is not a &quot;free
benefit.&quot;  Employers give employees nothing;  health benefits, like wages,

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal tax treatment of health insurance is exclusive.  Americans can
get tax relief for health insurance on only one  condition: that they get it
through their employer. If they have a large  benefits program, the tax breaks
are generous, and they get a large  amount of tax-free income; if the employer
offers a less generous  benefits package, they get a less generous tax break.
Employees who  purchase health insurance on their own receive negligible tax
relief  in comparison to employment-based packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only other significant health tax break for employees  under current law
is that individuals who itemize deductions may  deduct what they have paid
during the taxable year (if not reimbursed  by insurance) for medical care
(including medical insurance) to  the extent that the total of such expenses
exceeds 7.5 percent of  their adjusted gross income (AGI). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employees and their families without adequate  employer-provided insurance
must go without insurance altogether or purchase  individual policies outside of
employer-based insurance. But  these individual policies are marketed on an
individual basis and  thus are considerably more expensive. Worse, a worker and
his  family will have to pay for these policies with after-tax dollars,  making
their purchase substantially more expensive than a similar  package of benefits
offered through an employer tax-free. For most  middle-class Americans, health
insurance outside of the  employer-based system is not a financially realistic
option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the federally created constraints on the health  insurance market,
which basically limit Americans to one type of  insurance option (employer-based
insurance), it is not hard to see why  employees often are unable or unwilling
to move or change jobs,  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  when career opportunities promise
better lives for them and  their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It also is not surprising that uninsurance in the United States  is largely
a function of employment status. According to the  Employee Benefit Research
Institute (EBRI), a prominent  Washington think tank specializing in job-based
benefits, some 55.5 percent  of uninsured Americans are uninsured because of
loss of jobs  or change of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uninsurance also is highly correlated with employment in  small businesses,
or businesses with smaller profit margins. Under  the federal tax code, workers
in small business are not on a level  playing field with workers in large
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Employment-based coverage, like public programs, has  fostered the
rise in third-party payments.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1980, the amount of insurance premiums  paid by American
employers for their employee group insurance  policies increased by more than
352 percent. During the  mid-1980s, premium increases were between 6 and 8
percent annually;  by 1990, they once again were in double digits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992, group health insurance plans amounted to  approximately 81 percent
of all insurance costs paid by employers in private  industry; group life
accounted for 2.5 percent; and worker's  compensation insurance accounted for
almost 16  percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of Medicare and Medicaid has contributed to the  trend toward
third-party payments. By 1992, private insurance and  gov

accounted for coverage provided  to 217 million Americans.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike automobile insurance, which provides for accidents  and other
unexpected events, medical insurance typically pays for  routine medical
services such as dental examinations. To  understand why third-party medical
insurance for routine services helps  drive up costs, consider what would happen
if automobile  insurance worked this way: It would cover not only damages due to
 accident or theft, but also all regular repairs, regular oil changes, and 
other routine expenses  perhaps even a weekly fuel fill-up. Now  suppose that
the insurance policy was paid for by the driver's  employer. The driver would
have little incentive either to question  a mechanic who said a certain repair
was needed or to quibble  about the price. The result would be predictable: a
rapid rise in  automobile repair and servicing costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>HOW EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO COST INCREASES WITH MANAGED CARE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the increased utilization of third-party payments, the  rate of
increase in health care costs has slowed in recent years.  Between 1992 and
1993, medical care prices, as measured by  the Consumer Price Index for Medical
Care (CPI-MC), rose by  just 5.9 percent.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One factor contributing to the recent reduction in growth has  been the
increased enrollment of workers by their employers in  man
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  aged care organizations. In the
private sector, at least, these  arrangements are less expensive than
fee-for-service or  traditional indemnity insurance plans. Managed care
organizations are  networks of doctors and hospitals in which the patient faces 
varying levels of limitation in the choice and availability of services.  They
include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</B> HMOs generally  provide a
defined set of health services to an enrolled  population within a specified
geographic location. Providers usually are  reimbursed on a capitated basis,
which is pre-determined by the  HMO. By December 1994, there were 574 HMOs with
a total  enrollment of 51.1 million persons, or about 19.5 percent of the U.S. 
population.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs).</B> Developed in the  1980s,
the PPO tries to achieve the same type of cost savings as HMOs  by directing
patients to certain providers that have agreed to  cost-effective methods of
care delivery as prescribed by the PPO.  However, the PPO also gives patients
some degree of flexibility  and freedom by allowing them to select providers of
their choice at  a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Point-of-Service (POS) Plans.</B> POS plans combine the features  of
HMOs and PPOs. They utilize a network of selected,  contracted participating
providers, and if an employee goes to a plan  provider, there are minimal or no
out-of-pocket expenses. Enrollees also  can go to a provider not in the plan,
but will be charged  significantly higher copayments or deductibles.

<P><B>Who Are the Uninsured?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is routine to read that as many as 41 million people, or about  18
percent of the population, are uninsured. This estimate is  correct, but it also
hides more than it reveals. Americans need to be  reminded that 82 percent of
the nonelderly and 99 percent of  the elderly (aged 65 and over), or 215.7
million individuals, were  covered by private or public health insurance in 
1993.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#13">13</A>  Why the seeming
contradiction?  Because millions of the uninsured  lack coverage for only a
short time, typically between jobs (a  problem that nevertheless must be
addressed). Furthermore, most have  access to health services if they choose to
use them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most commentators tend to view the uninsured as a large,  undifferentiated
mass. A closer look, however, reveals that they fall  into three broad
categories: the &quot;temporarily&quot; uninsured, who are  without insurance
only briefly or intermittently; the &quot;voluntarily&quot;  uninsured, who
choose not to pay for medical coverage, although it  is accessible to them and
affordable; and the &quot;chronically&quot;  uninsured, who want to be covered
but cannot obtain affordable  coverage. The last category is the most troubling,
since 50.7 percent  of the uninsured in 1993 were in families with income under 
$20,000 annually.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#14">14</A>  It is this
relatively small segment of the  population that liberals often talk about but
have failed to help for the past  40 years. They represent a serious problem
that conservatives  must address.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of those seeking to address the weakness of the U.S.  health care
system look to Canada's single-payer,  government-controlled system. Although
Canada spends less on health care as a  percentage of gross national product (10
percent in 1995) than does  the United States (15.6 percent in 1995), its
per-capita health care  expenses are still the second-highest in the world,
outranked only  by those in the United States.

<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, it is important to understand how Canada's  lower spending affects
care.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Canada spends much less of its GDP on medical
research and  development, generally importing new technologies from the  United
States. The elderly, who tend to use health care services at a  higher rate, are

percent vs. 11 percent).

middle-class incomes,  the central and provincial governments are racing to

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicaid</B> was established as a joint federal-state matching  program.
It is an open-ended entitlement that pays for medically  necessary health care
services provided to specific groups of  low-income individuals. Individuals
eligible for Medicaid now  include the aged, disabled, pregnant women with
children, and the blind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending on Medicaid is out of control:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>*</CITE></B>     In FY 1995, Medicaid cost taxpayers $156.5
billion. Of  this amount, the federal government was responsible for 
approximately $89.2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#21">21</A> 
This represents an 11,050 percent increase  over the program's initial cost to
the federal government of $800  million in FY 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Remarkably, Medicaid was not intended to provide health  insurance to all
poor Americans. Originally, individuals became  eligible because of their &quot;categorical&quot;
relationship to two federal cash  assistance programs: Aid to Families with
Dependent  Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, 
congressional mandates since the late 1980s have resulted in  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  expansions in Medicaid
eligibility provisions. Now the  eligibility of individuals in additional
selected low-income groups is  based solely on the relationship of their incomes
to the federal  poverty level. In recent years, a progressively higher
proportion of  Medicaid spending is for nursing homes of formerly middle-class 
aged who have spent their resources and have become eligible for  Medicaid
custodial care. Each state is responsible for defining its  own package of
covered medical services, but some benefits are  mandated by Congress. These

<P>Many Americans still mistakenly believe that government  controls on the
price of pharmaceuticals, health insurance, and hospital  and physicians' fees
can reduce the cost of health care without  reducing either quality or
availability. Since the beginning,  Congress has been trying to keep down the
costs of Medicare and  Medicaid largely by reducing reimbursements as a way to
control the cost  of medical procedures. Since 1966, Congress has imposed 75 
different restrictions on doctors alone. In 1983 and 1989, respectively,  it
introduced the Prospective Payment System (PPS) of fixed  payments for
procedures in hospitals and the Resource-Based  Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), an
enormously complex  reimbursement schedule, in addition to balanced billing
limitations, to fix  prices 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  for doctors serving Medicare
patients.
</P>
<P>

<P>Such cumbersome controls have proved to be just as ineffective  in health
care as in every other part of the economy where they  have been tried. Faced
with price controls, doctors and hospitals  have responded like every other

<P><B>A Model for Health Care Reform: The Consumer Choice  That Members of
Congress Already Have
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and 9 million other federal workers and  retirees, as
well as their dependents, enjoy a very different system  of health care.
Candidates might want to suggest that  Congress should let Americans in on the
same kind of system it now  enjoys: a system based explicitly on the free-market
principles of  consumer choice and competition. This system, known as the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), enables almost  400 private
insurance carriers nationwide to compete for the  personal business of Members
of Congress and their staffs along with  almost 9 million federal employees,
retirees, and dependents. Once  a year, these special consumers can make their
personal choices. It  is virtually the only system in the country where
individuals  and families can pick and choose the kinds of benefits and 
insurance plans they want at prices they wish to pay. In any area of the 
country, federal workers and retirees can choose from among a  dozen to two
dozen plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each year, the government contributes a set dollar amount to  each
individual or family for the purchase of a private insurance plan  of their
choice. If they choose a more expensive plan, with a  richer set of benefits,
they pay more directly for those benefits. If  they pick a less expensive plan,
with a less generous set of  benefits, they are able to pocket the savings from
making such a choice.  All of the plans have catastrophic coverage and, health
insurance  experts with the National Association of Retired Federal  Employees
(NARFE) rate all of the plans offered as &quot;good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, the federal government's managerial role in  the FEHBP has
been passive. The Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), the federal agency
which administers the FEHBP, has  focused on negotiating with private insurance
carriers, setting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  basic ground rules for
competition among private insurers,  and making sure that private insurance
companies meet fiscal  solvency, consumer protection, and basic benefit
requirements  outlined in statute. While the FEHBP is imperfect, it has  many
strengths, particularly its level of consumer choice and  competition, the
bounteous benefits of a genuine market largely  unavailable to workers and their
families in employer-based  insurance. Compared with Medicare, the levels of
bureaucracy and  regulation are very low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Wide Choice.</B> Unlike most employees or Medicare 
beneficiaries who are locked into an inflexible standardized benefits  package
pre-determined for them by an employer or the government,  Members of Congress
can choose from a broad range of health  insurance options. Not only are they
allowed to choose from a  wide variety of private plans, with a variety of
prices and benefits,  but they also pocket the savings that result from their
own choices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excellent Cost Control.</B> While Americans typically are  being
herded into health care plans at their employers' discretion in  order to cut
down on corporate costs, Members of Congress and all  federal employees in 1996
will enjoy a solid range of benefits  and plans at insignificant premium
increases. Furthermore, many  federal employees will see no premium increases
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the government, federal workers in 1996 &quot;will find  a
total average premium increase of only four tenths of one  percent, compared to
an average private sector premium increase of  more than six percent over a
comparable  period.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#40">40</A>  For
1995, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Helpful Information for Making Choices.</B> The federal  government also
assists Members of Congress and federal workers and  retirees with unbiased
information on various health plans. But this  most often is not the chief
source of information on plan options.  A whole private-sector information
explosion has accompanied  the FEHBP. Members of Congress and federal workers
and  retirees can get helpful tips and advice from private-sector 
organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available  to
workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality,  and price.
For congressional and federal retirees, the National  Association of Retired
Federal Employees, which represents over  500,000 active and retired personnel,
suggests the best plans for those  needing specialized medical services.<I>
Washington Consumers  Checkbook</I>, a major publication available in

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Portability.</B> Within the federal workforce, there
are many  different functions and many different jobs. Federal workers can move 
from one job to another, or from one federal agency or department  to another,
and keep their health insurance plans. While  federal workers have a chance to
change insurance plans once a year,  most are satisfied with the quality and
service that their plans  provide them. If they belong to a union or an employee
organization,  they may wish  as approximately one-third of them now do  to 
retain their union-sponsored or employee organization-sponsored  health
insurance plan. Moreover, federal workers, unlike an  increasingly large number
of workers in the private sector, can take their  health insurance plan with
them when they retire, even if they retire  early at age 55. Because they have
this level of portability in their  insurance, they do not suffer the same kinds
of anxieties that  commonly plague workers and their families in the private
sector.

</P>
<P><B>The FEHBP as a Model for Health Care Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicare.</B> The basic market principles of consumer choice  and
competition that underlie the FEHBP are at the heart of  congressional efforts
to reform Medicare. Many of the key features  that federal workers and retirees
now find so attractive in the  FEHBP are incorporated in the congressional
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>First, like retired Members of Congress and federal workers,  Medicare
beneficiaries would be given a choice. They could keep  traditional Medicare, if
they wish, or they could choose from a  full range of qualified private health
care plans, including an  alternative fee-for-service plan; a managed care plan,
such as an HMO  or Preferred Provider Option; a &quot;provider service network&quot;
plan  (a plan run directly by physicians or hospitals); plans sponsored  by
private organizations or employers; or a special medical  savings account option
coupled with catastrophic health insurance  coverage. Like plans that compete
today for the dollars of retired  Members of Congress and federal workers, these
plans would have  to meet similar consumer protection, fiscal solvency, and core
 benefit requirements. In fact, the addition of the medical savings  account
option, which would allow Medicare beneficiaries to deposit  a significant
portion of the government contribution to a  tax-free account to pay routine
medical expenses, is a distinct  improvement over the current FEHBP, which does
not yet have a medical  savings account option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, like retired Members of Congress and federal  workers, senior
citizens could get better value for their money in a  competitive health
insurance market. Medicare currently spends  about 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  $4,800 per year for each
beneficiary. Under the congressional  reform plan, it would increase to $7,100
by the year 2002. Just  as federal workers and retirees get a specific
government  contribution for the purchase of private insurance in the FEHBP,
Medicare  beneficiaries would get a specific government contribution. With  this
contribution, not only could they choose the plan or option  best suited to
their personal needs, but they also could pocket the  savings of their personal
choices, getting cash rebates from the use  of medical savings accounts and
other private plans. In other  words, the congressional Medicare reform
proposal, by enabling  Medicare beneficiaries to pick and choose their plans and
options just  as federal workers and retirees do, introduces economic  dynamics
that are similar to those which drive the popular FEHBP. For  the past several
years especially, these dynamics have served to  improve the quality of health
care services and to hold premium  costs down below those of both the private
sector and the Medicare  program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming the Private Insurance Market</B>. The success of  the FEHBP is
not due to some mysterious managerial expertise  concentrated among bureaucrats
at the Office of Personnel  Management. It is due largely to the fact that
market forces do most of  the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; in this unusual, but
popular, system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 35-year experience of the FEHBP shows that individual  consumers,
properly armed with information, can make rational  health care insurance
choices. That experience also shows that  intense and direct competition among
insurance companies for  consumers' dollars can help control costs, just as
costs are controlled in  other sectors of the economy. On this basis, Members of
Congress  could construct a consumer choice health care system for every  Ameri
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  can that resembles, in its broad
outlines, the kind of  consumer choice and competition that is now enjoyed
almost exclusively  by Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees. But
to  do this, Congress will have to take very specific steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     First, Congress should establish neutrality in the
federal tax  code.</B> This could be done in one of two ways. The best way,
within  the context of reform, would be by enacting a flat tax. This means  that
there would be no tax advantage for insurance or for health  care services,
whether purchased through one's place of employment  or some other way. And
there would be no tax on the earnings of  savings accounts for health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Alternatively, every American family could get tax relief, in  the form of
a tax credit or a voucher, for the purchase of health  insurance or health care
services, regardless of the breadwinner's  place or status of employment. This
tax relief would be given to  individuals and families to use in a fashion that
best meets their  personal needs and circumstances: to offset the purchase of 
health insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenses, or the deposit of  funds in a
medical savings account, a tax-free account like an  individual retirement
account (IRA) in which funds roll over year after  year and from which
individuals or families could pay routine  medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Second, if households are to receive special tax
relief in the  form of credits or vouchers, the head of every household should
have  to purchase at least a basic package of catastrophic health  insurance.</B>
As with the FEHBP, Congress could set basic ground rules  for health insurance
or certify similar ground rules developed by  the states, including the
guaranteed renewability of health  insurance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  policies; a limitation on
exclusions for pre-existing medical  conditions; and limited underwriting of
health insurance that  is grounded in age, sex, and geography and provides for 
premium discounts for individuals or families who enroll in  preventive health
care or health promotion programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These tax and insurance changes would have a dramatic effect  by changing
today's health insurance market into a consumer  choice system. Like the FEHBP,
the private health insurance  market would benefit from intense competition
among private  insurance carriers, leading to an explosion of group insurance
options  outside of the place of employment and enabling trade associations, 
professional organizations, unions, employee organizations,  churches, and
religious institutions to sponsor their own health  insurance options for
workers and their families. Like the FEHBP, such  a market would put a premium
on the demand for information  on quality, price, and benefit. Outcomes research
would be in  demand for doctors and hospitals and medical groups. Consumer 
organizations and affinity groups, like the American Association of  Retired
Persons (AARP), would monitor performance and evaluate  different health plan
options and their doctors and hospitals.

<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration will long be remembered for its  attempt and
subsequent failure to federalize the American  health care system in 1994.
Criticizing the current system as wasteful  and bureaucratic, the Administration
initially enjoyed the support  of Americans in principle when it promised
security, simplicity,  sav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ings, choice, quality, and
personal responsibility. Moreover,  the President argued that sound reform
should be based on the  market principles of consumer choice and competition.
But the  record showed that President Clinton's costly, 1,342-page Health 
Security Act, an enormously complex and bureaucratic measure, was  anything but
an improvement over the current system. On the  contrary, and despite the
repeated denials of Administration  officials to this day, the Clinton
Administration's huge and complex  health reform legislation attempted to bring
one-seventh of the  U.S. economy under government control.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#41">41</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the subject of Medicare, President Clinton has refused to  consider any
major reform since the 1994 election. Rather than  overhaul the program so that
it can provide benefits to the next  generation, the Clinton Administration
Medicare reform plan  would achieve modest budget savings largely through even
tighter  controls on doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to Guy King, a spokesman for the prestigious  American Academy of
Actuaries and former Actuary of the Health Care  Financing Administration
(HCFA), &quot;It is similar to the quick  fixes enacted in the past that have
allowed the Medicare program to  fall into its current financial state. This
proposal also includes  accounting tricks to achieve short term fiscal soundness
in the  hospital insurance program. In the long run, these tricks may undermine 
the economic discipline of the trust fund.&quot;<A

</P>
<P><B>THE 104th CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the first session of the 104th Congress, federal  lawmakers took
important steps to improve the functioning of the  American 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  health care system. Of the
several legislative proposals  introduced to reform the current health system,
the most important was one  to reform the financially troubled Medicare program.
Virtually all  of the others were narrow adjustments in existing law or 
incremental reform proposals. Some of the key changes, including  Medicare
reform, were incorporated into the Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which was
vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicare. </B>In the fall of 1995, Congress passed  sweeping
Medicare reform which would have given the elderly  real choices in their health
care delivery for the first time while  taking important steps to stave off
bankruptcy and help restore  financial solvency to the program. While these
reforms are both  important and necessary, however, taxpayers should realize
that, despite  the level of bitter controversy surrounding them, they still fall
far  short of a permanent fix for the financially troubled Medicare  system.
They are serious structural changes, but still merely defer the  financial
collapse of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund  until 2010. Baby boomers
make up a huge bloc of future retirees, but  no one age 49 and under is
guaranteed, under any of the  proposals offered for congressional consideration
in 1995, that the  current Medicare program will be available upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of the key elements embodied in the vetoed  congressional Medicare
reforms include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  An option to pick private plans.</B> The legislation
offers  beneficiaries the option of enrolling in a private health plan as an 
alternative to traditional Medicare. These private plans are referred to  as &quot;MedicarePlus&quot;
plans. MedicarePlus plans include 1) a  coordinated care plan (HMO, PPO);  2) a
combination of a high-deductible plan and contributions to  a high-deductible
Medicare medical savings account; 3) plans  offered by a Provider-Sponsored
Organization (PSO); 4) a  union, Taft-Hartley, or qualified association plan;
and 5) a  fee-for-service plan that reimburses providers on the basis of a
privately  determined fee schedule. Groups such as the American Association  of
Retired Persons (AARP), United Auto Workers (UAW),  and churches could sponsor
health plans under the MedicarePlus  program. By introducing a much greater
degree of consumer  choice within a competitive market, the reform could be
expected to  reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending. Traditional 
Medicare would remain available as an option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  A defined contribution.</B> One of the key elements in the 
congressional reform proposal is to turn Medicare benefits into a  defined
contribution from the government towards the purchase of  a MedicarePlus plan,
as opposed to today's open-ended  entitlement to specific services.
Congressional budget projections indicate  that the amount available for
retirees would rise from $4,800 to  $7,100 per capita from 1995 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the reform, the federal government would make  monthly premium
payments to the MedicarePlus plan chosen by the  beneficiary. To ensure
stability in payments to MedicarePlus plans,  the government's contribution
levels would be adjusted to  recognize legitimate variations in the costs of
doing business in  different geographic areas. If beneficiaries wished a more
generous  plan, they would have to pay the difference. But if they chose a  more
economical plan that cost less than the defined contribution,  they would be
allowed to receive 75 percent of the difference, with  the remaining 25 percent
being deposited in the HI trust fund. If  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  enrollee elected a medical
savings account (MSA) option, the  entire rebate would be deposited into that
individual's MSA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  A new Medicare trust fund.</B> Liberals in Congress claimed  that
projected savings from the reform would be used to pay for  tax cuts. This is
incorrect. The Medicare reform created a &quot;lock  box&quot; mechanism to
place all savings from the Part B program into  a new Medicare Preservation
Trust Fund and specifically  prohibit any transfers to pay for future tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Creation of Provider-Sponsored Organizations and other  group plans.</B>
To make Medicare more competitive, the  congressional reform created a new
option for the elderly to purchase their  health insurance  Provider-Sponsored
Organizations (PSOs). These  are managed care plans created primarily by
physicians and  hospitals. In addition to expanding the range of choices and
creating  more competition within the MedicarePlus program, it is widely 
believed that providers (physicians and hospitals) in smaller  communities would
be better able to find efficiencies in providing  access to health care than
some of the more traditional insurers.  Certain rules applied to the PSOs are
not applicable to other  private plans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#43">43</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicaid. </B>According to the Congressional  Budget Office,
the federal government alone spent $89.2 billion in  FY 1995 on Medicaid.
Medicaid costs have been exploding.  Like Medicare, Medicaid is plagued with
internal inefficiencies, as  well as rising costs. And as with Medicare, failure
to address  these problems translates into direct and painful tax increases  on
America's working families. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing
program within the federal budget.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governors have testified before Congress about the  increasing strain that
exploding Medicaid costs impose on their  respective budgets, often restricting
investment in such other crucial  human service programs as child welfare,
education, public safety,  and judicial services. Responding to this financial
crisis,  Congress passed a block grant reform proposal which would enable states
 to provide medical assistance to low-income individuals and  families with a
much greater degree of flexibility. Allowing the states  to determine who is
eligible under their new programs would  eliminate the bureaucratic morass that
has resulted in mandatory  coverage for individuals whose needs are no greater,
and often are  less, than those of others for whom coverage is  prohibited.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this measure. The main difference  between the
vetoed block grant proposal and the current program  is that states would have
been given much wider latitude in  determining which segment of the population
is eligible for the new  program. States were permitted to cover any individuals
up to  250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 1995, this would  have meant
up to $31,475 for a family of three. Under the  congressional reform measure,
the states would be required to cover two  groups of qualifying individuals:
pregnant women and children aged  12 and younger living in families with income
below the federal  poverty level, and disabled individuals (as determined by the
state).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>States also would have been required to meet minimum  spending obligations
for each of three specific groups of beneficiaries:  1) families with income
below 185 percent of poverty with a  pregnant woman or child; 2) elderly
individuals; and 3) disabled  individuals. For each group, the minimum
percentage each state  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  be obligated to spend is 85
percent of the amount the states  were required to spend on mandatory services
(including nursing  facility services) under current Medicaid law during FY
1995. The 85  percent requirement also would apply to payments for Medicare 
premium assistance for low-income elderly persons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Special Needs of Children.</B> The legislation recognized the  unique
needs of children with special health care problems. Children  with serious
chronic conditions or disabilities such as cerebral  palsy, cystic fibrosis,
cancer, or heart conditions represent  approximately two percent of all children
in America. Despite their  relatively small numbers, however, the intensity of
care provided to  this population is high and requires particular attention.
Therefore,  the congressional Medicaid reform required states to outline  their
plans for providing care to children in their jurisdictions with  special health
care needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the congressional reform proposal, states were required  to include
descriptions of their objectives, goals, and methods  employed to achieve such
results. With regard to objectives  and goals, the states were to be allowed to
take into consideration  their financial resources, economic conditions,
adequacy of  existing infrastructure, and  most important  their own particular 
priorities. Current legal protections designed to protect the spouses  and adult
children of nursing home residents against  impoverishment were maintained in
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Nursing Care Standards</B>. While the elderly constitute less  than 25
percent of the Medicaid population, the mounting costs  associated with
long-term nursing care account for approximately  70 percent of the program's
costs. The bill retained the quality  assur
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  ance standards for nursing homes
that were passed in the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987).
OBRA  1987 reformed the Medicaid requirements for nursing homes  participating
in the program. The Medicaid reform in the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995 retained
these quality assurance provisions,  which include the following:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) A comprehensive list of requirements</B> that nursing
homes  must meet in order to be certified to participate in Medicaid,  including
requirements about assessments of residents, available  services, nurse
staffing, nurse aide training, and resident rights;

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restoring Tax Deduction for Self-Employed Buying Health 
Insurance.</B> Congress passed legislation that would permanently  increase and
extend the tax deduction for health insurance costs of  self-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  employed individuals from 25
percent to 30 percent. The bill  was signed into law by President Clinton.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#46">46</A>  The Balanced Budget  Act of
1995, vetoed by the President, also included an  amendment which would gradually
increase the 30 percent deduction to  50 percent between 1996 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medical Savings Accounts.</B> The Balanced Budget Act included  a
provision to allow Americans to establish medical savings  accounts (MSAs). This
revolutionary change in health care  financing promises to have a significant
impact on the functioning of  the health insurance market. Contributions of up
to $2,000 for  individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer 
contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income. 
Interest earned on the income is subject to taxation.  Withdrawals made for
non-medical expenditures would be included in  the individual's gross income and
subject to a 10 percent tax  before age 59 and a half. After that, withdrawals
could be made for  any purpose without the 10 percent tax. For a health plan to
be  classified as a catastrophic coverage plan, the minimum  deductible would
have to be $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improving Portability of Coverage.</B> Representative Bill  Thomas
(R-CA) introduced a bill (H.R. 1610) to end the problem of  &quot;job lock&quot;
that has been created under employment-based health  insurance systems. The
legislation would allow individuals  moving from one job to another to remain
continuously covered even  if they suffered from pre-existing medical
conditions. With the  use of pre-existing condition exclusions by insurers thus
limited,  individuals moving from one employer group health plan to  another
would not normally be subject to such exclusions. At the end  of the first
session, this bill was pending in the full Committee  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A similar bill (S.1028) was introduced in the Senate by  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS). Like the Thomas bill, S. 1028  would limit exclusions for
pre-existing conditions. By prohibiting  health plans from limiting or denying
coverage for more than 12  months for a medical condition that was diagnosed or
treated during  the previous six months, it is intended to alleviate some of the
 burdens facing workers trapped in an employment-based health  system. The bill
also would modify the Consolidated Omnibus  Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA).
Under current law, COBRA states  that workers in a firm with over 20 employees
can remain insured  between jobs by continuing their enrollment in the company's
 plan, paying the premiums themselves, for 18 months after they  leave the
company. Coverage for spouses and dependent children  remains in effect for a
total of 36 months in cases of death or  divorce. S.1028 extends the length of
coverage under  COBRA. While this is viewed by some as a consumer protection
measure,  it has potentially harmful effects because it would increase the 
costs of health insurance to employers who ultimately pass on any  additional
costs to active employees. In general, healthy  ex-employees decline COBRA
coverage while high risk ex-employees  accept and pay directly for coverage.
However, the employer is  required to pay the actual claims costs for former
workers who elect  COBRA coverage.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Incentives for Long-Term Care Insurance.</B> Included  in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was a provision which  would encourage individuals
to purchase private long-term care  insurance. By allowing tax-free withdrawals
from an individual  retirement account (IRA) and other pension plans to purchase
 private 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  long-term care insurance, it
would help alleviate the financial  pressures of the Medicaid program, which
spent $14.5 billion in  FY 1990 for nursing home care alone.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Delivery Options for Seniors  Medicare Select.</B>  Last
summer, Congress also enacted legislation to amend the  Social Security Act to
permit so-called Medicare Select policies to  be offered in all states. The
measure was signed into law by  President Clinton. The new law would: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Provide a three-year extension of
the Medicare Select  program. Under Medicare Select, beneficiaries have the
option to  purchase their Medigap (Medicare supplemental) policies through 
managed care networks. Studies have shown that Medicare Select  products have
saved beneficiaries between 10 percent and 37 percent  in premiums over the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare  supplemental programs. This has translated
into savings of up to  $300 per year for many seniors.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#47">47</A>  Especially for those on fixed

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Fix Medicare and Medicaid.</B> The Medicare program is 
facing bankruptcy. It must be fixed, or the current and future  generations of
taxpayers will be burdened with unprecedented increases  in levels of taxation
required to sustain it. Likewise, exploding  Medicaid costs also must be brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress passed legislation in 1995 to address these problems,  but the bill
was vetoed by President Clinton. The reforms would  have helped restore the
finances of Medicare while giving new  choices and security to the elderly. In
1997, these reforms should be  enacted into law. Clinton also vetoed structural
reform of  Medicaid  a reform which would have integrated Medicaid into the rest
 of the welfare system and given states the flexibility to find ways  of keeping
down costs by improving efficiency. This  legislation needs to be enacted in
1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt the flat tax.</B> For reasons of general tax reform, many  Members
of Congress want to overhaul the entire federal income  tax code, simplify it,
and replace it with a flat tax (either as a flat  income tax or as a sales tax).
The flat tax proposal is perhaps  the best way to bring neutrality to the tax
code and eliminate the  inequities and inefficiencies of the current tax
treatment of health  insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax, there would be no special tax exclusion on  the monetary
value of health care benefits provided through the  place of work. All health
benefits, like wages and other  compensation, would be counted as taxable income
and would be taxable at a  flat rate. Because there would be no built-in bias
toward  employment-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  based health insurance and no
discrimination against  non-employment-based health insurance, whether group or
individual,  Americans would have a powerful incentive to seek the best value 
for their money, weighing the quality and service of a benefits  package against
the price. Certainly, employers may still wish to  offer insurance or get good
group rates for their insurance; but  an employer's preferred option no longer
would have an exclusive  tax advantage, and thus would be in competition with
packages  sponsored by other organizations, including unions, trade 
associations, or other entities offering different packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A second advantage of the flat tax approach is that it  eliminates the
current tax advantage of third-party payment. Today, there  is no tax advantage
to paying for medical services directly. From  a tax position, it is best if
payment for health care services can  be accomplished through a third-party
payer. If Americans were  no longer penalized for paying directly, doctors and
hospitals  would receive cash payments more often from patients themselves. 
Moreover, cost control would be more effective; a dollar paid for  services
directly would have to be less expensive than a dollar paid  to a doctor through
the administrative apparatus of a third-party  payment system. And when
insurance companies weighed such  features as co-payment and deductibles, these
features would be  offered to consumers without the bias of the tax code
affecting  how they are determined.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax option, help for lower-income people  those  who are
ineligible for Medicaid or assistance for the unemployed   can be simplified and
secured through the adoption of a  straight voucher system. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Short of a flat tax, establish an individual tax credit for health  care
spending and MSAs.</B> If it should decide to forego reforming  the tax code by
establishing a flat tax, Congress could achieve  neutrality in the treatment of
health care by establishing an individual  tax credit to replace the current tax
exclusion for  employment-based health insurance. The amount of the tax credit
can be varied  by income level and family status to control the cost of the 
subsidy and target the benefits.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#48">48</A>
 A refundable tax credit for health  insurance, medical services, and
contributions to a medical savings  account would enable lower-income Americans
to buy into  the health insurance market on the same terms as all other 
Americans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#49">49</A>  By providing a
larger subsidy for low-income families,  a credit would encourage more people to
secure health  insurance, reduce adverse selection, and discourage free  riders.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#50">50</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A tax credit approach also has the benefit of advancing solid  welfare
reform by encouraging work and targeting the benefits of  the credit to the
segment of the population that otherwise would  remain uninsured without
Medicaid, a key element of the  welfare system. While the goal of medical
coverage for all who want  to purchase it is realized more efficiently through
tax credits, such  a system also increases the numbers in the labor force. The 
CBO confirms this: &quot;[T]he credit would also reduce the current 
disincentive for welfare recipients to enter the work force. At  present,
welfare recipients can lose most of their benefits when they go  to work.... [A]
tax credit would reduce this  penalty.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#51">51</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Comprehensive legislation establishing an individual tax  credit, The
Consumer Choice Health Security Act (H.R. 3698,  S.1743), was introduced in 1994
in the House by Representative  Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and in the Senate by
Senator Don Nickles (R-OK).
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under this approach, Americans would be able to choose a  package of health
benefits according to their needs and those of  the family. Whichever plan is
chosen by the head of household,  the family would receive tax relief, in the
form of an individual  tax credit, for the purchase of the health plan. Most of
the cost of  the tax credits would be offset by the fact that they replace the 
current tax exclusion of health benefits. Additional savings in  Medicare and
Medicaid reforms, outlined in the Nickles-Stearns bill,  would offset the
remaining costs of the new tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the tax credit would replace the current tax exclusion  for
company-sponsored health plans. This means that instead of  having a tax break
for the plan picked by his employer, a  worker would be able to claim a sliding
scale credit, based on income  or health care needs, for the plan of his
choosing, as well as for  out-of-pocket expenses and contributions to a medical
savings  account.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#52">52</A>  The tax
credits would be refundable, meaning that if  the credit actually exceeded the
family's federal tax liability, the  government would pay the difference.
Middle-income families  would benefit significantly from a tax credit approach.
A tax credit  patterned after the Nickles-Stearns legislation would mean a net 
tax cut for every income group, including the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If a head of household was satisfied with the plan already  offered by an
employer, the family could continue to be enrolled in it. If  a worker preferred
a plan offered through a different  organization, such as a union, church, or
professional association, the  employer would be required to &quot;cash out&quot;
the actuarial value of the  worker's current benefits and give the money to the
employee to use  for another health plan. Under the legislation, employers would
 have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  to offer employees the right to
convert their current health  plans into individual policies, which employees
then would own.  Employers also would be required to add the value of their 
current coverage to the worker's wages, with each worker then able to  use the
money either to pay for the company-sponsored plan or to  buy coverage from an
alternative source. To make the system  simpler for employees, and to ensure
timely premium payments,  employers would be responsible for directing premium
payments (just  as they currently do for the company plan) to the health plans 
designated by their employees. Employers also would adjust  tax withholdings to
reflect the credit available to employees. If  a worker became unemployed, the
family would receive a  refundable tax credit (voucher) to offset the cost of
the designated  plan. Workers and their families would have health care
security,  since they would be able to own their health coverage and take it 
with them if they changed jobs, even during a spell of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the insurance system.</B> Tax reform does not eliminate  the
necessity of making certain changes in the rules governing  the health insurance
market. Companies should not exclude a  person from coverage because of
pre-existing illness or drop a person  because he gets sick; thus, there should
be both limitations on  such exclusions and guaranteed renewability of
insurance.  Moreover, underwriting procedures, and hence premiums, should
reflect  age, gender, and geographic location. Insurance companies,  however,
also should be able to offer premium discounts to individuals  who enroll in
programs to promote healthy lifestyles, or for  checkups and other steps taken
to detect or prevent illness. Ideally,  these reforms of the health insurance
market should be effected at  the state level.

<P><B>Short-Term Reforms</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Short of comprehensive health care reform based on overhaul  of the tax
system and free-market reforms, Congress can  pursue short-term, or incremental,
reforms. The central problem with  the incremental approach is that if it is not
done carefully and  deliberately, reform measures can lead in any conceivable
direction.  Liberals in Congress who have sponsored the Clinton plan or 
legislation establishing a Canadian-style system have a very clear goal:  a
government-run, highly regulated national health care system.  Unless
conservatives have an equally clear sense of where they  are going, they may end
up supporting short-term measures that  actually move the country closer to the
liberals' ideological  goal. Therefore, conservatives ought to evaluate any
proposal by  asking whether it promotes a genuine free market in health care; 
promotes real consumer choice and genuine competition; empowers  patients to
make the key decisions concerning their choice of  physician, insurance plan,
and benefit options; gives employees and  their families direct control over
their own health care dollars;  gives workers and their families the right to
own their own health  insurance plan and enables them to take it with them
wherever they  go; and reduces the bureaucratic overregulation and paperwork 
requirements characteristic of the current health care  system.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#53">53</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several reforms that would move toward a health  care system that
is more secure and controlled by families rather  than employers, insurance
companies, or the government: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Permit self-employed individuals 100 percent tax
deductibility  for health insurance.</B> The self-employed currently are allowed
to  deduct up to 30 percent of health insurance costs. While the  Bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  anced Budget Act of 1995 would
increase this to 50 percent  over the next 7 years, true tax fairness would
place individually  purchased plans and employment-based health insurance on the
 same level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require employers to disclose to workers the true cost of  employee
health benefits.</B> A huge obstacle to serious health care  reform is that too
many Americans think that their employer is  paying for their health care.
While, under an employer-based  system, the employer becomes the means for
transmission of  premium payment and takes a tax deduction for doing so, the
truth is  that households bear 100 percent of health care costs. This simple 
reform would give workers a clearer understanding of just  how much of their
compensation goes to cover health care costs.  It could be accomplished by
requiring a periodic statement on  the employee's pay stub specifying both the
amount the employer  has paid in health care benefits and the corresponding
amount  by which his cash wages and other compensation have been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allow employers and employees to contribute to flexible  spending
accounts that can be rolled over from year to year.</B> Many  firms allow
employees to contribute pre-tax income to a flexible  spending account, which
can be used to pay for out-of-pocket  medical expenses. Unspent end-of-the-year
balances, however, cannot  be rolled over; they revert to the employer. The new
Congress  should change the law and permit these nontaxable accounts to be 
rolled over tax free from year to year. If an employee leaves a firm, he  or she
should be able to retain the tax-free account for medical  costs in the form of
a medical savings or health security account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Promote medical malpractice reform.</B> Medical malpractice  costs 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  have contributed to increased
medical costs. In conjunction  with medical malpractice litigation, the current
legal system allows  unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. 
Non-economic damages do not include compensation for medical costs, 
rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses.  The fear
of frivolous malpractice suits has driven approximately  75 percent of all
doctors to perform unnecessary tests because of  the threat of liability.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#54">54</A>  The House passed legislation to
limit  non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice, but  the
measure died in the Senate under intense pressure from trial  lawyers' groups
and the threat of a filibuster spearheaded by  Senate liberals. Medical
malpractice and tort reform should be  addressed in 1997, but preferably at the
state level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt antitrust reform.</B> &quot;Safe harbors&quot; from federal
anti-trust  laws should be created for certain groups of doctors, hospitals, 
and other medical providers; for medical self-regulatory entities that  do not
operate for financial gain; for certain joint ventures  involving high
technology and costly equipment and services; for  certain hospital mergers; and
for health care joint ventures that would  increase access to health care and
enhance health care quality.  Current antitrust laws prohibit such arrangements,
and thus  frustrate efficiencies in the system which would reduce health care 
costs and benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similar reforms were passed by the 104th Congress as part of  the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995. These reforms are needed to  allow the creation of
Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSOs) as  another health plan option for
elderly and disabled beneficiaries,  thus adding to the available choices in the
private sector for senior  citizens. Rural areas especially would benefit from
the creation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  PSOs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>As a condition of any insurance reform at the federal level,  eliminate
state-mandated benefits.</B> The health insurance industry is  one of the most
highly regulated sectors of the American  economy. But regulation of health
insurance usually is within the  jurisdiction of the state, not the federal
government. A key component of  state regulation is the imposition of mandated
benefits on  insurance firms licensed at the state level. These mandates are the
product  of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where  medical
specialists and practitioners have succeeded in imposing  coverage requirements.
Over the years, the number and scope of these  benefits have grown
substantially, adding to the cost of  insurance plans sold to employers and
employees. Nationwide, there are  over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from
in vitro fertilization  to chiropractic care and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at  the federal
level. But in reforming the federal tax code to establish  an individual tax
credit or voucher system, Congress could  specify that the only legal
requirement for securing a tax credit is that  any plan receiving the proceeds
of such a credit must include  catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress should find it necessary to intervene in the  regulation of
insurance, this reform could be accomplished through  federal preemption,
requiring only catastrophic coverage for health  insurance. Such a measure would
substantially reduce the cost of  insurance for small business at the state and
local levels. It also  would allow for more pooling of insurance and ensure
consumer  protection against underinsurance, which is the true meaning of a loss
 or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  absence of catastrophic coverage.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if the comprehensive congressional reform measure had  not been vetoed,
however, significant problems would remain in  traditional Medicare and would
need to be addressed. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Taxpayer burdens for Part B are still too high.</B> The  Medicare
supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known  as Part B, is
voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying  a monthly premium 
currently $42.50 per month. This amount  is approximately 25 percent of the
program's costs today. Most  of the debate on Medicare has focused on the
impending  bankruptcy of the trust fund in Part A of the program, the part that 
reimburses hospitals. But in terms of the growing fiscal pressure on  working
families to sustain Medicare, a more serious problem is Part  B, which has been
growing at 12.5 percent a year. Under the  traditional arrangement that the
taxpayer pick up 75 percent or more  of program costs  the position supported by
the Clinton  Administration and liberals in Congress  the CBO projects that the 
taxpayer burden to finance Medicare Part B over five years will be  $589.7
billion over the next seven years (1996-2002). This amount  easily surpasses the
Clinton tax increase of $262 billion between  1994 and 1998, the largest tax
increase in American history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reforms passed by the House and Senate in 1995 and  vetoed by President
Clinton would have frozen the Part B  beneficiary contribution at the current
rate of 31.5 percent at least  through 2002. This is an improvement, but it
still would not fully  address the crushing future tax burden facing America's
working  families. Under every scenario, that burden will increase sharply, 
especially when the nation's 77 million baby boomers begin to retire.   
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the original contract  with America's
taxpayers was that they would pay for 50 percent of  the program's cost. That
contract between Congress and the  taxpayers was broken by Congress, leaving the
taxpayers to pay an  increasingly disproportionate share of the cost. Congress
should  restore the Part B premium to 50 percent of program costs for  average
Americans, as originally intended. More affluent  Americans should receive no
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should allow patients to contract privately with  doctors,
hospitals, and other medical providers.</B> Private contracting  arrangements
help both the beneficiary and the taxpayer. Under  such an arrangement, no
Medicare reimbursement claims would be  filed because none would be sought
either by the provider or by the  patient. This would occur at no cost to
insurance companies or  federal taxpayers. Second, beneficiaries would be free
to receive  their health care from any provider they chose without government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many elderly and disabled persons, for a variety of personal  reasons, have
expressed to their physicians a desire to keep the  federal government
completely out of the picture. However,  Section 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social
Security Act requires health  care providers to &quot;[c]omplete and submit a
claim for such services on  a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to
the carrier  on behalf of a beneficiary.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#55">55</A>  Surprisingly, the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which is responsible for enforcing this  statute, has
failed to put forth a clear policy against private  contracting. In <I>Stewart
v. Sullivan</I><U>,</U> 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal  judge Nicholas
Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and  Human 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Services had not articulated a
clear policy against private  contracting; thus, given the discrepancy between
statutory law and  existing case law, physicians remain uncertain as to which
law prevails  and fearful of possible reprisals from bureaucrats at HCFA who 
periodically threaten sanctions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should end this confusion, stop HCFA's  bureaucratic threats, and
protect the right of private contract and the integrity  of the doctor-patient
relationship.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> True portability comes only from owning your own  insurance
policy, much as you own your own life, auto, or homeowner's  insurance policy.
Under employer-based insurance, the  employer, not the employee, owns the
policy. Therefore, when a  worker changes his job or loses his job, he can't
take the policy with  him. Insurance regulation, while mitigating the
circumstances of  job changes or transfers, cannot establish personal ownership
of  health insurance policies. That is why insurance reforms can only 
approximate portability, a pale imitation of the real thing. Only  reforming the
tax code can change this arrangement, giving the  individual direct tax relief
for the purchase of insurance and  enabling the consumer to purchase his own
policy and keep it, regardless  of where he works.

<P>The health care system cannot be reformed unless you reform  the market for
health insurance, and the market for health  insurance cannot be reformed unless
you reform the tax treatment of  health insurance. The federal tax code
profoundly shapes and drives  the current system, distorts the health care
market, and frustrates  the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
The states  can change insurance regulation; they can change the rules 
governing the licensing of doctors and hospitals or other medical  providers;
but they cannot change the federal tax code, and thus alter the  basic dynamics
of the health care system. Unfortunately, too  many state health care reform
measures make matters worse by  adding even more mandates and imposing price
controls on doctors  and hospitals, further frustrating the market forces of
consumer  choice and competition.

Congress know that it is not mathematically possible to balance  the federal
budget without also slowing the growth in Medicare  spending. But even if the
federal budget were balanced, the current  level of Medicare spending  now
almost 11 percent per year   cannot be sustained. It inevitably will impose huge
tax increases on  working Americans or drain federal funding from other vital 
government programs. Writing in the prestigious 
<I>New England Journal of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  Medicine</I> in 1992, President
Clinton himself said that the  current and projected level of Medicare spending
was &quot;unacceptable.&quot;   Curiously, the congressional proposal to reduce
Medicare  spending to roughly twice the rate of inflation is similar to the 
proposal advanced by the President in 1993, when neither the federal  budget nor
the solvency of the Medicare trust fund was a pressing  issue for the White
House and the President was proposing to  use the savings from Medicare to
finance the Administration's  health care plan. A noteworthy difference is that
all of the Medicare  savings under the congressional plan would be plowed back 
into Medicare itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why, then, was there such a huge gap between the $128  billion the
White House plan proposed to save in Medicare and the  $270 billion proposed by
Congress? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There wasn't. The President's plan used its own rosy OMB 
assumptions of baseline expenditures (that is, under current  law). Because OMB
assumed a slower growth in Medicare spending,  the President had to cut less to
reach virtually the same actual  spending levels. Congress used the bipartisan
Congressional  Budget Office baseline, and so needed to save $270 billion over 
seven years. If one uses different baselines, one gets different  results. When
one uses the same baseline, the difference between  the White House and
congressional figures shrinks dramatically.  Using the CBO baseline, the White
House savings of $128  billion balloon into $192 billion, a difference with
Congress of $78  billion over seven years, or a little more that $11 billion a
year.  Taking premium charges into account, a Heritage Foundation analysis  of
the two proposals indicates that the real gap between the  White House and
Congress would be only $20.7 billion in spending  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 -->  seven years, or about one percent
of current Medicare  outlays.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#56">56</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The appearance of a large gap thus is based on the use of  different
baselines in the same media reports on the competing plans. It's  as if the
White House says the temperature today is 0 degrees  Celsius but Congress says
it is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and so seems to  create an unbridgeable 32 degree
difference. Mixing OMB and  CBO baselines is tantamount to mixing Celsius and
Fahrenheit  measures of temperature, and is equally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to push the elderly all into  managed care?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no plan to do so. The congressional Medicare  reform
plan does make managed care an option, but it also enables  the elderly to
choose other options, including fee-for-service plans  or medical savings
accounts, as well as traditional Medicare. In  any case, the Congressional
Budget Office, in examining the  likelihood of enrollment changes, estimated
that about 24 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries would belong to HMOs in 2002,
an increase  of about 10 percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#57">57</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why raise Medicare premiums to pay for a tax cut for  wealthy
Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums paid  by
beneficiaries do not finance the tax relief provisions in the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995. The Balanced Budget Act sought  to maintain the calendar year 1995
ratio of SMI premium  collections to program costs at 31.5 percent. Since
enrollment in the SMI  program is voluntary, an increase in premiums is not a
tax increase  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  those who choose to take
advantage of a taxpayer subsidy.  The premium  $42.50 per month as of January 1,
1996  is  equivalent to just 25 percent of the actual cost of the Part B
program.  The remaining 75 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the  general
revenue fund. When Congress established Medicare Part B  in 1966, it created a
taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by  the nation's elderly, setting it at
50 percent of the program's cost.  As you can see, Congress created a subsidy
for the nation's  elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently
the case. It  is ironic that most of the uninsured workers in America are forced
 to subsidize health care for the elderly through the mandatory  Medicare
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Haven't we heard before that the Medicare system is bankrupt?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, you have. The Medicare Board of Trustees have  been warning
Congress for years that the Hospital Insurance (HI, or  Part A) Trust Fund will
be exhausted by the year 2002. During both  the Reagan and Bush Administrations,
Congress was told  repeatedly that corrective action was necessary to avoid huge
tax increases  on working families or a reduction in benefits of similar 
proportions. Congress chose to ignore these warnings. For example, 
Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House  Ways and Means
Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare,  says the insolvency issue is
greatly exaggerated: &quot;I've read these  trustees' reports for years. They're
all pessimistic. I don't panic  over the insolvency question.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#58">58</A>  Even President Clinton 
acknowledged the impending crisis in an address to a joint session of  Congress,
seeking to maintain the 1995 calendar year ratio of premium  collections to
program outlays with a 27 percent  ceiling.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#59">59</A>  While the 27 percent ceiling
perpetuates a generous taxpayer subsidy to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  elderly, it is a modest
improvement over current law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do Republicans want to force senior citizens into  Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Republicans do not want to force senior citizens into  HMOs. The
Medicare reform proposal contained within the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995
assumes that the elderly should be allowed to  enroll in a plan with health
services and benefits that they  choose, not just one with options prescribed by
bureaucrats or politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP), which
covers approximately 1.6 million retired  federal workers, including former
Members of Congress, the  congressional proposal expands the opportunities for
individual  choice. Enrollees would be able to choose either traditional
Medicare or  a private plan in the MedicarePlus program. For an enrollee  who
chose to enroll in MedicarePlus, the choices available would  include a private
fee-for-service plan, a union plan, a  Taft-Hartley plan, a managed care option
(HMO, PPO, etc.), a  high-deductible policy combined with a medical savings
account (MSA), or a  plan offered through a church or an association such as the
 American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't I entitled to every penny that I paid into Medicare?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. Many elderly Americans wrongly assume they  are
getting back what they paid into the system. However, many  seniors are getting
back much more than they contributed,  assuming they contributed at all. The
Medicare health benefit package  offered in future years will be worth more than
the current  program, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  which is much more valuable than
the one offered in past  years.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#60">60</A>
 Since Medicare benefits are open-ended by design, their value  has risen
consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and  B) per enrollee was
worth approximately $4,800 in 1995.  According to the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which  oversees and administers Medicare, spending is
expected to  continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value
of  Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is  over $185,000.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#61">61</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the workforce  supporting the
current system is scheduled to retire beginning in  2010. The approximate ratio
of workers to people 65 or over is 4:7;  by the year 2030, only two workers will
be supporting each  beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate reserves and
weak  financing structure, unless reforms are instituted, workers will  face
higher taxes to finance the subsidy enjoyed by current  beneficiaries.

<a name="ISSUES">

<P><b>THE ISSUES</b>
<P>
<P>Immigration has re-emerged as one of the nation's more 
controversial political issues. In 1994, California's Proposition 187, 
designed to deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, received 
a resounding 59 percent of the vote, and a special Commission 
on Immigration Reform issued a report supporting a national 
computerized registration system for all workers to help enforce 
laws against the employment of illegal aliens. Legislation to 
strengthen law enforcement against illegal immigration and restrict the 
quota of legal immigrants is being considered in Congress. 
Candidates for public office in 1996 are very likely to be asked to take a 
position on immigration issues.
<P>
<P>One reason for this concern is the widespread impression that 
immigrants who come to America to take advantage of welfare 
contribute to the urban crime rate. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many people worry that recent immigrants are changing 
the face of America ethnically, culturally, and politically. 
Immigration from European countries is much smaller than in earlier 
years, while Hispanic and Asian immigration is much greater.
<P>
<P>Not only is the number of new immigrants under current law at 
an all-time high, but the concentration of these new Americans in 
five 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

states -- California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and New York --  
significantly magnifies their impact on local government 
services, including schools, emergency medical care, and welfare.
<P>
<P>The changing skills of immigrants also raise concerns. The 
proportion of highly skilled immigrants has declined in the past decade 
as the proportion of immigrants sponsored by close family 
members has increased. Refugees from political repression or ethnic 
persecution often arrive in this country without skills or other 
 resources and automatically are placed on welfare.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a particularly sensitive issue for 
many Americans, one that prompts them to worry about the price 
society pays for an &quot;open door&quot; policy. Illegal immigration involves 
not only people who sneak across the U.S. border, but also those 
who come as tourists or students and decide to stay. In 1986, legal 
sanctions were imposed on employers who hire unlawful 
immigrants, but they have been difficult to enforce because identification 
documents are easily forged. Legislation pending in Congress 
would create a national identification card for every 
American,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#1">1</a> but this worries many who feel that a national identification card would 
be a dangerous intrusion by government.
<P>
<P>Opinions about the merits of America's current immigration 
policy are sharply divided. Those who believe immigrants should be 
welcomed argue that the cultural and economic contributions of 
immigrants are part of America's historical tradition and that the 
economic benefits from more workers and people who start 
businesses and pay taxes far exceed any social 
costs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#2">2</a>  Those who think the demographic change is too great, on the other hand, note that 
current levels of immigration will cause Americans from the 
Euro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

pean ethnic groups that dominated this country for most of its 
history to become a minority of the population the middle of the 
21st century.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#3">3</a>
<P>
<P>But this is not just a political numbers game. It is an intensely 
personal issue for millions of Americans whose close family ties 
or business interests are regulated by the immigration law. 
Reuniting families is a primary goal of U.S. immigration law, and 
businesses in the rapidly growing high technology sectors of the 
U.S. economy, as well as American corporations with a 
multinational workforce, want the freedom to bring foreign-born employees 
and their families into the United States without excessive red tape.
<P>
<P>Most current immigration to the United States cannot be 
justified as bringing some general economic benefit to other Americans, 
but neither can it be attacked as an economic drain. Though 
national statistics do not clearly show any particular economic costs or 
benefits to the country as a whole,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#4">4</a> the family members and 
employers who sponsor immigrants believe very strongly in the 
economic contributions of the individuals they 
know.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#5">5</a>
<P>
<P>The abstract question  whether there is too much 
immigration today  tends to dominate the debate (along with the problem 
of illegal immigration). But the issue is hard to resolve. For 
those people directly affected, the concern is whether the 
government will permit a particular, valuable<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#6">6</a> person to live and work in 
the United States. For other Americans, the issues are less 
clear-cut. Candidates must be prepared to help their constituents 
resolve them.
<a name="FACTS"><P>
<P><B>THE FACTS

<P>
<P>Immigrants and Welfare</B>
<P>
<P>The generous welfare benefits provided by most states and 
the federal government are intended to help individuals and families 
in need. Many people take advantage of the this system to avoid 
assuming their family responsibilities and performing work. It 
certainly seems plausible that people from impoverished 
countries would want to come to the United States because of the 
higher standard of living, as well as to assume that many would come 
to be on welfare, since welfare benefits in the United States 
are higher than the incomes of most people in less developed 
countries. But there is no evidence that large numbers of working 
age immigrants come to America to go on the dole. 
<ul><P>
<li><P>The labor force participation rate among male immigrants is 
77 percent -- slightly higher than among native-born Americans 
(74 percent), according to the 1990 census. The highest labor 
force participation rate, 83 percent, is among Hispanic immigrants. 
<P>
<li>The median age for legal immigrants in 1993 was 28, 
slightly younger than the average American's age of 33. More than 80 
percent of immigrants arrive before age 45, and only about 
5 percent arrive after retirement age to join family 
members.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#7">7</a>
</ul><P>
<P>Newly arrived immigrants, &quot;legal permanent residents,&quot; 
generally are prevented from receiving welfare. They cannot receive 
most direct aid during their first three years<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#8">8</a> in the country 
because their sponsors' income is counted as their own during this 
period in determining eligibility. They also can be deported as a 
public 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->

charge if they use public benefits during their first five years in 
the country. Elderly immigrants, however, who typically are 
sponsored by their children, are able to take advantage of the 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program after five years. 
Their sponsors' financial responsibility ends, and SSI is an 
entitlement for those with a low income after age 65.
<P>
<P>The Immigration Reform Act of 1986, which established 
procedures to legalize immigrants, barred those taking advantage of 
the amnesty from receiving public benefits for five years. After 
that, they can receive welfare. Undocumented aliens are not eligible 
for most public assistance, except for emergency medical 
treatment under Medicaid and nutrition benefits under the Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The states were mandated by 
the 1986 immigration law to establish a computerized system, the 
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to screen 
the immigration status of non-citizen applicants for Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other federal benefit 
programs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#9">9</a>
<P>
<P>A recent study of welfare participation over a whole lifetime 
by immigrant families, based on the years they arrived in the 
United States, shows a trend toward increasing use of welfare among 
immigrants in recent decades.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#10">10</a>

<P>This trend in lifetime welfare outlays for the foreign born is 
explained by the demographic pattern of recent immigration 
rather than by a growing tendency among immigrants in general, most 
of whom are young men, to go on welfare. More elderly 
immigrants have a higher lifetime dependence on welfare benefits for 
elderly people than the native born because they have fewer resources 
in the form of Social Security, private pensions, and 
accumulated savings. In addition, the number of refugees and political 
asylum seekers coming to the United States has increased since the 
1960s, and this category of immigrants is eligible for welfare 
immediately upon arrival.
<P>
<P>Still, it is important to keep this in proportion:
<P>
<P><B>Elderly Immigrants </B>
<ul><P>
<li><P>Elderly immigrants show up on the welfare rolls in greater 
numbers than younger immigrants, or the native born. But 
immigrants over age 65 who have lived in the U.S. for at least 20 years 
are only slightly more likely to receive welfare than elderly 
natives 

(8.7 percent versus 6.9 percent). 
<P>
<li><P>Most native born recipients receive other retirement income, 
including Social Security, that is not counted as welfare. But 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available when other sources 
of income are small. For most of the elderly immigrants on SSI, 
their monthly check is their only source of 
income.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#11">11</a> 
<P>
<li><P>In 1982, there were 127,900 non-citizens receiving SSI. In 
1992, this number had increased to 601,000, equal to about 11 percent 
of the total elderly poor. It continues to increase rapidly: By 1994, 
it had climbed to 738,000.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#12">12</a>  SSI recipients also qualify for 
Medicaid, food stamps, and local welfare services.
<P></ul>
<P>Most non-citizens on SSI have relatives able to support them. 
Support is a condition of sponsorship for immigration, but after 
five years is no longer mandatory. After five years as a legal 
permanent resident, an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen, and 
no restrictions on welfare eligibility apply. Significant changes in 
the federal means-tested welfare standards were included in the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#13">13</a>  Welfare benefits for refugees 
and other &quot;qualified aliens&quot; would have ended after five years. 
The income of a sponsor would have been used to calculate 
eligibility for SSI and other means-tested entitlements, without a three- 
or five-year limit. The legislation also would have required all 
non-citizens to reapply for benefits, with the incomes of their 
sponsors to be used in the recalculation of eligibility. But even this 
regulation ends if the elderly immigrant qualifies for citizenship.

<P><B>Immigrants and Crime
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->

</B>
<P>
<P>Ethnic communities with a high proportion of immigrants 
typically are located in the inner city, where higher crime rates are 
common. The issue: Do immigrants cause crime, or do they simply tend 
to live in high crime-areas?  The notion that higher immigration 
rates and higher crime rates are causally related cannot be dismissed 
out of hand. In every ethnic group, young males commit most of 
the crime, and immigrants are predominantly young males  
particularly illegal immigrants. In the United States, moreover, 
economic opportunity often depends on education and cultural 
advantages that immigrants from poor countries do not possess. 
<P>
<P>Many Americans assume this makes immigrants more inclined 
to commit crimes. But it is wrong to assume that educational 
disadvantages and other factors mean that immigrants are more likely 
to be involved in crime than native born Americans.
<P>
<ul>
<P><li>For the nation as a whole, the number of non-citizens in prison 
is approximately the same proportion as the number from the 
general population.
<P>
<P><li>Of the five states with the largest proportion of alien prisoners 
in 1992  California, New York, Florida, Illinois, and Texas  
only New York had a greater share of non-citizens in its prisons than 
in the general population.

<P>
<P>The federal prison system has a much greater proportion of 
non-citizens (not necessarily immigrants) in custody than the state 
prisons, with approximately 25 percent. One reason for this is 
that federal law enforcement tends to concentrate on different kinds 
of crime, such as drug smuggling, in which foreigners on tourist 
or business visas are caught entering and leaving the United 
States. Federal prison statistics tell us nothing about criminality 
among immigrants. Among the non-citizens in federal prison, 80 
percent were convicted for crimes related to the war on drugs, 
including former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#14">14</a> 
<P>
<P>The ethnic groups represented among non-citizen prisoners 
also have no significant correlation with the size of those 
immigrant groups in the general population. If immigration in general were 
a source of crime, we would expect to find a higher statistical 
correlation between members of specific ethnic groups in the 
prison population and their share of the general population.
<P>
<P><B>The Burden on State and Local Governments</B>
<P>
<P>Immigration policy, including the control of borders to halt 
illegal immigration, is a responsibility of the federal government. 
But state and local governments have to support public schools, 
hospitals, emergency rescue, police and fire departments, and other 
services for immigrant communities -- including many illegals 
who 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

live and hide among the much larger legal foreign born 
population. Thus, if the federal government fails to secure America's 
borders, the states pick up the tab for illegals who receive services. 
The federal government clearly has failed to control the Mexican 
border. Moreover, the President and Congress annually set the 
quota for refugees, who are entitled to federal and local welfare 
benefits. The flood of political asylum seekers and foreign visitors 
who overstay their visa periods and melt into the population as 
illegal immigrants is entirely the result of Washington's failure to 
discharge its responsibility.
<P>
<P>Federal law requires state and local governments to provide 
public schooling<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#15">15</a> and emergency medical care for illegal 
immigrants. States have grown increasingly angry in recent years at what 
they see as an unfair financial burden placed on them by a federal 
government that is unwilling to enforce its immigration 
laws. California's Proposition 187 and other measures to deny state 
and local government services to illegal immigrants are prompted 
by the rising cost of services paid for by state 
taxpayers.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#16">16</a> 
<P>
<P>The governors of the most heavily affected states have 
demanded federal reimbursement of the estimated costs imposed by 
illegal immigration on their state and local governments. In 
Washington, this argument is made in support of legislation to strengthen 
federal immigration controls, particularly at the Mexican border, 
to stop illegal crossing.
<P>
<P>In the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress for the first 
time voted to eliminate one unfunded mandate (for emergency 
medical care, including childbirth, provided to illegal aliens) by 
authorizing a supplemental allotment of federal money to reimburse 
states. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->

The Act also explicitly disqualified payments for 
non-emergency medical care for illegal aliens under the Medicaid program. 
To comply with the rules and obtain federal money, medical 
providers would have had to determine the immigration status of 
patients, which they do not now do.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#17">17</a>  The legislation was vetoed by 
President Clinton.
<P>
<P><B>What is the cost of illegal immigration?</B> Illegal aliens are 
assumed to be a net cost to states. However, while they are 
among the poorest immigrants and pay fewer taxes than legal 
immigrants or the native born, many are employed and do not receive 
services paid for by taxpayers. Thus, figuring the costs that illegal 
immigrants impose on a community, and comparing this with 
benefits to that community from sales tax payments and other 
financial contributions, is no easy task. Illegal immigrants in general 
have more difficulty getting benefits from the welfare system than 
legal residents, and do not identify themselves as illegal if they do. 
As the RAND Corporation has observed, &quot;Congress, state, and 
local policymakers still have no reliable answers to basic 
questions about the costs and benefits of immigration for state and local 
governments, for the economy as a whole, and for the nature 
and speed of integration of new immigrants into U.S. 
society.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#18">18</a>
<P>
<P>A review of the econometric studies of the fiscal burden on 
state and local governments from immigration by the RAND 
Corporation found that &quot;there is general agreement that currently 
illegal immigrants contribute less than those who received amnesty, 
who, in turn, contribute less than legal immigrants, who contribute 
less than the native born. However, this finding merely reflects 
differences in the average incomes of these various groups rather 
than their immigration status per se.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#19">19</a>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>
<P>In nine different studies<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#20">20</a> examined by the RAND 
Corporation, the available data about the costs of immigration are 
conflicting and inconclusive. &quot;Existing studies of the costs of immigration 
do not provide a reliable or accurate estimate of the net costs and 
benefits of immigration  even wcosts/benefits are defined 
narrowly. Moreover, without reaching consensus on a host of conceptual 
and accounting issues, we doubt that additional studies will shed 
light on these important policy questions.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#21">21</a>  This is because they 
use different definitions for immigrants and public assistance, 
and even count tax revenues differently. Estimates of the per 
capita costs of providing federal, state, and local services to 
immigrants ranged from a low of $2,638 to a high of $4,476. The per 
capita revenue estimates varied from $1,051 to $3,644. When the 
costs and benefits were compared in each study, the conclusions were 
as widely apart as a surplus of $1,400 per immigrant to a net cost 
of $1,600.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#22">22</a>
<P>
<P>RAND's analysis of the six state and local government studies 
of the cost of immigrants found that the methods used to 
calculate costs and benefits tended to include a full list of outlays for 
public services but only a partial list of revenues, including transfer 
payments from higher levels of government. The flawed 
accounting methods showed that neither immigrants nor the native born 
pay their way at the state and local levels. Where estimates were 
made separately for immigrants and the native born, the studies 
found that the &quot;deficit&quot; for immigrants is larger. What the studies 
actually seem to find is only the higher average income, and 
higher taxes paid, by the native born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#23">23</a>
<P>
<P>States and local communities with large immigrant 
populations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->

probably have a disproportionate concentration among them 
of illegal aliens, who tend to be poorest. Mandates for social 
services and welfare, and lax enforcement by social workers of 
rules against aiding illegal aliens, probably impose a financial burden 
on those state and local governments. Because the federal 
government has failed to prevent the illegal immigration, the argument that 
the federal taxpayer should pay any imposed costs is sensible. But 
the size and nature of the costs of illegal immigration have not 
been clearly established. Moreover, the task of identifying the 
immigration status of almost all poor people in America's ethnic 
communities is one that state and local governments may not want to 
undertake.
<P>
<P><B>Are There Too Many Immigrants?</B>
<P>
<P>Many Americans are concerned that the higher rate of 
immigration to the United States in recent years may be too great for the 
cultural assimilation of so many people. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many commentators are concerned that this is 
changing the culture of America. 
<P>
<P>The assimilation of the foreign born could be a problem if 
their numbers were too great. The question is: Are they too great?
<ul><P>
<li><P>In 1993, more than 904,000 legal immigrants and as many 
as 300,000 illegal immigrants settled permanently in the 
United States. The decade 1981-1990 saw 7.4 million legal 
immigrants, which was almost double the 4.5 million who arrived in 
1971-1980. The decade of greatest immigration to the United States 
was 1901-1910, with 8.8 million new arrivals.

<P>
<li>In every decade between the Civil War and the Depression, 
e than 13 percent of the U.S. population; 
today, they are approximately 8 percent. 
</ul>
<P>The principal concern about legal immigration is that the rate 
is increasing every decade, and the current immigration rate plus 
the birth rate among the groups that are arriving in this country 
is higher than the birth rate for other Americans. 
<P>
<P>During the 1980s, immigration contributed 37.1 percent of 
the growth in the U.S. population. In the 1970s, it contributed 
32.6 percent.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#24">24</a>  In 1990, immigrant women aged 35 to 44 had 
given birth to an average of 2.2 children, compared with 1.9 
children among native born women in that age group. The fertility 
concern is amplified by the fact that a greater percentage of 
immigrants than of native-born Americans are of reproductive 
age.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#25">25</a>
<P>
<P>Although the proportion of immigrants in American society 
today is relatively low, and the numbers that come to the United 
States every year are well within historical levels, the demographic 
trend today will produce higher and higher proportions of immigrants 
in the general population. 
<P>
<P>By the year 2050, the proportion of immigrants in the 
general population will rise to approximately the same level as in the 
six decades following the Civil War (over 13 percent). But 
because the population of the United States has increased, and will 
continue to grow, the number of immigrants living in the 
United States by the middle of the next century will be about six 
times greater than in the earlier period.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->

<P>
<P>Another important demographic trend that concerns opponents 
of more immigration is the very significant increase in 
immigration from Asia and Latin America.
<P><ul>
<li><P>In 1981-1990, 37.3 percent of immigrants were from Asia, 
22.6 percent were from Mexico, and 18 percent were from other 
Latin American countries. The great wave of immigration to the 
United States after the Civil War was mostly from Europe and 
essentially Caucasian. But a large proportion of the late 19th century 
immigrants were from the very poor regions of southern and 
eastern Europe and were very different culturally from those who 
originally settled the United States.
<P>
<li>The demographic projection of population growth represented 
by immigrants and the children of immigrants shows that by 
the middle of the next century, Asian or Hispanic immigrants and 
their immediate children will account for roughly a quarter of 
the American population.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#26">26</a>  The population as a whole will 
change from today's proportions of 3 percent Asian, 9 percent 
Hispanic, 11 percent non-Hispanic black, and 77 percent non-Hispanic 
white to approximately 9 percent Asian, 13 percent non-Hispanic 
black, 19 percent Hispanic, and 59 percent non-Hispanic 
white.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#27">27</a>  These estimates do not account for changes that would result from 
intermarriage among members of these groups.
<P></ul>
<P>The concern that opponents of current immigration policy 
feel about too many immigrants in the next century is exacerbated 
by the tendency of immigrants to move into their own ethnically 
homogeneous communities. More than 90 percent of 
immigrants move into cities and live in highly visible ethnic enclaves. 
The increased visibility of Hispanic and Asian communities 
reinforces 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->

the issue, just as the ghettos of Irish and Jewish immigrants in 
the last century and black Americans from the rural South after 
World War I aroused concern. The immigrant population is much 
more concentrated in Southern California, Texas, New York, and 
Miami than in the rest of the country. 
<P>
<P> Just 12 metropolitan areas received 55 percent of new 
immigrants in 1993. One in every three new immigrants now settles in 
California. Of these, 3 in 5 choose to live in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. Los Angeles is now 40 percent foreign 
born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#28">28</a>
<P>
<P>The question is whether the current U.S. trend is 
toward balkanization or a melting pot. Do large concentrations of 
immigrants living in their own communities, near others with 
similar backgrounds and cultural practices, resist Americanization 
and sustain a separate loyalty to a minority group?  It is easier for 
large ethnic community to use a non-English language outside the 
home, and public schools can be forced to offer bilingual education. 
Assimilation into a more uniform American culture would seem 
less likely to occur, but the evidence actually indicates that urban 
concentrations of immigrants, particularly from countries from 
which large numbers have come, are more likely to become 
naturalized citizens.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#29">29</a>
<P>
<P>For example, in the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin 
complained: &quot;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, 
become a colony of <I>aliens</I>, who will shortly be so numerous as 
to Germanize us instead of Anglifying them, and will never adopt 
our Language or Customs any more than they can acquire our 
complexion.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#30">30</a>  But he was wrong. In New York and Chicago for 
example, the concentrations of Yiddish-speaking immigrants so 
char
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->

acteristic in the earlier period have disappeared.
<P>
<P>Opponents of current U.S. immigration policy maintain that 
assimilation of so many from the last great wave of 
immigration, which ended in the 1920s, was possible because (1) almost all 
immigrants came from Europe, and many from 
English-speaking countries; (2) the influx was stopped for a period of time to 
permit the assimilation of the immigrant minorities into the 
dominant American culture; and (3) the birth rate among the native 
born population was significantly higher than it is today. Only 27.8 
percent of the growth in the U.S. population came from 
immigration during the 1901-1910 peak period, compared with 37.1 percent 
in the 1980s.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#31">31</a>
<P><ul>
<li><P>But the current rate of assimilation is very rapid. Research on 
immigrants to Southern California that looks at the age cohorts 
of recent immigrants has found very rapid increases in English 
language proficiency, naturalization rates, occupational mobility, 
self-employment, and income, in addition to significantly reduced 
poverty rates.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#32">32</a>
<P>
<li>In Southern California, &quot;all immigrant children showed a 
tremendous rate of increase in English ability, though the trend was 
especially marked among Latinos.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#33">33</a>
<P>
<li>By looking at age cohorts of Latino immigrants who arrived 
in California in the 1970s, demographers can see that poverty 
actually declined from 25.7 percent to 15.7 percent as the 
15-to-25-year-old arrivals matured and became 
assimilated.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#34">34</a>
</ul><P>
<P><b>Should population patterns be changed?</b> Author Peter Brimelow, 
in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

his recent book<I> Alien Nation</I>, points out that the 1965 
immigration law, which opened the doors to higher rates of immigration 
from Asia and Latin America, was passed by Congress with the 
understanding that it would <I>not</I> change America's historical 
population patterns.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#35">35</a>  Since the law has caused such a demographic 
change, however, particularly as the 1986 amnesty for illegal aliens 
has further shifted the family reunification preferences in favor of 
very recent immigrants from Asia and Latin America, he argues that 
the pattern of immigration must be corrected.
<P>
<P>This raises both political and non-political questions about 
what immigration policy the United States should adopt. From a 
political standpoint: 
<ul><P>
<li>The American people as a whole do not get to choose the 
nation's future demographic profile. But on their behalf, Congress does 
set immigration quotas, and these can be written to discriminate 
either for or against people. 
<P>
<li>The federal government has a constitutional responsibility to 
control the national borders, and the requirement that foreigners 
entering the country must have a visa and submit to customs 
inspection is important in maintaining that control. 
<P>
<li>The federal government sets requirements on individuals 
wishing to live permanently in the United States: extensive 
documentation of good character, sponsorship for immigration, and financial 
responsibility. Additional requirements involving financial 
responsibility, English language proficiency, or ethnicity could be 
added by Congress. 

<P>
<li>Both the size of immigration quotas and the categories of 
people who qualify were set in the 1990 Immigration Act and may 
be amended in 1996. But determining whether to increase or 
decrease immigration quotas will have a very small effect on the 
long-term demographic profile of the country.
</ul>
<P>The non-political considerations of immigration policy affect 
the nation's demographic patterns. Within the quota system, 
individual families and employers control the decisions over who 
can immigrate to America by virtue of their power to sponsor 
those individuals. Particular families or employers generally choose 
to sponsor immigrants for very personal or economic reasons, 
and there often is a long waiting period before an immigration visa 
is granted. The question is whether this choice should remain 
essentially personal or should be regarded as a significant public 
interest that requires more political control.
<P>
<P><B>The Immigration Law</B>
<P>
<P>The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the rules 
and quotas for immigration to the United States.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#36">36</a>  The visas issued 
to immigrants allow them to become permanent residents. The 
law provides that after five years, and after fulfilling a requirement 
to show some knowledge of American history, permanent 
residents may become naturalized citizens of the United States. Prior 
to 1965, specific quotas favoring predominantly European 
countries were enforced. In 1965, Congress repealed this system of 
quotas and established a worldwide quota for immigration, with a 
limit per country. This major change in U.S. immigration law put 
the priority on family unification  individual Americans 
sponsoring relatives to come here.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#37">37</a>  The law fundamentally changed the 
em

phasis from specific nationalities and opened the process 
much more widely to immigrants from Asia. Spouses and most 
children of American citizens are exempt from the quota system, 
while other relatives are given priority over foreigners with no 
American relatives.
<P>
<P>The quota system, with its &quot;preference categories,&quot; is an 
extremely complex area of immigration law. Combined with the limits 
on immigration from individual countries, the preference system 
requires some immigrants to wait many years after applying for 
U.S. permission before receiving it. Immigrants from other 
countries, however, are not subjected to such prolonged delays. The 
quota preference system also includes categories for occupations 
and skills, but these have much smaller quotas and are ranked lower 
in the preference categories.
<P>
<P>The quota system and its preferences were revised by the 
1990 immigration law, but the family unification priority was 
not changed. Current law provides for up to 675,000 immigrants 
annually. Of these, 480,000 (71 percent) are sponsored by relatives 
in the United States, and another 140,000 (21 percent) are 
&quot;economic&quot; immigrants whose acceptance is determined on the 
basis of skills, education, or willingness to invest and create jobs. A 
special preference category was created for &quot;diversity&quot; 
immigration, allowing 55,000, or 8 percent of the total, from countries 
where immigration was lowest in prior years. This provision is 
intended to ease immigration from Ireland and other European countries.
<P>
<P><b>Refugees.</b> The Refugee Act of 1980<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#38">38</a> provides general 
authority for the admission of refugees, who were removed as a 
category under the quota preference system. The number that will come 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

the United States annually is determined by the President in 
consultation with Congress, and there are procedures for 
admitting larger numbers in emergency situations, such as the Haitian 
and Cuban boatlifts. In 1993, 119,482 refugees were admitted.
<P>
<P>Political asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis to aliens 
who meet the definition of refugee but already are in the United 
States or at the border. The requirement for case-by-case 
determinations is a significant administrative burden for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS). In 1993, there were 150,386 
applications for asylum, and the backlog of cases had reached 
333,000. While waiting for the INS to schedule a hearing for political 
asylum, these individuals generally are allowed free movement 
within the country, and a large number disappear and become 
illegal aliens.
<P>
<P><b>Illegal Immigrants.</b> The Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 (IRCA)<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#39">39</a> was enacted to control illegal immigration. 
The intent of the law was to focus on the motives of illegal 
immigrants, who come to the United States and get jobs that offer better 
wages and working conditions than they can find in their native 
lands. The principal change in the law prohibiting employment of 
illegal immigrants, however, was to make the employer guilty of 
breaking the immigration law as well. To cut off the job 
opportunities being sought by illegal immigrants, employers were made 
responsible for enforcement. All job applicants must prove their 
citizenship or legal residence to their potential employers by 
completing an INS form (I-9) before they can begin work. The employer 
must verify this information and keep the documents with other 
personnel records. IRCA imposed both civil fines as high as $10,000 
on employers who hire illegal aliens and criminal penalties for a 
re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->

peated pattern of violations.
<P>
<P>Because it was known that millions of illegal aliens already 
were living and working in this country, the Congress established 
procedures by which they could apply for legal resident status. By 
1988, more than 3 million people had applied for &quot;legalization&quot; 
under the 1986 law. These legalized immigrants in turn have provided 
a newly enlarged pool of families that are seeking to sponsor 
other relatives for immigration.
<P>
<P><b>Citizenship.</b> A legal permanent resident in the United States 
may apply for citizenship after five years. The Immigration and 
Nationality Act sets out a number of specific requirements for 
becoming a naturalized citizen: a test of the applicant's knowledge of 
U.S. history and the Constitution, proficiency in the English 
language, and an oath renouncing all allegiance to foreign governments 
and swearing loyalty to the United States and a willingness to 
defend it. Congress also could enact additional financial 
responsibility requirements.
<P>
<P><B>The Problem of Illegal Immigration</B>
<P>
<P>There were an estimated 3.2 million illegal aliens in the 
United States as of October 1992, according to the 
INS.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#40">40</a>  The number of illegal residents is estimated to be growing by 300,000 per year.

<P>
<ul>
<li>Fifty-five percent of the illegal immigrants in the United States 

are estimated to be Mexican. Another 22 percent come from 
Central America. 
<P>
<li>Although Mexicans comprise about 90 percent of those 
apprehended at the southern U.S. border, one survey found they 
were joined by representatives of 70 other 
nationalities.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#41">41</a>
</ul><P>In addition to crossing the border illegally, many violators of 
the law just stay in the United States after their non-immigrant 
visas expire. 
<P><UL>
<p><li>In 1993, there were 21 million visas issued to 
non-immigrants, including 17 million tourists and almost 3 million business 
visitors; 165,000 temporary foreign workers and 257,000 foreign 
students also were admitted. In addition, foreign journalists, 
foreign government officials, and the families of persons working for 
international organizations come to the United States freely. 
<P>
<li>During the 1986 fiscal year, the INS apprehended 1.8 million 
illegal entrants. Of these, 243,000 had overstayed their 
visas.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#42">42</a> 
</UL><P>
<P>These statistics do not provide a good picture of the extent of 
the problem, however, because most illegal immigrants who enter 
the United States with a valid tourist or student visa are not 
identified unless stopped by the police for some reason.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a serious problem that law enforcement 
has not been able to control. The shortage of border patrol officers 
and adequate physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border has 
been widely cited as a large factor in the problem, and improved 
enforcement at key locations in California, Texas, Arizona, and 
New Mexico certainly should be undertaken to curb illegal 
crossings. But the larger problem would not be solved by those 
measures alone, because illegal entry is only one source of illegal 
immigration. The problem of individuals misusing tourist visas also 
must be addressed. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->

<P>
<P><B>Identification Cards</B>
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions under IRCA have failed to reduce illegal 
immigration and may have increased racial or ethnic 
discrimination in the workplace.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#43">43</a>  Employers who suspect a job applicant 
may not possess legitimate credentials for legal residence or 
citizenship face a difficult problem. In an effort to solve this problem, 
legislation now before Congress would set up a pilot program 
covering approximately 47 million workers, or almost 40 percent of 
the workforce, to test a computerized national worker 
identification system.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#44">44</a>  In theory, if an employer needed to verify the right of 
a job applicant to work, he could make a telephone call and obtain 
a verification number, just as businesses now do to verify 
credit cards and checks. This would be the employer's defense 
against any subsequent discovery that the new employee was in fact 
an illegal alien.
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, this idea is both impractical and potentially 
dangerous. It would solve a problem caused by less than 1.5 percent 
of the population that is here illegally by dramatically increasing 
government regulation of every American's life. Even the pilot 
program would require over 100 million names and numbers, 
since non-working spouses and children potentially are part of the 
labor force. What ought to be a private contractual arrangement 
between employers and job applicants would become an illegal 
relationship unless the employer first obtained government authorization. 
The danger that such a system would create an underground 
economy with crime and tax evasion is overwhelming. If the 
authorization were denied, for whatever reason  computer data errors, 
bureaucratic mistakes, or even sabotage by a criminal computer hacker 
 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->

the job applicant would be forcibly unemployed. As the 
logical implications of this system of legal sanctions against 
employers become clearer and more threatening to the civil rights of 
ordinary people, public opposition is likely to increase.
<P>
<P>Most advocates of a computer registry admit that it would 
work only with a secure national identification card. Without such 
positive identification, an employer would have no way to 
determine whether the Social Security number being used actually 
belonged to the job applicant. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), sponsor 
of the immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate, has 
described the two functions the worker identification system 
would have: &quot;It must verify that a name corresponds to someone who 
is authorized to work. And then verifying the identity, that the 
person claiming the name and the number is not an impostor. The use of 
a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, is needed if this 
function is to perform reliably.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#45">45</a>
<P>
<P>Before a national computer system to identify every 
American could be installed, there would have to be significant 
improvement in the data stored in the federal government's computers. 
With approximately 6.5 million Americans changing jobs every year, 
an error rate of just one percent would cause 650,000 innocent 
victims to be denied a job until bureaucrats in Washington could 
be persuaded to correct their mistakes. The Social Security 
Administration has estimated that a national computer registry would 
cost between $3 billion and $6 billion  about 10 to 20 times more 
than its advocates have claimed.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#46">46</a>
<P>
<P>The proposal for a national computerized worker registration 
system does not address the basic problem of illegal alien 
employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->

ment. Since employers are required to verify the right of job 
applicants to work in the United States today, violations of the law 
may occur because some employers simply ignore it. Advocates of 
the plan are enthusiastic about increasing the number of work site 
inspections for labor law and OSHA violations, along with 
the worker verification. The proposed computer system is an 
expensive, new invasion of every American worker's privacy and 
a threat to law-abiding employers who would have to deal with 
federal inspectors. Employers who violate the law today could 
continue to do so simply by going further underground and 
evading the new computer system.
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions is a misguided concept. The assumption is 
that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law, any 
employer who provides a job is a criminal accomplice. But employers 
are more likely to be the victims of document fraud. A solution to 
the criminal problem of illegal immigration ought to involve less 
government regulation of business, not more. Criminal 
penalties should focus on deterring illegal immigration by punishing 
the criminal, not the rest of the nation.
<a name="RECORD"><P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
<P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has emphasized toughening the 
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and increasing the 
number of inspections by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#47">47</a>  In addition, INS funding and personnel increased significantly in FY 1995 
and FY 1996: Increases of 26 percent in budget (to $2.6 billion) 
and 3,200 new full-time employees (to approximately 25,000) 
are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

scheduled. This will include an increase of 1,000 Border 
Patrol agents &quot;on the front lines.&quot;  The budget for FY 1995 was 
increased by 25 percent over the prior year, mostly to finance 
improvements in the agency's computer technology. The INS will spend 
more this year on detention and removal of deportable aliens, 
including people who have been denied political asylum. A detention 
facility operated jointly with the U.S. Marshal Service is being built 
in Batavia, N.Y., and a &quot;triple fencing pilot project&quot; is being 
placed on the border south of San Diego.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#48">48</a>
<P>
<P>The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#49">49</a> released its 
interim report to Congress, which addressed illegal immigration, 
in 1994, and a report on legal immigration in 1995. A final 
report covering issues related to immigration will appear in 1997. In 
general, the Commission has supported increased personnel 
and spending to enforce immigration laws at U.S. land borders 
and ports of entry.
<P>
<P>The Commission recommended &quot;development and 
implementation of a simpler, more fraud-resistant system for verifying work 
authorization.&quot;  It endorsed &quot;a computerized registry using data 
provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the INS.&quot; 
 It also called for federal regulation of birth certificates and 
other documents issued by states that establish nationality, as well 
as increased penalties for fraud.
<P>
<P>The Commission supported &quot;in principle&quot; the authorization of 
impact aid to offset the fiscal burdens of unlawful immigration, but 
it wanted further investigation to determine the real costs 
imposed on state and local governments by being required to educate 
illegal immigrant children and provide emergency medical assistance.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->

<P>
<P>The Commission's report on legal immigration generally 
supported changing the family visa priorities and eliminating them 
for adult children and siblings of American citizens. It proposed 
a change in the classifications of labor skills, the elimination of 
Department of Labor certifications, and the establishment of a 
&quot;labor market test&quot; for workers with college degrees. Employers 
would pay a fee to bring in skilled workers, and the money would be 
used for private-sector education and training of American workers.
<P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
<P>
<P>During the 104th Congress, legislation to crack down on 
illegal immigration and further restrict legal immigration moved 
through committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
At the end of the first session, nothing had been sent to the 
White House. The bills include:
<ul><P>
<li><b>S. 269</b>, the Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act 
of 1995, sponsored by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY).
<P>
<li><b>S. 1394</b>, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, sponsored by 
Senator Simpson.
<P>
<li><b>S. 1535</b>, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement 
Act, sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2202</b>, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, 
sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2898</b>, the One Strike and You're Out Illegal 
Immigration 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->

Act, sponsored by Representative Randy Tate (R-WA).
</ul><P>
<P>Although illegal immigration and the legal immigration quota 
system are distinct issues, they have been combined. There is 
widespread agreement on many of the reforms proposed to control 
illegal immigration, but strong differences about the proposals to 
reduce legal immigration quotas.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills increase border enforcement 
patrols and authorize expedited hearings for deportation and 
tougher penalties for document fraud. The legislation begins 
implementation of the national computer identification system to enforce 
employer sanctions. Enforcement powers and penalties are 
increased for smuggling of aliens, as are punishment for repeated 
offenses, detention of illegal immigrants pending removal, and 
criminal penalties for failure to depart.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills contain new restrictions on 
the receipt of public benefits by illegal immigrants and impose 
new requirements for income support on the sponsors of legal 
immigrants. Sponsors will have to demonstrate greater financial 
ability in order to assure that immigrants are less likely to end up on 
welfare. Both the House and Senate bills reduce the number of 
legal immigrants and eliminate whole categories, such as adult 
children, brothers, and sisters. Immigration of parents of U.S. citizens 
would be restricted, and increased financial support requirements 
would be imposed.
<P>
<P>Legislation also has been introduced to make English the 
official language of the federal government. Proficiency in 
understanding simple English is already a requirement for naturalization as a 
U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->

citizen, except for elderly, long-time residents. There is a 
growing concern that the United States in danger of becoming a 
multilingual society, with all the social tensions and political problems 
that have occurred in some other officially multilingual nations. 
Bills include:
<P><ul>
<li><b>S. 356</b>, the Language of Government Act, sponsored by 
Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 739</b>, sponsored by Representative Toby Roth (R-WI), 
and H.R. 1005, sponsored by Representative Peter King 
(R-NY), which provide for English to be the official language of the 
U.S. government and require the INS to apply more strictly the 
English proficiency requirement for naturalization. These bills also 
repeal the Bilingual Education Act. No hearings have been held in 
the House of Representatives.
<P>
</ul>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Separate the specific issue of illegal immigration control from 
the more general issue of immigration quota reform.</b> 
<P>
<P>The legislation pending in Congress should be divided into 
separate bills dealing with each side of the question separately.
<P>
<li><b>Strengthen enforcement measures at the Mexican border and 
other entry points.</b>
<P>
More personnel, physical barriers, and detention facilities 
are needed, as is added enforcement authority to deter the 
smuggling and document fraud involved in illegal immigration. The 
INS 

should increase the scrutiny of applicants for political asylum 
and decide their cases more rapidly. Political asylees should be 
denied work permits until determined to be eligible for legal 
permanent residence. The political debate about immigration policy in 
the United States is inflamed primarily because of the highly 
publicized, inadequate enforcement along the Mexican border. But 
increased border enforcement may only shift the problem to 
other ports of entry. The equally serious problem of illegal 
immigration by aliens who arrive legally as tourists or on business and 
then decide to stay also has to be met with severe penalties. Other 
ports of entry also are heavily burdened by the abuse of political 
asylum by immigrants who have been advised on how to exploit it.
<P>
<li><B>Make illegal immigration a felony. </B>
<P>
<P>There should be brief but mandatory incarceration for the first 
offense after a deportation order has been granted. In addition, 
anyone convicted of illegal immigration should be denied all 
future admission to the United States after deportation, even as a 
tourist or on business. Illegal immigration to the United States is 
attempted because violators see the costs as low and the rewards 
as very attractive.
<P>
<li><B>Repeal employer sanctions. </B>
<P>
<P>Employers should not have to verify the citizenship or 
immigration status of a prospective employee. Instead, criminal 
penalties and deportation, along with an absolute prohibition against 
ever returning to the United States, should be imposed on those 
who break the U.S. immigration laws. The expensive and 
unworkable computer verification system that eventually would require 
all 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->

Americans to carry a national identification card and 
surrender personal privacy should not be started. The enforcement of 
laws against illegal immigration should focus on the law breakers, 
not on the entire American population and millions of innocent 
employers.
<P>
<P>The legitimate concern expressed by many business leaders 
that restrictions on legal immigration will seriously impair their 
ability to hire the people they want and maintain a worldwide labor 
force should be addressed with a uniform system of financial 
reassurance, which also could be used by immigrants who might come 
to the United States to establish new businesses or who seek 
employment without first obtaining a U.S. sponsor. The United 
States does not benefit from numerical quotas for the admission of 
immigrants who would come with the financial assets or skills that 
help guarantee their positive contributions to the national economy, 
to the tax base, and to the middle and upper strata of American 
society. 
<P>
<li><B>Place tough and real financial requirements on 
immigrants and their sponsors to reduce immigrant &quot;gaming&quot; of 
welfare, including a financial bond as security.</B>
<P>
<P>Sponsors of immigrants should be required to demonstrate 
sufficient financial ability to prevent any risk of welfare dependency 
by those who come to the United States. Sponsors' income or 
financial support should be deemed to apply to immigrants' 
income status for the entire term of their legal permanent residence in 
the United States. Posting a bond or purchasing other kinds of 
financial assurance to demonstrate that immigrants will not 
become dependent on welfare, particularly SSI and Medicaid, should 
be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->

made a formal part of the visa approval process. Applicants 
for naturalized citizenship should be required to demonstrate by 
the same means that they will not become dependent on welfare, 
particularly SSI and Medicaid, in future years.
<P>
<P>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is 
expanding rapidly, and elderly immigrants are a growing proportion of 
the total welfare burden. U.S. immigration policy always has 
included the provision that no one, including the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens should be allowed to become a public charge. The 
obligation of a sponsor to guarantee that an immigrant does not become 
a burden to other American taxpayers should be enforced for as 
long as the immigrant is not an American citizen. The opportunity 
to become an American citizen is a privilege extended to the 
legal permanent resident, but it requires the applicant to undertake 
a significant number of duties and obligations. One of these 
obligations should be to prove financial responsibility. A bond or 
insurance policy or other financial indemnity could eliminate the 
attraction of welfare programs to those who might think about 
immigrating to exploit them; it also could recover part of the costs of 
publicly provided welfare and medical benefits if genuine 
misfortune should befall the new citizen or his family.
<P>
<P>Within the framework set by Congress, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service should be authorized to issue immigration 
visas to any person who meets stringent criteria of good character and 
is able to post a substantial bond or provide other financial 
assurance, subject to forfeiture if any welfare dependency should 
occur. Such a bond or other financial assurance could be remitted if 
the immigrant chose to depart permanently from the United States.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->

<P>
<li><B>Require proficiency in the English language for all 
immigrants and naturalized citizens. </B>
<P>
<P>The standard for naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency 
in English. Immigrants who are not initially proficient in the 
language should be required to practice and study English, and 
their progress should be tested periodically.
<P>
<P>The concept of American nationality is inextricably linked 
with English as the national language. Every other nation in the world 
is identified with its language, and immigration, to say nothing 
of citizenship, often is simply prohibited to outsiders. 
Americans founded a unique republican form of government in the 18th 
century, based on ideal principles of human rights and limited 
government, and invited immigrants to come and join the new civil 
society. But in 200 years, America has become more than simply 
a republic. It has become a people, and English is its language. 
This in no way precludes the right of Americans to converse in 
another language; nor should it discourage the media from providing 
services in another language. But in the courts, the public 
schools, and the political system, the language should be English. 
Becoming proficient in the language of America is a price that any 
immigrant should want to pay.
</ul><P><a name="Q&A">
<P><B>Q&amp;A</B>
<P>
<P><b>Q. What is the difference between legal and illegal 
immigration, and how big a problem is the whole immigration issue?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Legal immigration is a big part of the American tradition, 
and even though there is almost as much legal immigration now 
as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->

there was around the turn of the century, it is only a problem if 
you think there are too many new, legal immigrants. Most legal 
immigrants are family members of American families who want 
to sponsor them and bring them here. Family re-unification is a 
good thing. 
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a crime, and we must increase the 
penalties for committing this crime. No other remedy will work.
<P>
<P>People who come into the United States across the Mexican 
or Canadian border, or who come here as students or tourists and 
stay after their visas expire, are criminals. They should be 
tracked down, arrested, and put in jail for at least a year -- then 
deported. They should be forbidden ever to come back to the United 
States, even as tourists or businessmen. 
<P>
<P><b>Q. With generous welfare benefits in this country and 
poverty throughout the rest of the world, don't immigrants come 
to America primarily to go on the dole?
<P>
<P>A.</b> No. Statistics show that working-age immigrants actually 
use welfare benefits and food stamps less than native born 
Americans of working age. The real problem is the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens, who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they 
are poor. The laws need to be changed so that if they are sponsored 
to come here by their children, who are U.S. citizens, their 
children will be financially responsible. We have to change the SSI law, 
not the immigration law, to do that.
<P>
<P><b>Q. If legal immigrants to the United States are prevented from 
getting welfare, will they not just take jobs away from native 
born 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->

Americans?
<P>
<P>A.</b> The only immigrant welfare problem is caused by 
elderly people who, after their children bring them to America, then go 
on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they are poor. Their 
children should support them, but they are not going to take any 
jobs away from anyone, because they are already retired.
<P>
<P>Working-age immigrants on average are harder working than 
native born Americans and tend to have a higher labor force 
participation rate than native born Americans.
<P>
<P>Immigrants don't take jobs away from American workers.  In 
addition to the dramatic increase in immigration we have seen in 
the past ten years, we have seen a tremendous increase in new 
jobs and a falling rate of unemployment.
<P>
<P>Everybody who gets a job or keeps a job does so as an 
individual, not as a member of some group. Employers hire individuals 
who can do the work. If an immigrant gets a job, it is because the 
employer has specific job needs that the immigrant is qualified to fill.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would more Border Patrol officers and security fences 
across the Mexican border solve the problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> More Border Patrol officers and security fences are needed, 
and Congress is providing more money to do those things. But 
more than half of the illegal immigration problem comes from 
students and tourist visitors to the United States who simply decide to 
stay after their visas expire, and from people who falsely claim 
political asylum. Border patrols and fences won't keep them out.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->

<P>
<P>The only way to stop illegal immigration is to impose stiffer 
criminal penalties on those who break our immigration laws. We 
need to put them in jail for at least a year after we catch them, and 
deport them after that. And we need to make sure they will 
never again even be able to visit the United States as a tourist or a 
businessman. The word will get out to those violators, and they 
will stop treating the violation of U.S. immigration laws like a game.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would a national identification card, reinforced with a 
government computer system to verify identification, solve the 
problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> A national identification card, with a Big Brother 
computer system in Washington, D.C., would not stop illegal immigrants 
or even stop some employers from hiring them. What it would do 
is deprive all other Americans of some degree of privacy and create 
a monster information database that eventually could be used to 
violate our liberties.
<P>
<P>The law today makes it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants, but employers are victims, not criminals. We 
shouldn't create a system that punishes the victims and every other 
innocent American worker. Advocates of the giant computer system 
really are trying to increase government regulations on employers 
and create a justification for an army of Labor Department 
inspectors to invade every workplace in America.
<P>
<P><b>Q. How much should the federal government pay to states that 
are forced to carry the costs of illegal immigration?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->

<P>
<P>A.</b> The federal government should be prepared to pay the 
entire costs of illegal immigration. Enforcing the immigration laws is 
a federal responsibility. If the federal government cannot do its 
job, it should pay the costs. The Balanced Budget Act Congress 
passed last year set up a way to pay the states for emergency 
medical treatment for illegal aliens.
<P>
<P>At the same time, the states should have to demonstrate the 
actual costs of illegal immigration. There have been a number of 
so-called studies of the costs of immigration, but none of them 
really proves that there is a significant cost or measures how great it 
may be. We need to get the real data and figure out how much the 
costs are; then the federal government should pay for the problem.
<P>
<P>But the most important things the federal government can do 
to stop illegal immigration are to hire more Border Patrol officers 
and stiffen the criminal penalties for breaking our immigration laws.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Should English be established officially as America's 
language and immigrants be required to read, write, and speak English?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Yes. Proficiency in the English language should be required 
of all immigrants and naturalized citizens. The standard for 
naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency in English. 
Immigrants not initially proficient in the language should be required to 
practice and study English, and their progress should be tested 
periodically.
<P>
<P>English as the national language is central to the concept 
of American nationality. Every other nation in the world is 
closely identified with its language. English is America's language.

<P>The 104th Congress has taken dramatic first steps to reform  itself. But
although the new majority  particularly the newly  elected freshmen  has made
great strides in achieving the  meaningful reform that the voters demanded
through the 1994  congressional election, much remains to be done. Congress now
must  complete the task of reforming its own operations and extend the process 
of reform to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:

<P>
</P>
<P>Congress and the President must work together to complete  these reforms
both to demonstrate their commitment to the  American people and to make
government more accountable to the  voters and less focused on protecting
special interests and the careers  of politicians.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress made great strides in the effort to clean  up Washington,
enacting substantial reforms in its own processes  that changed the &quot;business-as-usual&quot;
mentality which frustrated  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  sponsible government before the
1994 elections. But full  reform obviously takes time. The fact is that the new
Congress inherited  a federal government beset with fundamental problems in all 
three branches  executive, legislative, and judicial.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To complete the reforms begun in 1995, therefore, Congress  and the
President must confront a series of problems, some old and some new.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      The Supreme Court ruled state-imposed term limits 
unconstitutional.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#2">2</A>
the U.S. Supreme Court  held that states may not impose term limits on their own
Members  of Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress 
itself may not  by statute  impose term limits. The impact of  this decision was
to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and  give greater force to the idea
of a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ensure that members of the House and Senate  stay in touch
with their constituents and truly represent their views is  to prevent
politicians from spending their entire careers in  Washington. If they knew that
Congress could not be a career,  legislators would be less interested in the
trappings of office and less  inclined to feather their own nests, mislead the
voters, legislate  irresponsibly, and abuse their offices as part of their
reelection efforts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are at least four key arguments for a constitutional  amendment to
limit congressional terms:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Term limits are popular.</B> Support for limiting 
congressional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  terms reaches as high as 80
percent in some polls. The Gallup  poll shows that a 49 percent plurality of
Americans favored term  limits for Congress in 1964, with support swelling to 64
percent in  1990 and 73 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Term limits receive substantial support at the polls.</B> In 
addition to the fact that term limits were one of the most popular  components
of the Contract With America, voters have supported  them overwhelmingly when
faced with ballot initiatives. In the 22  states with term limits by referendum,
the average level of support in  the voting booth on election day was 66
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Term limits are a fundamentally democratic concept.</B> Since  as far
back as Aristotle, the concept of limiting the tenure of  politicians has been a
topic of public debate. One of America's  own Founding Fathers, James Madison,
argued 200 years ago that  term limits would reduce the influence of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Term limits ensure healthy change.</B> Increasing the turnover  in
Congress gives more citizens the opportunity to serve their  government and
their fellow Americans. The introduction of fresh  insights into the political
process increases the chances that  dramatic improvements in the role of
government can be effected.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Audits have uncovered significant past abuses.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 
for an internal audit by an outside accounting firm, Price  Waterhouse. It was a
matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that the  management of the House had
been permeated with &quot;abuses and  management inefficiencies,&quot; in the
words of former House  Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992.
Although a  few House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting 
Office, it is likely that many had never been reviewed by an  independent
examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House  Bank scandal, a full
accounting was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress revealed by  the Price
Waterhouse audit demonstrate that the House's financial  and operational
controls were worse than even the harshest critics  had imagined. The 14
material weaknesses uncovered would be  troubling in a medium-sized business;
their presence in the  13,000-employee House of Representatives is a national
disgrace.  Most disturbing are the conclusions that the House was:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Wasting</B> millions of dollars on inefficient
purchasing practices  and superfluous staff; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Failing</B> to prevent employee fraud through multiple 
reimbursements for the same purchase; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Allowing</B> the use of official resources for campaign purposes;
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Keeping</B> such careless records that the magnitude of the loss
to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  public probably will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership  of Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), House Oversight  Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA),
Representative Jim Nussle  (R-IA), its administrative officers, and the
management team they  brought in, has taken aggressive action to correct the
deficiencies  identified by the audit. Many of the 226 recommendations the
auditors  made already have been implemented, and the remainder are  being
implemented.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Members of Congress still benefit from a system of perks  and
privileges.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on  Congress and
helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution. The  new Republican majorities in
the House and Senate moved quickly  to cut staff and expenses and to eliminate
many of Congress's  exemptions from the law. Further steps are necessary,
however,  to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. 
Congressional committees currently are considering some of these  reforms, while
others will likely be debated in the course of the  appropriations process. But
problems remain, such as automatic pay  raises, excessive pensions, and high
expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These perks continue to insulate Congress from American  citizens, to
frustrate political fairness, and to promote legislative  careerism and
bureaucracy. Reforms in these areas will mean a more  efficient, representative,
and politically competitive Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Automatic Pay Hikes.</B>  These pay hikes are
scheduled each  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  with no vote required, further
boosting lawmakers' salaries,  which already exceed $11,000 a month ($133,600
per year).  Because Members' salaries are funded by a permanent, indefinite 
appropriation rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they  are
nearly invulnerable to legislative change when the rest  of Congress's budget is
under discussion. Congress should  make Members' salaries a legislative
appropriations line item and  eliminate the automatic salary cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs)  that, unless Congress acts, give each Member an automatic
pay  hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates the spirit of the 27th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which states that Members must stand  for
reelection before any pay raise they vote on takes effect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excessive Pensions.</B> Congressional pensions far exceed most 
private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as  generous as
those of most Fortune 500 corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers,  but they also
promote political careerism by providing incentives  for lawmakers to extend
their tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over 250 Members of the 103rd Congress will become  &quot;pension
millionaires,&quot; receiving pension income after their retirement  in excess
of $1 million. For instance, former Speaker of the  House Tom Foley (D-WA) is
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in  addition to the pay he will receive
from his job at a  lobbying/law firm. The former Speaker could take in over $3
million in  pension checks over the course of his expected lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as well as  congressional
salaries. Only one in ten private-sector pensions is  adjusted 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  for inflation, and many of those
compensate for as little as a  third of the inflation rate. This feature makes
former Members of  Congress among the wealthiest of retired Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members' office expense accounts are too high.</B> The 1996 
appropriation combined the three House Members' personal  allowance accounts
(staff salaries, office expenses, and official mail) into  one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease  administrative burdens. However,
the combined account was  increased by over 2 percent, to over $360 million, due
to increases  in staff salaries and mail funding. A House committee has 
approved an additional 2 percent increase for the coming year, to an  average of
$887,337 for each House member. Although increases in  postal rates and
population may justify some adjustment of mail  allowances, it is difficult to
make similar arguments for an increase  in the aggregate staff salary
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the debate at the beginning of the 104th Congress over  the proposed
elimination of House Legislative Service  Organizations, advocates of abolition
intimated that a substantial portion of the  $5 million spent each year on LSOs
would be saved. In fact,  these funds were not cut, and even steeper staff cuts
are justified. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Incumbents retain a significant electoral advantage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Campaign finance law and congressional perquisites provide  huge electoral
advantages for incumbents, leading to House  reelection rates of well over 90
percent  even the dramatic 1994  elections produced a reelection rate of 90.2
percent. This remarkable  level of job security is the result of several
built-in advantages that  stack the election deck. There are several reasons why
incumbents  enjoy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  such success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Challengers have difficulty raising funds.</B> After
passage of  the 1974 law that first regulated contributions to congressional 
campaigns, incumbents' financial advantage over challengers  grew fivefold by
1992, approaching an advantage of four to one.  In 1994, this had fallen
somewhat, to just over two to one. Much  of this is due to political action
committee (PAC) donations   special-interest gifts five times larger than
individuals are allowed  to contribute   that flow to incumbents by a
disproportionate  margin of nine to one.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members use constituent services to build a voter base.</B> The 
greatest tax-funded advantage enjoyed by incumbents is the  routine operation of
congressional offices. Members of Congress  use about half their staffs for
constituent service or casework,  helping voters who have problems with the
government. The irony is  that these problems flow in large part from the very
laws and  government programs Congress makes possible. Says former  Minnesota
Representative Vin Weber, &quot;we create the government that  screws you, and
then you're supposed to thank us for protecting you  from it.&quot;  Studies
show that constituent service adds 5 percent to 10  percent to a typical
Member's vote total.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#3">3</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members have free mailing privileges  though now in  smaller
amounts.</B> In March 1994, the House Oversight Committee  approved a one-third
cut in Members' franking allowances from  their 1994 authorizations. This will
save over $20 million in  postage-related spending yearly, bringing down the
average annual  spending ceiling per congressional office from $163,000 to 
$108,000. This is a healthy step on the road to eliminating abuses that  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  petuate congressional careerism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Many campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; schemes are overregulatory.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the reform plans to diminish the influence of money  in politics
create a regulatory system that actually protects  incumbents and punishes
challengers. The key elements of many  regulatory campaign finance reform plans
include spending limits,  advertising subsidies, and public financing. These
provisions  are likely to make elections even less competitive and less 
issue-oriented.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four key problems involved in limiting  congressional campaign
spending:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Spending limits uniformly punish challengers.</B>
Studies  have demonstrated that challengers need to spend significant amounts 
of money to unseat sitting Members of Congress. In 1994, the  average challenger
who unseated an incumbent spent well  over $700,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Spending limits ignore the advantages of incumbency.</B> In  addition
to contending with incumbents' natural advantage in  name identification and
media access, challengers must compete  with the enormous array of
taxpayer-funded resources that  incumbents have at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Spending limits violate the First Amendment.</B> Mandatory  limits
are clearly unconstitutional. To get around this problem, most  proposals call
the limits voluntary, but they place those who do  not accept the caps at such a
great disadvantage that the limits  argu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  ably are made compulsory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Spending limits encourage evasion, hiding, and cheating.</B> 
Citizens will always find ways to express their views. The  principal effect of
government regulation of political speech is to push  citizens away from
straightforward activities (such as direct  donations) into more circuitous
methods. Previous attempts at  regulating away political influence have led to
the development of  PACs, bundling, soft money, and independent expenditure 
campaigns.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Public Financing Is No Answer.</B> Another way to limit  the
influence of money on politics is through public subsidizing  of campaigns.
Already, presidential campaigns receive a limited  public subsidy that has
become increasingly unpopular with  the American taxpayers (as demonstrated by
the declining number  of taxpayers who elect to participate on their tax forms).
The  four most critical problems with public financing are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The money is already committed.</B> Public financing of 
congressional candidates would require additional funds from the  federal budget
 an effort which the commitment to a balanced budget  by 2002 makes all the more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Public financing is expensive.</B> Taxpayer grants for  congressional
candidates could well total in the hundreds of millions of  dollars. The
possibility of nearly 1,000 subsidized candidates every  two years vividly
demonstrates the tremendous cost of  government involvement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. The people oppose public financing.</B> Taxpayers have  abandoned the
presidential campaign fund checkoff, with participation  falling 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  from 29 percent in 1980 to 17
percent in 1991. To find  sufficient funds for the 1996 presidential elections,
Congress was forced  to raise the value of the individual checkoff from $1 to $3
per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Subsidizing political extremists is unattractive to most  Americans.</B>
Experience with the presidential fund shows that fringe  candidates are
attracted by government subsidies. Third-party  radical Lenora Fulani received
nearly $1 million in federal  matching funds in the 1988 presidential campaign
and over $2 million  in 1992.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#5">5</A> 
Because there cannot be an ideological litmus test for  public financing, tax
dollars inevitably would go to dozens of  extremist candidates ranging from
Fulani to Lyndon La Rouche to  David Duke.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Broadcast Subsidies Also Are No Answer.</B> Postal and  broadcast
subsidies are nothing more than public funding in disguise.  By compelling
broadcasters or the postal service to provide no-cost  or low-cost political
communication services to candidates, the  government essentially is taxing
these entities and transferring  those funds to the candidates. All of the
problems that exist with  public subsidies necessarily carry over to this
heavy-handed,  big-government &quot;reform&quot; scheme.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Taxpayer-subsidized lobbying helps drive up the cost of 
government.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently subsidizes lobbying by  tax-exempt
organizations by supplying grants and contracts to  advocacy groups. Each year,
America's taxpayers provide these  organizations with billions of dollars which
they then use to advance  their own political agendas.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by  ideology.
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use  taxpayers'
funds to promote their ideas and positions. Almost  every interest in America 
from agriculture to zoology  has one  or more organizations tainted by
government funding. The  American Association of Retired Persons, for example,
received over  $73 million in a one-year period, while the American Bar 
Association received over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage  network of
organizations that enjoy preferred tax status, receive  federal funds, and
engage in legislative or political advocacy.  The days of big-city political
machines disbursing patronage may  be coming to an end, but the disbursement of
financial dividends  to political friends remains a prominent feature of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo wrote in their  1985 book <I>Destroying
Democracy</I>: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      A large number of individuals with strong views can 
express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that  promotes that
issue. With tax-funded politics, however, a  small number of zealots with access
to the public purse can  obtain resources to advance its views even though few
individuals  in society share the group's philosophy. Whenever  government funds
any political advocacy group, it effectively  penalizes those groups that
advocate opposing public policies and  provides a distinct advantage to the
group or groups it favors  in the clash of ideas.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress began to address the significant problem of  welfare for
lobbyists. In the House, Representatives Ernest Istook  (R-OK), David McIntosh
(R-IN), and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD)  proposed an amendment to an appropriations
bill that would limit  the amount of money federal grantees could spend on
political  advocacy to not more than 5 percent of their non-grant  revenue.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#7">7</A>  Even though this formula permitted
charities to spend generous  amounts of money on lobbying, it was bitterly
opposed. The  amendment died in conference.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Huge Growth in Committees and Staff
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Until action was taken in the 104th Congress, the explosion  in committees
and staff led to the growth of a powerful staff  bureaucracy and made it easier
for interest groups to influence  legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     House committee staff had grown almost twelvefold since 
World War II. In the last two decades alone, committee staffs in  the House of
Representatives had grown by 158 percent. Congress  was the most heavily staffed
legislature in the world by a factor of  five, with nearly 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The number of committees and subcommittees totaled under  200 in 1947,
exploded in the post-Watergate era, and did not fall  significantly under 300
until the early 1990s. The new Congress  cut this number to 198.

</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and  practices. The
1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress  and delivered a clear
reform mandate. The Contract With  America promised numerous changes in House
rules, and the new  leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate
and  ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th  Congress,
the House voted to end procedures that had become  increasingly arbitrary and
secretive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of  the institution's
critics. The rules were designed to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Improve deliberation</B> by banning proxy (absentee) voting in 
committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process,  and requiring
fuller reporting on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Streamline the legislative process</B> by cutting the number of 
committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of  legislation, and
slashing committee staff.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Promote accountability</B> by requiring that committee meetings 
be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll  call votes on
major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate  transcripts, and
conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Increase responsiveness</B> by imposing term limits on the 
Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a  measure to
apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative  vote 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  in the 104th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight  specific
first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</B> The new rules  package
eliminated three House committees  Post Office and Civil  Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries   and 25 subcommittees. The
committee reform provision also  will shrink House committee staff by one-third.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> 2)  Truth in Budgeting.</B> Appropriations committees are now  required
to compare new spending recommendations to the  current spending level. Under
the old system, tax-and-spend liberals  had the upper hand because spending
increases were judged not  against what was actually spent last year, but
against projected  spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending
increase could  be called a &quot;cut.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</B>  House
committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more  than three consecutive
Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure  of committee chairmen begins to
address some of the concerns  of advocates of full-scale legislative term
limits. A central problem  of previous Congresses had been that committee
chairmen, who  set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd
Congress,  for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most  powerful
committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce)  had held these positions
for over a decade; the chairman of the  third (Appropriations) had just vacated
his position after holding it  since the 1970s.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more  than four
Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional  officer of the
legislative branch in line with the President, his  executive branch
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Elimination of Proxy Voting.</B> Elimination of the practice  of
allowing absent members of a committee to loan their votes  to other members was
critical to ensuring fairness and  improving committee deliberation. Although
House rules strictly  prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on
the House  floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's 
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the  103rd Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership  to extend
its control over committee outcomes by scheduling  multiple, contemporaneous
committee and subcommittee  meetings. Proxy voting also promoted committee
absenteeism by  ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain
their ability  to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to
 abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against 
legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its  merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee  chairmen and force
Members to show up and actually participate in  the work of their committees if
they want their votes to count.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5)  Open Meetings.</B> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public  access
to committee meetings. In previous Congresses,  committees frequently closed
their doors to the press and public, a step  the panels could take for nearly
any reason. In fact, the two  House 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  committees that most often
operated in secret   Appropriations and Ways and Means  were the ones making 
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open  hearing or meeting
(previously, media coverage was subject to a vote  of approval). The new rules
also require that committees publish  recorded committee votes in their reports
(most voting records  previously were available only at committee offices) and
that  hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor  grammatical
changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6)  Tax Hikes More Difficult.</B> The new rules require a  three-fifths
vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and  prohibit retroactive
taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been  particularly controversial,
with some Washington  commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or
even  unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the
conviction  that new tax increases are needed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions  voters have
imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the  most beneficial aspects of
the 60 percent tax rule is that any future  Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the  rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost.
The provision also  balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively
requires a  60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions 
are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7)  Authorization of House Audit.</B> Another 1995 rules change 
authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and  fa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  cilities by an independent
accounting firm. Some House  accounts previously had been audited sporadically
by the General  Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the
fact  that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most  House accounts
were not examined regularly, and some may never  have been reviewed by an
independent examiner. This audit was  the first complete accounting of the
House's financial status  ever made available to the public.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8)  Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</B> The last of the  Contract
reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA).  This measure has both
substantive and symbolic importance. It  underscores the principle that no
American should be immune from  the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill  also should encourage legislators to review the burdens
that  federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the  benefits
they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Term Limits </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress also held the first-ever votes on term  limits. Although
the House fell short of the necessary two-thirds  majority by 63 votes (227
ayes, 204 nays), the vote marked a  significant improvement over previous
Congresses that refused even to  debate the issue. Seven months after the House
vote, the Senate took up  a nonbinding resolution supporting term limits. The
resolution  failed to win majority support (45 ayes, 49 nays). Still, by putting
 members of the House and Senate on record as publicly supporting  or opposing
term limits, supporters now have a standard  against which they can measure
future Congresses. In addition, the  voters will know  unequivocally  where
their representatives stand  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  this important issue. A Senate
vote on a constitutional  amendment is planned for early 1996, though supporters
concede they are  certain to fail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Budget Cuts </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY  1996 legislative
branch appropriations bill provided systemic  congressional reforms as important
as any yet enacted, including  spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and
abolition of unnecessary  offices and functions. The FY 1996 congressional
budget would  reduce spending in real dollars  not phony &quot;baseline&quot;
cuts  by  $242 million, or 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the  government by
slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded  agencies, including the $21 million
Office of Technology  Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the
national  legislature. The reforms push the General Accounting Office to
privatize  its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and 
library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract  out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the  lower costs available in the
private sector. The result is a real cut of  more than one-fourth in the GAO's
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite Congress's effort to lead by example by cutting its  own budget
first, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch  appropriations bill the
first time it reached his desk. He stated that  he liked the bill but did not
want to let Congress receive its  funding early in the budget process. In other
words, the President  decided that scoring political points was more important
than  achieving 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  real spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting  the types and
amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The  Senate passed a complex rule that
allowed single gifts up to $50, with  a $100 annual limit. Any item less than
$10 fell outside the  Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping
proposal  offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich to prohibit all gifts. Both the 
Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for  commemorative items and
expenses related to official activities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the  House and Senate
in late 1995. While this legislation would adopt  new reporting requirements and
close loopholes in the original  1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many
potential pitfalls.  It successfully protects legitimate grassroots organizing,
as well  as part-time and small lobbying operations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A glaring omission from the so-called reform bill was any  meaningful effort
to address taxpayer-subsidized lobbying.  Opponents of this reform argued for
months that welfare for lobbyists  should be addressed in the lobby reform
debate, then turned around  and argued against any House amendments to this
important  legislation. The result is a flawed lobby reform bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a very poor record on  political reform
issues. The President has supported an overregulatory  cam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  paign finance &quot;reform&quot;
scheme that would impose spending  limits and public financing. He promoted
lobbying reform but  adamantly opposed provisions that would have restricted the
abuse of  taxpayer grants through government-subsidized lobbying.  Moreover, he
has not supported the most important reform needed to shake  up the current
political process: term limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has promoted the concept of  &quot;reinventing
government,&quot; but a close examination of the fine print  of the
Administration's plan shows that it makes federal  management even worse.
Clinton proposals weaken merit standards in  hiring, promotion, and pay and
strengthen the role of federal unions  in setting salary levels of work
assignments in federal agencies,  thus directly undermining management
authority. The result: a  federal bureaucracy even less accountable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress achieved dramatic reforms in the structure  and operation
of Congress, but many other reforms are needed.  Among them, the new Congress
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Pass a constitutional amendment for term limits.</B> Although  the
104th Congress put all its members on record for or against  term limits, the
failure to enact the reform means that Members of  Congress still can remain in
office as long as they want. The  Supreme Court's ruling against state-based
term limits leaves Congress  no choice but to enact a constitutional amendment
to end  congressional careerism.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Slash congressional perks and privileges. </B>Congress should  end

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  wasteful, inefficient spending
and perquisites that separate  lawmakers from their constituents. The reforms in
the Contract  With America were good first steps, but Congress should continue 
to reform its own pay, pensions, perks, and staff. Specifically,  it should:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Citizen Congress Act, introduced in the House by  Representatives Mark
Sanford (R-SC) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) and in  the Senate by Bill Frist (R-TN),
is a sensible effort to address  these perks and privileges, including the items
listed above. The  bill (H.R. 2610/S. 1405) also would eliminate mass mailings
paid  for by the taxpayers  a tremendous incumbent advantage. These  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  forms are needed to bring
Congress more in contact with the  challenges faced by average citizens and to
help restore  Americans' trust in government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Action on the political reform that the American public has  demanded is
beginning to materialize, as shown by the 23 states  that passed term limits
legislation and by the provisions of the  Contract With America providing for
congressional committee and  staff reductions. To make challengers more
competitive and ensure  that incumbents are not abusing taxpayers' funds in
their  re-election campaigns, Congress should:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Curtail franked mass mailings</B> from House Members

savings  to create a central constituent service office to handle routine 
requests. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eliminating these advantages, in addition to saving  taxpayers money, would
represent true campaign finance reform by  diminishing the overwhelming
advantages incumbents enjoy in  elections. Reformers who seek genuinely
competitive elections and  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  more efficient, representative,
and deliberative Congress  should place cuts in congressional pay, perks,
pensions, and staff at  the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Enact campaign finance reform.</B> While the most important 
steps toward improving the American electoral system are term  limits and
reducing the incumbency advantage, other improvements  can be made in campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Wamp Congress Act of 1995 (H.R. 2148), named for  sponsor Zach Wamp
(R-TN), provides productive and realistic reforms  that reduce special-interest
and incumbent advantages with a  minimum of new regulation. The legislation
would:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<P>Wamp points out that the proposed increase in individual  donation limits is
less than the level required to offset inflation since  1974. His proposal

<P><B>*     Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.</B> The  major
flaw in the Congressional Accountability Act was its exclusion  of the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) from the list of  covered laws. The FOIA does not
apply to the private sector because it  is intended to give the public access to
government information.  Excluding the Act makes it appear that Congress thinks
it has  something to hide and runs counter to the openness in government 
principles embodied in most other House reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End welfare for lobbyists.</B> Although Congress has begun to 
address the issue of taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy, much  remains to be
done. In the 105th Congress, investigative hearings  must continue to examine
existing abuses, and further remedies must  be considered. The information
gained from these hearings and  from further investigation into the activities
of federal grantees must  be used to develop a meaningful reform proposal that,
as nearly  as possible, eliminates this outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At its root, the issue of welfare for lobbyists is one of fairness  and
fiscal responsibility. True reform can be achieved only if it  includes the
following principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Full Disclosure.</B> Strong reporting requirements
are necessary  to shed light on the extent of this problem. Widespread abuse is 
already apparent  even from the limited and often confusing  data currently
gathered by the government. Federal grantees must  be tracked carefully and
should be required to indicate how  much money they dedicate to advocacy.
Furthermore, whatever  informa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  tion the government collects
should be readily available to  the public for inspection. To the greatest
extent feasible, this  should include availability via the Internet at no cost
to users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Truth in Testimony.</B> Witnesses testifying before Congress 
should be required to divulge whether they receive federal funds and,  if so,
for what purposes and in what amounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</B> No advocacy organization 
that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in  anything but
incidental lobbying except on issues related directly to its  tax status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</B> No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to provide financial assistance  to any
affiliated organization that engages in lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees
should be treated as if they received the funds  directly from the federal
government. Organizations should not  be able to create sham &quot;foundations&quot;
that launder taxpayer funding  to support lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Tough Penalties.</B> The consequences for violating the
prohibition  on federally subsidized lobbying must be firm enough to  discourage
organizations from violating the standards. Under no  circumstances should any
organization that willingly and knowingly  violates this prohibition receive
additional federal funding.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Civil Service Reform. </B>The new Congress and the new  President must
cooperate in tackling the toughest management chore in  the country: running the
federal bureaucracy. To do this, they  must examine every agency and bureau of
the government to:

altogether.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While reforming federal hiring, pay, and benefit policies, both  the
President and Congress must be sure to enforce the merit  principles of the
civil service system and maintain a bright line  between career and non-career
jobs. The usurpation of policy  functions by career staff undermines the
accountability of political  appointees to the President and the taxpayer, while
political abuse  of career staff undermines the integrity and professionalism of
 the civil service. Under no circumstance should Congress  undermine the
President's authority to appoint his own people to positions  of responsibility
and thus carry out his agenda and fulfill his  promises to the taxpayers. Good
government is accountable government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, the President and Congress should advance  serious reform
of the federal civil service system:

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Establish serious pay-for-performance standards for

throughout the federal workforce.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Modernize federal benefits.</B> The federal government should 
adopt a defined contribution for federal retirement and expand  investment

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Consolidate federal management and personnel agencies.</B>  The
President and Congress should consolidate the Office of  Management and Budget
(OMB), the Office of Personnel  management (OPM), and the General Services
Administration (GSA) into a  new Office of Management. At the same time, federal
employee  appeals and grievances, now scattered among EEOC, the  Federal Labor
Relations Board (FLRB), and the Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB), should
be consolidated into one agency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't the Republicans hypocritical to attack  congressional
careerism in 1994, then fail to pass term limits in 1995?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The 104th Congress made great progress on term limits just  by
bringing the measure up for a vote in the House and Senate.  Although both
houses failed to come up with the two-thirds  majority needed to move the
amendment forward, they have provided  term limit supporters with a solid
benchmark to use in pressing ahead  in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will likely take at least one more election before Congress  has enough
conservative members dedicated to the cause of term  limits to muster the
supermajority needed to press ahead with a  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  stitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't Congress really just trying to &quot;muzzle&quot; opponents
with  its effort to end welfare for lobbyists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. The attempts to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying all  seek to
end 40 years of corrupt political patronage. The proposals  considered by the
104th Congress applied to groups all across  the ideological spectrum. Despite
cries that the reform  efforts amounted to nothing more than &quot;defunding the
left,&quot; the  Simpson-Istook compromise language that reached the floor of
the  House and Senate would affect corporations that receive grants  (primarily
for research and development) just as much as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare for lobbyists is a fundamental question of fiscal  responsibility.
With the drive to achieve a balanced budget in 2002, it  is utterly
irresponsible for the government to be feeding hungry  lobbyists instead of
hungry children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are some of the most vocal supporters of term limits  career
politicians?  Why don't they apply term limits to themselves?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some Members, particularly those elected since 1990,  have agreed
to self-imposed term limits. This marks significant  progress toward a true &quot;citizen
Congress.&quot;  However, many Members  are reluctant to agree voluntarily to
term limits. If reformers  unilaterally &quot;disarm themselves&quot; by leaving
Congress now, the  career politicians left behind will enjoy an even tighter
control of  Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the influence of big money contributions be reduced?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to reduce the impact of special interests on 
elections is to reduce the role of Washington. This can be  accomplished in
several ways. First, reducing the size of  government would reduce the number of
programs subject to  special-interest lobbying and would lower the taxes from
which corporations  routinely seek exceptions. Similarly, imposition of a flat
tax  would eliminate the bidding for tax code loopholes that currently  drives
much Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second step is to reduce Washington's role in the  political process.
Ending taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and forcing  special interests to raise
their money directly from supporters will place  all groups on a level playing
field. At the same time, the federal  government should remain out of the
business of overregulating  elections. In fact, current regulatory schemes are
part of the problem.  It is important to recall that the 1970s campaign finance
reform  effort produced PACs, now the target of reform themselves.  Elections
should not be government-funded, the media should not  be forced to carry
no-cost or low-cost political advertising, and  the government should not impose
spending limits. Moreover,  individual and PAC contribution levels should be
equalized to  ensure that special interests do not enjoy an advantage over 
individual voters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, the ultimate solution to the influence of money in  politics is
to adopt term limits. Limiting the tenure of Members  of Congress forces them to
focus more on policies than politics.  With the understanding that they will not
be part of a &quot;career  Congress,&quot; Members will not be as dependent on
special interests to remain  in office.

<P>
</P>
<P>Race and all of the complex and emotional issues that flow from  it have
been America's unique dilemma since before the founding  of the Republic. After
centuries of overt discrimination against  black Americans, the Supreme Court,
in a series of seminal  decisions beginning with <I>Brown v. Board of 
Education</I> in 1954, initiated the long process of dismantling the
institutional sources of racial  discrimination in American society in areas
such as education,  housing, and voting. Congress, too, attempted to remove
these  barriers in historic legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
 the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise of Affirmative Action. </B>Over the last three  decades,
however, federal judges and agency bureaucrats have  embarked upon a sustained
crusade to twist and distort the original intent  of these laws so that race,
ethnicity, and sex became the proxy  for special, rather than equal, treatment
under the law. Race  consciousness quickly overtook color blindness as the
guiding  principle for the application of civil rights laws that Congress 
explicitly intended to be neutral on these grounds. Today, liberals  justify
race and sex preferences  which have proliferated under the  guise of
affirmative action  as an appropriate and long-overdue  response to centuries of
discrimination against racial minorities  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  women.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, federal agencies now administer literally hundreds  of programs
that favor individuals, businesses, and other  institutions on the basis of the
race, ethnicity, or sex of those who benefit  from these programs. These
preferences can be found in federal  statutes, regulations, and executive
orders. Some are specific to a  particular law or agency; others are
government-wide in their application.  A thorough review of these preferences,
moreover, reveals that  they come in all shapes and sizes  5 percent, 6.9
percent, 8 percent,  10 percent, even as high as 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to these federally sponsored preferences, judicial  and agency
interpretations of federal civil rights laws have  required state and local
governments, colleges and universities, and  private-sector employers to adopt
race and sex-based preferences in  areas such as hiring, promotions, college
admissions, and the  distribution of other privileges and benefits in our
society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates for federal office who believe in the  principle of
equal treatment under the law should emphasize the  following:

</P>
<P><B>Congress should clarify what constitutes discrimination.</B> A  pattern

mean an individual is subject to discrimination.  Discrimi

inferred from statistical  disparities between whites and minorities (or between
men  and women) in employment, housing, or student bodies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many liberal economists and policymakers argue that virtually  all income
differences between racial groups, and between men  and women, are attributable
to discrimination. What exactly do  we know about income differences between
whites and blacks?   What are these differences?  More important, do these
differences  serve as irrefutable proof of discrimination?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) offers a statistical  perspective
common among liberals when she relies upon  statistical differences to argue
that &quot;minorities and women do not have  equal opportunity.&quot;  According
to Lee, &quot;As long as women make up  only 8 percent of engineers, 31 percent
of scientists, and 16 percent  of physicists, we have much work ahead of  us.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#2">2</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>Boston University economics professor Glenn C. Loury,  however, disagrees.
Testifying before the same House subcommittee,  Professor Loury observed that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [T]here is no scientific basis for concluding that
existing  economic differences between groups are caused by, or  reflect the
extent of, discrimination. Groups differ in ways  which affect their aggregate
income, but which are often not  taken 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  into account when the groups are
compared. On my review  of the evidence, discrimination is not a major factor in
 explaining racial economic differences, and federal affirmative  action
policies over the past two decades have contributed  only marginally to the
diminution of these  differences.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#3">3</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ascertain whether any real differences exist  between groups
is to compare apples to apples by controlling  for such important factors as
age, education, and family  structure. When such comparisons are made, most, if
not all, aggregate  income differences between whites and blacks disappear. In
fact,  an honest application of the liberal assumption that  discrimination
lurks behind statistical differences leads to the conclusion that  not only is
statistical proof of discrimination extremely hard to  find, but some categories
of minorities  such as black,  college-educated females  are doing so well that
they qualify as the  &quot;innocent persons&quot; who must bear the burden of
race or  sex-conscious remedies.

similarly  situated whites:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      Overall, black men earned 82.9 percent of the white 
wage. Adjusting for black-white differences in geographic  region, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  schooling and age raises the ratio
to 87.7 percent; adding  differences in [standardized] test scores to this list
of  characteristics raises the ratio to 95.5 percent, and adding differences  in
years of work experience raises the ratio to 99.1  percent.<A

<P><B>Neither are black and white women.</B> Among women with  comparable
educational credentials, there is little or no difference  between whites and
blacks. The U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights found that, among women with
college degrees, black women  actually earn more than their white counterparts.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Citing a recent Census Bureau study, Boston University's  Glenn Loury noted
that: &quot;In 1993 there were about 400,000 college  educated black men and
women working full time as executives,  administrators or managers.... [T]he
women enjoyed median  earnings 10 percent<I> higher</I> than comparable white 
women.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#6">6</A>  Loury emphasizes
that sizable aggregate income differences do exist  between black and white
women and attributes this to the fact  that black women are far more likely to
head single-parent  households than are whites; in 1994, roughly one-half of
black families  were headed by women compared to 13 percent of white  families.<A

<P><B>Family Structure Explains Many Differences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thomas Sowell, Senior Fellow at Stanford University's  Hoover Institution,
has found that, when education and family structure  are held constant, income
differences between whites and blacks  have been negligible for almost three
decades:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     As far back as 1969, black males who came from  homes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  where there were newspapers,
magazines and library  cards had the same incomes as whites from similar homes
and  with the same number of years of schooling. In the 1970s,  black
husband-and-wife families outside the South earned as  much as white
husband-and-wife families outside the South.  By 1981, for the country as a
whole, black  husband-and-wife families where both were college educated and
both  working earned slightly more than white families of the same  description.<A

<P>To Sowell and many other experts, white-black income  differences can be
traced to differences in family structure that became  apparent in 1960 and have
been accelerating ever since:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In every decennial census from 1920 through 1960, 
inclusive, at least 60 percent of all black males from age 15 on  up were
currently married. Moreover, the difference  between black and white males in
this respect was never as great as  5 percentage points during this entire era.
Yet, by 1980,  less than half of all black males in these age brackets were 
currently married  and the gap between black and white  males was 17 percentage
points. By 1992, that gap had widened  to 21 percentage points.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Original Intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</B> Senator Hubert  H.
Humphrey (D-MN), floor manager for the 1964 Act, when  addressing one skeptical
colleague made what is perhaps the  most famous offer ever made on the Senate
floor: &quot;If the Senator  can find in title VII... any language which
provides that an  employer 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  will have to hire on the basis of
percentage or quota related  to color... I will start eating the pages one after
another, because it  is not in there.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Humphrey also assured the Senate that &quot;nothing in the bill  would
permit any official or court to require any employer or labor  union to give
preferential treatment to any minority group.&quot;  
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#11">11</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Senator Harrison Williams (D-NJ) also understood the 1964  Civil Rights Act
to be color-blind in its application. During floor  debate, he said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      [T]o hire a Negro solely because he is a Negro is racial 
discrimination, just as much as a `white only'  employment policy. Both forms of
discrimination are prohibited by  Title VII of this bill. The language of that
title simply states  that race is not a qualification for employment....Some 
people charge that [the Civil Rights Act of 1964] favors the Negro,  at the
expense of the white majority. But how can the  language of equality favor one
race over another?  Equality can  have only one meaning....Those who say that
equality means  favoritism do violence to common sense.
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#12">12</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative John Lindsay (R-NY), a member of the House  Judiciary
Committee, similarly assured members that the  legislation did not favor one
group over another: &quot;[The bill] does  not...force acceptance of people in
schools, jobs, housing, or public  accommodations because they are Negro. It
does not impose quotas  or any special privileges of seniority or acceptance.
There is  nothing whatever in this bill about racial  balance.&quot;<A

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers over 94 million employees  in both the
public and private sectors. As controversial as the  Dole-Canady legislation may
be to liberals, it would reach only  federal workers, who comprise but 3.1
percent of the nation's work  force. Those who work for state and local
governments,  private-sector firms that receive federal contracts, and other
private sector  firms would continue to be subject to federal civil rights laws
that  require employers to favor some individuals over others on  racial,
ethnic, or gender grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Casting a Wider Net?</B> One common perception about  affirmative action
is that it began as a benign effort to combat  discrimination by requiring
employers to cast a wider net so that members of  historically neglected groups
could compete on an equal footing  for jobs and promotions. Only later, this
theory holds, did it  evolve into the current system of quotas and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While this may be true in some instances, President  Lyndon Johnson laid the
foundations for today's complex web of  race-conscious programs and set-asides
as early as June 1965. &quot;[I]t  is not enough,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;to
open the gates of opportunity.&quot;   Rather, &quot;All our citizens must have
the ability to walk  through those gates.&quot;  Johnson continued: &quot;This
is the next and the  more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek
not just  freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human 
ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a  fact and
equality as a result.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#14">14</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, while most commentators recall the famous  declaration by Martin
Luther King, Jr., that he dreamed of the day when  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  citizen's race would not matter
and persons would be judged  &quot;not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their  character,&quot; they forget his comment two years later when
he defended  &quot;preferential treatment&quot; for minority groups in a
magazine interview: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Playboy:</B> Do you feel it's fair to request a
multibillion-dollar  program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any
other  minority group?

<P><B>Dr. King:</B> I do indeed.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today, it is common for proponents to justify affirmative action  as a group
remedy that rewards even individuals who have not  suffered from discrimination.
One of many examples of this  approach comes from Walter Dellinger, currently
Assistant Attorney  General in the U.S. Department of Justice, who defines 
affirmative action as &quot;a group-based remedy: where a group has been 
subject to discrimination, individual members of the group can  benefit from the
remedy, even if they have not proved that they have  been discriminated against
personally.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#16">16</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents of affirmative action typically deny that these  policies amount
to quotas or that they constitute any form of reverse  discrimination. Numerical
goals and timetables, they argue, are  not quotas. President Clinton's Assistant
Attorney General for  Civil Rights, Deval L. Patrick, believes that affirmative
action  policies come in three flavors:<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#17">17</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Casting a wider net:</B> At one end of the spectrum are
efforts  to reach out to &quot;traditionally excluded individuals&quot; and to  &quot;recruit
talent broadly in all American communities.&quot; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Quotas:</B> At the other end of the spectrum are quotas, which  Patrick
defines as &quot;hard and fast numbers of places in school or the  workplace
specifically reserved for members of certain groups,  regardless of
qualifications.&quot;  No one supports quotas, argues  Patrick, who adds that
federal law makes these measures patently illegal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Affirmative consideration:</B> Here lies the middle ground
of  affirmative action, where race, ethnicity, or sex is but one of many 
factors considered in evaluating qualified candidates. &quot;This form of 
consideration,&quot; Patrick explains, &quot;does not guarantee success based 
on race, ethnicity or gender. Rather it emphasizes a full range  of
qualifications and is characterized by flexibility.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is discrimination an inevitable part of affirmative action  programs? 
</B>Since the inception of affirmative action, the  Supreme Court has concluded
on several occasions that these programs  actually require discrimination
against innocent parties. For  example, former Justice Harry Blackmun admitted
in 
<I>Bakke v. State of California</I> that &quot;I suspect that it would be
impossible to arrange  an affirmative action program in a racially neutral way
and have it  be successful.... In order to get beyond racism, we must first take
 account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat  some persons
equally, we must treat them  differently.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#18">18</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eight years later, the Court acknowledged that &quot;as part of  this
Nation's dedication to eradicating racial discrimination,  innocent persons may
be called upon to bear some of the burden of the  remedy.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#19">19</A>  Finally, in his autobiography,
Justice William O.  Douglas quoted his colleague, Justice Thurgood Marshall, as 
specifically acknowledging the discriminatory nature of race-conscious  affir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mative action policies: &quot;You
guys have been practicing  discrimination for years. Now it's our  turn.&quot;<A

</P>
<P><B>The Supreme Court's Tighter Standard for Federal  Affirmative Action
Programs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 12, 1995, the Supreme Court imposed a crucial and,  many would
argue, debilitating requirement on government  programs that bestow preferences
on the basis of race. The case  was <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</I>.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#21">21</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the prime  contract for a
highway construction project in Colorado to  Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction
Company. Under the terms of the  contract, Mountain Gravel would receive a
bonus, up to 2 percent of  the total contract, if it hired subcontractors
certified as small  businesses controlled by &quot;socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#22">22</A>
 Although Adarand submitted the low bid for  the guardrail portion of the
contract, Mountain Gravel accepted  a higher bid from the Gonzales Construction
Company. Why?   Under federal law, Gonzales' designation as a &quot;socially and
 economically disadvantaged&quot; business entitled Mountain Gravel to  a
$30,000 bonus from the Department of  Transportation.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#23">23</A>  The Court held that &quot;[A]ll
racial classifications, imposed by  whatever federal, state, or local
governmental actor, must be analyzed by  a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny. In other words, such  classifications are constitutional only if they
are narrowly tailored  measures that further compelling governmental interests.&quot;

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The <I>Adarand </I>decision has prompted the Clinton Administration  to
mount an aggressive defense of existing affirmative action  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  grams that favor one race or
ethnic group over  others.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#24">24</A> 
Because <I>Adarand</I><U> </U>will cast a long shadow over congressional and 
executive branch activity on civil rights issues in 1996 and beyond, it is 
important to examine it in some detail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  observed that
race-based distinctions in federal law are always highly  suspect, both when
they seek to harm groups that historically  have been discriminated against and
when they seek to bestow  advantages on them. O'Connor concluded that &quot;any
person, of  whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor 
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting  that
person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial  scrutiny.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#25">25</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is there a &quot;debtor&quot; or &quot;creditor&quot; race?  
</B>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions in
which  they took strong exception to any statutory or regulatory  classification
based, in whole or in part, on race. Justice Scalia wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In my view, government can never have a &quot;compelling 
interest&quot; in discriminating on the basis of race in order to  &quot;make up&quot;
for past racial discrimination in the opposite  direction. Individuals who have
been wronged by unlawful racial  discrimination should be made whole; but under
our  Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or  debtor
race.... To pursue the concept of racial entitlement  even  for the most
admirable and benign of purposes  is to  reinforce and preserve for future
mischief the way of thinking that  produced race slavery, race privilege and
race hatred. In the  eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is 
American.<a href="ftnt13.htm#26">26</a> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Leaving the door open to future  mischief.</B> While the strict scrutiny
standard undoubtedly will force federal, state, and  local policymakers to
eliminate racial preferences from  government programs, Justices Scalia and
Thomas raise a legitimate point.  The very notion of strict scrutiny
contemplates that in some  situations, laws that favor one race over another
will pass constitutional  muster. In fact, Justice O'Connor left the door open
for legislatures  to enact laws containing more subtle forms of racial
preferences  by observing that &quot;The unhappy persistence of both the
practice  and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against  minority
groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government  is not
disqualified from acting in response to  it.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#27">27</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Looking for ways to preserve the literally hundreds of federal  laws and
regulations that contain racial preferences, President  Clinton and his
appointees have seized upon O'Connor's comment to  argue that strict scrutiny is
not really all that  strict.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Will Strict Scrutiny Spell the End of Race and Sex-Based  Preferences?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Former Justice Thurgood Marshall once described the strict  scrutiny
standard in constitutional cases as &quot;strict in theory, but fatal  in fact.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#29">29</A>  More recently, Justice Clarence
Thomas concluded  that, aside from two anomalous cases during World War II, 
application of this standard to racial classifications &quot;has proven 
automatically fatal.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#30">30</A> 
While legal scholars may dispute the effect of strict  scrutiny on federal
affirmative action programs, no one doubts  that <I>Adarand </I>makes it
extraordinarily difficult for these programs  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  survive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To Justice O'Connor, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to  &quot;`smoke out'
illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative  body is pursuing a
goal important enough to warrant use of a highly  suspect tool. The test also
ensures that the means chosen `fit'  this compelling goal so closely that there
is little or no possibility  that the motive for the classification was
illegitimate racial prejudice  or stereotype.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#31">31</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What, then, does strict scrutiny mean for racial preferences in  federal
law?<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#32">32</A>  Yale Law School professor
Paul Gewirtz believes  that most, if not all, racial preferences will fall afoul
of this  standard. He argues that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Race-based affirmative action is constitutional only where
it  addresses the effects of discrimination in the most  circumscribed sense.</B>
Despite the best efforts of President Clinton and his  appointees to rally
around the mantra of diversity, a majority of  justices now reject both
diversity and inclusion as independent goals  for affirmative action.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#33">33</A>  In doing so, the Court has put
the  Congress on notice that literally hundreds of federal programs and 
regulations are unconstitutional. Justice O'Connor has said that  diversity &quot;is
clearly not a compelling interest,&quot; rests on &quot;illegitimate 
stereotypes,&quot; and is &quot;too amorphous, too insubstantial, and too 
unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial  classifications.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Affirmative action may be used only where Congress can  show that actual
discrimination has occurred.</B> This requires hard  evidence that
discrimination exists in the local market and  sector where affirmative action
is used. Courts are increasingly  reluctant 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  to accept inferences that
statistical disparities among racial  groups are caused by local discrimination
rather than by other  factors. Thus, an affirmative action program that gives
preferences to  minority-owned engineering firms in awarding contracts would  be
more likely to pass constitutional muster if officials could  demonstrate that
the basis of the alleged statistical underrepresentation  is the relevant pool
of qualified applicants  the number of  minority-owned engineering firms
financially capable of bidding for  these contracts in the geographic area in
question  rather than the  overall percentage of minorities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Racial preferences must be narrowly tailored to remedy  identifiable
discrimination.</B> Race-based methods may be used only  (a) after race-neutral
means are considered; (b) to the extent  shown necessary to remedy the scope of
the identified discrimination;  (c) where the individual seeking a racial
preference has suffered  from the effects of the past discrimination; and (d) if
undue burdens  on nonbeneficiaries   such as layoffs  are avoided. As 
University of Michigan professor Carl Cohen explains, &quot;[I]t is the injury 
for which remedy is given, not the skin color or  sex.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lower courts have interpreted the strict scrutiny standard  narrowly. As
Gewirtz notes, &quot;most of the [state and local]  programs litigated to
judgment have been held unconstitutional.&quot;  Those  that have survived,
moreover, either have not been challenged or  were settled out of court.<A

<P>On June 28, 1995, Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General  in the
Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department, sent &quot;a  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  eral overview&quot; to all
general counsel in federal agencies  on <I>Adarand </I>and &quot;the new
standard for assessing the  constitutionality of federal affirmative action
programs.&quot;  Dellinger advised  that <I>Adarand </I>allows some
race-conscious affirmative action  programs to survive in certain circumstances.
But what are those  circumstances?  Dellinger's legal strategy to undermine 
<I>Adarand </I>includes the following key points:

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Constitutional considerations may compel the courts to
defer  to Congress more generally on affirmative action issues.</B>  Dellinger
drives an enormous loophole through<I>  Adarand</I> when he argues that
Congress may be able to justify remedial racial and ethnic  classifications
simply by including &quot;national findings of  discrimination&quot; in the
prologue to legislation. Congress, he argues, enjoys  express constitutional
power to remedy discrimination against  minorities and therefore has more
latitude to engage in race-based  affirmative action than do state and local
governments. But he cautions  that Congress may not use evidence of &quot;generalized,
historical  societal discrimination&quot; to justify racial preferences. Rather,
it &quot;must  have some particularized evidence about the existence and effects
 of discrimination in the sectors and industries for which it  prescribes racial
or ethnic  classifications.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#37">37</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Governments can enact affirmative action programs even with  no evidence
of actual discrimination, provided that this  information eventually becomes
available.</B> Dellinger argues that lower  courts have concluded that
governments may use &quot;post-enactment&quot;  evidence to justify affirmative
action programs. To create a record  of discrimination prior to legislative
action, he recommends the  use of controversial and discredited &quot;disparity
studies:&quot;  &quot;Where  the record is sparse, Congress or the relevant
agency may have to  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  velop it. That endeavor may
involve the commissioning of  disparity studies of the type that state and local
governments around  the country undertook... to demonstrate that remedial racial
and  ethnic classifications in public contracting are  warranted.&quot;<A

past discrimination,<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#39">39</A> Dellinger
insists  that diversity remains an acceptable goal of affirmative  action<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#40">40</A> and offers several examples of
situations in which  diversity-inspired racial preferences would satisfy the
compelling interest test,  including college admissions, the hiring of
university faculty,  the ownership of broadcast licenses, law enforcement, and

<P><B>Federal Programs That Contain Race or Sex-Based  Preferences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In February 1995, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)  responded to a
request from Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole  (R-KS) for a comprehensive list
of &quot;every federal statute,  regulation, program, and executive order that
grants a preference to  individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin,
or ethnic  background.&quot;  Preferences, Senator Dole instructed, &quot;include,
but  are not limited to, timetables, goals, set-asides, and quotas.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The CRS study<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#41">41</A> lists over
160 federal laws, regulations, and  executive orders that contain these
preferences, identifying race  and sex-based preferences that range from 5 to 25
percent. These  pref

levels as 5  percent, 6.9 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, 12 percent, 15
percent, and  25 percent.

<P><B>Ignoring the Law in Pursuit of Racial and Sex-Based  Preferences - The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal  Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the  federal prohibition against
employment discrimination, as well as  prohibitions against discrimination
contained in the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination Act, Equal
Pay Act, and  other civil rights laws. The commission investigates allegations
of  discrimination by individuals, unions, associations, and others and,  if the
claims are not settled out of court, brings civil suit  seeking damages against
responsible parties. Unfortunately, the EEOC  has abused this authority by
assuming that any statistical disparity  between the races in employment results
from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Does Federal Law Require the EEOC to Use Quotas? The  answer clearly is &quot;No.&quot;
 During floor debate on the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, some Members of the House
questioned whether the  bill's employment provisions would force private-sector
employers  to adopt quotas. Judiciary Committee Chairman Emmanuel  Celler (D-NY)
assured them that &quot;The charge... that the Equal  Employment Opportunity
Commission to be established by Title VII  of the bill would have the power
to... order the hiring and  promotion only of employees of certain races or
religious groups... is  patently false.&quot;  Celler also denied emphatically
that the EEOC would  have the authority to remedy racial or religious imbalances
by  requiring &quot;the hiring of certain people without regard to their 
qualifications simply because they are of a given race or religion.&quot;

In fact, the very  opposite is true. Title VII prohibits discrimination. In
effect, it  says that race, religion, and national origin are not to be used  as
the basis for hiring and firing. Title VII is designed to  encourage hiring on
the basis of ability and qualifications, not  race or religion.<A

the company violated federal  law because it did not hire exactly 8.45 black
employees. EEOC  attorneys demanded that the firm advertise to find blacks who 
might have applied for work there but never did so, and then pay  these
individuals a total of $123,000 in &quot;back pay.&quot;  After  considerable

<P>The EEOC applied a &quot;disparate impact&quot; theory to infer

market (36 percent), even though the firm hired  a higher percentage of black
(16.4 percent) than white (6.1  percent) applicants. A federal appeals court
rejected the EEOC's  claims, concluding that potential black employees faced
high  commuting costs due to the firm's location in a Hispanic and Asian part 
of Chicago and that the company's lack of an English fluency  requirement meant
it naturally would receive a  disproportionate number of applications from
non-English-speaking  applicants. These factors, the court reasoned, were too

<P>The University of Maryland administered a scholarship  program reserved
exclusively for black students that, according to  the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals, did not meet the Supreme  Court's strict scrutiny standard for racial
classifications. The Clinton  Administration filed a brief on behalf of the
preference  program. Court documents indicate that between 1990 and 1992, the 
university awarded scholarships to 76 minority students, 42 of whom  had the
financial resources to pay their own way through college.  In fact, the
scholarships exceeded the actual financial need of all  but eight students.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In spite of this decision, Judith A. Winston, general counsel at  the

not to revise &quot;race-targeted aid  programs.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#72">72</A>  She advised that the Clinton
Administration believes that  &quot;race-based student aid is legal... as a
remedy for past discrimination or as  a tool to achieve a diverse student body.&quot;
 It is not surprising,  therefore, to see that race-exclusive policies continue
unchecked at  our major universities.

its applications for its graduate program into two  categories, one for &quot;underrepresented

Non-minorities, on the  other hand, must make a specific showing of need. &quot;If
you're a  black, Puerto Rican, Mexican-American, or Native American applicant 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  Harvard's graduate program in

expenses; low-income white  students, on the other hand, receive a maximum
stipend of two  years. As summed up by Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield,  &quot;Blacks
are compared with other blacks and not really with whites;  and there are
separate funds as well, the purpose of which is to  keep the professors on the
admissions committee from actually  feeling that they're rejecting someone
better qualified when they  choose on the basis of affirmative action. But, of

<P>Many corporations, hoping to immunize themselves from  expensive

<P>

<P>Two experts who have reviewed the U.S. military's  experience with
affirmative action believe that it could serve as a model  for such programs in
the private sector and other government  agencies. According to former White

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     One of the keys to the military's recent 
success...in...dealing with race relations...has been its insistence on each 
recruit's meeting the same employment standards. Virtually every  recruit is
required to have a high school diploma. This policy  is the result of decades of
data demonstrating that high  school achievement as represented by a diploma is
more  predictive than aptitude tests of adaptability to military life and 
likelihood of serving out an entire tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     With the same employment standards required of each  recruit, it should
come as no surprise that the military can  make integration work...Indeed,
notwithstanding the relatively  high minority drop-out rate, the percentage of
blacks in the  military, virtually all of whom have diplomas, is nearly twice 
the national percentage. <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#85">85</A>

As Moskos explains it, the system works  as follows:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     The goal for the number of minorities promoted to the 
next highest rank is based not on the overall number of  minorities in the Army,
but on the number of minorities in the pool  of those qualified for promotion.
The military has no hint of  two promotion lists, whites being compared only
with  whites, blacks only with blacks. From enlistment on up, all  candidates
are held to the same standard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     The number of blacks who are promoted from captain to  major, a virtual
prerequisite for an officer seeking an Army  career, is usually below the
goal....The most plausible  explanation is that a disproportionate number of
black officers  lack the writing and communication skills for promotion to 
staff jobs. In all other ranks, including colonel through  general officers,
promotions show little racial differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     Strict maintenance of common standards for  promotion... means that
those who attain senior positions are fully  qualified. Also important, those
blacks who are promoted have  a self-confidence that makes them the strongest
defenders  of standards for their own black subordinates.<A

as typical white students.&quot;  Unlike California's Bridge Program,  these
programs are not targeted exclusively at minority soldiers.  Their
beneficiaries, however, are disproportionately  African-American. The bottom
line?  According to Moskos, &quot;no identifiable groups  of

precludes private-sector employers from adopting  the military's version of
affirmative action.  In<I> Griggs</I>, the Court determined that diplomas could

workplace rewards for academic  achievement have been abandoned.<A

insofar as they can be interpreted to  put any inhibition on any employer's

 This could be accomplished easily by amending the  rules to provide that &quot;No

performance from those they know to have been preferred in the process  of
selection. Moreover, affirmative action sometimes leaves  its beneficiaries
uncertain about the basis of their own  accomplishments. Blacks promoted to

<P>At the beginning of 1995, the issue of racial preferences  attracted

<P>Although racial preferences reach into virtually every aspect  of American
society, legislation currently being considered in  Congress leaves most federal

extremely controversial,  success even in this limited area would be unusually

activism of liberal Supreme Courts, which established the current regime  of
legal race privileges. It is proper, therefore, for Congress to  reassert its
constitutional role and restore the timeless principle  of equal treatment under
the law for all Americans by ridding  the public sector of such veiled
restitution and social experimentation.

<P><B>The Dole-Canady Legislation</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, Congress will consider the Equal Opportunity Act  of 1995,
introduced by Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) and  Representative Charles Canady
(R-FL). This legislation would implement  the <I>Adarand</I> decision by
eliminating race and sex consciousness  from all federal programs and
activities. Professor Carl Cohen of  the University of Michigan has summed up
the philosophical  premise of this legislation:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [M]oral entitlements are not held by groups. Whites as  a
group do not have rights; blacks as a group do not  have rights; rights are
possessed by persons, individual human  persons. And when persons are entitled
to be made whole  for some injury earlier done to them, the duty is owed not  to
members of their race or sex or nationality, not to their  group, but to them as
individuals. The effort to defend preference  as group compensation fails

</P>
<P>What would the Dole-Canady legislation do?  The  Dole-Canady Equal
Opportunity Act of 1995 <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#116">116</A>
seeks to accomplish two  broad goals: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Equal Treatment:</B> &quot;The purpose of this Act is
to ensure that  all Americans are treated equally by the Federal government in 
Federal employment, Federal contracting and subcontracting, and 
Federally-conducted programs.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#117">117</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Equal Opportunity:</B> &quot;The Act endorses those Federal 
`affirmative action' programs that are designed to recruit broadly and widen 
the opportunities for competition without guaranteeing the results  of the
competition.&quot;  At the same time, the bill would eliminate  those federal
activities that create quotas, set-asides, timetables,  goals, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  and other preferences on the
basis of race, color, national origin,  or sex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The legislation reflects the view that the federal government  must put its
own house in order with respect to racial and gender  preferences. Specifically,
the bill:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Bans race or sex-based preferences in federal programs.</B> The 
federal government, its officers, and its employees would have to  end all
intentional discrimination based &quot;in whole or in part on  race, color,
national origin, or sex&quot; with respect to contracts,  subcontracts, and
employment. In addition, no federal entity would  be allowed to &quot;grant a
preference&quot; to any individual or group on  the basis of race, sex, or
ethnicity. As defined broadly in the  Act, granting a preference includes &quot;any
preferential treatment and  includes but is not limited to any use of a quota,
set-aside,  goal, timetable, or other numerical objective.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Prohibits the federal government from encouraging federal 
contractors and subcontractors to adopt race or sex-based preferences.</B>   The
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  (OFCCP) would no longer be
allowed to pressure firms that receive  federal contracts or subcontracts to
adopt racial or gender quotas.  Located in the Department of Labor, OFCCP
receives an annual  appropriation of $60 million to monitor the hiring practices
of federal  contractors with respect to race, ethnicity, and sex. Its
jurisdiction  extends to more than $161 billion in annual federal contracting 
activity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Protects outreach, recruiting, and marketing efforts designed  to
bring more qualified minorities and women to the attention of  em
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  ployers, colleges, and
universities.</B> Federal programs that are  targeted on minorities but do not &quot;guarantee
the results of the  competition&quot; would continue in place. One example is a
small program  in the U.S. Department of Agriculture<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#118">118</A> which provides support  for
campus recruitment and retention programs and agricultural  career awareness
initiatives in order to increase the participation of  minorities in agriculture
without subjecting participating schools  to any numerical goals or timetables.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Exempts Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HCBUs) and
Indian tribes.</B> The federal government sets aside literally  hundreds of
millions of dollars annually for HCBUs and Indian  tribes. While conservatives
ought to question the rationale for these  programs,<A

them alone. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 would put an  immediate end to
an enormously complex web of race and sex-based  preferences in federal law,
including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     As many as 100 programs in dozens of federal agencies and
 departments that grant preferences to individuals, nonprofit  organizations,
and colleges and universities on the basis of race,  ethnicity, or sex.
Together, these programs receive over $10 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Dozens of agency-specific regulations that reach every program  in an
agency's jurisdiction, even where the authorizing law makes  no mention of race
or sex preferences. In addition,  Dole-Canady would put an end to the common
practice of conditioning  federal employee evaluations and bonuses on whether
employers have  met their affirmative action goals. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Several government-wide preferences that affect over $161  billion in
federal contracting activity annually, and others that  condition the awarding
of federal licenses and charters  for example,  to banks and broadcasting
facilities  on the recipient's agreeing  to bestow preferences on favored
groups.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates who want to advance a policy of equal treatment  under the law
for all employees, students, and recipients of federal  grants and contracts
would do well to embrace the following  policy changes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Enact the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 
(H.R. 2128/S. 1085).</B> Enactment of this legislation represents the  first
step toward a true policy of equal treatment under the law.  It would end the
federal government's practice of favoring  women and minorities in the
allocation of over $160 billion of federal  contracts; establish race-neutral
and sex-neutral principles in the  hiring, promotion, and evaluation of all
federal employees; end  the imposition of federal racial quotas on
private-sector firms that  do business with the government; and end
discriminatory practices  in the operation of hundreds of federal programs that
award over  $10 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore the original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</B> 
The guiding principle behind the Dole-Canady bill  equal  treatment under the
law  must be extended to employees of state and  local governments, colleges and
universities, and all private-sector  employers. To accomplish this, Congress
must restore the  original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by adding
language that  ech
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  oes former Justice Thurgood
Marshall's statement that the  1964 Act &quot;prohibits all racial
discrimination in employment,  without exception for any group of particular
employees.&quot;  Congress  must explicitly forbid courts and administrative
agencies from  construing Title VII of the 1964 Act as authorizing, permitting,
or  encouraging the use of quotas or preferences involving race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and 
universities.</B> There is no justification for the proliferation of 
race-exclusive scholarships, special financial assistance programs,  and relaxed
admissions standards for minority students now found  routinely in our colleges
and universities. Congress should  abolish these practices outright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*    Repeal the EEOC's <I>Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection
Procedures</I>.</B> Congress should use its power of the purse to end  the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission's practice of  using the<I> Uniform
Guidelines</I> to prohibit employers from requiring  employees to meet minimal
educational requirements, such as  possession of a high school diploma.

<P><B>Q &amp; A</B>

<P><B>Q. Would enactment of the Dole-Canady legislation result in  race and
gender neutrality for all Americans? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Because the Dole-Canady bill only reaches federal  employees
and federal programs, it would not affect affirmative  action practices that,
thanks to overzealous judges and agency  bureaucrats who have misconstrued the
original intent of the 1964  Civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  Rights Act, have become the norm
in the private sector, in  state and local government, and at colleges and
universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do you want to eliminate protections for people who  are
discriminated against?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In fact, the original Civil Rights legislation in 1964, which  is
still on the books, protects everyone of all races and creeds  from
discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 still provides  this protection on
an individual basis. It is the courts, through  undue judicial activism, which
have miscontrued the legal application  of these laws to allow racial
preferences for certain favored races  at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Justice Scalia stated in his <I>Adarand</I> opinion, there can be  no &quot;debtor
race.&quot;  In order for civil rights to be something other than  a tool for
veiled restitution and retribution, the legal protection  from discrimination
must only attach to individuals on a case by  case basis. Any other application
must result in an unfair system of  racial preferences and government-sponsored
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can conservatives call for a color blind society when 
discrimination exists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is first important to realize that the federal government is 
limited in its ability to address such social maladies as racial 
discrimination. The best it can do is to end those government  programs that
promote discrimination. Affirmative action programs not  only promote
discrimination; discrimination is the fundamental  principle behind of these
programs.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With frustrated Americans focusing their anger increasingly  on Washington
and gridlock, many political candidates in 1994  successfully ran against
Washington, appealing to voters to &quot;throw  the bums out&quot; and replace
them with individuals who are more  honest and more devoted to the public
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One result has been that ideas such as devolution and  federalism, ignored
for decades, are back in the forefront of public  debate. Because Washington is
seen as cumbersome, rigid, and  distant from the people, this Congress has
attempted to give the states  and local governments more autonomy and
responsibility in areas  such as welfare. The assumption is that this will
result in greater  experimentation, increased efficiency, and government that
once again  is closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America emphasized the need for  devolution and a shift of
selected responsibilities from Washington to  state and local governments.
However, although devolution in its  many forms may produce benefits in selected
programs, by itself it  will not address the root cause of the many problems
plaguing  American society. The reason: The source of the problem is not an 
inefficient distribution of functions between the different layers of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  ernment, to be corrected by
reshuffling. Nor is it bad people  holding public office, or even poorly
designed programs. The  fundamental problem is systemic: The Constitutional
system  established by the Framers has been largely dismantled, releasing 
government, especially the national government, from virtually all  restraint.
Unconstrained government inevitably has swept aside civil  society, replacing it
with political decisionmaking and  bureaucratic administration unaccountable to
the public. Together, these  have created the conditions within which the
economic and social  problems now burdening society have arisen and flourished. 
Encroachment by Washington also has blocked state and local  governments, as
well as civil society, from initiating innovative responses  to those problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This has resulted in four dilemmas, all of which require action:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the central purpose of the Constitution  limiting the  power
of government  has been forgotten, and many of the  mechanisms for enforcing
those limits have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the states  the key element in the American  constitutional
system  have been stripped of the ability to carry out  their constitutional
responsibility of checking and balancing the  national government, and this has
allowed Washington to assume an  unlimited and unchallengeable role in the
economy, in society, and  in the lives of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the resulting centralization of power in Washington and  the
unchecked expansion of its reach have undermined the  institutions of civil
society and thereby severely weakened the ability of  the people to exercise
self-government. Washington has replaced  civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  society with bureaucratic
rulemaking and administration  from above, and<B> </B>has<B> </B>made
decisionmaking in all areas of public  and private life more responsive to
political factors  and<B> </B>ideologies than to empirical results and the
preferences of the citizenry. In  addition, centralization has insulated
decisionmaking from  participation by the very people most directly affected by
government  programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the federal judiciary has permitted, even mandated,  an
open-ended expansion of power by the national government,  arrogating to itself
the role of legislature of last resort and imposing  a liberal agenda explicitly
and repeatedly rejected by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The national government's rise to dominance has taken  many years. Some
steps, such as the popular election of Senators,  occurred for entirely
democratic reasons and with full public  support; others, such as the weakening
of the criminal justice system,  were accomplished by sleight of hand and
against solid public  opposition. Taken together, they constitute a virtual
rewriting of the  Constitution, the impact of which has yet to be fully
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What the Framers Intended</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A fundamental assumption of the Framers of the Constitution  was that the
American people were and would continue to be  largely self-governing, running
their own affairs by means of the  network of social relationships and voluntary
organizations  collectively known as civil society, such as families,
communities,  and churches. Government, especially local government  controlled

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  directly by the community, was
seen as a necessary ally of  civil society. But it was restricted to those
limited functions which  civil society could not easily perform for itself, such
as defense,  the police, and the coining of money. The purpose of government 
was to secure an environment within which free people would  control their own
affairs: in other words, an environment that makes  possible the individual &quot;pursuit
of happiness.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In writing the Constitution, the Framers had two objectives:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  To correct the failings of the Articles of Confederation,  due
largely to the states' domination of a weak national  government.</B> Thus, a
new national government was created with sufficient  powers to carry out a
limited number of crucial functions, such as  the regulation of international
and interstate commerce, and to  prevent the states from interfering in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To limit the power of the new national government.</B>  Having
fought a revolution against what they defined as tyranny   the unchecked
exercise of power, regardless of motive  their  second, and far more important,
objective was to prevent its  reemergence from their own handiwork. They
therefore spent the bulk of  their deliberations on devising ways to limit the
power of the  national government.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Trusting neither the written word of the Constitution nor  self-restraint on
the part of officeholders to enforce the necessary  limits, the Framers devised
a complex system of checks and balances  in which various political actors were
placed deliberately in  permanent opposition to one another. This tension was
intended to  ensure that the energies and ambitions of the respective  groups 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  would be directed against one
another, thereby protecting  civil society from unwanted interference. The best
known of these  safeguards  the division of the national government into three 
competing branches: executive, legislative, and judicial  has  proven both
effective and durable despite two centuries of change.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Central Role of Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even more essential to the intent of the Constitution were the  several
checks and balances between the national government and  the states, and the
division of power between them, a wholly new  system which came to be called
federalism. Despite the crucial  role assigned to it, however, federalism
remains widely misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federalism is commonly defined as the division of powers  among the federal,
state, and local governments according to which  performs them best. For
example, the national government has  general responsibility for defense; the
states, for most prisons  and roads; and local governments, for schools. Certain
powers, such  as taxation and the regulation of commerce, are shared. Advocates 
of federalism often assert that this division of powers is more  efficient than
centralizing all functions in Washington, and that  innovative approaches to
problems are more likely to emerge from  the experiments of 50 state governments
than from a monolithic  national bureaucracy. In addition, proponents generally 
emphasize the need to keep government as close to the people as possible  by
keeping its functions at the lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, all of these arguments in favor of federalism are  subsidiary to
its central purpose: limiting the power of government at  all levels. The
national and state governments were intended to  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  strain one another, not to work
hand-in-glove or parcel out  functions to that level of government which will
perform them  best. Thus, the new government was given the power to prevent  the
states from abusing their authority through such actions as  erecting trade
barriers against one another, and national legislation  was given preeminence
over state and local law in those limited  areas reserved to the national
government. In turn, the states were  expected to constrain Washington, as they
were regarded as the  only effective means of doing so.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>So crucial was the role of the states in limiting the  national government's
power that the Framers provided them with  several safeguards, including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A direct role</B> in the making of all laws and the
appointment of  all federal officials, including federal judges, through a
Senate  composed of members appointed by the states;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The ability to block</B> all constitutional amendments proposed 
by Congress and to bypass an out-of-touch national government  altogether by
means of a constitutional convention; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A written guarantee</B> against Washington's assumption of 
additional powers in the form of the blunt and sweeping language  of the Tenth
Amendment, which reserved all powers not delegated  to the national government
by the Constitution either to the states  or to the people.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Safeguards Were Dismantled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This carefully constructed system remained largely intact for  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  100 years; but beginning in the
early part of this century, the  ability of the states to perform their
constitutional role of limiting  the national government has been progressively
reduced to the  point that it has been virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The process was a lengthy and complex one, but its principal  landmarks
were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The ratification in 1913 of the 16th and 17th
Amendments,</B>  which removed key restraints on the national government by
giving  it unlimited taxing authority and by mandating that Senators were  to be
elected by popular vote rather than selected by state  legislatures. As a
result, Washington secured the resources necessary  for an open-ended expansion
of its functions even as the states  were removed from the making of national
policy and eliminated as  the principal bulwark against expansion by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The national emergencies of the Depression, World War II,  and the
Cold War,</B> which legitimized political forces arguing  for greater power at
the national level to deal with domestic and  international problems. The powers
and functions assumed by  Washington in times of emergency have remained long
after their  original justification has passed. In fact, many of the emergency 
powers of the 1930s were vastly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s in  such
programs as the Great Society and the War on Poverty, each  of which further
increased Washington's power by giving it an  activist leading role in areas of
the economy and society never  before assumed by any level of government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in 1937, the Supreme Court's abandonment of its 
traditional role of enforcing limits</B> laid out in the Constitution through  a
series of decisions that have removed virtually all  constitutional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  restraints on the national
government. The power of the  national government to regulate interstate
commerce, for example, has  been interpreted as being virtually unlimited,
extending to virtually  every area of the economy and society; the Tenth
Amendment,  in effect, has been gutted.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in the 1950s, in pursuit of what its advocates  have
called a &quot;judicial revolution,&quot;</B> the Supreme Court's radical 
alteration of established interpretations of rights guaranteed by  the
Constitution, with some vastly expanded, others restricted,  and still others
simply invented. This judicial activism has  transformed the Court into an
unelected &quot;super legislature,&quot; effectively  unbound by any restraints.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Judicial Activism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Judicial activism now extends to all areas of public and private  life
because the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary have  succeeded in granting
themselves virtually unlimited power.  Federal, state, and local laws, duly
enacted by elected officials, have  been struck down; state and local government
functions such as  schools and prisons have been taken over by the federal
courts and  subjected to their increasingly minute direction; and state 
constitutions have been rewritten at will. Referenda passed with  overwhelming

<P>Calculating the economic costs stemming from the demise of  federalism and
the expansion of the national government is  difficult, if only because of the
enormity of the task. These costs  include reduced economic growth for the
nation as a whole through  heavy taxation, burdensome regulation of businesses,
and the  skewed investment of resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     As programs have expanded to cover all areas of
national life,  the federal budget has grown commensurately, both in terms of 
taxpayer dollars and as a percentage of the national economy.  In 1934, the
national government accounted for 10 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP).
In 1948, it was still only 12 percent.  By 1960, however, it had ballooned to 18
percent, and by 1994, to  22 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The tax burden also has necessarily expanded. In 1914, the 
first year of the federal income tax, Americans making from $4,000  to $20,000
were taxed 1 percent of their incomes. The rate  gradually increased to 7
percent for Americans making over $500,000.  Because those making over $4,000 in
1914 accounted for less than  1 percent of the population, the average family
paid no income  tax. Even by 1950, following the expansion of the national 
government during and after the New Deal, the average American family  with two
children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal  government. In 1994,
federal taxes accounted for 24 percent of a  typical family's income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Though taxation has increased dramatically since World War 
II, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  spending has grown even faster. A
1991 study prepared for  the Joint Economic Committee found that for every $1
increase  in taxes since the end of World War II, expenditures have  grown
$1.59. The national debt now stands at $4.9 trillion,  representing more than
$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in the  country  an obligation that will
be paid by every individual and  family through higher taxes and lower living
standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Roughly one-third of the average family's income tax today  is
used merely to pay interest on the national debt, a significant  reduction in
standard of living for which that family receives no  benefits. Much of this
debt and tax burden is used to subsidize  special interests with political clout
in Washington, from millionaire  peanut farmers to the affluent elderly.
</P>
<P>

<P><B>*</B>     By contrast, 49 of the 50 states are required to balance their
 budgets every year, making the perennial accumulation of debt  difficult if not
impossible. Although all opinion polls show that there  is overwhelming public
support for a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution, every attempt to
have Congress pass the  measure has failed. Powerful special interests lobby
behind closed  doors against any proposal which would force Washington to cut 
spending, and the government continues to borrow money and  obligate future

the states billions each year. The cost of incarcerating prisoners is 
especially burdensome. For the seven states most affected by  illegal

<P><B>II. The High Cost to Democracy</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More difficult to calculate, but nevertheless far-reaching, are  the high
costs to democracy that stem from the demise of  federalism. An oft-repeated
description of the American system of  government is that it is a &quot;government
of laws, not of men,&quot; meaning that  the rules which govern society are
openly formulated, apply equally  to all, and are reliably stable over time.
Laws are made by  citizens and their elected representatives; they are not
supposed to be  subject to the whims of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, this characterization is no longer accurate. Even as  federal power
over the economy, society, and all facets of  public policy has grown, the
concentration of decisionmaking in  Washington has radically reduced the ability
of the public to affect  it. Whereas the American people once were described
routinely  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  self-governing and self-reliant,
it is now virtually impossible  for individuals or communities to influence the
decisions which  directly affect them. Distant rule-making bureaucracies are 
immune from local pressure; Congress is overrun with powerful and  well-heeled
interest groups; and enormous coalitions of citizens  are required to get even
rudimentary attention from Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As local and state governments have been reduced increasingly  to the role
of implementing federal decisions, elections for them  have lost most of their
importance. Regardless of who holds office,  and regardless of the electorate's
intentions when electing these  officials, Washington need pay attention to none
of them as it  imposes programs on state and local governments. Governor Ben 
Nelson (D-NE) has said that he often feels he is merely an  administrator for
the federal government, and Governor Michael Leavitt  (R-UT) has noted that his
constituents, when referring to government,  now think almost exclusively in
terms of Washington, not state or  local government. National elections, in
turn, are not about  individual issues, but about large combinations of them,
with the  individual voter unable to register his preferences. And each voter's 
choice must compete with those of 100 million others. With their  votes meaning
so little in terms of how decisions are made, it is not  surprising that the
percentage of the electorate which goes to the  polls has declined steadily over
decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the power of citizens has declined, however, that of  certain individuals
has grown. Committee chairmen in the House and  Senate, unelected staff, obscure
bureaucrats, and federal judges  wield vast powers which are often exercised out
of the public's  eye. Hundreds of bills with thousands of prescriptions,
allotments,  and prohibitions are passed each year, often with Members of  Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  gress having only the haziest of
ideas about their content. An  endless stream of special interests brings
enormous financial and  organizational capacities to bear on Congress and the
executive  branch  often to secure enactment of agendas these interests know 
the public would not support if given the opportunity to decide  for themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Untethered Judiciary</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if elected officials could be made more responsive to  the public's
preferences, however, they would remain subject to  the unelected judges of the
federal courts. The Supreme Court and  the federal judiciary as a whole have
arrogated to themselves a  dominant role in every public and private institution
in society.  Federal judges have taken charge of wide areas of state and local 
jurisdiction and imposed on them their own dictates, from which there  is little
appeal. Individual judges overturn and rewrite laws,  suspend whole sections of
state constitutions, impose detailed  mandates, order actions by officials at
all levels, and even mandate the  imposition of taxes on populations which
refuse to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No area of American life can escape detailed examination and  reconstruction
by the Supreme Court. Members of the Court  are bound by little but their own
self-restraint. Cynics often say  that the Constitution is whatever the Supreme
Court says it is. In  fact, no less an authority than Chief Justice Charles
Evans  Hughes stated in a 1907 speech: &quot;We are under a Constitution, but 
the Constitution is what the judges say it is.&quot;  But the reality is  even
worse: It is whatever any five of the Court's nine justices say it  is. A 5 to 4
decision one day can be abruptly reversed the next;  what was once legal may
become illegal, and vice versa;  wrenching 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  changes can be produced by the
replacement of a single  individual on the Court, or even by a change of opinion
by any one of  the justices, regardless of the language of the Constitution or
the  preferences of the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Long-established rights may be cast aside, while newly  mined ones are put
in their place. No law, constitutional provision,  popular referendum, community
standard, or tradition, regardless of  its support among the people or their
elected officials, has any  meaning or standing other than that which the
federal courts choose  to give it. All may be set aside, and the public has no
recourse. It  is for this reason that the once-routine confirmations of  Supreme
Court justices have become brutal political contests.

<P><B>III. The High Costs to Civil Society</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of all the costs produced by the demise of federalism, the  greatest have
been those associated with the breakdown of civil society:  the individuals,
families, communities, and voluntary  organizations and institutions which
together enable individuals to control  the environment in which they, their
families, and their  communities live and operate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the Framers, the purpose of government was to establish  and secure the
general environment within which civil society  could operate essentially
unmolested. Within this environment, the  array of social institutions would
regulate the public aspects of the  community and intrude in the lives of
individuals and families as  little as possible. Government, especially local
government  controlled by the adult citizenry, was essential to maintaining this
order,  but only if its power was limited to narrow purposes. It was well 
understood that the more distant the government, the less control  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  citizens would have over its
actions, and thus the more damage  it could do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once the national government had freed itself from its  constitutional
restraints, however, its rapid expansion inevitably  undermined civil society,
because the purpose of expanded  government is to substitute itself for civil
society. The national government,  in centralizing power, inevitably has taken
control away from  citizens and communities and replaced it with  political
decisionmaking and bureaucratic administration. It also has  forcibly replaced
civil society's home-grown workings with its  own political and bureaucratic
vision of how society should be  structured and run, and with devastating costs.
Unconstrained  government and civil society cannot coexist; their respective 
resources are too unequal to permit competition. When government  expands,
society must retreat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The result has been a broad decline in civilized life, especially  in the
nation's cities where government activism has been  greatest. Among the results:
vastly increased crime and violence, a  breakdown of public order, a decline in
community life, erosion of  the family, the rise of illegitimacy, and the
pervasive mediocrity  of public education, among other ills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social scientists profess bafflement at the emergence and  continuation of
these developments. Among the most common  explanations: America is an
inherently violent society, there has been  a &quot;war on the poor&quot;
stemming from hard-hearted budget cutters,  or endemic racism prevents progress.
The true source, however,  can be located directly in the engineered demise of
civil society and  its replacement by the federal government. Individuals,
families,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  communities have been stripped of
the ability to control  either their environment or the behavior of individuals
within it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise in Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The rate of violent crime in the U.S. has risen dramatically   over 400
percent since the late 1950s. Some of this is attributable to  the increase in
the population aged 15-30, the age group  responsible for the vast majority of
felonies. But if demographics were the  sole factor, the rate should have
plummeted in the 1980s along  with this segment's share of the population. It
did not, and other  countries with similar demographics did not experience the
same rise  in crime. Liberals claim the reason is widespread availability of 
guns in the United States, but gun ownership has been common in  the United
States since the country's inception. Moreover, other  societies, such as
peaceable Switzerland, that actually require all  able-bodied men to maintain
guns in their homes experience no  upsurge in drive-by shootings. Why, then, the
vast and rapid increase in  the rate of violent crime in the U.S. and its
continuance at such  high levels?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two reasons. One is the breakdown in family structure  in America 
itself exacerbated by federal policies (see Chapter  6). The other is the
Supreme Court's radical reconstruction of  the criminal justice system in the
U.S., an all-embracing  exercise weighted consistently toward restricting the
policing power  of communities. Beginning in the 1960s, federal courts began 
viewing law enforcement, rather than criminals, as the principal  threat to
public safety and set out to restrict the power of police to  arrest criminals,
the ability of the judicial system to convict them,  and the right of society to
put and keep them behind bars. The  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  vastly expanded, and even
invented, rights for criminals which,  if not actually written in the
Constitution, were held by the courts  to be &quot;inspired&quot; by its &quot;penumbras.&quot;
 However lofty this  solicitude for the rights of criminals may be, its
real-world impact has  been to create an America much more dangerous and violent
for  law-abiding citizens.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#12">12</A>

<P>To curb alleged coercion of defendants, the Supreme Court  has virtually
eliminated the ability of state and federal prosecutors  to use confessions by
the accused as evidence. In the mid-1960s,  with the Court's imposition of
arbitrarily detailed procedures for  arrest and investigation, the rate of
solved crimes plummeted  virtually overnight from the level of 70 percent in the
1950s to 40  percent, and hundreds of thousands of felons were never prosecuted 
even though ample evidence was available. In addition, severe  restrictions have
been placed on the collection of evidence; trials  increasingly focus not on the
defendant's innocence or guilt, but  on whether the police have adhered
sufficiently to procedural  minutiae.

<P>The federal bench also has intervened to change the way  states deal with
felons convicted of crimes and sentenced to  prison terms. In state after state,
entire prison systems have been  taken over by the federal courts. Ostensibly to
eliminate  &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of prisoners have been
released onto  the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot; has never been
consistently  defined, so each judge is free to define it for himself on an
entirely  subjective basis. To several judges, therefore, it means not groups 
of prisoners crammed into single cells, but simply more than  one prisoner to a
cell, however large. Some federal judges even  refuse to allow convicted felons
to be sent to prison in the first place  because of &quot;overcrowding&quot; and
simply release them, even those  convicted of violent crimes and repeat
offenders. These released  felons have been responsible for tens of thousands of
additional  violent crimes.

</P>
<P>The federal courts have demonstrated an amazing solicitude  for the small
minority of felons who actually reach prison, being  especially attentive to
suits claiming violations of the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition of &quot;cruel
and unusual punishment.&quot;   To help prisoners develop and file these claims,
the federal  courts have ruled that prisoners must be provided with 
state-of-the-art law libraries in their prisons, and even with law clerks. 
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods has said that the law libraries  in state
prisons are equipped with better services and resources  than those in his own
office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, the number of suits by prisoners claiming violations  of
constitutional rights has exploded in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1966, prisoners brought 218 suits in federal court for  alleged
constitutional violations in state and federal prisons. In 1993,  prisoners
filed over 53,000 suits, primarily against state prisons,  representing 25
percent of all cases handled in federal courts and  7,000 more suits than the
federal government itself filed against  criminals. Most of this litigation is
frivolous  inmates have sued,  for example, because they were given creamy
instead of chunky  peanut butter, were denied breast implants at public expense,
or  did not like the color of their cells  and ultimately are dismissed  by the
courts. But the cost to the taxpayers is still heavy, as the  state must treat
each case seriously lest it be lost by default.  Generally, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  prisoners pay no fees, claiming
indigent status.

<P>Keith Poladian, an inmate in New York's Auburn state  prison, brought suit

<P>It is little wonder that most criminals show a psychology of  denial for
their criminal actions. Nevada Deputy Attorney General  Anne Cathcart says
criminals &quot;come into prison denying any  wrongdoing, and they are
constantly presented with further reasons  to blame others. Unlimited access to
federal courts gives them  an added tool to vent their anger and rebel against
the system.&quot;   But that is only one element. The total effect of the
federal courts  on the criminal justice system has been staggering. Thanks to a 
succession of messages to the potential felon  you won't be  arrested, you won't
be convicted, your sentence will be cut short,  prison isn't really so bad, and
your rights in prison are superior to  those of the administration, for example 
deterrence has been all  but destroyed. Even violent felons remain on the
streets, free to  commit crimes. Far from having a mysterious source, the 
enormous upsurge in crime was all but inevitable.

<P>The streets of the nation's cities have become a permanent  home for tens of

this alleged lack of shelter is due not to the  hard-heartedness of budget
cutters, but to the fact that up to  three-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  fourths of America's homeless are
mentally ill or  drug-dependent and unable to care for themselves. The advent of
drugs in  the 1950s and 1960s led to the widespread closing of institutions 
that cared for the mentally ill on the assumption that drug therapy  had
eliminated most of the need for institutionalization. At the  same time, in
addition to destroying viable communities, federal  urban renewal projects
eliminated much of the housing space available  to the very poor. Much of this
lost housing has been replaced by  shelters and other facilities, but many of
these people refuse to live  in shelters, citing endemic violence, drug use, and
corruption,  and many more individuals are clearly incapable of making  rational
choices for themselves. Community efforts to bring the  homeless into shelters
have been blocked by the federal courts because  of alleged violations of civil
rights; freedom of assembly is  claimed by those permanently squatting in public

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a mixed record, at best, in the  area of
reducing the power of the federal government and  devolving power back to the
states. Clinton has assisted states in  accelerating the waiver process whereby
state welfare and health care  agencies can receive exemptions from a host of
federal requirements as  they attempt novel approaches to welfare and health
care reforms.  Unfortunately, most governors are still frustrated at the slow 
granting of waivers by the Administration and many believe the entire  process
is flawed in that they are seeking exemptions from  federal 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  laws they believe to be an
encroachment on state prerogatives.  For instance, the Clinton Administration's
proposal in 1994 to  revamp the nation's health care system envisioned a
diminishing role  for the states, which would merely administer a national
system  created and directed from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In areas such as environmental protection and federal  land-use policy, the
Clinton Administration has continued to support  a growing federal role and has
resisted attempts by the states to  devolve powers back to them. For instance,
this is most  evident among Western states, where Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt  has been promoting an overarching policy of environmental  protection
that dramatically increases the power of the federal government  in land-use
policy in federal, state-owned, and private lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To the extent the Administration has even focused on federalism  it has
missed the true meaning of the word. For instance, Vice  President Al Gore's
calls for a &quot;New Federalism&quot;are embodied in  his efforts to streamline
and reinvent the federal government  through its National Performance Review.
Regardless of the merits of  the National Performance Review  which attempts to
make the  federal government more efficient through downsizing and 
restructuring  it has had little if anything to do with reestablishing a 
balance between the state and federal governments.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken important first steps in the areas  of
devolution, federalism, and the restoration of constitutional  government. Under
the Contract With America, it passed  legislation that turns over most
responsibility for welfare to the states  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  allows them more flexibility and
authority in the administration  of welfare programs. Even more important, it
has put the country  on course for a balanced budget in seven years. While not
strictly  an issue of federalism, bringing spending under control is a 
prerequisite both for reimposing limits on government's ambitions and  for
rebuilding civil society. The federal government also has agreed  to reimburse
the states for part of the education, health care,  and other costs associated
with the incarceration of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of pending bills and resolutions are  designed to make
the federal government more responsive to its  constitutional limits. These
include requiring Congress to cite its  constitutional authority for each piece
of legislation, restricting the  ability of the federal judiciary to take over
state administrative  functions, and eliminating agencies of the federal
government which  exercise &quot;powers not delegated to the United States by
the  Constitution,&quot; among other proposals.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Correcting the many problems confronting American society  will involve more
than isolated reforms; a lasting solution will  require dealing with their root
causes, especially the federal  government's crushing impact on civil society.
This means more than  merely resurrecting the past. Too much has changed to
permit a  simple repeal of the many constitutional innovations of the preceding 
decades, and powerful and well-entrenched groups with  economic, political, and
ideological interests at stake are certain to resist  any change which
diminishes the power of Washington to reward  them from the public treasury and
impose their agendas on the rest  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  the country. Instead, new
approaches must be developed that  draw on the lessons learned in this century
about Washington's ability  to free itself, Houdini-like, from almost any
constraint.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Devolve power to the states by returning taxes, not
just programs.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America has taken the essential first step  in reversing
the trend toward centralization of power in  Washington by curtailing some
entitlements and allowing states greater  discretion over welfare and other
programs, but several additional  measures are needed to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current plans, the principal funding for programs  devolved to the
states will continue to be through block grants from  Washington. Although the
states gain flexibility, this formula  undermines accountability because the
federal government collects  the money but state and local governments spend it.
As a result,  the public is less able to connect the collection of taxes with
the  provision of services, and neither level of government has  sufficient
incentive to ensure that the money is spent wisely and frugally.  A far better
approach would be for Washington to bow out of  the picture entirely and return
the money to the people in the form of  a tax cut. The states could collect the
taxes themselves   and thereby assure a direct connection between taxes and
services   or allow individuals to retain the money for their own use. If this 
is not done, the likely consequence is that rising budgetary  pressures will
lead Washington simply to maintain current federal  requirements on the states
to deliver services while cutting back on  the federal grants to fund them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal argument for continuing a federal role in these  programs is
that it assures equality of treatment for recipients,  regard
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  less of whether they live in
high-income or low-income  states. This argument is based on a misunderstanding
of the actual  impact of federal spending. Federal funding for individual
programs  often does vary widely from state to state, but those variations 
largely disappear when a broader range of programs is considered.  For example,
if responsibility for the more than 70 programs that  comprise federal welfare
spending was turned over to the states  along with a broad reduction in the
federal income tax, only a few  states would be adversely affected, and none by
more than 5 percent  of current revenue. And this does not take into account
money  that states could save by providing services more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is also important for candidates to stress that devolution is  not
necessarily federalism. While state-friendly legislation passed  by Congress is
a marked improvement over past practice, the  current debate and decisionmaking
on devolution have been  conducted almost entirely from Washington's point of
view. The programs  to be transferred will continue to be subject to conditions
imposed  by the federal government, which can change them unilaterally at  its
discretion to suit its own needs. And Washington will retain  the ability to
reverse or modify its grant at any time. Devolution  is evidence not that
Washington has been restrained, but merely  that it has changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Hold a constitutional convention on federalism.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution  is the route
most favored by those who seek a quick and  comprehensive solution to the
problem of Washington's overreaching.  Two-thirds of the state legislatures may
call a constitutional  convention by petitioning Congress to do so, a provision
the Framers  included 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  both to deny Congress a monopoly
on proposing amendments  and to prevent it from insulating itself from the
public will.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the two centuries since the Constitution's adoption, there  have been
several efforts to call a convention. The most notable  attempts in recent
decades include an effort in the 1960s to  overturn the Supreme Court's revision
of state constitutions regarding  the structure of state legislatures and
several efforts concerning a  balanced budget amendment, the most successful of
which reached  32 states by 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal reason these and other efforts have not succeeded  is fear
that a &quot;runaway&quot; convention might lead to an extensive  rewriting of
the Constitution. But opponents generally do not  take into account the fact
that any amendment proposed by a  convention is exactly that: merely a proposal.
To become part of the  Constitution, it must be ratified by the same
three-fourths of the  state legislatures required for the approval of any
amendment put  forth by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents also ignore the fact that, in effect, two permanent 
constitutional conventions already exist: Congress, which can  propose an
amendment on any subject at any time, and the Supreme  Court. Although the Court
technically has no role in the amending  process, its rulings repeatedly have
had the same effect, adding  and deleting sections as the justices see fit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opposing a convention called by the states merely ensures  that Congress and
the Supreme Court  and thus Washington   retain their monopoly on changing the
Constitution while denying  the states and citizens any real opportunity to
participate. This  position 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  is understandable in those who
wish to keep power centralized  in Washington but somewhat perplexing when held
by  conservatives and others who profess a desire to restrict the federal 
government. Given the opposition, however, calls for a constitutional 
convention are not likely to be successful without considerable  public
education.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Efforts to revive the Tenth Amendment occupy a special place  in the
movement to restore federalism. The Tenth Amendment is  the &quot;federalism
amendment,&quot; a written contractual guarantee  against the expansion of
federal power. It has not performed as  intended because the political and other
mechanisms designed to make  it effective have been removed and because the
Supreme Court  has been allowed to render it null and void.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Indications that the Supreme Court may revive the Amendment,  at least in a
limited fashion, are easily exaggerated. In a  recent case,<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#22">22</A> the Supreme Court made headlines
by ruling that the  states cannot always be used as simple administrative arms
of the  federal government. This was the first time in six decades that the 
Tenth Amendment had been used to restrict federal power, but even  this
vestigial application was decided by a very narrow majority (5  to 4) and can be
reversed at any time.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A grass-roots movement to revive the Tenth Amendment has  been gathering
strength. Several state legislatures have passed  resolutions stating their view
that the Amendment remains fully in  effect, with several going further to
demand that the federal  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  ment abide by its provisions.
However, this has occurred in  a largely uncoordinated and low-key manner, and
little  political pressure has been brought to bear on Washington.

<P>
</P>
<P>Though Congress has been an egregious violator of federalism,  it also has
the power to reverse its own excesses and curb those  of the executive and
judicial branches as well. The most  prominent effort in this regard is the
Contract With America's commitment  to returning to the states many functions
now performed by the  federal government, such as the primary responsibility for
 welfare. Efforts in other, more specific areas need to be made as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unwilling to part with its own money, Congress often has  resorted to
requiring state and local governments to pay for programs  that Washington
enacts and for which it takes the credit. Faced with  a growing revolt in the
states because of the unsustainable  burden these mandates impose on state
budgets, Congress in 1994  passed the Unfunded Mandates Act, advertised as
largely solving  the problem. However, the scope of the Act is very limited, 
covering only new mandates while leaving the truly burdensome  existing ones in
place. More important, the legislation puts no real  restraints on Congress at
all, as it requires Congress merely to  label an unfunded mandate as such before
enactment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As pressures on the federal budget increase, Congress may  be tempted to use
unfunded mandates to transfer responsibilities  for certain programs to the
states while keeping all or most of  the funding in Washington to balance the
federal books. States  and local communities need to close this gaping loophole

amendments to the Constitution.  However, amending Article V to allow the states
to propose  amendments without calling a convention, but subject to a 
congressional veto on such amendments, could overcome this obstacle.  Amendments
approved by Congress would be reintroduced in the  states for the three-fourths
approval needed to adopt an amendment  to the Constitution.

<P>
</P>
<P>The principal factor in the demise of federalism and the growth  of
government in Washington is the undermining of the states'  ability to act as a
counterweight to the national government. The  states have been reduced to
subservience for so long that most have  lost the incentive to challenge
Washington and concentrate instead  on lobbying for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal problem confronting the states is fragmentation: 
Individually, states cannot have much influence in Washington;  only by
combining their efforts can they bring to bear the political  pressure needed to
deal with Washington as equals.  Unfortunately, however, the existing
organizations that serve state officials,  such as the National Governors'
Association (NGA), have not  succeeded in promoting an independent and effective
voice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A number of efforts in this area have been made in recent  years, the most
notable being the Conference of the States. Initiated  by Governors Mike Leavitt
(R-UT) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in  1994 and joined by the NGA and other
organizations, along with  scores of state officials, the COS was designed to
create a process  by which the states could meet, discuss their common problems 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  recommended solutions, and bring
their collective influence  to bear on Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For many reasons, the COS was not able to achieve the goals  it laid out for
itself, but some similar effort would prove to be  invaluable to the states in
their dealings with Washington.  Among the possible steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Suits against the federal government.</B> Several
states have  initiated or are contemplating suits against the federal government
 for abuse of its authority, especially on Tenth Amendment  grounds. Arizona
leads this effort; the legislature voted in 1994 to  establish a Constitutional
Defense Council and appropriated $1 million  for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Mandates recall.</B> Beginning with Alabama in 1992, a number  of
state legislatures have established annual meetings between  themselves and
members of their congressional delegations to  review the latter's votes on
unfunded federal mandates. Although  the states cannot compel attendance or
attentiveness, there is a  certain political cost for those who simply ignore
such requests, and  the meetings do provide a way for both sides to air their 
respective concerns.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Far more should be done to reconnect the state legislatures to  the making
of national policy. It once was common for state  legislatures to instruct their
representatives in Washington on how to  vote on particular issues, even if the
latter chose to ignore them.  On issues which affect a state, its legislature
certainly has at least  as much claim to represent the interests of the people
as does  any federal representative, and it should not hesitate to make its 
views 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Term limits.</B> An additional area for emphasis is imposing  term
limits on federal officials, the theory being that a guaranteed  turnover will
reduce the opportunities for elected officials to  insulate themselves from the
voters and guarantee a continuing infusion  of individuals who are closer to the
people. Term limits by  themselves, however, will neither constrain Washington's
power  nor erect a permanent barrier to activism, even on the part of 
short-termers. More important, the Supreme Court has ruled that  the people have
no right to impose term limits on federal officials,  and proponents are now
seeking other ways  including a  constitutional amendment  to advance this
objective.(See table below)

<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q.What is the difference between devolution and federalism  and can they
contradict one another?  
</B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> Devolution legislation in Congress has dealt primarily  with
granting greater flexibility and decision-making authority to  state and local
governments in specific programs such as welfare.  Federalism, in contrast, is
concerned with the structure of  government as a whole and deals with the proper
balance that should exist  between the state governments and the national
government as  outlined in the U.S. Constitution. Current efforts to devolve 
selected powers from Washington to the states, however beneficial,  will have
only a small impact on the balance of power between  the federal and state
governments; Washington's primacy will  remain largely unaltered. For example,
the debate and  decision-making regarding devolution have been almost entirely
the product of  the Congress; state and local officials have played only 
secondary roles. As a result, the design and extent of the affected  programs
reflect Washington's preferences far more than those of the  states, and even
the devolved responsibilities remain subject to  unilateral revision by the
federal government. Devolution concerns the  reapportioning between the federal
and state governments of the  responsibility for current programs; federalism
addresses the  means by which Washington and the states can be made to limit 
each other's power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there issues too important to entrust to state governments?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The domination of the national government by the states  under
the Articles of Confederation produced such chaos that the  Framers of the
Constitution sought to permanently redress the  balance. As a result, the
Constitution lists several powers reserved to  the national government and makes
its laws superior to those of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  states in these areas. That grant
of power, however, is strictly  limited. The Constitution specifies procedures
for amending the  document to alter that list should a sufficient majority of
the  country desire it, but it does not sanction federal action simply because 
it may be efficient or expedient. Under the system established by  the Founders,
state governments and the national government were  to have distinct and limited
powers in order to serve as a check  on one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The presumption throughout much of this century, however,  has been that the
national government is progressive and the  states regressive, and therefore
that progress requires a centralization  of power in Washington. Once achieved,
however, the result has  been not only to shift most decision-making to the
federal  government, but to make possible the vast expansion of government 
throughout every area of society, with decidedly negative results.  Whatever the
past failings of the states, they pale in comparison with  those of the federal
government. Federalism is not based on the  assumption that one level of
government is necessarily better than  another; instead, it holds that limited,
constitutional government  is the goal and that the different levels are needed
to restrain  one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. If states assume more power under a reinvigorated  federalism, how will
civil rights be protected?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. A reinvigorated federalism would not reduce the power of  the federal
government to protect the civil rights guaranteed by  the Constitution. The Bill
of Rights, and especially the Fourteenth  and Fifteenth Amendments, provide the
federal government with  sufficient powers to enforce the civil rights of all
Americans. In  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  past, the political will to
exercise these powers was often  lacking, a failing which has been more than
made up for over the past  four decades. Nevertheless, advocates of an activist
federal  judiciary often cite the need for an unelected protector of civil
rights  to guard minorities against the inevitable abuses of the  majority.
However, the contempt for the citizenry this attitude is based on  is wholly
contradictory to the theory of the American  government &quot;which rests on the
consent of the governed.&quot;  The  assumption must be that the majority wants
the rights of minorities (of  which everyone is a member of at least one) to be
fully guaranteed,  and for this reason has brought into being a Constitution
which has  that objective as one its principal goals. To assume that the purpose
 of government is to override and suppress the desires of a  thuggish and
intolerant majority is to believe that self-government is  an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. Isn't the U.S. economy becoming so sophisticated that a  national
economic and regulatory regime is needed to maintain  competition in the global
economy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. Taken to its logical conclusion, this approach would argue  for the
superiority of international regulation over national  regulation. However, one
of the most important phenomena of the last  quarter of the 20th century is the
widespread realization that the costs  of governmental control over the economy
greatly exceed its  benefits. Communist economies have collapsed; socialist and 
heavily regulated economies have stagnated; and free-market  economies
increasingly have demonstrated the benefits of reducing the role  of the state
through such measures as privatization and the  lowering of trade barriers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To this has been added the new pressures and opportunities of  the emerging
global economy, which is rapidly undermining the  idea of separate national
economies. This new economy places an  emphasis on flexibility and the ability
to adapt quickly to  changing economic and commercial realities. Slumbering
central  governments are proving to be grossly inadequate to such a challenge. 
A renewal of federalism would not replace Washington's  regulation with that of
the states as much as it would allow the latter to  experiment with policies
that are more conducive to  economic growth. Every state would have an interest
in promoting its  own economic growth, and competition between them would 
ensure that only the most beneficial policies survived. The federal  government
would continue to exercise its crucial function of  preventing the states from
erecting their own barriers against one another.  The overall limitations on
government at all levels that this  system would encourage would ensure a more
positive environment  for economic growth.

<B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration came into office with a widely  recognized lack
of experience in defense and foreign policy. But  the new President did not take
the necessary steps to correct this  deficiency. The new Commander in Chief,
already suspect in the  national security community for his history of draft
avoidance  during the Vietnam War, made decisions which reinforced his image as 
a President out of touch with the military services and inattentive  to foreign
policy and national security issues. His flip-flops on  Haiti, Cuba, China, and
Bosnia weakened American credibility  abroad and created doubts around the world
about U.S. leadership.  Moreover, the Clinton Administration has presided over a period of neglect  and decline of
U.S. military strength. The Administration's series  of missteps amounts to
little more than on-the-job-training.  Despite over three years in office, the
job as leader and chief architect  of America's foreign and defense policies
still appears to be too  big for Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Instead of developing a clear and coherent foreign and  defense policy
grounded in American principles and national interest,  the Clinton
Administration allowed politics and indifference to  foreign policy issues to
create muddle and confusion in America's  foreign 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  policy. Until the beginning of the
104th Congress and the  Contract With America, Congress regrettably did little
to correct the  unwise course being followed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and his advisors, indelibly influenced by their  opposition to
the Vietnam War, came into office confused about  the principles that legitimize
the exercise of American power. It  soon became apparent that the Clinton team
believed unilateral  U.S. action was improper, and that U.S. power must be  &quot;legitimized&quot;
by operating through some international or multilateral agency  like the United
Nations. The resulting policy of  &quot;assertive multilateralism&quot;
subordinated clear national interests to the  U.N. and other supranational
entities. Extending his liberal  worldview to international politics, President
Clinton in Somalia, Haiti,  and Bosnia looked upon foreign policy as social
work. Clinton's  vague global utopianism led him to commit the U.S. to dubious 
enterprises, with American soldiers needlessly killed and scarce  defense
dollars wasted. The Administration claims to have learned  that &quot;assertive
multilateralism&quot; in the U.N. does not work, but  the President exercised
the same unwise judgment from his early  years in office by unnecessarily and
unwisely sending U.S. troops  to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dubious Foreign Policy Successes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of these enterprises have been hailed as foreign policy  successes by
the Clinton Administration. The President has  claimed that his greatest
successes are in North Korea, Haiti, and  Bosnia. But these claims are
overblown. For example, the  Administration has:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Made extraordinary concessions to a most dangerous 
potential enemy, North Korea.</B> Rewarding North Korea's blatant and 
persistent refusal to live up to its obligations as a signatory to  the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the U.S. agreed to provide  $5 billion in fuel oil and
to help finance and build two new light  water reactors for Pyongyang. These
terms were spelled out in  the Nuclear Framework Agreement the Clinton
Administration  negotiated with North Korea. The Administration brags that this 
agreement gives the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) the right
to inspect certain nuclear facilities inside  North Korea. But the IAEA already
had the right to carry out  inspections. Moreover, the Nuclear Framework
Agreement provides no  guarantee that the North has stopped trying to build
nuclear weapons  at hidden sites, or that the North will continue to cooperate
with  the IAEA once Pyongyang has extracted financial and diplomatic 
concessions from the West.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> North Korea has  been paid to do what
it already was obligated to do under the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
the U.S. is still not certain  that North Korea has stopped its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Embarked on a costly venture of dubious value in Haiti.  President
Clinton hails his Haiti venture as a great foreign policy success.</B>  To be
sure, the U.S., the world's remaining military superpower,  did subdue the
Hemisphere's poorest and most backward country.  But for what purpose?  To
restore to office an avowed Marxist  demagogue known for his hostility to the
U.S. While the Haiti  mission did not turn into a Somalia-like disaster with the
loss of  American lives, it has cost upwards of $2 billion and placed enormous 
strain on U.S. forces at a time when they were engaged in many other  so-called
peace operations. Moreover, under the watchful eyes  of U.S. occupation forces,
former President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  hijacked democracy in Haiti,
placing his hand-picked and  easily controlled successor in power via the
elections of December,  1995, and allowing political murders of his opponents to
occur  unpunished. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. operation in Haiti was  unnecessary
and wasteful, serving no vital U.S. interest, and it did  not achieve its stated
purpose  the creation of democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Boxed America into an unwise and unnecessary U.N. troop  commitment to
Bosnia.</B> By failing to lift the arms embargo on the  embattled Bosnians so
they could defend themselves, it was left up  to the Croatians to push back the
Bosnian Serbs, who had  dominated the military balance of power inside Bosnia.
Once this shift in  the balance of power occurred, the stage was set for the
peace  agreement which was negotiated November 30, 1995, in Dayton,  Ohio.
Although U.S. pressure and NATO airstrikes played a role  in bringing about the
Dayton agreement, the real key was the  military defeats which the Bosnians and
Croatians imposed on the  Bosnian Serbs last year. But because the Bosnian
Muslims do not fully  trust the Croatians  indeed a few years ago they were at
war with  each other  the Dayton peace agreement is not only very fragile,  it
requires the presence of 20,000 U.S. troops and other  NATO forces to enforce
it. Thus, by failing to lift the arms embargo  on Bosnia, President Clinton
practically guaranteed that U.S.  troops would have to go to Bosnia to enforce
the peace, something  which he had repeatedly in the past promised he would not
do.
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. troop deployment was unneccessary and  unwise, and
peace is by no means assured in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claimed credit for the two Israeli-Palestinian peace accords  signed at
the White House in September 1993 and September 1995.</B>  But the two
agreements came about through bilateral negotiations  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  tween Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization,  initially conducted without the Administration's
knowledge. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> President Clinton enjoyed two photo opportunities,
but  the diplomatic breakthroughs that produced the agreements  came about
mainly through bilateral talks between Israelis and  Palestinians, not through
American diplomatic efforts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claims to have advanced the peace process between the  Irish Catholic
minority in Northern Ireland and the Irish Protestant  majority, backed by the
British government.</B> But the  Administration's controversial embrace of Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), is a risky  diplomatic gambit that has backfired. Despite the fact that
the  IRA has killed almost 2,000 people in terrorist attacks over the last  25
years, the Administration has rewarded it with a &quot;carrot and  carrot&quot;
policy. Clinton overruled the advice of his own State  Department, Defense
Department, and Justice Department to  allow Adams to obtain a visa to visit the
U.S. in February 1994.  In March 1995, the Administration allowed Adams to
travel to  the U.S. on a fund-raising trip, open an office in Washington, and 
visit the White House on Saint Patrick's Day. Although the IRA  agreed to a
cease-fire in its terrorist war, it did not agree to disarm,  and maintains a
huge arsenal, including more than a ton of  Semtex plastic explosive, much of it
provided by Libyan  dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Of course, the IRA broke its
cease-fire,  renewing its terrorist campaign, making a mockery of Clinton's 
efforts to bring peace to Nothern Ireland. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>  Clinton's opportunistic embrace of Gerry Adams, motivated at least in  part by domestic
politics, has undermined U.S. counterterrorism  policy; strained relations with
Britain, a staunch ally; and raised the  IRA's expectations that Washington will
press London to make  conces
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  sions without IRA concessions,
thereby undermining the  chances of a genuine peace.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>NAFTA and GATT: Successes Unfulfilled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One genuine success for which the Clinton Administration fails  to claim
much credit is the approval of the North American  Free Trade Agreement and the
Uruguay Round of talks in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The Clinton  Administration is to be commended for completing these agreements, 
but the initiative and much of the work behind them occurred in  the Reagan and
Bush Administrations. Moreover, by dropping the  ball on expanding NAFTA to
include Chile, the Clinton  Administration has practically taken the U.S. out of
the game of expanding  free trade in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, the
President  has ceded the initiative to Brazil and others who may want to  create
trade blocs closed to the U.S. but possibly more open to U.S.  competitors in
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Failures</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the President's foreign policy &quot;successes&quot; have proven to 
be doubtful, his many foreign policy failures are obvious and  admitted even by
his supporters. For example, the President has: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Dragged his feet on protecting the U.S. homeland and troops
 and interests abroad from the growing danger of ballistic missiles. </B> He cut
the budget for missile defense by over 50 percent from  levels projected by the
Bush Administration and has attempted  illegally to broaden the restrictions of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM) Treaty, which imposes severe restrictions
on strategic  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  fenses, to cover tactical and
theater defenses as well. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Americans will be left vulnerable to
nuclear attack,  even though the Clinton Administration itself has admitted that
the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the most 
serious threat to national security.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wasted American lives and treasure on dubious peacekeeping  operations.</B>
Clinton allowed a limited, humanitarian mission to  Somalia to escalate into an
uncertain and dangerous  &quot;nation-building&quot; mission, which included
hunting Somali warlords and  disarming militant factions  in effect making the
U.S. a combatant in  a bloody civil war. Putting U.S. troops under a confused
U.N.  command structure, the Clinton Administration failed to provide  adequate
weapons and equipment to U.S. forces engaged in a  combat operation. The result
was an intense street battle in Mogadishu  in October 1993 which left 18 young
American Rangers dead,  75 other soldiers wounded and led to America's
humiliating  retreat from Somalia. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> American lives were lost 
unnecessarily, and U.S. national prestige and credibility suffered  needlessly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Frittered away American military strength and credibility in a  series
of &quot;peace operations&quot; with little or no benefit to the  nation's
security, consuming billions of defense budget dollars intended  for training,
operations, and maintenance of U.S. forces and  equipment.</B> These missions
included an unwise expansion of the  peace mission in Somalia, which led to the
mission's failure, and  the dispatch of troops to peacekeeping missions in
Haiti,  Macedonia, and Bosnia. At the same time, by cutting the defense budget, 
the President has neglected the core duty of the armed forces: to  fight and win
wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and  existing 
 military alliance commitments. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Under  Clinton, American fighting troops are weaker and less able
to deal  with larger military contingencies, such as in Korea or the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Built America's military strategy on a potentially fatal illusion.  In
1993 President Clinton's Pentagon released a study of  America's long-range
military requirements.</B> Called the &quot;Bottom-Up  Review,&quot; this study
concluded that the U.S. should have the  means and forces to fight two nearly
simultaneous medium-sized  conflicts. Yet Clinton proceeded to cut the very
forces needed to  sustain this capability. The President refused to fund
adequately  and field the force which his own planners said the country  needed.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Because the U.S. will not be able to protect  all its interests
around the world, its alliances may weaken, its  credibility and influence may
wane, and Americans could be forced  to follow the lead of others rather than to
lead themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Weakened the armed forces with social experimentation and  &quot;political
correctness.&quot;</B>  The President has imposed his radical  vision on the
military services by pushing women into combat  positions before their
effectiveness has been tested, or their impact on  combat effectiveness honestly
evaluated. He has advocated the  admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the
ranks, contrary to  the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The
result has been  a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they 
lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat  effectiveness.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton has weakened the morale of  America's fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Followed a &quot;Russia-only&quot; policy that has not bolstered 
democracy in Russia, but it has blocked development of strong relations  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  former Soviet states like Ukraine.</B>
President Clinton has  staked U.S. policy on the fate of one man, President
Boris Yeltsin.  The ostensible reason for this policy is to bolster democracy in
 Russia, but it clearly has not worked. Yeltsin has kicked democrats  like
former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and former  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais out of his cabinet, replacing  them with old Soviet hardliners like
Yevgeny Primakov, the new  Foreign Minister. But still the U.S. offers Yeltsin
good will and  cooperation. Clinton has largely turned a blind eye to Russia's 
hard-line policy toward its former &quot;republics&quot; and provinces  the 
so-called &quot;Near Abroad&quot;  and he has failed to condemn Russian 
aggression in trouble spots like Chechnya, Moldova, and Georgia. 
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Clinton's policy of accommodation has not  worked. Russia continues to
drift away from democracy and toward a  more hard line foreign policy, while the
U.S. continues to offer  friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Put at risk key alliance relationships with Japan and the  Republic of
Korea. The Administration's effort last year to manage  trade with Japan was
acrimonious and counterproductive from the  start.</B> The U.S. reached auto
trade agreements with Japan in  November 1994 and March 1995, but these achieved
little and strained  U.S.-Japan relations. After initially denying that its
confrontational  policies were damaging the U.S.-Japan alliance, the 
Administration, under the Pentagon's leadership, belatedly tried to limit the 
damage and reaffirm the alliance. The main purpose of the April  1996
U.S.-Japanese summit is to repair the damage caused by the  previous year's
trade battles. At the same time, Clinton's efforts  to strike a nuclear bargain
with North Korea marginalized the  influence and role of a reliable U.S. ally,
South Korea. Recent  opinion polls by the United States Information Agency show
South  Korean 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  support for a U.S. military
presence at 72 percent, down 10  percent from 1994. Overall opinion of the U.S.
not only is down 20  percent, but also  and for the first time in 12 years  is
more  unfavorable (53 percent) than favorable (43 percent).<br><b>The Bottom  Line:</b> America's alliances with South Korea and Japan, key links in  the security chain
of Asia, have been weakened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with the People's Republic  of
China. After campaigning in 1992 to link China's Most  Favored Nation (MFN)
trading status to its human rights record,  President Clinton reversed himself
in 1994 and delinked MFN from  human rights.</B> <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntfor.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  This was the correct
decision. As the Administration  belatedly recognized, the best way to encourage
China to  observe international norms of conduct is to promote policies which 
enhance economic interaction and, in turn, economic freedom  and reform. These
are the seeds from which democracy can  grow. However, the Administration's
flip-flops created the impression  of ineptness and weakness. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
While the  Administration ultimately did the right thing, its ill-conceived
linkage  policy cost the U.S. credibility both in Beijing and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allowed Beijing to set America's agenda with the Republic  of China on
Taiwan.</B> In response to nearly unanimous  congressional resolutions, the
Administration relented and allowed  Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to make a
&quot;private&quot; visit to his alma  mater, Cornell University, in June 1995.
Previously, in the face  of Beijing's protests, the Administration had resisted
the visit  of President Lee, claiming that it would violate its  &quot;One-China&quot;
policy. Clinton reversed himself only when he was pressured to  do so. The
mistake was the initial refusal to allow President Lee  to visit the U.S. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Beijing should not be allowed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  dictate the terms of America's &quot;unofficial&quot;
commercial and  cultural relations with Taiwan, and its interest in Taiwan's
security,  as established by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned three decades of principled U.S. policy towards  Cuba.</B>
President Clinton secretly negotiated with Fidel Castro's  communist regime in
August 1994 to reach an agreement whereby all  Cuban boat people intercepted at
sea by U.S. ships would be  repatriated forcibly to Cuba. Hitherto Cuban
refugees were permitted  to enter the U.S. without restriction.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton changed the longstanding U.S. policy of isolating communist  Cuba to a
new conciliatory stance, without winning any democratic  or free-market
concessions from Castro. Clinton was  eventually forced to abandon this
conciliatory policy, and to strengthen  the embargo against Cuba, but only after
he was forced to do so in  the aftermath of the Cuban downing of two U.S.
civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Failed to take seriously the global challenge of radical or 
revolutionary Islam.</B> Nor has the President pursued realistic steps to  deal
with the Islamist threat to friendly regimes or secular Muslim  powers in the
Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Instead,  he has sought to
establish diplomatic contacts with radical  Islamic movements such as Algeria's
Islamic Salvation Front, thereby  undermining secular regimes battling Islamic
radicals. As a  result, the U.S. is not properly anticipating the potential
realignment  of global power in regions critical to U.S. interests. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Radical regimes could threaten not only U.S. access to oil, but  also
American lives and interests through terrorism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that  have
characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  defense policy over the past four
years are serious. They  have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad
and, unless  rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great 
power capable of defending its values and interests. For America, it  is either
lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security,  and greatness, the
second to weakness and submission. For its  own well-being, and for that of the
entire globe, America's  leadership needs to be restored.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weak record of the Clinton Administration in foreign and  defense policy
was singled out for criticism in the GOP's  Contract With America. Alarmed over
Clinton's defense budget cuts  and failure to move rapidly toward a national
missile defense  system, Republicans marching under the banner of the Contract 
promised to restore America's military strength. Once elected in  November 1994,
they got to work on trying to fulfill their promise. On  February 7, 1995, the
House of Representatives passed the National  Security Revitalization Act (H.R.
7), which sought to establish  a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall
in defense, set a  new policy for the development and deployment of missile 
defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the  President to
subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Senate did not take up H.R. 7. However, parts of H.R. 7  found their way
into different pieces of legislation in the Senate, such  as in the defense
authorization bill and foreign relations  authorization bill. While not all of
the original Contract items were included  in final legislation reconciling
differences between the House  and Senate  for example, Congress dropped the
House's demand  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  create a commission to examine
U.S. national security strategy   conservative supporters of the Contract
delivered on the  majority of their promises to the American people. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress undertook a number of other foreign and  defense policy
initiatives in 1995 that complemented and supplemented  the legislation inspired
by the Contract With America. For  example, the new majority in Congress
endeavored to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restore America's military strength. Congress approved a 
defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget  request
submitted by President Clinton.</B> This money was needed not  only to keep
America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but  also to maintain a force
with modern high-technology weapons in  the 21st century. Primarily because he
counted on congressional  support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton
bowed to  congressional demands and signed the defense appropriations bill for 
fiscal 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his  original
request. But in an unprecedented act the President vetoed  the accompanying
fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill  which would have: 1) provided more
funds to maintain the  technological superiority of U.S. forces, 2) authorized a
pay raise and  housing allowance increase for military personnel (including
those  deployed to Bosnia), and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S.  homeland
against ballistic missiles. However, in early 1996 the  President signed a
different version of the defense authorization bill  that weakened missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Move the United States closer to a national missile defense  system.</B>
The defense authorization bill approved by Congress but  vetoed by the President
sought to establish a clear timetable for  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  velopment and deployment of both
national and theater  missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the
application of  Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater
defense  systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill,
giving  as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it 
contained. Of course, the President eventually got his way,  forcing Congress to
accept a weakening of missile defense in the  final 1996 defense authorization
bill. Once again the President has  succeeded in blocking this country's ability
to defend its citizens  from nuclear attack and Congress was not able to muster
enough  votes to override his veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut foreign aid.</B> While the new Republican majority promised 
extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of  revamping
America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending  on foreign aid will
likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than  it was in FY 1995. However,
under the umbrella of a balanced  budget by the year 2002, further cuts are
likely. While current  cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except
aid to  Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right 
direction is a new law, that the U.S. government report on the  progress being
made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets,  the main engine of
economic development. This effort was inspired  by The Heritage Foundation's
<I>Index of Economic  Freedom</I>, a global comparison of economic freedom in
142 countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</B> Congress passed and  the
President signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity  Act just a few
days after the February 24, 1996, downing by Cuba  of two U.S. registered
civilian aircraft in international waters.  This legislation, which tightens the
U.S. trade embargo on Cuba  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  allows American citizens to seek
compensation for property  stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening
the end of  Castro's dictatorship.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reorganize the State Department.</B> Congress proposed to cut  waste in
the State Department and foreign operations accounts by  consolidating several
independent foreign policy agencies into  the State Department. This effort, led
by Senate Foreign  Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the
support of  Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic  interests
within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key  legislation to move
the Arms Control and Disarmament  Agency (ACDA), United States Information
Agency (USIA), Agency  for International Development (AID), and two other
foreign  policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a 
House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President  has vowed to
veto this legislation if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</B> In  December
1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support  the U.S. troops being
deployed on the peacekeeping mission  to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did
not endorse  the President's decision to deploy them, and raised questions about
 the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear  goals. The House
went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the  Bosnia mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Maintain America's trading relations with China by  approving
most-favored-nation trade status for China.</B> In July 1995, the  Congress
sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China.  This decision reflects
the belief held by a majority in the Congress  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  increasing economic interaction
is the best way to promote  economic reform and advance political liberalization
and  human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</B> In the face of 
Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui  a visa to
visit his alma mater Cornell University, the Congress  voted with near unanimity
in May 1995 to support his visit. As a  result, the President reversed course
and granted the visa. Also, both  the House and Senate, have included provisions
in the 1996 State  Department authorization bill that would give precedence to
the  1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China  government-to-government
communiqu&eacute;s when considering future weapons exports to  Taiwan. U.S.
China policy too often is framed by communiqu&eacute;s  that have no force of
law, international or domestic. The Taiwan  Relations Act, however, is the law
of the land. The President  has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.

</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost Americans believe that America, for all its flaws, is a 
peaceable, generous, and benevolent nation that has been a force  for good in
the world. Today, the industrialized democracies, led  by the United States,
face rising new challenges to their security,  interests, and prosperity. The
fall of the Soviet Union and  Warsaw Pact has meant not the end of threats to
U.S. and allied  security, but the unleashing of forces contained by 45 years of
the  Cold War. U.S. leadership is still vital if America and other free  nations
are to deal effectively with these forces. To provide this  leadership, the
United States needs to remain engaged in world  affairs, working to create
conditions that serve the interests of the U.S.  and its allies and trying to
shape the kind of world in which  democratic institutions, free trade, and the
unimpeded flow of ideas can  flourish.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America cannot be -- nor should it try to be -- the world's  policeman. But
neither can the nation retreat into neo-isolationism.  This is an era
characterized by the global spread of ballistic  missiles; nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons; and other  high-tech weaponry among potential
adversaries. And while the threat  of thermonuclear war has subsided, at least
from the former  Soviet Union, threats from nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
and tribal  and ethnic conflict have not. Even in this new &quot;Age of Chaos,&quot;
 however, the world remains linked by innumerable strands of  trade, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  commerce, and telecommunications;
and these essential links  must operate despite conflict, confrontation, and
dislocation. A  &quot;Fortress America&quot; strategy in this kind of world is
not workable.  The U.S. could not put its head in the sand for long even if it
wanted  to. The North Koreas, Iraqs, and Irans, not to mention the  positive
demands of trade and commerce, would not allow it.  America needs access to the
world's markets and resources and must  maintain the ability to move goods
freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Consequently, acting in concert with friends and allies when  possible but
unilaterally when necessary, the United States should  use all the components of
national power and influence -- diplomacy, trade, communications, and (as a last resort) armed force -- to shape a world friendly to America's interests and
values. In  short, the U.S. needs to make the world safe for America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. has global interests and must be a world leader in  ways that suit
its interests, values, and capabilities. Because it is a  trading nation
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and  goods, America has commercial and
political interests in almost all  corners of the world. Therefore, the U.S.
must be engaged -- through diplomacy, trade, and other means -- in practically all
regions  of the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. does not have security interests  everywhere. Some of the
world's regions are more important than others.  Since the U.S. cannot be the
world's policeman -- it has neither  the means nor the will to impose a security
order on the world -- it  will have to choose carefully in deciding when, and
under what  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  cumstances, to engage its military
forces and prestige. It will  have to choose strategies, alliances, and military
capabilities that  are best suited to its unique position as the world's only
global  military power. It will have to choose when its use of military force 
is decisive and unique.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To exploit this unique and unenviable position, the U.S.  should adopt a
military strategy of selective engagement  whereby America, lacking a single
global threat, engages its military  power primarily to maintain a balance of
power in regions that are  most vital to her interests. The U.S. must always be
prepared to  protect its borders and regions close to home; for this reason,
security  matters in the Western Hemisphere will always be vitally  important.
But as a global power, the U.S. also must be prepared to  intervene militarily
to maintain a positive balance of power in other key  regions of the world. Now
that the Soviet Union has dissolved,  no single power can challenge the U.S.
globally, but smaller  powers in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf can threaten
U.S.  security interests in these vitally important regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's &quot;global&quot; strategy is both global and regional. The 
primary aims of U.S. military strategy should be: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)</B>  <B>To defend the American people and territory
from attack. </B> Thus, America's top priorities should be not only to deploy a 
ballistic missile defense for the U.S. homeland, but also to take a lead  role
in countering nuclear proliferation and other global threats to  security. <B>
</B>The greatest threat to the peace and stability in the world  today is the
acquisition by rogue regimes or hostile forces of  weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, along with the  ballis
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  tic missiles to deliver them, will
result inevitably in greater  confrontation and conflict unless the free
nations, led by the  United States, take steps to keep dangerous weapons out of
the hands  of potential enemies. America has the resources to counter the 
proliferation of advanced weaponry, including the ability to build  an effective
defense against ballistic missiles, thereby rendering  them less useful.
Harnessing these resources and demonstrating the  leadership necessary to use
them should be a top priority for U.S.  foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To maintain a balance of power in Europe, Asia, and the
 Persian Gulf.</B> It is still a vital interest of the U.S. to prevent the 
domination of Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf by a hostile power  or bloc of
hostile powers. NATO and other military alliances  remain the best ways to
prevent such domination. These alliances are  insurance policies against the
instability and chaos that  brought America into two world wars in this century.
Without an  American military presence in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf,
chaos  and conflict will fill the vacuum if security arrangements among  the
free nations of the world erode. The U.S. must cultivate good  relations with
allies in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and  Latin America, and where possible
bring emerging democracies  into security partnerships. Top priorities include
bringing new  democracies in Central Europe into NATO and strengthening 
alliances and friendships in Asia.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therein lies not only the basis of American leadership in the world -- not as the world's policeman, but as the only power capable  of
preventing major regional or even global wars -- but also a  new division of labor
with allies. America's allies should take the  lead in settling purely regional
conflicts, such as the civil war  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  Bosnia-Herzogovina, while the U.S.
focuses primarily on the  core military mission of collective defense. The U.S.
should not try  to put out every brushfire that breaks out in Europe or Asia, 
but should husband its resources to deal with larger threats that  endanger the
overall security of these regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This strategy of selective engagement is very different from  the one
pursued by the Clinton Administration. The President calls  his strategy &quot;engagement
and enlargement.&quot;  No one is sure  exactly what these terms mean, but his
strategy entails a heavy focus  on peacekeeping, multilateralism, appeasement of
large powers  like Russia and China, and a general neglect of military 
capabilities, military alliances, and the core military missions of those 
alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The strategy of selective engagement is practically the opposite  of
Clinton's approach. Peacekeeping would be downplayed (and  U.S. troop
participation in such operations avoided); multilateralism  de-emphasized except
through military alliances; policies  toward large powers like Russia and China
toughened; military  capabilities maintained at higher levels; and military
alliances focused  on core missions of collective defense, not peacekeeping or 
crisis management. Leadership would be demonstrated not by  engaging in global
social work, as the President has done, but by  emphasizing America's unique and
decisive contributions to world  peace and stability as a global power.


<P>
</P>
<P><B>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR AMERICANS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is more to maintaining America's leadership role in  the
world than military strategy. There also are the key issues of  trade 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  and economics. To be sure,
America's standard of living  depends on its role as a global power; the wealth
of America as a nation  is inconceivable without the security provided by
America's  armed forces and alliances. But it is also true that America's 
wealth would be inconceivable were it not for its access to overseas  markets
and the relative stability of the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the U.S. has a vital interest in free trade and  open
overseas markets. As a maritime nation dependent on  foreign trade, the U.S.
depends on access to world markets, raw  materials, and energy resources for its
prosperity and security.  Protecting these interests depends on the free and
safe transit of the air,  space, and the world's sea lanes and maritime choke
points.  Historically, the U.S. has been compelled to intervene with armed force
to  protect these freedoms, and it must remain prepared to do so  when
necessary. But persuasion is always preferable. Therefore, the  U.S. should
conduct an enlightened diplomacy to remove artificial  barriers to the free flow
of goods, services, and ideas,  especially among the industrialized democracies.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>PROMOTING FREEDOM ABROAD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans care deeply about the morality of their foreign 
policy. They wish to see a reflection of themselves as a people in the  foreign
policies which their government pursues. For this reason,  they wish to support
freedom and democracy abroad, not only for  the practical benefits of spreading
peace and stability, but  because doing so is a reflection of their own values
in the world. It also is  a source of inspiration which sustains their
commitments  beyond what is required by self-interest.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, most Americans do not wish to see their country  embark on some
overseas crusade for democracy. They understand  the limits imposed by reality.
It makes little sense to imply, as  the Clinton Administration did in Haiti,
that creating democracy is  a general and unlimited goal of U.S. military
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is both a practical and moral benefit for the U.S.  to help
free institutions take root abroad, particularly in  regions where old
totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed.  Free nations grounded in
democratic institutions generally do not  start wars. The freer and more
democratic the world becomes, the  more peaceful, and therefore the more
congenial to U.S. values and  interests, it will be. The best tools with which
to help emerging  democracies are foreign aid and public and private diplomacy, 
not direct military intervention, which should be undertaken  only when vital
interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These principles can and should guide policymakers, not only 
in the next Administration or next session of Congress, but in  successive
Administrations and Congresses for decades to come. In  short, they should be
viewed as the basic principles of foreign and  defense policy for America in the
21st century. They are, in  essence, the foundations of a post-Cold War national
strategy for the  United States.

<P>U.S. defense policy is undergoing its most sweeping  reappraisal since World
War II. The defense budget has dropped every  year for ten years, and from the
end of FY 1988 through FY 1995,  the Pentagon has eliminated well over one
million military  personnel. Nevertheless, despite the shrinking of America's
military might,  it is not yet clear how weak America can afford to become, or 
indeed what the major mission of the U.S. armed forces will be in the  21st
century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most dangerous threat to America today is the proliferation  of
long-range nuclear missiles that could reach American soil  from Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, or some other hostile nation.  Intelligence officials state that at
least 20 countries already have or may  be developing both weapons of mass
destruction (including  nuclear weapons) and ballistic missile delivery 
systems.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#1">1</A>  While no Third World
countries yet have ballistic missiles with sufficient range  to reach the United
States, it is a virtual certainty that some will  have them by the next decade.
Yet America has no defense against  these weapons. Strategic anti-missile
defenses are more important  than ever and could be deployed by the early part
of the coming  century. To do otherwise -- to leave America undefended against such a clear physical threat -- would be a dereliction of duty with  tragic
potential consequences.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other possible near-term threats to U.S. vital national interests  are the
potential re-establishment of an expansionist dictatorship  in Russia, military
expansionism by Iran or Iraq, attacks by  North Korea against South Korea, or
militarily threatening moves  by China against Taiwan. A defense posture capable
of  countering these threats can be maintained at far less cost than the Cold 
War demanded. However, the Clinton Administration is not  maintaining these
necessary defenses. Instead, it has presided over a  period of decline and
confusion in America's military capabilities.

</P>
<P>There are many national security issues and questions  dividing liberals
from conservatives, but not all are familiar. What, for  example, is the right
amount to spend on defense now that the  Soviet threat has ended?  There is no
consensus on the Left or the  Right; much of the old Left-Right division on
defense strategy and  spending ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. Many 
conservatives want to focus entirely on domestic problems and cut all  federal
spending, including defense. Many liberals (including the  Clinton
Administration), while not supporting higher defense  spending, want to use
American military forces in humanitarian,  peacekeeping, and non-traditional
missions which put enormous pressure  on the shrinking defense budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many other issues and questions facing the  candidates this year:
What is the proper use of American military force in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  post-Cold War world, and what kind
of forces are needed?   Should the U.S. military be converted to a kind of
global  peacekeeping constabulary?  Or should the armed services continue to
focus  on their traditional role of deterring threats to America's vital 
interests, the central element of which is preparing to fight and  win wars?  If
the U.S. military is to maintain its focus on this  traditional warfighting
role, what level of personnel is needed, and  how should the armed forces be
organized, trained, and equipped  for the future?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The post-Cold War world can be characterized as an &quot;Age  of Chaos.&quot;
 While the Soviet Union has fallen and no longer  threatens the free world with
nuclear annihilation, new conflicts have  been spawned  ethnic, tribal, and
religious  between emerging  nations and at the sub-national level. Some of
these conflicts  may threaten U.S. interests; most will not. But they certainly 
disturb peace and order in the world. Under what circumstances should  the U.S.
intervene?  What are sound and politically supportable  criteria for the use of
American military force abroad?  These are  two key questions facing the U.S.
today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. armed forces are not merely subordinate to civilian  leadership,
starting with the Commander in Chief, but highly  responsive, precisely because
of their command hierarchy. How  should the military respond to the social and
political agenda of the  President and his Administration?  Should the
Administration use  this highly responsive institution to foster revolutionary
social  change or as a laboratory for social experimentation?  What is the 
impact on combat readiness when radical social changes are forced on  the armed
forces?

</P>
<P>Perhaps the most contentious unresolved defense issue is  this: Should the
American homeland be defended against the  growing threat of long-range
ballistic missiles and the proliferation   especially among potentially hostile
nations  of weapons of mass  destruction?  Five years after the Gulf War, in
which the  largest single loss of American lives came from an Iraqi Scud missile
 attack, the U.S. still has no better defense against regional or  theater
missile threats than the <U>Patriot</U> missile, which was designed  primarily
not as a missile defense, but as an anti-aircraft missile.  The question is:
Should the U.S. move aggressively to deploy  more effective theater missile
defenses for U.S. forces and allies abroad?   Or should America continue to rely
on arms control treaties  like the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect
its security?

<P>The Clinton Administration has all but abandoned strategic  ballistic
missile defense (BMD). What is left of the nation's BMD  program is both
misdirected and underfunded. The  Administration's current plan directs the bulk
of funds toward defenses  against short-range ballistic missiles, ignoring the
need to defend  U.S. territory against long-range ballistic missiles. It reduces
the  budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion  more than 50 percent  
from FY 1995 through FY 1999. Even the plan's  high-priority &quot;theater&quot;
defenses against short-range missiles are cut by $4.5  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  lion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration is providing neither the resources  nor the
proper direction in maintaining strong conventional  forces. Instead of
identifying specific national interests and the threats  to them, the
Administration has formulated a vague strategy of  &quot;engagement and
enlargement&quot; that confuses the purposes of  national security policy. In
its national security planning, the  Administration has placed far too much
emphasis on tangential issues  like domestic economic policy, environmental
policy, and foreign  economic development.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#4">4</A>  The result has been a national
security  planning process out of control  one disconnected not only from  the
Administration's decision-making process, but also from the  hard realities of
the threats America faces.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current National Security Strategy developed by the  Clinton
Administration fails to make clear where and under what  circumstances U.S.
forces may be asked to fight. While the Clinton  Administration has established
some guidelines for military  intervention, for example, it ignored many of them
in its decision to  send troops to Bosnia. In Bosnia, the Administration made
the  mistake of creating a vital American interest where there otherwise  would
not be one. By promising U.S. troops in a yet-to-be-defined  mission and putting
American credibility on the line during the  Dayton peace talks, the Clinton
Administration presented  Congress with the choice of supporting the
Administration or damaging  U.S. credibility by breaking its word. The risks of
the Bosnian  intervention clearly are out of proportion to the costs, and the
exit  strategy is essentially an exit date of a year or less after the 
intervention began. Most controversial of all, however, was President  Clinton's
decision to deploy American forces without congressional  ap
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  proval or public support. Public
opinion supporting the  intervention crested at 40 percent in December 1995,
when the House  of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Bosnia 
mission. At the same time, the Senate expressed only lukewarm  support  support
directed at American forces, but not the  Clinton policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another example of poor defense leadership by the  Administration was its
1993 &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot; of U.S. military forces.  The purpose of the
BUR was to devise a new military force to  implement U.S. strategy in the
post-Cold War era. In meeting this  goal, however, the BUR failed. The Clinton
Administration promised  to maintain sufficient military forces to fight and win
two  medium regional conflicts, but the forces provided for by the 
Administration strategy are clearly inadequate for a two-war scenario. 
President Clinton's proposed defense budgets for the period  covering FY 1996 to
FY 2000 are not enough to pay for the BUR  force, according to numerous defense
analyses, including those of  The Heritage Foundation and the General Accounting
 Office.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#5">5</A>  The Pentagon will be
around $110 billion short over five years if  it pursues the current Clinton
Administration defense spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Deploying the forces proposed for a single major conflict from  the other
services would leave virtually nothing in reserve if a  second major conflict
began. Of the total active force of 11 aircraft  carrier battle groups proposed
for the Navy, for example, the Clinton  Administration would assign four to five
carriers to each of the  two major regional conflicts, leaving perilously little
room for error.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even worse, because &quot;peace operations&quot; will draw from the  &quot;same
collection of general purpose forces&quot; already obligated for  major 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  regional contingencies, the
Administration intends to support  them by committing up to two Army divisions,
one Marine brigade,  two aircraft carrier battle groups, and two Air Force wings
from  an already overcommitted force.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The bottom line: At the same time the Clinton Administration  has been
cutting the size and readiness of U.S. forces, it has been  increasing the
commitments they are supposed to cover. In  other words, the President is
developing a military &quot;strategy&quot;  whose reach exceeds its grasp and
which inevitably will leave some  vital U.S. interests undefended.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of Clinton's mismanagement of U.S. defense policy,  the U.S. could
not repeat the<B> </B>sweeping victory of the Persian Gulf  War today<B>.</B>
The Persian Gulf War epitomizes U.S. military  prowess. The forces that won
Desert Storm were largely the product of  the Reagan Administration's military
buildup during the early  1980s. But the Clinton Administration is sacrificing
the combat  readiness of the force of tomorrow to preserve operational readiness
 today. Had Ronald Reagan and Congress done this in the 1980s,  George Bush
could not have won such a decisive and relatively  low-casualty victory in the
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton and Congress owe the same careful  stewardship to the next
President. Not only has Clinton reduced the  armed forces to the point where
they lack the means to fight and win  a Gulf War (while maintaining a minimum of
other defense  commitments), but his budget cuts have severely affected the 
combat readiness of this reduced force. For instance, some Marine  divisions are
operating at 80-90 percent of their assigned  combat strength, Army combat
battalions assigned to be the first forces  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  the Persian Gulf have been forced
to cancel annual gunnery  training, and Navy fighter squadrons have been forced
to  cannibalize some units in order to keep others  flying.<A

threaten to make the U.S. military a hollow  fighting force.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To avoid further critical weakening of America's combat  capability, there
are several actions that the next Administration and  Congress must take.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devise a coherent national military strategy.</B> In addition to 
providing adequate resources, Congress and the next Administration  need to
devise a new military strategy for the U.S.; for all intents  and purposes,
America now has none. U.S. defense policy should  be built on four fundamental
strategies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Strategy #1:</B> Selective Engagement. The United States
has  global interests. In fact, it has economic and political interests in 
practically all regions of the world. But it does not have security  interests
in all parts of the world. When it comes to employing  U.S. military power,
America has to make choices. It should choose  to engage its armed forces
primarily in ways that affect the  global balance of power. The main purpose of
American military  power should be to establish a balance of power favorable to 
American and Western interests in key regions of the world  Europe,  Asia, and
the Persian Gulf. According to this strategy, the U.S.  would bear the principal
responsibility for the collective defense of  these regions, while U.S. allies
in the regions affected would  become responsible primarily for collective
security, peacekeeping,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  settling lesser conflicts that
are essentially regional in nature.  It must be emphasized that selective
engagement is a military  strategy, not a national strategy encompassing all
aspects  (economic, political, and diplomatic) of U.S. policy. Moreover,
selective  engagement implies that America needs a military force capable  of
handling core missions in different regions of the world.  These forces should
not be customized for specific regions when  undertaking peacekeeping and other
missions short of war.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #2:</B> Dissuasion. The U.S. armed forces should be  strong
enough to dissuade other nations from attempting to threaten  the U.S., its
interests, and its allies. By forcing them to recognize  the futility of
aggression, such power even may discourage  potential enemy nations from
substantially arming themselves. To have  the desired deterrent effect, this
power must be global in reach  and capable, when necessary, of achieving
decisive military  victory over most potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #3:</B> Strategic Defense. With many potentially  unstable
regimes acquiring both nuclear weapons and long-range  ballistic missile
delivery systems, anti-ballistic missile defenses are  absolutely essential to
defense of the U.S. homeland.  Threatening nuclear retaliation to deter an
attack using these weapons may  fail with any one of these regimes. The ability
to knock out single  or multiple missile launches could save tens of millions of
 American lives and spare the country unimaginable devastation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #4:</B> Force Projection. With many potential trouble  spots
around the globe, U.S. forces need to be redesigned so they can  be deployed
quickly around the globe. With U.S. bases  overseas shrinking in number, America
increasingly will have to be able  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  project force overseas from its
own territory. Thus, the U.S.  needs a strong navy, flexible expeditionary
forces, and an army  capable of decisively defeating a large and modern force on
the battlefield.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to reflecting these four fundamental strategies, a  sound and
credible U.S. defense policy must:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Acknowledge that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up  Review
force is not adequate to fight and win two medium-size  regional conflicts
simultaneously,</B> but should be postured to  fight and win simultaneously one
major regional conflict and  one smaller contingency. If the Administration's
objective is to  win two major regional conflicts simultaneously, it must
provide  a larger force  and the budget and other resources to sustain  that
force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Budget approximately $285 billion per year</B> (with annual 
adjustments as needed for inflation) for defense from FY 1997  through FY 2001.
</P>

<P><B>*     Devote adequate funds to research and development</B> so  that
tomorrow's force will have the advanced weaponry needed to  win with as few
casualties as possible. The research and  development account should be
increased to $38 billion (1995 dollars) by  the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Increase military pay to keep pace with inflation.</B> This will 
ensure that high-quality personnel continue to serve in the  all-volunteer
military.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain spending for operations, maintenance, and training</B> 
at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  1995 levels, adjusted for
inflation. This funding is essential to  keep the U.S. armed forces fully
trained and combat ready.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore adequate funds to crippled ballistic missile defense 
programs.</B> In FY 1997 the Pentagon should spend about $1.2  billion more on
missile defenses than the $3 billion the Clinton  Administration is likely to
request. Thus, the total, which includes funds  for the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO) and a  few select programs under the Air Force
budget, should be about  $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion in FY 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Develop a cheaper but more effective approach to missile  defense.</B>
Sea-based and space-based systems, rather than relatively  ineffective and
costly ground-based ones, would fill the bill. The  best architecture would be
one based on accelerating the Navy's  &quot;Upper Tier&quot; missile defense
system and then moving to deploy  a combination of space-based interceptors and
space-based  lasers early in the next decade.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Keep an eye on the future.</B> The computer chip and 
microelectronics revolutions are bringing about a corresponding revolution  in
military affairs. As its forces shrink, the U.S. must maintain  the most
technologically advanced military in the world, paying  close attention to new
operational concepts made possible by new  technologies  in particular,
information warfare capabilities,  improvements in surveillance and
precision-strike weapons, and  advanced &quot;situational awareness&quot; of
battlefield commanders.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we spend enough on defense?  The Cold War is  over; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  why can't we get by with
dramatically smaller military forces?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American forces already are smaller than during the Cold  War,
and they continue to shrink in size. The Pentagon has cut  more than one million
personnel during the drawdown after the end  of the Cold War. But though the
Cold War threat has ended,  the world is entering an era of new threats and
conflicts, some  of which are very dangerous. America's security and prosperity 
still depend upon a military large enough and capable enough to  defend vital
U.S. interests around the globe. For that force to remain  sufficiently combat
ready and technologically advanced to deter or  defeat future threats, the
nation must invest in adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Critics of missile defense say that no rogue state can threaten  us
with missiles today. Why do you insist on hyping the threat  from ballistic
missiles?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Ballistic missile technology is now 50 years old and is  no
longer high technology. More countries are acquiring ballistic  missiles and
missile technology and using these destructive  weapons once they obtain them.
Ballistic missiles have been used in the  war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War,
the civil war in Yemen, and  the Persian Gulf War. In the Gulf War, more
Americans (28)  died from missile attack than from any other enemy action when 
an Iraqi Scud fell on a U.S. barracks in Dharan. Inevitably,  these rogue states
will acquire missiles with greater ranges and  increased accuracy. Fielding
comprehensive defenses against the  emerging missile threat will take some 10
years; if the U.S. waits until  rogue states actually deploy missiles with
ranges sufficient to reach  U.S. territory, it will be too late. Finally, U.S.
territory is at risk  today because of intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) and  subma
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  rine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs) deployed by China  and Russia. At a minimum, the U.S. should deploy
defenses to  address the possibility of unauthorized or accidental missile
launches  by these two countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Some critics say there is no readiness crisis in the military.  Is
there a crisis in readiness or not?

<P><B>A.</B> Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence J. Korb,  a
scholar at the Brookings Institution, argues that there is no  readiness crisis.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#9">9</A>  However, two separate reports
based on the  evidence from field units themselves paint a dramatically
different  picture. Senator John McCain's <I>Going Hollow: The Warnings of the 
Chiefs of Staff</I> and Representative Floyd Spence's 
<I>Military Readiness: The View from the Field</I> document how funding
shortfalls  have forced understrength first-line combat units to cancel
training,  curtail missions, and cease flying in preparation for eventual 
military missions. At the same time, Clinton has sent the military on 
humanitarian missions to Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and  elsewhere at the
expense of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the inability of the Bottom-Up  Review
Force to fight and win two simultaneous major conflicts?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Create a &quot;one-and-a-half-war&quot; fighting force. The size
of  the U.S. forces needed depends on the magnitude of the  commitments made to
meet possible threats. It is unlikely that the U.S. will  face more than one
large-scale regional conflict similar to the  Persian Gulf War at any one time
over the next five years.  Conceivably, however, the nation may have to deal
with one small-scale  regional conflict roughly the size of the 1989 Panama
operation  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  currently with a large-scale
conflict. The U.S. should maintain  a one-and-a-half-war force capable of
engaging in such  conflicts simultaneously.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#10">10</A>  While this strategy accepts a
higher level of  risk than the Clinton Administration's &quot;two war&quot;
strategy,  the Administration's defense budget puts the nation in a  position
where it will have barely enough forces to fight one major  regional conflict by
itself. The important thing is to stop the  demobilization process now. If the
nation later finds it necessary, it should  re-examine the two-war strategy and
increase the defense budget  accordingly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How many and what kinds of conventional forces and  equipment does
the nation need?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. needs a Navy of about 400 ships, with 12 active 
aircraft carriers. The Marine Corps should retain three Marine  Expeditionary
Forces (MEFs), which would require 177,000  active-duty Marines; the Marine
Corps Reserve should number 42,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps Reserve,
therefore, should be reduced  by a smaller proportion than the other services.
Also needed are  fast sealift ships and new heavy airlifters, like the C-17, to
replace  the nation's rapidly aging airlift fleet and maintain the ability to 
get heavy forces into a theater of conflict in a hurry. Finally,  adequate
pre-positioned stocks of heavy equipment, either ashore near  likely trouble
spots or on maritime pre-positioned ships, are essential  to sustain a conflict
for more than a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't building strategic defenses kill arms control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should carry out the strategic nuclear weapons 
reductions agreed upon with Moscow. This would lessen the  Russian 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nuclear threat while leaving the
U.S. with the forces it needs  both to protect itself should a political
reversal take place in  Moscow and to deter such lesser nuclear powers as China.
At the  same time, however, a policy of nuclear deterrence will be inadequate 
in a world where many nations possess both weapons of mass  destruction and
long-range delivery systems. With many  potentially unstable, even irrational,
regimes capable of delivering  nuclear weapons, strategic anti-missile defenses
are more essential  than ever. The Cold War policy of deliberate vulnerability
to  missile attack is unthinkable in this new international climate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Building missile defenses will not kill arms control.  Ronald Reagan signed
numerous arms reduction deals with the  Soviets while pursuing the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). It would  be no different in the future. The Russians'
bluster against U.S.  strategic defense comes simply from their desire to keep
America  vulnerable to their strategic missiles, in which they have made such  a
huge investment, and which constitute their one surviving  qualification as a
global power. The U.S. should offer to discuss a  transition from an
offense-only posture to missile defenses by  both sides, but Russia should not
be permitted a veto over the  deployment of U.S. missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the ABM Treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM)
Treaty. The treaty effectively bars the deployment of  effective,
non-threatening defenses. A new multilateral  agreement with all relevant
parties to provide for the mutual deployment  of such defenses should be
pursued.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#11">11</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the U.S. military be reorganized to deal mainly  with
peacekeeping operations and not large wars, which are things  of the past?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight  and
win America's wars. Under no circumstances can it fail in  that most profound
task. Given the many American security  commitments around the globe, the U.S.
military must train  continuously and arduously towards this goal. During the
Cold War, the  U.S. military concentrated almost exclusively on decisive 
battlefield engagements against the forces of the Soviet Union and the  Warsaw
Pact. It was this training and focus that gave America the  military prowess to
defeat Iraq so completely in the Persian Gulf  War. Such a commitment to winning
in combat must not be  squandered through continuous commitment to peacekeeping
operations or  a restructuring of vital combat units for such missions. The 
deployments to Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia already have greatly  reduced the
combat capabilities of the military. Any further dilution of  this fundamental
mission stands to put the U.S. military in a  position similar to the one it
faced in Korea in 1950. At that time,  American occupation forces were untrained
for combat and nearly  wiped out by the North Korean invasion. America cannot
afford to  lose on the battlefield, and history conclusively proves that 
concentrating on military missions other than war increases the possibility  of
such a disaster.

operations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Only when it serves U.S. national interests. There are  many
humanitarian crises in the world, but neither the U.S. nor the  U.N. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  has the resources to deal with
every one. When America does  participate, U.S. troops must remain under U.S. or
allied, rather  than U.N., command. A peacekeeping mission must have clear 
command and control arrangements, adequate force, appropriate  criteria for
success, a definite endpoint, and a plan for  disengagement once success is
achieved. As a rule, U.S. military forces  should engage in allied combat
operations when their employment is  decisive, unique, and make the difference
between success and failure.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES2">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight and  win the
nation's wars. But an effective military force depends on  more than weapons,
equipment, and adequate defense budgets.  Such intangible human factors as
leadership, esprit de corps,  morale, mutual trust, and unit cohesion are as
vital to an effective  combat force as the material factors. These intangible
elements make  up the &quot;warrior ethos&quot; that is needed if U.S. armed
forces are to  win America's wars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This ethos is under siege. The Clinton Administration has tried  to put
homosexuals in the military and women in combat  positions. This agenda of
political correctness will undermine the  combat effectiveness of U.S. forces if
allowed to continue unchecked. It  is eroding morale and corroding the mutual
trust that must exist in  an effective fighting organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of this agenda is to re-create the military services in  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  fashionable, liberal image.
Liberal social activists who exercise  an inordinate influence on the Clinton
Administration view the  military as a federally sponsored vehicle for social 
experimentation. Because they see it as the last bastion of &quot;male
domination,&quot;  liberals want to de-masculinize the military regardless of
the effect  on its capacity to do its only job, which is to fight and win 
America's wars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because the military is a command hierarchy, liberal social  activists
believe they can impose their agenda from the top down.  Most service members
oppose social engineering of this kind  because they know it saps the fighting
power of the services, and thus  exposes them to greater danger. But they are
intimidated from  speaking out, and often find their careers in jeopardy if they
do not  embrace the &quot;diversity&quot; agenda imposed on them from above.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS2">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Colin
Powell,  all serving Chiefs of Staff, and most former members of the  Joint
Chiefs have stated unequivocally that acknowledged  homosexuals in the
military's ranks are harmful to the good order and  discipline of the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Women currently make up approximately 12 percent of the  U.S.
armed forces, more than any other nation's military. While  women do not serve
in so-called direct combat positions in the  infantry, armored, or field
artillery units, many are being assigned to  combat support units, combatant
ships, and pilot billets which put  them in harm's way. These assignments
inevitably would put women  in combat during a war.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     During the Persian Gulf War, American women soldiers  were
taken prisoner for the first time in U.S. history. These women  were sexually
abused by Iraqi captors. The possibility that women  prisoners will be raped and
tortured, or that large numbers of  women will be killed and wounded in action,
could have a  dramatically negative effect on American public opinion and on the
 nation's ability to prosecute a war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     No other nation places women in combat posts, not even 
Israel, despite a common misconception to the contrary and even  though Israel
has a manpower shortage. Israel used women in combat  for a short time during
its war of independence and made it  policy never to do so again except in the
most dire national  emergencies. In the Israel Defense Force, women do receive
basic combat  training and may be attached to combat units in support roles, but
 they do not take part in combat operations. (Recently, the Israeli  Supreme
Court directed the Israeli armed forces to permit a  woman to train as a combat
pilot; she has since dropped out of flight  training.) Other nations, such as
Denmark, allow women to serve  in combat units but also note that they are not
likely to see combat.  In any event, Denmark concedes that its policy was
undertaken  to satisfy contemporary social mores and could hurt unit  cohesion
and combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Introducing women into all combat specialties means creating 
two different standards in order to account for the physiological  differences
between women and men. A combat unit's effectiveness  is predicated on unit
cohesion, which is based in turn on the bonds  of trust among soldiers in a
unit. Training to two different  standards is the surest way to wreck unit
morale, raising problems of  favorit
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  ism and of training that does not
meet the standard required by  the mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Putting women in combat units degrades combat readiness.  For instance,
pregnant women are not able to deploy on military  missions with their units,
causing further problems of morale,  unit cohesion, and readiness. The aircraft
carrier USS Eisenhower  is the first U.S. naval ship to try to integrate men and
women. In  the first six months of a recent deployment, 14 women on  the
Eisenhower became pregnant while on cruise, and were freed  from their duties.
The message sent to sailors is that there are  different standards for men and
women, standards that are based not on  the capability of the individual to help
the team win in combat, but  on one's sex.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD2">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has instituted policies that would put women  in combat
and homosexuals in the military. Because the  President comes from an
aggressively anti-military background, these  decisions as Commander in Chief
have been resisted by the  American military establishment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, on April 28, 1993, the Clinton Administration  announced that
the Department of Defense would open certain  combat aviation positions to
women. This change in policy affected  all three services and made women
available for duty in all  aviation units, including air cavalry units in the
Army. Women  currently are barred only from direct participation in infantry,
armor,  and some artillery units.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, early in his Administration, the President revoked  the
long-standing military ban on homosexuals, establishing instead  a fuzzy &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy that simply prohibits open  displays of
homosexuality. This policy is a poor compromise  between the President and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were  concerned about the adverse impact of lifting
the ban. It makes it  technically legal for homosexuals to serve in the armed
forces, but also  allows them to be discharged for openly displaying homosexual 
behavior. As might be expected from such an ambiguous compromise,  the policy
has been challenged in several court cases but with  unclear results, being
upheld in some decisions and struck down in  others. Congress has hidden behind
the compromise language, refusing  to hold hearings or conduct proper oversight
of Defense  Department regulations implementing the law prohibiting open 
homosexuals from serving, as passed in the FY 1995 Defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> President Clinton also objected to provisions in the 1996  Defense
authorization bill that allow the military to  discharge servicemembers
diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes  AIDS. This ban was imposed because
HIV-positive  servicemembers could infect other members in combat operations.
This is in  keeping with existing military policy that prevents the deployment 
of servicemembers with other contagious or debilitating  diseases. President
Clinton maintains that this discriminates against  HIV-positive personnel; the
Department of Defense maintains that  because HIV-positive servicemembers cannot
serve on  deployments, they should not continue to serve while others must
deploy in  their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To ensure that the U.S. military continues to do its job of  fighting and
winning America's wars, the Administration and  Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Return to the Chiefs of Staff the power to determine social 
policies based on the requirement to fight and win in combat.</B> The  service
Chiefs are charged by law to provide the best military advice to  the President
and Secretary of Defense, and the best command  guidance to their respective
services. They have a heavy  responsibility and must be allowed to put the
nation's defense needs and  the combat capabilities of the services ahead of the
political  pressures or passing social agendas of the moment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Eliminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the  Service.</B>
This committee was set up after the Korean War to advise  the Chiefs of Staff on
women's issues in the service. Over the  years, however, it has become a vehicle
for promoting the  legislative agendas of militant homosexual lobbies, feminist 
organizations, and other liberal pressure groups. In addition, similar 
organizations in the services should be focused on the challenge of  maintaining
equality and professionalism in the military while promoting  the warrior ethos
and military ethic among all members of the  service. They should not advance
the radical agendas of groups who  view the military as &quot;just another job&quot;
and believe it needs to be  restructured so its values and ethics are in line
with those of  contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Ensure that the military oversight committees of Congress  protect
the careers of loyal service officers who properly advise  against the social
engineering agenda.</B> For instance, congressional  oversight  which includes
final approval of military promotion lists   
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  must ensure that exemplary
officers like Commander  Robert Stumpf, U.S. Navy, are not ridden out of the
service as the  result of a political correctness witch hunt. Commander Stumpf,
a  Naval aviator and former commander of the Navy's precision  combat flying
team, was denied promotion because he attended the  notorious Tailhook
convention in 1991. Even though a Navy  investigation completely exonerated him
of any connection with the  events of Tailhook, Commander Stumpf was denied
promotion by a  Senate Armed Services Committee policy that the Navy notify  the
committee of all officers who attended the Tailhook  convention. Such egregious
bows to political correctness are nonsensical,  unjust, and damaging to morale.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abandon the confusing &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy 
regarding homosexuals in the military.</B> This policy is a clear example of  a
President who wants to have his cake and eat it too. As a result,  the policy is
under legal challenge in two different courts and  most likely will need to be
settled by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A2">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the services ban women from combat and  homosexuals from
military service?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Advocates of women in combat and homosexuals in the  military
view military service as similar to any other job and  assume that gender or
sexual orientation are insignificant in the  military environment. They are
wrong. Combat is a team endeavor and  the most demanding environment 
physically, mentally, and  morally  that one can endure. It is not a &quot;job&quot;
but a life-and-death  under
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  taking. The primary criterion for
inclusion must be the ability  of the individual to enhance  not to detract from
 the  effectiveness of the unit. A military organization functions best when 
differences among individuals in a unit are minimized. That is why  soldiers are
required to look, act, dress, and train alike. It makes  no sense to break down
all of these differences only to inject  the greatest difference of all 
individual sexual identity  into a unit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Professional military judgment and experience indicate that  mixing known
homosexuals with heterosexuals undermines  cohesion and combat effectiveness.
Common sense suggests that men  and women distract each other even when trying
not to do so. In  combat, such distractions can be the difference between life
and  death. The purpose of the military is to build the most effective  fighting
force to defeat an enemy as quickly, and with as few  American casualties, as
possible. Differences in sexual identity will  weaken discipline and
effectiveness, thus making it more difficult to  prevail in combat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Access to the military has never been based on what is &quot;fair.&quot;  
Military service is a privilege and sometimes a duty, but never  a right.
Because victories in combat are achieved by cohesive  units, the armed forces
routinely sacrifice individual interests to  ensure unit cohesion. Military
service is legally restricted or denied  to patriotic Americans who are too
tall, too short, too fat,  color-blind, flat-footed, or mentally or physically
handicapped. This is no  reflection on the inherent worth of these individuals;
they simply  do not meet the military's needs.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#12">12</A>  For the same reason,  women
should be barred from combat and known homosexuals should  be excluded entirely
from military service.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Before the military was desegregated in 1948, many of  the same
arguments used today to oppose gays in the military  were used to oppose blacks
in the service. Can't America's GIs learn  to live and work with homosexuals in
the same way they learned  to live and work with black Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As General Powell  himself a black man  has explained,  being
black is a benign condition, a matter of birth. On the  other hand, homosexual
activity is not. It is a gross fallacy to equate  the two. Moreover, black
Americans have proven themselves on  the field of battle and in every other
military function. They  have made remarkable contributions to the military and
to the  nation's security, and are recognized universally among the best 
soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen in the world. On the other hand,  the
open acceptance of homosexuality in the ranks almost  always causes problems of
morale and discipline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If a woman can perform the same job as a man, why  can't women hold
combat jobs?  To limit women to support roles  also limits their career
opportunities for advancement in the military.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The fundamental purpose of military service is to  defend
America, not to advance careers. There can be only one  standard for a warrior,
and that is determined by what it takes to fight  and win in combat. The great
majority of women in the military,  and even some men, cannot meet the physical
standards required  for service in combat units. Having different standards for
men  and women would ruin morale and unit cohesion. Putting women  in combat
also would raise a host of thorny questions, among  them: How will the
inevitable formation of male-female special  relationships affect discipline and
unit cohesion, which are essential  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  success in combat?  How can a
woman's privacy be respected  adequately in combat conditions?  What would be
the effect  on troops and the impact on public support for a combat mission if 
a number of females were taken prisoner and abused by their  captors or
exploited for psychological warfare or propaganda advantage?   How would
official and legal efforts to prevent sexual  harassment of women prevent the
rise of double standards and the  inevitable breakdown of morale and unit
cohesion?

<P>

<P><B>A</B>merica is a global power with vital interests in key regions of 
the world, specifically in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the  Middle East.
America fought two world wars in this century to  preserve freedom and stability
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,  and then endured the long twilight
struggle of the Cold War,  including shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam, to
protect Europe and  Asia from communist domination. In effect, the U.S. is both
a  European and Pacific power. It has maintained a military presence in  Europe
and Asia since the end of the Second World War to protect  vital links of trade,
communication, and cultural exchange. And  even though the Cold War is over,
U.S. security interests still  require America's military, political, and
economic involvement in  European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf War dramatized the vital interests of  America and the
world's industrialized democracies in the Middle  East. U.S. air and naval
forces patrol the Eastern Mediterranean  and keep watch on the potential threat
from Iraq and Iran to the  Persian Gulf, still the source of much of the free
world's energy  supplies. In fact, the U.S. depends more on crude oil from the
Gulf  today than it did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To make the world safe for America, the U.S. needs to keep  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vital regions of Europe, Asia, and
the Persian Gulf free of  hostile domination. This strategy requires a mixture
of diplomacy  and military deterrence. The U.S. must maintain its military 
alliances in these regions and adapt them to new conditions. At the  same time,
new types of relationships with friends and allies, based  on trade and
commercial ties, must be advanced to supplement  (and possibly, in some cases,
replace) old ones based on military  alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect America's interests in various regions of the world,  the U.S.
needs some forces deployed overseas, the capability to  respond rapidly and
effectively to regional crises, and the ability  to support U.S. forces that
have been deployed overseas from  the continental United States. Effective
regional security  strategies, coupled with the means and the will to carry them
out, not  only will allow the U.S. to prevail in the event of a conflict, but 
also may deter aggression in the first place.

<p>
<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily responsible for  guaranteeing
that Western Europe would not be dominated by a  hostile power. With the demise
of the Soviet Union, many  Americans wonder what role America should play in
Europe and exactly  how the American role in the Atlantic alliance should be
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans believe that the U.S. should simply pull its  military forces
out of Europe. Others warn against such an action.  Historically, when it has
taken no notice of European affairs, the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  has been called upon to intervene
in conflicts that threaten the  global balance of power and the safety of
America as well. This  was the case in the First and Second World Wars and
during the  Cold War. Proponents of U.S. military involvement in Europe argue 
that America had to help defend Europe in order to defend the  security and
liberty of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue today is how to structure America's participation in  European
security. Should the U.S. be primarily a peacemaker in  settling civil wars like
the one in Bosnia?  Or should it confine  itself to the core mission of
collective defense, defending Europe  from major power threats regardless of the
source or sources of  those threats? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These questions are at the heart of the debate over NATO's  future. NATO has
been undergoing an identity crisis since the  Soviet Union collapsed. At issue
is whether the U.S. and its allies, in  order to make NATO more relevant, should
task the alliance  with out-of-area missions, including peacekeeping, peace 
enforcement, and other security activities NATO was never intended to  perform.
But this search for a new role could turn NATO into an  organization like the
United Nations, which, because of its many  different members and missions, is
not suited to organizing and  directing significant military operations. In the
end, some fear NATO  could become no more effective than the U.N. is now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For some in America, the question is not how the U.S. role  in NATO should
be defined, but whether the U.S. should be  in NATO at all. Others argue that
America's 100,000 troops in  Europe act as a stabilizing force that enhances
European  security; they believe that the American military presence in Europe
is  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  insurance policy against the
threat of war between any of  Europe's major powers. The cost of maintaining
these troops is a matter  for legitimate debate, but given the costs of a
European  conflagration, it is well worth paying. Those Americans who advocate 
pulling U.S. military forces out of Europe or reducing the U.S. presence  to a
skeleton force are saying, in essence, that the U.S. has no  vital national
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious NATO issue involves the peacekeeping  operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. is heavily involved in  the NATO Peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia, and while  the Clinton Administration has
promised to end the mission after  a one-year deployment, many questions arise:
If the promised  peace does not take hold, and especially if Americans are drawn
 into combat with one or more Bosnian factions, will the U.S. be able  to
withdraw on schedule?  
</P>
<P>Will the U.S. be able withdraw in the midst of renewed  fighting and
possible American casualties without the appearance of  an ignominious retreat,
and without harming U.S. credibility  and prestige?  What happens if peace has
not taken hold at the end  of one year?  Will the U.S. pull out anyway, bringing
the  European peacekeepers out with it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>NATO expansion is another significant issue in the debate  over Europe and
the U.S. role in Europe. NATO expansion would  extend NATO's zone of peace,
democracy, stability, and freedom  to its new members. Many security experts
believe that the  Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO
enlargement out  of fear of offending Russia. They maintain that Russia has an 
implicit veto over extending NATO membership to new democracies  in Central
Europe. However, critics of expansion maintain that  en
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  larging NATO will only encourage
an adversarial response  from Russia and may precipitate a return to Cold
War-style  relations. These critics also insist that expanding NATO will dilute
the  alliance, enlarging its commitments while weakening its basic  structure.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The economic prosperity of the United States is closely tied 
to trade with Europe. Europe is America's second largest  customer, taking 31
percent of American exports and providing 29 percent  of imports. Fifty percent
of direct American investment abroad is  in Europe and over 60 percent of direct
foreign investment in  the U.S. comes from Europe. Over three million Americans
are  employed in the U.S. by European-owned firms, and another 1.5  million
American workers are supported directly by U.S. exports  to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States maintains approximately 100,000 troops in 
Europe, and most of the troops involved in the Bosnia peace  implementation plan
were taken from U.S. forces based in  Europe. These forces are a key element in
America's national strategy  for two reasons:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) European-based forces contribute directly to European

and

<P><B>2) The forces stationed in Europe are one ocean closer to many  of the
regions</B> in which the U.S. might be called to fight.  Approximately half of
the U.S. combat units deployed during  Operation 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  Desert Storm came directly from
Europe.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     NATO still consists of the 16 nations that belonged to the 
alliance at the end of the Cold War. France recently decided to rejoin  the
integrated NATO military structure, at least partially, after  leaving it in
1966. Spain, the NATO Secretary-General's home country,  is not integrated fully
into NATO's military structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Besides NATO's 16 full members, there are 27 states enrolled 
in the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program, a  U.S.
initiative that enables non-NATO nations to associate with  and apply for
membership in NATO. Almost every country of  Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union is a member of the  Partnership for Peace, designed as an
intermediate step to membership  in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A European collective security organization often touted by 
the Russians as a possible substitute for NATO is the Organization  for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Despite having over 50  members, however, OSCE is
little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot; for  general issues of European
security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration estimates that the Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Force will cost the U.S. between $2 billion and $3  billion per
year, but this does not include costs for the  reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure in Bosnia. Many experts believe that  the actual cost will be
closer to twice that predicted by the  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     European integration under the auspices of the European  Union
(EU) is proceeding more slowly than expected, and there is  no 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  certainty of a federal Europe, a
European army, or even a  unified currency in the immediate future. Last year
the EU expanded  to include Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Further expansion, 
especially in Eastern Europe, is not expected anytime soon,  although most
former Warsaw Pact countries are eager to join the EU.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO  enlargement and
missed an important window of opportunity for  offering membership to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary,  and Slovakia, the most likely candidates for NATO
membership.  Instead of expanding Europe's zone of peace, security, and  freedom
to Central Europe, President Clinton has taken counsel of his  fears and handed
the Russians an implicit veto over when, where,  and how NATO should expand.
What has the U.S. received in return?   A meaningless Russian troop
participation in the Bosnian  peacekeeping operation  something of only marginal
interest to  the U.S. Every day NATO delays enlargement, opposition from  the
Russians grows. Former communists have regained power in  Central and Eastern
Europe and may soon do the same in Russia.  Unless the U.S. Administration acts
soon, the opportunity to  enlarge NATO may disappear.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The GOP's Contract With America called for NATO expansion  in the form of
near-term membership for Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
Both the House and Senate versions of  the foreign operations bill contained
language supporting this  expansion but neither specifically nor legally
mandating a concrete  time frame for expansion.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even as the Clinton Administration has delayed NATO  expansion, it has
committed U.S. power and prestige to a questionable  peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia. President Clinton has deployed  over 35,000 U.S. troops to support the
Peace Implementation  Force (IFOR). These troops are stationed in Croatia,
Hungary, Italy,  and afloat in the Adriatic Sea, and include 20,000 U.S. combat 
troops in northeastern Bosnia. His reason: to keep faith with U.S.  allies and
preserve NATO. But failure in Bosnia could wreck the  very cohesion that the
President hopes to preserve. If IFOR  fails, NATO could fail with it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration does not have an exit strategy for U.S.  forces in
Bosnia, the President invented one by promising that U.S.  forces will return
home in &quot;about a year.&quot;  Such an ambiguous and  poorly defined
commitment endangers the U.S. soldiers involved,  opens the door for &quot;mission
creep,&quot; and raises the possibility of a  long and open-ended commitment to
a mission that may never succeed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President assumes unrealistically that within a year the  new state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have resettled all  refugees, settled all territorial
disputes, conducted free and democratic  elections, and formed a new
constitutional central government  based on an elaborate power-sharing
agreement. Most experts agree  that these issues will take much longer to settle
and that U.S.  troops either will leave too soon to make a lasting contribution
or,  even worse, will be drawn into new roles and mandates that prolong  an
already ill-advised U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most troubling issues is what to do with indicted  war criminals.
If NATO tries to arrest them, the aggrieved faction  may pull out of the
agreement. But if these war criminals are ignored  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  released, the other side may take
matters into its own hands  and resume the fighting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From the beginning, Congress was reluctant to support  the Bosnian mission.
On December 13, 1995, the Senate voted  69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain
resolution, which supports the  men and women in uniform but &quot;does not
endorse the President's  decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton.&quot; 
The House was  more critical and voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while 
expressing support for the troops being deployed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Europe, the Administration and  Congress
should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Declare that America's vital national interest in Europe lies in 
preventing the domination of the continent by a hostile power or  bloc of
powers.</B> This is a clear and focused national interest. A  major power threat
to Europe would present a political and  economic threat to the peace, security,
and prosperity of the United  States itself, and America must be prepared to
defend this interest  with military action. This is done most effectively
through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Clearly define the role the U.S. will play in European security 
affairs and NATO.</B> First, an American military role must be  focused on the
core mission of NATO: collective defense. America  can support peacekeeping or
other out-of-area operations, but  the American contribution to NATO operations
should be  focused primarily on this core mission. Second, American military 
involvement should make a unique and decisive contribution to  any NATO
operation. American power will be squandered if it is  used 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  only to address peripheral and
marginal security issues that  the European allies are reluctant to undertake
themselves. This  will promote a clear and sensible division of labor with
America's  European allies and show the American people that the Europeans  are
&quot;pulling their weight&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the Europeans to take the lead in addressing  marginal
and peripheral security problems while guaranteeing an active  U.S. support role
in these endeavors.</B> In the past, an  American-led NATO effort was the only
option available for dealing with  a range of security issues in Europe. The
U.S. must promote a  more flexible range of responses to the many different
types of  security problems in and around Europe. When the U.S. role is 
re-focused on collective defense, the European powers can work  through other
structures (such as the Western European Union or OSCE)  to manage more marginal
security problems. This also will  prevent NATO from trying to become all things
to all people,  thereby minimizing the risk that the alliance could become an 
unwieldy and emasculated collective security organization instead of a  focused
and robust instrument of collective defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Offer immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary,  the Czech
Republic, and Slovakia and drop the implicit guarantee  of membership for other
countries in the Partnership for Peace.</B>  The addition of these countries to
Europe will expand NATO's zone  of peace and freedom and contribute to the core
mission of  collective defense against a major power threat to Europe. These 
countries are best suited for NATO membership. They have  demonstrated their
commitment to democracy, and their membership makes  strategic and geopolitical
sense for NATO. While other countries  can maintain a relationship with the PFP
or develop new ties with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  Western European Union, these
four Central European  countries should be the only new members admitted to NATO
itself.  Any more countries would be practically impossible for NATO to  defend
and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Lower expectations for &quot;success&quot; in the Bosnia peace 
implementation mission.</B> This can be done by limiting the U.S. military role 
to purely military functions and to operations that are both  clearly definable
and achievable. Above all, the U.S. must avoid  &quot;mission creep,&quot; or
escalation of the mission, in which IFOR might be  given long-term
nation-building or war crimes tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the European Union to maintain free trading  relations
with the U.S. and avoid instituting protectionist trade  measures.</B> The U.S.
should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested European countries,
including those in Central and Eastern  Europe. This should be initiated through
a &quot;framework agreement&quot;  to ensure that the EU and the U.S. stay on
track to create a  world-wide free trade regime in line with the WTO and GATT 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Cold War is over, and Europe is now full of many  prosperous
democratic states. Can't they bear the burden of their own  security?  Why do we
need to keep hundreds of thousands of  American troops over there?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> To defend our own freedom and security. A secure Europe is  a
vital U.S. interest. American freedom could not long endure if  all of Europe
with its resources and power were turned against  us. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Besides, the continued peace and
stability of Europe gives  considerable economic benefit to the United States.
Europe takes  almost one-third of U.S. exports and supplies 30 percent of
American  imports. Almost half of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe. 
In addition, millions of Americans are employed in the U.S. by  European-owned
firms, and millions more are supported by U.S.  exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't NATO expansion alienate Russia and risk creating a  new Cold
War with a new Iron Curtain in Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NATO membership brings security and stability. Therefore,  by
extending membership to Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, NATO
can help stabilize an area of Europe that  has rarely been either stable or
prosperous. NATO can work with  Moscow throughout this process to explain that
limited enlargement  is no threat to Russia. This should be done while the U.S.
has  relatively good relations with a friendly Russian administration.  The
return to power of a more nationalist Russian administration  is possible down
the road and would make NATO expansion  considerably more difficult. In any
event, however, Russian opposition  to NATO expansion is motivated mainly by
internal political  debates and economic instability, not by any real fear of
the West.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't expanding NATO just draw a line between East  and West, fueling
a new Cold War?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This is a line that inevitably must be drawn somewhere, 
sometime, unless you assume Russia will become a NATO member   something that is
both inadvisable and highly unlikely. Those  who complain about drawing lines
between East and West are  really 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  saying that they do not want the
free and democratic systems  of Western Europe moved east. NATO need not expand
to all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but it should incorporate 
those Central European states that strategically make sense to  NATO and which
politically, economically, and culturally already are  part of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should U.S. soldiers fight and die in a place like Bosnia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. soldiers should not fight and die in Bosnia, at least  under
current circumstances. American troops should be committed  to hostilities only
where their sacrifice is needed to protect  America's vital national interests.
That interest in Europe is to prevent  the continent from being dominated by a
hostile power or bloc of  powers. This is the core mission of NATO. American
combat  troops should not be deployed in the middle of peripheral civil wars  in
order to enforce a tenuous and cosmetic peace. The contribution  of American
combat forces to NATO must be unique and decisive,  as well as oriented toward
NATO's core mission of collective  defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What are U.S. interests in the Balkans?  What should we  do there now
that we are involved in the peacekeeping operation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Europe 
is not threatened by a major hostile power. To guarantee that  this vital
interest is protected, the U.S. should be willing to use  American combat
forces. The ethnic conflict in Bosnia does not  threaten the peace and stability
of Europe in this way. However, the  U.S. can assist the lead efforts of its
European allies in containing  and helping to resolve this conflict. The U.S.
can provide  logistical, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  intelligence, and air support for
European peacekeeping  operations, but American troops need not be involved
where  European troops can do the job. However, now that U.S. troops are there 
as part of IFOR, the U.S. should ensure that their mission is limited  to purely
military operations. Military objectives should be  clearly defined, and upon
achieving them, U.S. military forces  should leave. U.S. forces should not be
involved in rebuilding  Bosnia's political, economic, or social institutions.
This would be the  first step on the road to &quot;mission creep&quot; and would
ensure that  U.S. forces are drawn into the conflict with no clear exit in
sight.

<p>
<P><A NAME="ISSUESA"><B>THE ISSUES
</B></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's interests in Asia have remained consistent for two  centuries.
These interests are freedom of navigation, commercial  access to markets, and
preventing the domination of the region by  a hostile power or coalition of such
powers. The question  looming before America today is whether the United States
will retain  the leadership role in Asia required to defend these interests. 
After over three years of indecisive and faulty leadership from  the Clinton
Administration, the U.S. leadership role is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the President's policies  toward the
People's Republic of China (PRC). The Clinton  Administration has failed to
follow a consistent and coherent strategy  in dealing with China. As a result,
the U.S. has lost much of its  credibility in the region. For example, the
President, like many  liberals, tried to link trade with China to Beijing's
performance on  human rights issues. Conservatives, on the other hand, believing
that  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  best way to encourage democracy
and promote human rights  is through open trade, opposed early attempts by
Clinton to  deny China most-favored-nation trading status. Ultimately, the 
President had to reverse course, implicitly admitting the bankruptcy of  his
policies, but his inconstancy weakened his hand in dealing  with the Chinese and
undermined U.S. credibility in the region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is how to deal with the PRC's attempts  to
intimidate the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC). Bill  Clinton has demonstrated
an inclination to succumb to bullying  from Beijing. In early 1995, he sided at
first with the mainland  Chinese against granting a visa to permit Taiwan's
President, Lee  Teng-hui, to make an unofficial visit to the United States. He 
reversed course abruptly, granting the visa in May 1995, but only after 
pressure from Congress. Subsequently, the President was  painfully slow to
recognize the seriousness of Beijing's threats of  military force against the
ROC, including the testing of  nuclear-capable missiles in the vicinity of
Taiwan. Even when the  Administration abandoned its policy of ineffectual
diplomacy in March, after  three test missiles landed near two Taiwanese ports,
the Clinton  team shrank from labeling the Chinese actions for what they are  
political terrorism. Finally, mainly because of opposition  from Beijing,
Clinton has failed to provide adequate support  for Taiwan's entry into
international economic organizations like  the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. Taiwan deserves membership in
these  organizations because of its growing status as an economic  powerhouse
and emerging democracy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of the President's China policies argue that  Beijing should not
be allowed to dictate the terms of America's  unofficial 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  relations with Taiwan  terms
established by the 1979  Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which stipulates that
although the U.S.  does not have official relations with the ROC, it does stand
ready  to help Taiwan defend itself. Critics of the President insist that 
Taiwan should have the weapons necessary to defend its security  and that, if
necessary, the U.S. should provide the ROC with  these weapons. In particular,
it should be working with Taiwan to  build a defense against the PRC's ballistic
missiles, which threaten  Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the Korean peninsula, the issue is how to restore trust and  confidence
to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In pursuing its  nuclear bargain with North
Korea, called the Agreed Framework,  the Clinton Administration marginalized the
role of its ally South  Korea. Negotiating directly with North Korea, the U.S. 
got Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return  for help in
converting its nuclear reactors to peaceful purposes.  The North has used the
agreement to open a direct channel to the  U.S. while continuing to vilify and
shun South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of Clinton's policies contend that this approach  has damaged
relations with an important ally, South Korea. They  also insist that progress
in the North-South dialogue should be linked  to implementation of the Framework
Agreement. America has a  vital interest in deterring a North Korean attack on
the South  an  interest that has not been given adequate attention by the
Clinton  Administration. North Korea's million-man army stands only a  few miles
away from the South Korean capital of Seoul and the  37,000 U.S. troops near the
North-South border. Reducing this  conventional military threat from the North
should be equally as  important as eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear weapons
potential.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On Japan, the issue dividing Clinton and his opponents is how  best to
sustain and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while  advancing deregulation and
the further opening of Japan's markets.  Critics argue that Bill Clinton made
two fundamental mistakes in  his policy toward Japan: He put economics and trade
at the center  of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and he attempted to use a highly 
confrontational managed-trade strategy to force internal change  in Japan.
Neither policy worked. Clinton's November 1994 and  June 1995 trade deals with
Japan did little to open Japan's market  to U.S. goods; instead they damaged
U.S.-Japan military alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S.-Japan security alliance remains the key to peace  and prosperity in
Asia. Relations with Japan must be managed  with this fact in mind. This is a
realization Bill Clinton came to  only belatedly. In 1995, the Pentagon, under
the leadership of  Assistant Secretary Joseph Nye, undertook a major initiative
aimed  at strengthening the alliance; at the same time, the Clinton trade  team
backed off from its confrontational approach. Managed trade is  not the answer
to the trade deficit with Japan; it only reinforces  the clout of bureaucratic
elements hostile to free trade. A far  better approach, Clinton's critics
maintain, is for the U.S. to  support forces inside Japan advocating
deregulation and the further  opening of Japan's market. These are America's
allies inside Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On trade in Asia, the issue is whether the U.S. will or will not  take the
lead in opening up Asian markets to U.S. goods and  services. Bill Clinton
claims to support trade liberalization in Asia, but  he leaves the heavy lifting
to others. In 1994, the President agreed  to work with leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum to create an Asia-Pacific
free-trade area by the  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  2020. But at an APEC meeting in
Tokyo last year, he not  only failed to show up; he also left the U.S.
delegation without  authority to make substantial commitments on his behalf.
Critics  believe the President's commitment to APEC and free trade in Asia  is
lukewarm and largely rhetorical. To advance free trade and  American prosperity,
they believe, the President should ask Congress  for &quot;fast-track&quot;
authority to negotiate free-trade agreements in  Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major issue in Southeast Asia is how to respond to rising  instability
in Cambodia, where Bill Clinton has failed to use the  leverage provided by U.S.
economic assistance to advance  American interests. Indifferent to Washington's
diplomatic protests, the  government of Cambodia has proceeded to ban political 
opposition parties, attack press freedoms, and even assassinate  journalists.
Critics of the President argue that the U.S. should not tolerate  such assaults
on the democratically elected government in  Cambodia and that future U.S.
economic assistance must depend  on Cambodia's respect for democratic freedoms
and human rights.

1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The most immediate threat to U.S. security interests comes 
from North Korea's enduring hostility toward South Korea, a U.S.  ally. During
the 1970s and 1980s, North Korea pursued a nuclear  weapons development program,
now frozen under the 1994  Framework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea.
North  Korea's graphite-moderated reactors have produced between 7 and 22 
kilograms of plutonium, enough for from 2 to 6 nuclear devices.  In addition,
North Korea has an active missile development  program; its Soviet-made <I>SCUD
</I>ballistic missiles are capable of  reaching Seoul, the capital of the
Republic of Korea, and even  threatening U.S. forces stationed in Japan. And its
million-man  conventional army remains deployed within 26 miles of Seoul. South 
Korean active-duty forces number approximately 650,000; U.S. forces  in the
Republic of Korea number approximately 37,000, forward  deployed mostly along
the 38th parallel.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      A second major threat to U.S. security interests arises  from
China's aggressive behavior. In February 1995, the Chinese  navy occupied
Mischief Reef, an atoll in the South China Sea  well within the Philippines'
Exclusive Economic Zone, which is  internationally recognized by the Law of the
Sea Convention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Against the Republic of China on Taiwan, Beijing has conducted
 a campaign of military intimidation in response to the visit to  the United
States of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. This  campaign was highlighted by
Beijing's testing of nuclear-capable  intermediate range ballistic missiles 100
miles north of Taiwan.  Six test firings of these missiles took place on July
21-26 1995.  On 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  March 8, 1995, China fired three
test M-9 missiles into two  zones astride Taiwan's largest ports and near
international sea and  air lanes. The M-9 missile can carry conventional,
chemical,  or nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In l978, the U.S. diplomatically recognized the People's 
Republic of China as the sole government of China. However, the U.S.  has
maintained unofficial relations with the Republic of China on  Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA  has allowed the U.S. to maintain
commercial, educational,  cultural, and defense  but not diplomatic  relations
with Taiwan.  The U.S. acknowledges that Beijing claims a &quot;One-China 
policy,&quot; which the PRC interprets as including sovereignty over  Taiwan,
but the U.S. does not officially recognize the legitimacy of  this claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan held its first democratic 
presidential elections on March 23, 1996. President Lee Teng-hui  was elected in
an overwhelming victory, despite weeks of  Chinese threats and saber-rattling.
This was the first democratic election  of a leader in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan, like the PRC, has made clear 
its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This body was set
up in 1995 under the auspices of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. Thus far, however,  neither the ROC nor the PRC has met the requirements
for WTO  membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's largest overseas market, importing more 
goods and services from the U.S. than the United Kingdom and  Germany 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  combined. Japan imported some $70
billion in goods and  services from the U.S. in 1994, supporting 1.4 million
American jobs.  Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan is made up of 
manufactured goods, which support 840,000 American jobs. Japan is  America's
largest overseas market for agricultural products.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In 1989, with strong support from the United States, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) was established  to promote trade
liberalization in the region. Five years later,  at Bogor, Indonesia, the
leaders of the region's economies  pledged themselves to create a free-trade
area in Asia by 2020.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      United States security strategy toward the Asia-Pacific
region  is based on a network of bilateral alliances with Japan, the  Republic
of Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines. America's  military forces
in Japan and the Republic of Korea are committed  to the defense of U.S. allies
and to the protection of American  interests in the region.1  U.S. forces in
Okinawa also are an  integral part of this commitment. Japan provides some $4
billion in  host nation support for U.S. forces and another $1 billion in a 
facilities improvement program. ROK cost-sharing is $330 million for  1996 and
will increase to $400 million by 1998.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORDA">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in Asia is one of  confusion and failed
leadership. In a startling admission, Clinton's own  Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston  Lord, in 1994 said that the
Administration's Asia policies have  produced an &quot;emerging malaise&quot; 
an environment in which &quot;Asian  and others view us as placating domestic
special interest groups  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  criticize us for tactics that
destabilize relationships which are  central to the region's peace and 
prosperity.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt17.htm#1">1</A>  Unfortunately,
the mid-course corrections which Lord called for have not been  made. As a
result, the danger of lost influence has only increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Risking Alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The Clinton
Administration's Japan policy, focused initially on  efforts to manage trade,
has been acrimonious and counterproductive.  In 1993-1995 talks with the
Japanese, the Clinton trade team  demanded that the Japanese government accept
numerical targets  or indicators to ensure that the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan would  be reduced. While taking constructive steps toward deregulation, 
the Japanese government successfully resisted the U.S. demand  for enforceable
targets. After denying that its confrontational  trade policies were harming the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the  Administration, led by the Pentagon, in 1995 belatedly
engaged in a damage  limitation effort to reaffirm the alliance. Known as the
Nye  Initiative, after then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, this 
undertaking publicly highlighted the importance of the security  relationship
with Japan. But U.S. relations with Japan received  another blow in late 1995
when, citing domestic priorities during the  November budget negotiations with
Congress, the President  canceled a scheduled trip to Tokyo which was supposed
to be the  centerpiece of this campaign to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan  alliance.
Clinton's Asian advisors had warned that shunning the  Japanese would amount to
&quot;a body-blow&quot; to the alliance. To patch up  relations, Clinton
scheduled a summit with the Japanese in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another key relationship in Asia has been weakened by  the President's
policies toward the Republic of Korea. A  democracy and free-market economy,
South Korea is a military ally of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  United States. This alliance is
aimed at Communist North  Korea, which remains focused on uniting the Korean
peninsula under  its leadership. In addition to the threat of its million-man
army,  North Korea has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. The Clinton Administration struck a  diplomatic bargain
with North Korea in October 1994 to freeze  its nuclear program in exchange for
internationally financed and  constructed light water reactors. Thus was born
the U.S.-North  Korean Agreed Framework, which permits North Korea to put off
for  at least five years international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
These inspections are required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty  of 1968, to
which North Korea is a signatory. So far, North Korea  has honored its
commitments in the Framework Agreement and  maintained the freeze on its
reactors, but it remains to be seen  whether it will do so in the future. And
the fact remains that North  Korea was able to extract concessions from the U.S.
in exchange for  doing what it already was obligated to do under international
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest casualty of the Framework Agreement  has been the trust
and confidence of America's South Korean allies.  In reaching its nuclear
bargain with North Korea, the Clinton  Administration marginalized the input and
role of South Korea in the  negotiations. Indicative of the Clinton
Administration's  diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula, recent opinion polls by
the  United States Information Agency show South Korean support  for America's
military presence in the ROK at 72 percent, down  10 percent from 1994. In
addition, overall opinion of the U.S. is  down and, for the first time in 12
years, more unfavorable (53  percent) than favorable (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the record shows, America's Asian alliances, which are key  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  protecting commerce and U.S.
security interests, have been  weakened by feckless and myopic Administration
leadership. No  one can say whether such damage is permanent, but four more
years  of these policies could set the stage for a general retreat of U.S. 
influence and power from Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Misguided China Policy. </B>After campaigning in 1992  to link
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China to  its human rights record,
President Clinton reversed himself in  1994 and, two months after the Chinese
leadership had publicly  humiliated the Secretary of State during his March
visit to  Beijing, dropped its human rights demands and supported MFN for 
China. This was the correct decision, but the Administration's  ill-conceived
linkage strategy forced it into a series of policy retreats  and flip-flops
which have undermined U.S. credibility throughout  the region.<A
HREF="ftnt17.htm#2">2</A>  More and more, America's word in
Asia has come  to matter less and less.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the best example was the Administration's mishandling  of ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in  June 1995. At first, the
Clinton Administration caved in to  Beijing's protests and resisted granting a
visa so that Taiwan's President  Lee could pay an unofficial visit to his alma
mater, Cornell  University. Agreeing with Beijing, the Administration argued
that granting  a visa would violate its &quot;One-China&quot; policy. However,
in  response to nearly unanimous congressional condemnation of its  decision,
the Administration relented and permitted President Lee to make  a private visit
to Cornell last June. While the decision to let  President Lee visit the U.S.
was the right one, it should have been  made at the beginning. The ROC should
have been spared this  painful ordeal that angered all involved and undermined
U.S. credibility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In yet another misstep, the Clinton Administration in  February 1995
mishandled the Chinese navy's occupation of Mischief  Reef in the South China
Sea. Mischief Reef is a small atoll well  within the Philippines' 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, but it is in  an area also claimed by China, Taiwan,
and Vietnam. It took  the Clinton Administration three months to respond to this
breach  of international law, and even then it could muster only a mild 
diplomatic protest. In addition to the Mischief Reef episode, China  decided to
express disapproval of U.S. support for President  Lee's visit by conducting
large-scale military maneuvers, including  the firing of nuclear-capable
missiles, in the vicinity of Taiwan.  Only after the Chinese launched these
missiles near two Taiwanese  ports on March 8, 1995, did the Clinton
Administration belatedly  take action, dispatching two aircraft carriers to the
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The President's ineffectual and delayed reactions have  cost America much
in lost prestige and credibility in Asia. The  ROC feels more threatened, the
PRC more emboldened, and the  entire region of Asia more uncertain, not only
about China's  intentions, but also about America's credibility and staying
power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Half-Hearted Support for Asia-Pacific Free Trade. The  Clinton
Administration's record on advancing U.S. trade interests in  Asia is mixed. In
1994, the President joined other leaders of the  Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in declaring his  support for the idea of a free-trade
and investment area in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. This is a
worthy goal, but then  the President failed to attend the 1995 APEC meeting in
Tokyo,  which focused on developing a blueprint for implementing the 1994 
declaration. In addition, the U.S. delegation came without the  fast-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  track negotiating authority
needed for the U.S. to move  ahead more quickly with a free-trade agenda, and
U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor threw roadblocks in the way of gaining 
fast-track authority from Congress. Kantor, for example, refused  to compromise
when Congress opposed environmental and labor  provisions that the President
wanted included in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Failure to Defend the U.S. Investment in Cambodian  Democracy. The U.S. is
in danger of losing its $500 million investment in  the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. In  May 1993, the Cambodian people voted
freely for a government to  be led by non-communist political parties. However,
the  communist Cambodian People's Party (CCP), installed by Vietnam in  1979,
bullied its way into a coalition with the non-communists.  While claiming
Cambodia as one of its supposed diplomatic success  stories, the Clinton
Administration has failed to censure the  government of Cambodia as it has
proceeded to attack press  freedoms, assassinate journalists, and ban opposition
political parties.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in Asia, the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain strong alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea,

five decades, economic growth and prosperity across the  Pacific have been based
on the security provided by the United  States. Even today, the Cold War's
bilateral alliance structure remains  the firm foundation of regional stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Better define U.S. interests and priorities with respect to 
China.</B> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  These are: 1) a peaceful
resolution of issues outstanding  between Beijing and the Republic of China on
Taiwan; 2) non-use of  force by China in the South China Sea; 3) stopping the
proliferation  of missiles and missile technology into the Persian Gulf and 
South Asia; and 4) respect for human rights by China. America  should assume
neither China's friendship nor its hostility. By  sustaining Asian alliances,
clearly defining interests and priorities  toward China, and measuring China's
actions against them, America  can judge the nature of Beijing's intentions and
adopt appropriate  policies. Once these policies are adopted, Washington needs
to stick  to them and not, as the Clinton Administration has done,  abandon them
under pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Insist that China uphold international standards and &quot;rules
of  the road.&quot;</B>  China's willingness to observe international &quot;rules
of  the road&quot; with respect to non-proliferation, the protection of 
intellectual property, and human rights should be used as a benchmark  to
measure China's conduct as a responsible international  power. China should be
told that the degree to which it will be  respected and integrated into the
international economic and political  community depends on how well it abides by
international rules  and standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Support the Republic of China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization.</B> Should the Republic of China meet the criteria for  admission
to the WTO, it should permitted to join. Taiwan's joining  the WTO should not be
held hostage to Beijing's insistence that  the People's Republic of China be
admitted first. This would be  unfair to Taiwan, which is not only one of the
world's most  vibrant economies, but also a democracy.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Closely monitor implementation of the U.S.-North Korea  Agreed
Framework.</B> North Korea must not be allowed to avoid  compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Framework agreement.  In particular, it must
continue the freeze on its nuclear  program. Should the North restart its
plutonium-producing reactors or fail  to allow inspections of the facilities
agreed to under the terms of  the Framework, the U.S. should build an
international coalition to  support sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand opportunities for greater American trade with Asia.</B> 
The United States should explore with Australia, New Zealand,  Chile, and
Singapore the possibility of their accession to the  North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). Similarly,  America should offer to negotiate a merger
between NAFTA and other  existing free-trade agreements, including the
Australia-New  Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) and the  ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Explore with allies and friends in Asia the construction of an 
integrated anti-missile defense system. North Korea's missile  program threatens
South Korea and Japan, while China's tactical and  strategic missile arsenal is
a threat to the security of the entire  Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. should
equip its own ground and  naval forces with missile defense systems and then
offer to sell  those systems to key allies and friends. Missile defense should
be a  key mission for U.S. forces in Asia in the next decade.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restructure America's approach to U.S.-Japan trade issues.</B> 
The Clinton Administration's approach to trade with Japan is based  on using
external pressure to force internal change. This  approach was confrontational
from the outset, and it has not worked.  More
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  over, it has damaged the U.S.
military alliance with Japan. A  more effective approach would be to recognize
that change in Japan  is internally driven, and align U.S. trade and economic 
objectives with reformers inside Japan who advocate deregulation and a  further
opening of Japanese markets. For example, the U.S.  should propose a
deregulation summit to Japan, aimed at producing  commitments to an action plan.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&AA">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States still need to maintain a large  military
presence in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The end of the Cold War has not ended threats to peace in  Asia.
North Korea's large conventional military force and its  nuclear program pose a
direct threat to South Korea and Japan, both  of which are U.S. allies. China's
rapid military buildup and its  willingness to use force to pursue territorial
claims in the South  China Sea and against Taiwan also are cause for concern. 
America's military presence in Asia has been reduced significantly  since 1990,
but it remains large enough at its current 100,000-man  level to deter possible
threats. American forces in Japan and South  Korea receive significant financial
support from their host  countries. By helping to preserve peace, the U.S. is
helping Asians  and Americans alike to become more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States need to press for freer trade  in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> By pressing to reduce trade barriers, both within Asia and 
between the United States and Asia, Americans will benefit from  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  jobs created by economic growth.
More U.S. exports mean  more American jobs. In 1994, U.S. exports to Asia grew
at a rate of  16 percent, totaling over $153 billion. In that same year, more
than  3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.  Of these 3
million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in  1994 alone. In addition,
greater prosperity in Asia reinforces  regional stability and strengthens the
democratic political evolution  underway in countries like Taiwan, South Korea,
and the  Philippines. Democracy and stability reduce the risk of armed conflict 
between states.

<P><A NAME="ISSUESR"><b>THE ISSUES</b>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The future of U.S.-Russian relations is uncertain. Much  depends on the
outcome of the presidential elections in Russia,  currently scheduled for the
summer of 1996. Among candidates for  the Duma (the lower house of the Russian
parliament) in the  December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their
allies  captured over 50 percent of the popular vote. President Boris  Yeltsin,
who declared his candidacy for the presidency in February 1996,  is trailing the
pack of presidential candidates. The most popular  candidate is Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the unreformed  Communist Party. Another dangerous contender
is Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  an anti-American ultra-nationalist. Victory for either
Zyuganov  or Zhirinovsky would seriously endanger Russia's young  democracy and
market reforms. A communist or extreme nationalist at  the helm could well put
the world's second-largest nuclear power on  a collision course with the United
States in Central Europe or  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  Middle East.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Yeltsin's own prospects look grim. His health is  failing, and
Russia's internal economic and political crisis continues  unabated. The war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya  and Russia's economic difficulties have
eroded the popularity  of Yeltsin's administration to the point where polls show
 approval ratings at around 10 percent to 15 percent. Moscow is awash  in rumors
of coups and falsified presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No one knows who will rule in Moscow by the end of 1996,  but the period of
romantic partnership with the U.S. and the West  is over. Russia is striking out
on its own, taking a path that  already has led to confrontation with the West.
In fact, Russia is in  the midst of a political turbulence fraught with dangers
for the  West, and the chances are good that the next American President  will
have to deal with a new and very different set of players in  Moscow.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major point of disagreement between President Clinton and  his U.S.
critics concerns the U.S. support for President Yeltsin.  Critics charge that
the Clinton Administration's continued  unquestioning support for Boris Yeltsin
makes less and less sense. According  to critics, Yeltsin today is presiding
over the return of the  hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power.
He has lost  the support of the Russian reformers and is pursuing an 
increasingly confrontational foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Anti-Western sentiments are growing in Russia. Moscow is  attempting to
re-establish its influence in neighboring regions  that once were part of the
Soviet Union. The Kremlin is  employing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  economic, diplomatic, and
military means to achieve a sphere  of economic and military influence in what
Moscow calls its  &quot;near abroad&quot;  the Baltic States, Ukraine, and the
non-Russian states  in Central Asia and the Caucasus that used to be part of the
 Soviet Union but became independent when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's critics believe that preventing the  emergence of a
Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union  should be a top Western
priority, both to help assure the development  and survival of Russian democracy
and to safeguard vital Western  interests. Moreover, an anti-Western policy
could lead Russia  to forge alliances with anti-Western forces in Iran, Iraq,
China,  and Libya. Yet, critics allege, the Clinton Administration has given 
the Russians a free ride in the &quot;near abroad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics of the Clinton Administration also claim that the U.S.  has turned a
blind eye to the atrocities in Chechnya. The President  and his aides have bent
over backwards not to offend President  Yeltsin as he has crushed the rebellion,
which so far has resulted in  over 30,000 deaths and more than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A critical concern is the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to  Iran. The
Islamic regime in Tehran has launched a bid to  acquire nuclear weapons. It is
buying two Russian-made nuclear  reactors capable of producing plutonium that
can be enriched to  become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. The
Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself does not support this sale, 
believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security.  Nevertheless,
the sale goes on, primarily because of pressure from the  powerful Russian
Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom) headed  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Victor Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is aid to Russia and the NIS  countries. Aid to
Russia has attracted bipartisan support, but this may  be weakening as Russia
becomes more anti-Western and  expansionist. The Bush and Clinton
Administrations have provided over  $4 billion in aid to Russia since 1992.
Combined aid monies  and loans to the former Soviet Union and Russia for 
1985-1995 amounted to over $100 billion. The results of these aid  programs have
been mixed; critics argue that U.S. aid programs often  disregard Russia's real
needs and are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also dividing President Clinton and his critics is NATO  expansion. The 1994
Contract With America stipulated that NATO  enlargement (to include Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech  Republic) should be a top national priority. However,
the Clinton  Administration has put NATO expansion on the back burner, both to 
secure Moscow's cooperation in peacekeeping in Bosnia and to  appease Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics charge also that the President is appeasing Yeltsin on  missile
defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans  the deployment of a
missile defense system from the U.S. The  Clinton Administration opposes
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and  wants to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty
to limit even shorter  range (tactical) missiles  something which it was not
originally  intended to do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another point of contention concerns conventional arms  control. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty places limits  on the numbers of
conventional weapons (such as tanks and  cannon) 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  in Europe and Russia. It was
signed with the now-defunct  U.S.S.R. in 1990 after more than two decades of
negotiations. Critics  became worried when Clinton agreed to a unilateral
revision of  the treaty that permitted the Russians to exceed agreed limits on 
conventional weapons in Russia's northern and southern states.  Beefing up the
numbers of tanks and cannon on the borders of  Russia's neighbors, be it the
Baltic States or nations in the Caucasus,  raises questions about Moscow's
long-term intentions. Moreover,  critics point out that Russia is already far
behind on meeting the  weapons system destruction targets stipulated by the CFE
agreement.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has made relations with Boris Yeltsin too  personal. As
Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the  flames 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  of Russian resentment toward the
U.S. with his unequivocal  support of the Russian president, especially after
the dramatic  shooting at the parliament building in October 1993 and the 
beginning of the Chechen war. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived  by many in
the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically  supportive of
Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has  endangered the ability of
the U.S. to maintain a relationship  with segments of Russian society that
oppose President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration paid lip service to the idea of  enlarging NATO
to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. However, it has done very
little to make this happen. Critics  accuse the Administration of promising not
to expand NATO  in 1996 in exchange for Russia's cooperation on peacekeeping  in
Bosnia. Republican Members of Congress, who included  NATO expansion in their
Contract With America, generally are more  supportive of a rapid expansion of
NATO than the Clinton  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to  recognize the
importance of countries other than Russia. For example,  without Ukraine, the
Russian empire cannot be recreated and will  have only limited access to the
heart of Europe. Azerbaijan  controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia
is situated in a  strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. Nevertheless,
the  Clinton Administration has neglected these countries, promoting a  &quot;Russia-first&quot;
policy and recognizing Moscow's domination of  the &quot;near abroad.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has failed to prevent the sale  of nuclear
reactors to Iran, despite America's share in the  massive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  financial aid provided to Moscow
by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral
financial  institutions. The reactors are a vital component of the Iranian bid
to  acquire &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. assistance to the reform efforts in Russia and other  former Soviet
states has been poorly executed. Much of the $4.1 billion  in U.S. assistance
allocated to date has been wasted. The Bush  and Clinton Administrations erred
in choosing the U.S. Agency  for International Development as the main
implementing agency  for assistance. AID has its expertise in the developing
world, not  in post-communist transitional economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Russia and other New Independent States (NIS) have become  leading exporters
of crime, together with Colombia, Southeast  Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
others. Law and order in Russia have  collapsed, organized crime is merging with
legal government  structures, and it is difficult to say where the mafiosi end
and the  government begins. Many Russian and Eurasian criminal  organizations
operate internationally, including in the United States  and Western Europe.
Russian organized criminals and corrupt  officials have access to weapons and
technology of mass destruction,  including uranium, chemical and biological
weapons, and the  raw materials and components for their manufacture, as well as
 scientists with specific weapons-related expertise. Despite all of  this
evidence, the Clinton Administration has continued to hail the  success of
economic reforms in Russia, failing to raise the crime  and corruption issue in
bilateral talks with the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration championed the START II  nuclear arms reduction
treaty with Russia. The main obstacles to  START 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  II ratification are not in
Washington (the U.S. Senate ratified  the treaty on January 26, 1996) but in
Moscow, where a majority  of deputies in the newly elected Duma probably will
refuse to  ratify it. Objections have been raised based on America's presumed 
intention to build a missile defense, but the real reason for the  Russian
intransigence lies elsewhere: The Russian military  establishment wants to keep
large, land-based multiple-warhead  missiles, such as the SS-18, SS-19, and
especially the mobile SS-24.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weakest part of Clinton's arms control record concerns  the ABM Treaty.
Russia today claims to be the heir to the  now-defunct Soviet Union, and is
demanding that the U.S. abide by  the 1972 ABM treaty. The Administration not
only wants to abide  by the treaty, it wants to expand its scope. U.S.
negotiators  reportedly have accepted a Russian demand to limit the performance
of  the most promising U.S. short-range missile defenses. And  President Clinton
vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because  of its missile defense
provisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in conventional arms  control with the
Russians has not been much better. The  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty places limits on the numbers of  conventional weapons, such as tanks and
cannon, permitted in the  European theaters of operation. It was signed with the
U.S.S.R.  in 1990, and the U.S. agreed in 1995 to allow Russia to exceed  the
limits imposed by the CFE on weapons stationed on its  northern and southern
flanks. Russia's neighbors in the Baltic region or  the Caucasus are now more
insecure as the number of weapons  and tanks on the Russian border continue to
grow. This is  especially worrisome because of all the rhetoric in Moscow about 
restoring the Soviet Union. Moreover, Russia is far behind in meeting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  weapons system destruction
targets stipulated by the CFE.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To promote democracy and U.S. interests in Russia, the  U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Develop a Russian policy based on support for ideas
and  interests, not individual politicians.</B>  The U.S. should support
democracy  and free markets in Russia, as well as political forces advocating 
these ideas, not controversial individual politicians like Boris  Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure  in bringing
about the collapse of Soviet communism. Today,  however, today some of his
policies and his personal style are  extremely controversial, and his popularity
is plummeting.  Moreover, there are other reform-oriented politicians in Russia 
with whom a dialogue should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Advocate broad-based cooperation with Russia and
other  NIS members to ensure their integration into global markets and  the
democratic community of nations.</B> The U.S. should continue  selective and
targeted technical assistance programs and provide  support to pro-democracy
forces and nascent market institutions in  the NIS. The U.S. must design and
implement trade, investment,  and assistance programs for Russia and the NIS
that reduce  inflation, lower market barriers, and stimulate growth. Thriving
Russian  and Eurasian markets would create jobs and export opportunities  for
American businesses. U.S. assistance programs should be  taken away from AID and
given to an independent board  of policymakers, area specialists, and business
representatives.  Such a board can be appointed jointly by the President and
Congress.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's interference in the affairs of its
neighbors.  The survival, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all NIS 
countries are important to future peace and prosperity in Eurasia.</B> The  U.S.
should support the independence of Ukraine, Azerbaijan,  Georgia, and the
Central Asian states, many of which are being drawn  unwillingly back into the
Russian orbit. Washington should  intensify its ties with Ukraine, the Baltic
States, and countries in  the Caucasus and Central Asia. The West should assist
them in  developing foreign and domestic policy decisionmaking bodies  and
mechanisms, training their bureaucracies, and increasing  security cooperation.
Technical assistance in privatization of industry  and agriculture also should
be provided.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's brutality in Chechnya.</B> The U.S.
should  make clear to Moscow that the use of force against other states or 
areas of the former Soviet Union could trigger U.S. retaliation  against Russian
economic and political interests. While the U.S.  should support the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation, the  West should oppose the brutal methods
of the Russian military in  handling internal dissent, such as those used in
Chechnya. The  Clinton Administration should stop issuing declarations of
support  for Russia's actions in Chechnya and instead support OSCE efforts  to
resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully. The OSCE should  undertake a high-profile
mission to Chechnya and Russia. If Russia is to  integrate into the world
community, it must abide by its rules of  conduct, including international law
and custom. Washington  should clarify to Russia that aggressive military action
against her  neighbors could result in international isolation and possible 
economic sanctions. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Not allow Moscow to veto the opening of NATO to new 
members.</B> The U.S. should maintain a constant dialogue with Russia  on NATO
expansion, pointing out possibilities for  Russian-NATO cooperation and
stressing that NATO is not a threat to  Russian security. While NATO enlargement
will occur, Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program should
be expanded  simultaneously as appropriate to assuage Russian concerns. But 
under no circumstances should Moscow be allowed to prevent  sovereign countries
in East and Central Europe from joining the  NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Oppose Russia's policies of nuclear proliferation.</B>
The U.S.  should take every step to prevent Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states 
from gaining nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. For  example, voluntary
export controls similar to those developed by the  Coordination Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) regime during the Cold War could be
imposed on technology  sales to these countries. Pressure should be applied
against the arming  of rogue states, up to and including the imposition of
selective  economic sanctions. At the same time, Russia should be  encouraged to
pursue other less threatening commercial ventures, such as  commercial space
launches. These could bring about a voluntary  cancellation of the reactor deal.
The U.S. also should cooperate  with pro-Western circles in Turkey and
Azerbaijan to promote  democracy and oppose radical Islam in Eurasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assist Russia and other NIS countries in fighting organized  crime
and corruption. The U.S. could do this by helping the  Russians devise
comprehensive criminal and criminal procedure  codes.</B> Some of the leftover
Soviet laws in Russia make it difficult to  fight organized crime; for example,
there is no adequate law against  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  conspiracy to commit a crime. In
addition, U.S. law  enforcement agencies should cooperate with trustworthy and
reliable law  enforcement personnel in the East. In particular, they can assist 
in developing a witness relocation program. They should strive  to track and
penetrate Russian and NIS criminal rings dealing  in weapons of mass destruction
and narcotics. Finally, American  law enforcement agencies should monitor
East-West financial  transactions more closely. Deposits that originate in the
NIS should  be carefully screened and the legitimacy of earnings established.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Reject Russian demands for broadening the ABM
Treaty.</B> The  U.S. needs to be defended against missile launches by rogue
states  and terrorists and against accidental launches. The Clinton 
Administration and the Russians are attempting to extend the life of the  ABM
Treaty by designating Russia and other states as successors to  the Soviet Union
under the treaty and broadening its scope to  cover theater missile defense
systems. Ballistic missile defense is a  vital goal for the U.S. These moves by
Clinton and the Russians  therefore should be resisted firmly. The ABM Treaty
needs to be  eliminated, not extended or broadened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&AR">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should we provide aid to Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The window of opportunity for the West in Russia may be  closing.
While there is still time, we should provide aid that  strengthens free markets
and free minds. Communism worked to  destroy both of these for 70 years. Many
Russians still want to learn  about democracy and capitalism, and we should
provide them with  a fighting chance before it is too late. However, we must
ensure  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  the aid is used wisely. Aid to
Russia needs to be customized  for Russian conditions. If a hard-line government
were to take over  in Russia, making U.S. aid meaningless or worse, we probably 
would have to cut off all aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What do we do if hard-liners take Yeltsin's place?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should act now to strengthen relations with all countries  in
the region, which will be threatened even more than the West  if hard-liners
come to power in Moscow. We should expand  NATO to include Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and  perhaps Slovakia, and should prevent any U.S. or
international  assistance to Moscow if an aggressive, anti-American, or
anti-Western  government emerges. Even under these severe circumstances, 
however, the U.S. should maintain a dialogue with Moscow,  clarifying what price
Russia may pay if &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed. Eventually,  if the need
arises, we may need to plan for military  contingencies and even to contain
Russia if it becomes aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't NATO expansion endanger Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. NATO enlargement is aimed at creating a zone of  stability
and security in Eastern and Central Europe. Opening NATO  to new members 
something which has happened repeatedly in  the past  will hasten the
integration of the Czech Republic,  Poland, Hungary, and other new members into
the West. NATO is a  defensive alliance, and its posture in Central Europe
should remain  defensive.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why shouldn't we be more cooperative with Russia?  After  all, the
Cold War is over. Russia is a democracy and a great  power. Why shouldn't we
allow Moscow a greater role in policing  unstable regions, such as the Caucasus
or Central Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We can cooperate with reformers in Russia who are  interested in
building a market economy and democracy. It will take  time, however, to assess
whether democracy has taken root in  Russia. Russia will always have a
considerable role in the region  because of its sheer size and economic,
political, and cultural weight,  but there are forces in Russia that dream of
re-establishing the  Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. These anti-Western and 
anti-American forces desire to expand Russia's power and influence to  compete
with the West, not cooperate with it. We should  oppose Russia's heavy-handed
interference in the affairs of its  neighbors and attempts to violate their
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In view of Chechnya, what should the U.S. do to prevent  Russia from
invading its neighbors?  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should enhance our relations with Ukraine, the  Baltic States,
and countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. There  are as many people in
these countries as there are in Russia.  We should draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot;
and stick to them. For example,  we should warn Moscow that we will block all
IMF and World  Bank assistance if an NIS country is invaded, and that the U.S.
will  lead the international diplomatic campaign to restore the  independence of
a violated country. If Russia crosses these lines, we should  consider imposing
both restrictions on exchanges and economic  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  trade sanctions against Russia.
We also should demand from  Moscow that the war in Chechnya stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are democracy and reform the causes of crime in Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is widespread crime and corruption in Russia, and  some
Russians mistakenly think that the cause of crime is  free-market capitalism.
Crime is rampant, of course, but because there is  no rule of law in Russia.
Moreover, real democracy barely exists,  and the country still has a long way to
go before a free-market  system is fully established. Free markets mean the rule
of law, not the  rule of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is Russian organized crime a threat to U.S. and Western  security?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, because Russian criminals are very sophisticated, 
well-educated, and well-connected worldwide. They often boast  advanced college
degrees, as well as KGB and special forces  training. There is great potential
danger in the merger of former  communist, KGB, and criminal elements in Russia
and the NIS,  and the threat from the possible access of organized criminals to 
weapons of mass destruction is particularly acute.

<a href="israel.gif">Map 5</a>: Israel and Syria: At Odds Over the Golan Heights<P>
<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESP">THE ISSUES</A></B>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf is the strategic storehouse of roughly 55  percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.S. cannot allow hostile  powers such as Iran or Iraq
to gain hegemony over Persian Gulf oil  supplies. This would allow them to gain
an economic stranglehold  on oil-importing states and could fuel a military
buildup that  includes weapons of mass destruction. The issue is how best to
contain  Iran and Iraq. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator  Alfonse
D'Amato (R-NY) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  (R-GA), have pushed for a
hard-line policy of aggressive  containment of Iran and the stiffening of
economic sanctions against it, but  the Administration has dragged its feet. On
Iraq, the  Administration came to office prepared to improve relations with
Baghdad if  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein behaved himself, but Saddam's 
repeated provocations have convinced the Administration that the U.S.  must
contain Iraq vigilantly and firmly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the many cleavages that  threaten the
stability of the region, has been muted substantially but  still poses a threat
to the security of Israel and moderate  pro-Western Arab regimes. A renewal of
this conflict also could help fan  the flames of Islamic radicalism and lead to
an upsurge in  international terrorism. The issue is how to help advance 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Clinton Administration has pushed for  a
peace treaty between Israel and Syria. It has offered to  deploy American
peacekeeping forces on the Golan Heights, following  an Israeli military
withdrawal from that strategic border area,  to monitor compliance with a
possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.  A growing chorus of conservatives
questions the wisdom of an  open-ended U.S. peacekeeping commitment on the Golan
Heights  which could divert U.S. military forces from other missions, erode 
military readiness, and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist attacks  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  Middle Eastern terrorist groups
opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third issue is how to help contain the rising tide of Islamic  radicalism
that threatens to sweep away the Algerian military  regime and undermine
pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Jordan,  Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey.
Islamic radicals also threaten  U.S. interests by promoting international
terrorism and opposing  the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Clinton
Administration has  established diplomatic contacts with Islamic radicals and
has called  for a political dialogue between them and the states they seek to 
overthrow. Many conservatives oppose such contact because it  undermines secular
Middle Eastern regimes that the radicals seek  to overthrow, makes it easier for
Islamic radicals to seize power,  and would not change their anti-Western
policies if they did come  to power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSP">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains a dangerous, albeit 
weakened, threat to regional stability. The Iraqi army remains the  strongest
regional military force in the Persian Gulf region, and  Iraq continues its
efforts to build weapons of mass destruction, such  as chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein  will remain a threat to Western interests in
the Persian Gulf as long  as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran looms large as the principal long-term threat to U.S. 
interests in the Persian Gulf. It has launched a massive military buildup  and
continues to support terrorism against its neighbors and  Western countries,
including the U.S. It also has sought to intimidate  the Arab emirates across
the Persian Gulf by rattling its saber. In  1992 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  Iran seized three disputed
islands at the mouth of the Persian  Gulf and fortified them with 8,000 troops,
chemical weapons,  anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran, like Iraq, has launched a clandestine program to build 
nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian nuclear power program.  Russia,
China, and Pakistan have provided technology, equipment,  or training that could
help advance Iran's nuclear weapons  program. Western companies, including many
from Germany, have  sold Iran dual-use (civilian/military) technologies that
could aid  its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>    The Arab-Israeli peace negotiations achieved the October  1994
Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, but Syrian-Israeli negotiations  have been
deadlocked by Syrian intransigence. The  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have
lurched along through two interim  self-rule agreements that have led to an
unstable, uneasy peace  continually undermined by persistent terrorism from
Palestinian Islamic  radicals. The most difficult issues  borders, Palestinian 
statehood, security arrangements, Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, 
Palestinian refugees, and water resources  have been relegated to  the final
status talks, set to begin in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Islamic radicals form a tiny majority of the world's more than
 900 million Muslims. They pose a threat primarily to secular  regimes in the
Muslim world, which they have not had a great deal of  success in overthrowing.
But when they seize control of a state,  as they did in Iran in 1979 or Sudan in
1989, their power to  threaten U.S. interests greatly increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. has suffered repeated terrorist attacks from Islamic

<P>The Clinton Administration has done a mediocre job of  consolidating the
benefits of the Bush Administration's Desert Storm  victory and protecting
Western interests in the Persian Gulf against  Iranian and Iraqi aggression. It
has done marginally better at assisting  in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations but
also has offered to  commit American peacekeeping forces to a risky open-ended 
deployment on the Golan Heights if Israel signs a peace treaty with Syria.  The
Administration has fared worst of all in its policy toward  Islamic radicals.
For example, the Clinton Administration's May  1993 &quot;Dual Containment&quot;
policy, which calls for the simultaneous  containment and isolation of Iraq and
Iran, takes a passive approach  to containing these two countries unless prodded
by Iraqi  provocations or concerned members of the U.S. Congress. Another 
example: Clinton in June 1993 ordered an attack by  Tomahawk cruise missiles
against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's  secret police in retaliation for the
failed April 1993 Iraqi-sponsored  assassination attempt against former
President George Bush in  Kuwait. But this was a mere slap on the wrist in view
of the  grave nature of the terrorist attack against a former American head  of

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on  increasing pressure on
Iran to halt its support of terrorism. Clinton on  April 30, 1995, announced the
signing of an executive order banning  all U.S. trade with Iran, but he did so
in part to prevent the U.S.  Congress from going farther and placing an import
ban on any  foreign company that continued to trade to Iran. The Administration 
feared this would create tensions with U.S. allies in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress has tried to strengthen America's policy toward  Iran. Led by
Senator D'Amato, the Senate passed a bill on December  21 that would punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil  industry. The House is likely to
pass this measure. House  Speaker Gingrich also forced the Administration to
toughen its policy  on Iran by insisting that the intelligence authorization
bill include  $18 million to support covert actions against the Iranian 
government by Iranian opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the Clinton Administration's policies toward Iraq and Iran  have been
unsuccessful, its role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations has been
overrated. President Clinton hosted  Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremonies at
the White House in September 1993  and September 1995, but the interim
Palestinian self-rule  agreements signed at those two ceremonies came about
through bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, not through U.S. diplomatic
 efforts. In October 1993, the Administration pledged to provide $500  million
in foreign aid to the Palestinians over five years. In 1994  Congress passed the
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act requiring  the State Department to certify
each year that the Palestine  Liberation Organization had complied with its
commitments under the  treaty 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  before this aid could be
disbursed. Representative  Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House
International  Relations Committee, has denounced the State Department
compliance  reports as a &quot;whitewash.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yielding to pressure from Congress, the President signed into  law a bill
requiring that the U.S. move its embassy in Israel from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, by May 31, 1999. The  legislation contains a provision that
permits the President to delay  the embassy move if he considers it harmful to
U.S. national  security interests. The Clinton Administration had opposed the
bill,  arguing that it would upset the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which 
include conflicting claims to Jerusalem, but the embassy would  be located in
Western Jerusalem, which is not claimed by the PLO.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To facilitate the negotiation of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty,  the Clinton
Administration has offered to dispatch a U.S.  peacekeeping force to the Golan
Heights, strategic territory along the  Syrian-Israeli border which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six Day War  and which Syria demands be returned to its
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has been much more active than  previous
administrations in establishing diplomatic contacts with  Islamic radicals, such
as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in  Algeria. This is dangerous because it
undermines confidence in  secular governments battling Islamic movements,
thereby helping  these movements come to power. The Clinton Administration has 
called for a political dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian  military
regime. It believes that the FIS can halt terrorism and enter  a power-sharing
arrangement with secular Algerian parties,  despite the fact that the FIS is
unable to control the more radical  Armed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Islamic Group which perpetrates
much of the terrorism in  the country and increasingly is eclipsing the FIS.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, 
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain a strong military presence in the Persian Gulf to  deter
Iran and Iraq from aggression and safeguard the free flow of  oil from the gulf
region.</B> Both countries have staged military  maneuvers in recent years to
intimidate their smaller neighbors. The  U.S. needs to maintain strong air and
naval forces in the region, as  well as pre-positioned military supplies that
can be deployed rapidly  by air transport to equip ground troops in a crisis.
Kuwait and  Qatar have agreed to provide facilities for pre-positioned military 
equipment, but the Saudi government has refused American requests  for a similar
arrangement in Saudi Arabia because it fears that  Islamic militants will
denounce such an arrangement as an American  base. Given such local political
sensitivities, the U.S. must seek to  limit the number of military personnel
stationed on the ground in  Saudi Arabia while depending on naval and air units
deployed in the  region to deter aggression from Iraq and Iran and relying on
rapid  air and sea transport to bring ground troops to the region in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq as long  as
Saddam Hussein remains in power, if necessary by vetoing  any move in the
Security Council to lift the sanctions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Tighten economic sanctions against Iran and press the  European
allies and Japan to stop lending money to Iran or renegotiating  its foreign
debt.</B> Iran is having increasing difficulty in financing  its 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  roughly $30 billion foreign debt.
The stagnant Iranian  economy has been plagued by government mismanagement and
by  continued low prices for oil, its principal export. The U.S. ban on  trade
with Iran has cut into Iran's export earnings but has had  limited impact
because Japan and Western European states continue  their policy of &quot;constructive
engagement&quot; with Iran, which amounts  to business as usual. Washington
should press its allies to join  the embargo on trade with Iran and halt their
efforts to help Iran  reschedule its debt until the regime ends its support of
terrorism  and Islamic revolution. Washington should make a point of 
publicizing Iranian involvement in terrorism and subversion to  embarrass
Western leaders that turn a blind eye to Iranian aggression. If  the allies
continue to neglect the Iranian threat, the U.S. should  impose trade sanctions
on Western companies that continue to do  business with Iran. Banning such
companies from selling their goods in  the United States would force them to
choose between the  American market and the smaller Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Pressure Russia, China, and Pakistan to halt their support of 
Iran's nuclear power program, which is being used as cover for  Iran's
clandestine nuclear weapons program.</B> These countries have  signed agreements
to provide nuclear technology, equipment, or  training to Iran. The U.S. should
increase pressure on all three countries  to break off their nuclear cooperation
with Tehran or risk U.S.  economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Take a cautious, go-slow approach to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations.</B> Washington should demand that the PLO comply with  its past
commitments, especially to fight terrorism and revoke  provisions in the
Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call  for the destruction of
Israel. The U.S. should not pressure Israel  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  make any concessions in the final
status talks, which begin in  May 1996, but should allow the two sides to work
out their  differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Withdraw the offer to deploy U.S. peacekeeping forces on  the
Golan Heights. If peacekeeping forces are needed to monitor  a Syrian-Israeli
peace treaty, they can be drawn from other  nations, as is the present United
Nations peacekeeping force on the  Golan Heights.</B> American forces should not
be used because they will  be a lightning rod for terrorist attacks by groups
based in  nearby Lebanon, such as the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah. If the 
forces deployed are too small, they will not significantly reduce the  military
risks that Israel would run in returning the heights to Syria;  if they are
large enough to deter Syrian aggression, they will  divert other U.S. military
units from more important missions and  erode U.S. military readiness by
interfering with combat training  schedules. For a Golan peacekeeping force to
be credible would  require the commitment of a heavy brigade of roughly 5,000
troops.  To maintain a long-term deployment would require the  commitment of
three brigades: one for deployment, one for retraining for  combat missions
after deployment, and one for training and  preparing to deploy. This represents
roughly 10 percent of the U.S.  Army's active duty combat strength, a
prohibitively high burden for  an open-ended peacekeeping commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Break off diplomatic contacts with the FIS and other radical 
Islamic groups.</B> Such contacts undermine the embattled secular  regimes
challenged by these radical groups. The U.S. also  should halt efforts to
pressure the embattled Algerian military regime  into a suicidal power-sharing
arrangement with Islamic radicals.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage free-market economic reforms, including the  development
of a European Union - North African free trade area, to  fuel economic growth in
North Africa and the Middle East.</B>  Economic reforms will create jobs for the
unemployed youth who serve  as the vanguard of Islamic revolutionary movements.
The U.S.  also should encourage the development of secular political parties 
that can give voice to political opposition and preclude Islamic  radicals from
monopolizing the opposition to established regimes.
</P>
<P>In addition, Congress should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Strengthen congressional oversight over the $100 million in 
annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians.</B> Congress should judge for  itself
whether the PLO has lived up to its peace commitments,  including its pledge to
end terrorism. Congress should withhold all U.S.  aid if the PLO fails to
comply.

<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. seek to maintain U.N. economic  sanctions on Iraq
when the Iraqi people, not the regime, appear to be  doing all the suffering?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.N. specifically exempted food and medicine from  its
embargo and gave Iraq the opportunity to export $1.6 billion  worth of oil to
pay for its imports if it did so under U.N.  supervision. Saddam Hussein
rejected this as an infringement of Iraqi  sovereignty and prefers to use the
suffering of his own people to  manipulate international public opinion. The
U.S. cannot afford to  lift the sanctions because Saddam has not complied with
U.N.  resolutions requiring that he provide a full accounting of his  military
buildup, recognize of the border with Kuwait, return Kuwaiti  hos
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  tages and assets, and halt
terrorism against his own people.  Moreover, Saddam remains a threat to the
region. If Iraq is allowed  to resume its oil exports, both Saddam's hold on
power and his  ability to threaten his neighbors will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be the U.S. role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Paradoxically, the U.S. should minimize its role as much  as
possible to encourage the Israelis and Arabs to negotiate with  each other, not
with Washington. Some of the biggest breakthroughs  in the peace negotiations,
such as Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat's 1977 visit to Jerusalem and the 1993
Oslo Accords, came  about without any direct U.S. involvement. Washington should
let  the two sides work out their problems by themselves to the  greatest extent
possible, suggesting ways to break diplomatic  impasses only when both sides
request that it do so. A lasting  Arab-Israeli peace must be negotiated
painstakingly by the parties to the  conflict and should not be imposed by
outside powers. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who has traveled to the
Middle East  17 times, should adjust his priorities and spend more time 
addressing more important issues, such as U.S. policy toward Russia  and China,
which he has visited less frequently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. reject a peacekeeping presence on  the Golan
Heights when it has maintained a similar  peacekeeping force in the Sinai
peninsula since 1982 to monitor compliance  with the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. forces would face a very different political, military,  and

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  terrorist threat environment in
the Golan Heights.  Peacekeepers would be deployed close to large armored
forces, in a  constricted area, and in positions that would become important
military  objectives if fighting erupts. Moreover, Golan peacekeepers could  be
subject to terrorist attacks from nearby Lebanon or from  terrorists hiding
among Syrian civilians. Finally, unlike Sadat's  Egypt, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
is one of the world's leading exporters  of terrorism. Syria supported
Hezbollah's terrorist attacks  against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
in 1983-1984 and  may be tempted to do so again in the Golan Heights to drive 
peacekeepers away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. By firmly opposing Islamic radicalism, can the U.S. be  accused of
being anti-Muslim?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. Muslims are the chief victims of Islamic  radicals,
who are totalitarian ideologues willing to use violence,  terrorism, and
intimidation to impose their narrow religious and  political views on their
countrymen. The U.S. has cooperated closely  with fundamentalist states such as
Saudi Arabia and President Zia  al-Haq's Pakistan. The U.S. is opposed to
terrorism and the export  of violent revolution, not to the religious beliefs of
any group.

</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has two vital national interests in Latin America:  countering such
ongoing threats to U.S. national security as illegal  drug trafficking and Fidel
Castro's Cuba and encouraging the  development of prosperous and stable
capitalist democracies  throughout 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Latin America's economies are among the fastest growing in  the world, and
the United States has been one of the principal  beneficiaries of this growth.
U.S. exports to Latin America more  than doubled between 1988 and 1994, rising
to $94 billion, and  now support over 2 million American jobs. Moreover,
democratic  reforms are advancing at a quicker pace in Latin America than 
anywhere else in the world. Today, Cuba is the only  undemocratic country in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Trade expansion drives U.S. relations with Latin America,  and NAFTA (the
North American Free Trade Agreement) will be  the main instrument for achieving
America's principal foreign  policy goals for the region. These goals consist of
expanding U.S.  exports and investment as quickly as possible and assuring
long-term  economic and political stability on America's southern flank, 
particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1989, the Bush Administration unveiled the Enterprise of  the Americas
Initiative, a bold proposal to create a single  free-trade area encompassing the
entire Western Hemisphere. The  following year, in 1990, the U.S. and Mexico
agreed to negotiate  NAFTA, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement ever
signed by  the U.S. with any Latin American country. NAFTA was signed  into law
by President Clinton on December 8, 1993. One year later,  at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, President Clinton and  33 other hemispheric heads of state
agreed unanimously to create  a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
President Clinton  also pledged at the summit to expand NAFTA to Chile in 1996,
but  that presidential promise has not yet been fulfilled.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most immediate threat to stability and security on  America's southern
flank is the crisis in Mexico. The peso's collapse on  December 19, 1994,
plunged Mexico into the worst economic  and political crisis it has suffered in
more than a century. The  peso crisis also weakened support for NAFTA in the
U.S. and may  have derailed further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Western 
Hemisphere for a period of two or three years. The Clinton  Administration is
aiding Mexico with a $50 billion emergency bailout  package, and the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo has  stepped up the pace of economic and political
reform, but the turmoil  will not subside quickly. It remains to be seen whether
the  Clinton Administration's bailout and the Zedillo government's  emergency
economic reforms will be enough to end the current crisis; if  not, Mexico will
be forced to implement even tougher reforms in  1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other threats to stability and security in Latin America  include
corruption, the widespread absence of the rule of law,  inadequate protection of
property rights, drug trafficking, organized  crime, and guerrilla activities in
several countries. These are  structural problems for which there are no easy or
quick solutions.  However, without sustained economic development, prospects for
 confronting these threats successfully are poor. The expansion of  NAFTA to
include Chile and other Latin American countries is the  vehicle proposed by the
U.S., and embraced by the emerging  capitalist democracies of Latin America, to
achieve sustained economic  development and create a 21st century hemispheric
partnership  based on free trade and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most important Latin American issues is whether  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 62 -->  include Chile in NAFTA. Some
American protectionists  oppose NAFTA's expansion, arguing that NAFTA caused the
 Mexican crisis and that free trade is bad for the United States. Others 
believe that expanding NAFTA is the only way to expand the  economies of the
U.S. and Latin America. Thus, they advocate  extending fast-track negotiating
authority to the President. Fast-track  negotiating authority authorizes the
President to conduct trade  negotiations with a view to achieving specific goals
established  by Congress. Agreements negotiated under fast-track are submitted 
to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but Congress may not amend  or otherwise
alter the proposed agreement submitted for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the U.S. should be bailing out  Mexico's economy.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration bailed out  Mexico with a rescue package
totaling nearly $50 billion. About half  of this amount has been borrowed by the
Mexican government so  far, yet the economic crisis has not ended. Critics of
the  Administration argue that it is both unwise and wasteful to  subsidize
Mexico's economic inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third important Latin American issue is whether the U.S.  should impose
sanctions on Colombia for not doing enough to curb  the drug cartels operating
in that country. President Ernesto  Samper financed his 1994 election campaign
with more than $6 million  in political contributions from the Cali cartel. In
1995, the  Clinton Administration renewed Colombia's annual certification with 
a &quot;national interest waiver,&quot; which is analogous to flunking a  final
exam but receiving a passing grade anyway. The Republican  majority in Congress
criticized Colombia's national interest  certification in 1995 and urged Clinton
instead to decertify Colombia  and impose trade sanctions. The Administration in
March 1996  decerti
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  fied Colombia as a sign of U.S.
opposition to the penetration  of Colombia's presidency, Congress, and court
system by  corrupt drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSL">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more 
than doubled in just six years, rising from $46.4 billion in 1988 to  over $98
billion in 1994. These exports support nearly 2 million  American jobs. Total
U.S. exports to Latin America represent 19  percent of all U.S. exports, making
Latin America the fourth-largest  U.S. export market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1990, U.S. exports to all countries in the Western 
Hemisphere, including Canada, have increased over 50 percent,  from $137 billion
to nearly $207 billion. In all, these exports  support over 4.1 million American
jobs. Total U.S. exports to all  countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1994
represented over 40 percent  of America's exports worldwide. The Western
Hemisphere  is America's second-largest export market, after Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Negotiations for NAFTA were substantially concluded in 1992 
by the Bush Administration. The final agreement was approved  in 1993 by the
U.S. Congress, but only after the Clinton  Administration forced Mexico and
Canada to accept unnecessary side  agreements on labor and the environment.
NAFTA is to be  implemented over a period of 15 years, with full implementation
scheduled  for 2009. Chile is next in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Trade growth during NAFTA's first two years surpassed even 
the most optimistic forecasts. In 1994, two-way trade between the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 -->  and Mexico increased over 22
percent, to more than $100  billion. The U.S. reported a trade deficit of nearly
$16 billion with  Mexico during 1995, mainly because Mexican exports had
increased  by more than one-third since 1994. However, despite the peso  crisis,
U.S. exports to Mexico in 1995 fell by less than 9 percent from  the year
before, and were still higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The South American Common Market (Mercosur), which is led  by
Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is  rapidly
developing a free-trade area in South America while  seeking closer trade
relations with the European Union and several of  the APEC countries, including
Japan. If NAFTA is not  expanded quickly to include Chile, and subsequently
Argentina, the  U.S. may be sidelined from South American trade liberalization 
centered on Mercosur at the expense of American exports, jobs,  and U.S.
leadership in that region of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have become a  significant
threat to U.S. economic and security interests. Colombian  drug traffickers
financed the election of President Ernesto Samper  in 1994 and have penetrated
Columbia's Congress, courts, and  law enforcement institutions. Moreover, over
80 percent of the  cocaine imported illegally into the U.S. is transported
through Mexico  by powerful drug cartels in league with corrupt politicians, law
 enforcement, and military personnel. Belatedly, the Clinton  Administration
appears to have acknowledged that drug traffickers are  a national security
threat to America by appointing former  Army General Barry McCaffrey as the new
head of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORDL">THE RECORD</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 65 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The high watermarks of the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy toward
Latin America were the approval of NAFTA  in 1993 and the Summit of the Americas
in 1994. It was at this  conference that the President pledged to expand NAFTA
to  include Chile in 1996 and promised to create a Free Trade Area of  the
Americas by 2005. Both achievements were eclipsed by the  collapse of the
Mexican peso in 1995, and the crisis in Mexico  has derailed further U.S.-led
trade expansion in Latin America for  one or two years at least. The Clinton
Administration is  pretending otherwise, but without NAFTA's expansion to Chile,
the  President has nothing to offer Latin America, and the U.S. is  temporarily
sidelined from the process of hemispheric trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, with NAFTA's expansion pushed off  the Administration's
agenda, at least for now, President Clinton  has little to show for his efforts
in Latin America except a string  of foreign policy blunders. These include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The U.S. military occupation of Haiti.</B> President
Clinton  ordered the invasion of Haiti to establish a lasting democracy in that 
country. In truth, however, the Clinton Administration restored  Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and then  provided Aristide with over
$2 billion in military security and financial  aid as he consolidated his
one-man rule. New Haitian President  Rene Preval is Aristide's closest friend,
chosen by Aristide to  succeed him in power. Moreover, political violence has
continued in  Haiti since the start of the U.S. military occupation. Since
Aristide  was restored to power, more than 20 leaders of the political 
opposition have been murdered. Now that the U.S. has left Haiti, there  are
fears of renewed political violence.

</P>
<P><B>*     The Mexican peso crisis.</B> The Clinton Administration had  more
than a year's advance warning, during 1993 and 1994, of  Mexico's impending
financial collapse but did nothing to prevent it.  When the crisis hit,
President Clinton rushed to the  Mexican government's rescue with a $50 billion
bailout package that  assured Americans holding Mexican government bonds of full
 repayment at the expense of American taxpayers. However,  the Mexican economy
suffered a brutal contraction that will be felt  for many years by the Mexican
people, and the expansion of  NAFTA to Chile and other Latin American countries
was derailed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Dealing secretly with Castro.</B> The White House secretly 
negotiated an agreement with Castro that requires U.S. Navy and Coast  Guard
ships to intercept Cuban refugees fleeing the island and  return them forcibly
to Cuba. However, Clinton obtained no economic  or political concessions from
Castro, except a promise not to  permit any new mass departures of Cubans
seeking freedom.

crisis in Mexico is not over. As soon as 1997, another peso  crisis 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 67 -->  could force the Zedillo
government to request more financial  aid from the U.S., and possibly also to
call for a new round of  debt negotiations to prevent a default. The U.S. should
refuse all  future Mexican requests for emergency financial bailouts and should 
urge Mexico instead to resolve its economic difficulties with  market-oriented
solutions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand NAFTA to include Chile.</B> Including Chile in  NAFTA would
send the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean a  strong message that U.S.
commitment to creating a Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA) remains firm.
It also would  enhance America's leadership in the Western Hemisphere while 
expanding export and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in  South
America, creating a South American gateway to Asian markets  for U.S. producers,
and strengthening the relative bargaining power  of U.S. trade negotiators in
future talks between NAFTA and  the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
headed by  Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Give Caribbean and Central American countries  NAFTA-level trade
parity.</B> Raising the countries of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative to NAFTA
parity with Mexico would not cost the U.S.  anything. To the contrary, it would
increase market access for U.S.  companies and investors in the Caribbean and
Central America  and would compel countries in the region to accept NAFTA 
standards in other areas beneficial to American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Negotiate a framework free-trade agreement between NAFTA  and
Mercosur, the South American Common Market.</B>  A  free-trade agreement between
NAFTA and Mercosur is an essential step  in creating a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. At present, Brazil  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  pursuing a policy of
consolidating Mercosur first in order to  create a South American Free Trade
Area (SAFTA), centered on  Brazil, that would exclude NAFTA initially. This
would have  adverse long-term consequences for U.S. exports and investments in 
South America. The U.S. should try to counter this Brazilian strategy  by
expanding NAFTA to include Chile, and subsequently  Argentina, in order to push
Mercosur toward a convergence with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Suspend all U.S. government aid to Haiti.</B> The Clinton 
Administration has withdrawn the American military presence from Haiti,  but it
plans to continue funding the Aristide-sponsored government  of President Rene
Preval with hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial aid disbursed through
the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) and multilateral
institutions like the  IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. 
However, lasting democracy has not been established, and American  taxpayers
should not be dunned for the cost of maintaining the illusion  of democracy in
the least democratic country in the Americas  (after communist Cuba).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Continue pressure against Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.</B>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to return to Cuba all  refugees
intercepted at sea, but Castro has made no economic or  political concessions.
Castro wants the U.S. trade embargo lifted, but  he refuses to relax his
totalitarian enslavement of the Cuban  people. Until Castro agrees to make real
free-market and democratic  concessions aimed at freeing the Cuban people, the
U.S. should  continue to turn the economic screws against Castro, as it did 
recently by approving the Helms-Burton Bill that tightens sanctions  against
Cuba.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican peso crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso  collapsed
because the Mexican economy is not free and  because Mexico is not a
full-fledged democracy. NAFTA prevented  the Mexican crisis from becoming much
worse, because it  provided Mexico with a strong institutional anchor that
encouraged the  government to stay on course with the economic and political 
reforms that, over the next decade, will foster the consolidation of a  true
capitalist democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is NAFTA responsible for growing illegal immigration  and drug
trafficking from Mexico?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Mexicans emigrate to the U.S., legally and illegally,  because
they are fleeing poverty and repression. Mexicans have been  migrating to
America for over 100 years and will continue to do so  as long as they are
denied opportunities for economic advancement  in their own country. NAFTA
compels the Mexican government  to open up the Mexican economy; over the next
10-15 years,  therefore, more economic freedom in Mexico will be reflected in 
reduced immigration to the U.S. Similarly, NAFTA is not  responsible for drug
trafficking in North America. The real cause is  the lack of economic and
political freedom in Mexico, combined  with incoherent U.S. anti-drug policies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Wouldn't America be better off without NAFTA?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Without NAFTA, relations between the U.S. and Mexico  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 70 -->  deteriorate. NAFTA is the first
successful effort, in nearly  200 years of frequently difficult U.S.-Mexico
relations, to build a  lasting partnership based on economic prosperity and
democratic  stability. Abolishing NAFTA would not end common security  concerns
related to economic relations, immigration, and drug  trafficking. However, with
NAFTA in place, the U.S. has an  effective foreign policy instrument with which
to create a durable  cross-border relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Was the military occupation of Haiti a mistake?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Yes. President Clinton's commitment of U.S. troops to  Haiti was
driven by domestic policy concerns. Haiti has no  democratic tradition, and
history teaches that democracy cannot be  imposed forcibly by external power.
The creation of a true democracy  in Haiti is important to all democracies in
the Americas, but the  drive to become a democracy must come from within.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Throughout most of its history, America sought to avoid  entanglement in the
affairs of other countries, focusing instead on  peaceful avenues of trade.
America has grown into an industrial giant  partly because of international
trade, which now accounts for some  23 percent of the national wealth. With
increased reliance on  global markets, the U.S. is trying to expand its exports
by involving  itself in agreements such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While America has been largely a free-trade nation, the  principles of free
trade today are under siege. On the one side of the  argument are those who
advocate free trade because it creates  jobs, promotes economic growth, and
maximizes efficiency and  individual wealth. On the other are those who argue
that free  trade forces American manufacturing overseas, and leads to lost 
jobs, declining wealth, and increased national suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To its proponents, free trade is a matter of principle.  Individuals should
enjoy the right to buy lawful products, wherever  made, without governmental
interference. Free traders believe that  governments should not dictate to
individuals what clothes they  will wear, what food they will eat, and which
cars they will drive  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  benefit domestic producers.
Tariffs, import quotas,  discriminatory regulations, and other forms of
protectionism are unwarranted  infringements of individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents also believe that free trade promotes economic  growth and
creates jobs for Americans. Virtually all economists argue  that free trade
increases competition, spurs innovation, lowers  prices, accelerates economic
growth, and on balance creates more  jobs than are lost to foreign competition.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of free trade advocate closed borders and argue  that cutting off
or restricting trade with other nations is in  America's interest. While they
admit that tariffs and import quotas raise  consumer prices, they believe such
measures also safeguard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps no other recent public figure has advocated trade  protectionism
more vigorously than Patrick Buchanan, who says  he would impose stiff tariffs
on imports and withdraw America  from almost all of its international
agreements, including the  North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada
and  the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trade organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The outcome of this debate is vitally important to America's  future. The
choice before the U.S. is whether to continue or  abandon its standard of living
and its position as the world's  leading economy. A false move on the trade
front could have  disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy. It should be
recalled that  the protectionism of the 1930s was a major factor in bringing 
about the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The challenge for America is whether it will embrace free trade  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  a key to its continuing
prosperity. Linked to this challenge are  such issues as expanding NAFTA to
include Chile and other  countries, expanding free trade in Asia through the
Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, expanding trade across the 
Atlantic with Europe, and dealing with the entry of the People's  Republic of
China (PRC) and Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) into  the World Trade
Organization. Generally, free traders have been  disappointed in President
Clinton's handling of all these trade  issues. They accuse him of dragging his
feet on expanding NAFTA  to include Chile and of trying to force &quot;managed&quot;
trade deals  with the Japanese over auto parts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     America is the largest exporter of goods and

year,  and over 14 million Americans are employed producing these exports.

<P><B>*</B>     America's trade deficit is minuscule when compared to the size
 of the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services is  a mere
1.5 percent of America's overall economy (gross  national product). America's
annual budget deficit  2.5 percent of GNP   is almost twice the size of its
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. trades with Asia more than any other region in the 
world. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia in 1994 was  $424.9 billion, or
36.1 percent of total U.S. two-way merchandise  trade worldwide. Merchandise
exports to Asia support 3.1  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  American jobs<B>.</B>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     <B></B>The U.S. exports over $120 billion in goods to Europe,
not  including the newly independent states of the former Soviet  Union. These
exports support over 2 million U.S. jobs. Removing  barriers to U.S. exports to
Europe means creating more American jobs in  a number of different sectors,
including agricultural goods,  automobiles, electric power and natural gas
equipment, information  technology products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,
and  telecommunications equipment.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's second-largest foreign market, importing 
more goods and services from America than any other country  except Canada. In
1994, Japan imported some $70 billion worth of  goods and services from the
U.S., supporting some 1.4 million  American jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is a big customer for the U.S. manufacturing  industry.<B>
</B>Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan are manufactured goods,  and
Japan's purchases of these goods support over 840,000  American manufacturing
jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. exports nearly $98 billion in goods to Latin  America
each year. These merchandise exports represent 19 percent of  all U.S.

</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. 
merchandise exports to Mexico and Canada have soared. During  NAFTA's first year
in 1994, U.S. merchandise exports to Canada,  America's largest trading partner,
grew by more than 13 percent to $114  billion. Likewise, U.S. merchandise
exports to Mexico grew over  22

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the expansion of  free trade has
been the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward  Latin America and the Caribbean. The
Enterprise for the Americas  Initiative launched by former President George Bush
in 1989 laid  out the goal of creating an American-led free-trade area 
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere, from Alaska in North America  to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. The first step in creating  a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) was taken by the  Bush Administration in 1990 with the
announcement that the U.S.  would negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the  U.S.
Congress in 1993 and implemented as of January 1, 1994.  Subsequently, at the
Summit of the Americas held in Miami,  Florida, from December 9-11, 1994,
President Clinton and all of the  democratically elected leaders of Latin
America, the Caribbean,  and Canada pledged unanimously to create an FTAA by the
year  2005; President Clinton also pledged that Chile would become  NAFTA's
fourth member by 1996, thus confirming to the region's  leaders that the U.S.
was firmly committed to hemispheric trade  expansion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In April 1994, the United States signed the Uruguay Round  trade agreement,
which went into force on January 1, 1995. The  Reagan Administration initiated
these trade negotiations in 1986 as part  of an ongoing series of talks under
the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was the seventh &quot;round&quot;
of GATT  trade talks that started in 1947. Prior to World War II, many 
countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  established barriers to
international trade which contributed to  the Great Depression in the U.S. and
Europe. Following the war,  many of these barriers remained in place. The first
GATT round  was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947 and resulted in some 
45,000 separate agreements that reduced tariffs on manufactured  goods and some
agricultural goods. Since GATT's inception, world  trade has expanded from less
than $100 billion in the late 1940s to  over $3 trillion today. Among other
things, the Uruguay Round  agreement creates a new body called the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This organization is a forum in which countries can  seek
peaceful solutions to trade disputes without resorting to trade  protectionism.
Thus, instead of occasional international trade  negotiations like the seven
rounds GATT talks, the WTO allows for  ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  is America's
institutional link to fast-growing Asian  economies. Formed in 1989, APEC
encompasses Australia, Brunei,  Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. The  leaders of
APEC's member economies, including President Bill  Clinton, in 1994 set as their
goal achieving &quot;free trade and investment  in the Asia Pacific&quot; region
by 2010 for developed members and  by 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, while paying lip service to free trade, the Clinton  Administration
has pursued a policy that isolates America from  the international economy and
thus threatens Americans whose  jobs depend on international trade. For example,
NAFTA's  expansion to include Chile has stalled because the Administration and 
Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  gress cannot agree on the language
of a new fast-track  negotiating authority. The Administration insists on
language that would  allow trade sanctions to be imposed against countries that
violate  labor and environmental rules contained in the side agreements  to
NAFTA. Republican leaders in Congress reject this demand,  arguing that
extraneous issues unrelated to trade should not be  confused with trade. Without
a new fast-track negotiating  authority, NAFTA cannot be expanded to Chile, and
it is unlikely that  free-trade agreements could be negotiated with any other
country.

<P>President Clinton snubbed other government heads and  reduced American
prestige in the region when he skipped the  November 19, 1995, Leaders' Meeting
in Osaka, Japan. The leaders will  meet in November 1996 in Subic Bay,
Philippines, and again in  November 1997 in Canada to review the each member's
progress  toward achieving APEC's free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has vacillated between free trade and  managed trade in
Asia. On one hand, he agreed to create a vast APEC  free-trade area, including
China and Japan, and help China join  the World Trade Organization (WTO). On the
other, he has  tightened import quotas on Chinese apparel and textiles and has
tried  unsuccessfully to force Japan to consent to new managed trade  agreements
on autos and semiconductors. Additionally, since  Clinton became President, the
U.S. has threatened to impose trade  sanctions on such imported products as
steel, textiles, cellular  telephones, consumer electronics products, and a host
of other  manufactured goods.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The path of trade protectionism paved by the Clinton  Administration should
be reversed. America needs to be put back on the  road to free trade. In 1997,
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Establish free-trade areas between the United States
and its  trading partners.</B> NAFTA should be expanded to incorporate Chile 
and other Latin American countries, and Caribbean nations should  receive
trading parity with NAFTA members. The U.S. should  cooperate with other APEC
members and take more concrete steps  at the next two Leaders' Meetings to
achieve a free-trade area in  the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. also should encourage
other Latin  American economies to join Chile and Mexico in APEC in 1997. 
Finally, the U.S. should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested
European countries, including the recently freed nations in  Eastern and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Propose a free-trade area &quot;framework agreement&quot; with 
European countries interested in a free-trade area with the U.S.</B> A 
framework agreement precedes a free-trade agreement, allowing both sides  to
propose which items and topics they wish to pursue as part of  the formal
negotiating process. It is a necessary first step toward  formal negotiations to
create a free-trade agreement with  European countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free trade area with Europe would make it easier for U.S.  companies to
sell their goods there.<B> </B>Most European countries still  have their own
peculiarities regarding product standards, testing,  labeling, and
certification. These differences often increase the cost  of U.S. products as
companies must alter their products to meet  these differing requirements. A
free-trade area with Europe would  allow the U.S. and Europe to seek common
product standards,  testing, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  labeling, and certification
requirements, thereby reducing the  costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free-trade area with Europe also would increase America's  access to
Europe's agricultural market. Even though the U.S.  and Europe reached an
agreement in 1994 to reduce some  agricultural subsidies as part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), Europe still maintains a host of
subsidies, trade  quotas, and import bans that restrict or prevent U.S.
agricultural exports  to Europe. Likewise, the U.S. still maintains agricultural
 subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions that restrict agricultural 
imports from Europe. A free-trade agreement would allow U.S.  and European
negotiators to reduce barriers and promote  agricultural exports on both sides,
benefiting all parites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-    Support the accession of both the People's Republic of China  and
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade  Organization on a
commercially viable basis.</B> In 1986, Beijing applied to  resume China's seat
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the predecessor of the WTO,
which the Republic of China on  Taiwan had abandoned in 1950. In 1990, Taiwan
also applied to join  the GATT. Following Hong Kong's example, Taiwan elected to
 apply as the autonomous customs territory of &quot;Chinese Taipei,&quot; 
rather than as a sovereign country. This move was intended to  finesse Beijing's
sensitivities over questions of sovereignty. Beijing  insists that Taiwan not
join the WTO before the PRC, but has offered  as its first act as a WTO member
to sponsor Taiwan. Joining  the WTO is an economic, not political, act.
Therefore, Beijing  should not be allowed to block Taiwan's entry; each
application should  be considered on its own merits. Although negotiations with 
Taiwan have progressed further, neither China nor Taiwan has offered  suf
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ficient concessions to warrant
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Demand an end to China's practice of forcing foreign firms  to
transfer technology as a condition of investing.</B> The leverage  that China
can exert with its huge market makes it difficult even  for large industrial
firms to resist this form of  government-sponsored theft. The U.S. must also
insist that all existing bilateral  trade agreements, especially the 1995
Intellectual Property  Rights Memorandum of Understanding, be fully enforced
before  approving China's accession to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal the outdated Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade  Act of
1975.</B> The Jackson-Vanik Trade Act was designed to  encourage the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift  restrictions on Jewish
emigration to Israel and the U.S. It  withdraws America's most-favored-nation
trading status from any  country that restricts immigration. Threatening to deny
MFN status  to China because of human rights abuses has become an annual  ritual
in Congress. But maintaining MFN with China is clearly  in America's economic
interest. At stake are billions of dollars  in trade. It also encourages the
liberalization of China's political  system. Trade forces China to open up to
the outside world and  therefore serves the long-run cause of human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Approve fast track for Chile before the 1996 elections.</B> Chile 
has enjoyed the fastest economic growth and the greatest  economic stability of
any country in Latin America since the mid-1980s. It  is in the forefront of
economic and democratic reform in the  Americas, having successfully achieved
the transition from military  dictatorship to civilian democracy. Chile is a
member of the APEC;  it is a strong candidate to join Mercosur (the South
American  Com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mon Market comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)  when Mercosur's members can reduce their
tariffs to match Chile's;  and it has a working bilateral trade agreement with
Mexico.  However, Chile cannot join NAFTA before 1997 if Congress does not 
approve fast-track negotiating authority. Under fast track,  trade agreements
negotiated by the Administration are submitted  to Congress for a straight
up-or-down vote; however, Congress  may not change or amend any portion of the
proposed agreement  before voting. Chile is the benchmark against which the rest
of the  region will measure America's hemispheric vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Submit more accurate trade reports.</B> The United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) produces an annual report on foreign  trade barriers. This
report is important because it identifies the  barriers that U.S. exporters face
when selling their products  overseas. However, it tells only one side of the
story. America maintains  a host of import restrictions such as trade quotas,
high tariffs,  and import bans that are not described in the report. They should
 be. By including such information, the U.S. government would  be presenting a
more open picture of the status of free trade and  of where reforms are still
needed, including within the U.S.  Moreover, such USTR reports should
incorporate a scorecard of  the current cost to the economy of each of these
U.S. restrictions  on trade.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support free trade when our huge trade deficit  is
destroying jobs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America's trade deficit is only 1.5 percent of the size of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  overall U.S. economy. The U.S.
budget deficit is 2.5 percent  of America's GNP. Thus, while much is made of
America's  trade deficit, it is nearly half the size of the U.S. budget deficit.
The  budget deficit hinders America's economy far more than does  the trade
deficit. Free trade creates jobs: One of every five U.S. jobs  is the result of
U.S. trade. Besides, free trade provides  Americans with greater consumer
choice, adds to the national wealth, and  is responsible for the fact that
American businesses are the  largest exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Free trade is fine, but shouldn't America require a level  playing
field with its trading partners?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Countries that maintain trade barriers harm their  own
economies for more than they harm America's. Rather  than threaten to close
America's markets to foreign countries if they  do not remove barriers to U.S.
exports, America should seek to  use free-trade areas and the newly created
international dispute  settlement forum, the World Trade Organization, to
encourage  open markets. Under the WTO, the U.S. would be able to seek the 
opening of foreign markets through negotiations rather than threats  and
destructive retaliation. Even if the U.S. could not achieve  open markets abroad
through such means, it would be better  for America and its consumers to
dismantle U.S. trade  protectionism unilaterally than to impose higher barriers
to foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Shouldn't America tell countries like Japan that if they do  not open
up, we will close our borders to them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. That would be self-defeating. Japan is America's  largest
overseas market. It imports more goods and services from the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  than the United Kingdom and
Germany combined and  is America's largest overseas market for agricultural
goods. Also,  the average Japanese person buys more goods and services from  the
U.S. than the average U.S. citizen buys from Japan. Why  does America have a
trade deficit with Japan?  There are many  factors, including the stubbornness
of American companies in refusing  to design products for the Japanese market.
But the main reason  is that there are twice as many Americans as there are 
Japanese. Even the Clinton Administration agrees that if Japan removed  all
supposed trade barriers to U.S. imports, the deficit would  shrink only
marginally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican crisis. The peso  collapsed on
December 19, 1994, because the Mexican economy is not  sufficiently free, and
because Mexico's political system is  undemocratic. Moreover, former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari refused to make needed monetary and
exchange  policy adjustments in advance of Mexico's 1994 presidential 
elections. When investors lost confidence in Mexico, they fled to safer 
markets. Mexico was unable to retain the confidence of investors  because it
lacked strong economic and democratic  institutions. Thanks to NAFTA, however,
President Ernesto Zedillo is  implementing economic and political reforms that
should create the  institutions Mexico lacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is fast track, and why is it important?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Fast-track negotiating authority consists of special  legislative
rules adopted by Congress. These authorize the President to  nego
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  tiate trade agreements and submit
them to Congress for an  up-or-down vote without the addition of any amendments
by  Congress. Fast track accelerates the process of negotiating free trade 
agreements with other countries, while providing them the  assurance that
agreements they reach with the U.S. government will not  be changed subsequently
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is it important that fast track be approved before the  1996
elections?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> On four separate occasions since 1990, the U.S. has  pledged
officially that Chile would become the fourth member of  NAFTA. If Chile is not
admitted to NAFTA until 1997, America will  lose the opportunity to take the
lead in negotiating free-trade  agreements with other major economies in South
America,  including Argentina and Brazil. By 1997, Chile's interest in joining 
NAFTA may weaken, and America's chances of consolidating U.S.  leadership in
South America may be diminished. Chile cannot  join NAFTA until Congress has
granted fast-track negotiating  authority to the President. This authority is
needed to expedite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Since NAFTA has not worked, why would a free-trade  area with Europe
work.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA has worked. Exports to Mexico increased by 20  percent
during the NAFTA's first year in 1994. Due to the  Mexican peso crisis, U.S.
exports to Mexico dropped slightly during  1995, but they were still higher than
the total for 1993, before  NAFTA was implemented. Moreover, the &quot;giant
sucking sound&quot;  predicted by Ross Perot never did occur. In fact, some
companies  that moved to Mexico prior to the NAFTA now are moving back to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  U.S. Why?  Because even though
Mexican workers may get  paid less, some companies are finding it harder to get
their products  out of Mexico because its roads, ports, and transportation
networks  are costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens if some members of the European Union want  a free-trade
area with the U.S. but others do not?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should extend an offer for a free-trade area directly 
to the European Union. At the same time, it should extend an offer  to
non-European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe,  and even to the newly
independent states of the former Soviet  Union. If the EU drags its feet in
negotiating with the U.S.,  America should pursue a free-trade area with such
non-EU members as  the Czech Republic and Estonia, two of Europe's most rapidly 
growing market economies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What U.S. industries could be expected to benefit from  freer trade
with Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A host of industries would benefit from freer trade with  Europe.
These would include those involved in agriculture,  telecommunications, and the
manufacturing of automobiles, medical  equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

</center><p>

<P>Beyond the traditional tools of statecraft  war and diplomacy   America has
many lesser tools at its disposal in formulating  and executing foreign policy.
Like all good tools, however, they  are means to an end and should be used only
under the right  circumstances and with proper care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of these tools is the United Nations. The U.S. should treat  the U.N.
not as some superior body to which it must apply for  approval, but as an
institution which can be useful in cultivating  international support for U.S.
policy. Another tool is foreign aid.  Aid can be an effective adjunct to U.S.
foreign policy, but only if  it works and serves American interests, neither of
which it has  done very well. Two other tools, both of which are indispensable 
for national security, are intelligence gathering and covert  operations. Even
though the Cold War is over, the chaotic and  threatening condition of today's
world requires a robust and effective  intelligence capability. Finally, there
is the important work of  public diplomacy, as represented by the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the Voice of America (VOA), and other  official
media. Telling the American story to people overseas helps  build international
support for democracy and freedom, as well as  for specific U.S. policies.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America must be engaged in world affairs. The U.S. cannot  protect its vital
interests unless it seeks to influence world opinion  and events in such
international bodies as the United Nations. But  this does not mean compromising
American principles, sovereignty,  or freedom of action. Whether in the U.N. or
any other  multilateral organization, the U.S. government should strive to
protect  American interests and represent American values. America must  pursue
its own agenda, not that of international bureaucrats often  hostile to U.S
interests. Only by doing so can the United States  remain strong enough to
contribute effectively to international peace  and stability.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How to develop this American agenda in international  diplomacy is an issue
which separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals tend to distrust American
power and seek to constrain it by tying  it to the U.N. Conservatives, knowing
that this power historically  has been used for good, want to liberate it from
these constraints.  Liberals want to put American forces under U.N. military 
command, and to have America adopt the U.N. bureaucracy's generally  socialist
agenda as its own; some have gone so far as to propose  that the U.N. be given
taxing powers over U.S. citizens. By  contrast, conservatives want America to
retain sovereign control over  its own military forces when they are involved in
U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Above all, conservatives want to prevent the U.S.
 from becoming a mere servant of the U.N.'s agenda, as the Clinton 
Administration has allowed to happen in Somalia and elsewhere;  they are willing
to work through the U.N. when it suits American  interests, but not when these
interests are not served.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether, and to what extent, to support  U.S. policy abroad
through public diplomacy. Most people believe  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  the U.S. needs some form of public
diplomacy to explain  American policy and values to people in foreign lands. It
is well  known that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of  America
played important roles in bringing down the Iron Curtain.  What role should they
play in today's international diplomacy?   And once this role has been
established, what is the best way to  convey this message, through existing
official media structures and  outlets or through new ones?

<P>

<P>Even its strongest advocates recognize that the U.N. is  bloated, wasteful,
poorly managed, and disorganized. Only  fundamental reform can reinvigorate the
U.N. and restore its lost  credibility. The Clinton Administration itself
recognizes that unless the  U.N. is reformed, it will drift into irrelevance and
lose public support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.N. claims that the U.S. is some $1.3 billion behind in  its financial
contributions. Washington says the figure should  be somewhat less. With
approximately half of its 185 member  states delinquent in their dues, the U.N.
is in serious financial crisis.  The Clinton Administration wants to pay, but
Congress wants to  withhold payment until the U.N. gets its budget under control
and  ends corruption and poor management practices. The Clinton  Administration
may propose a deal with Congress to repay America's  back fees over several
years in return for promised U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past few years, the U.N. has proven that it cannot  manage 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  large, complex, and ambitious &quot;peace
operations&quot;  competently. This was seen most clearly in the debacles in
Somalia and  the former Yugoslavia. Not only have these operations been 
spectacular failures; they have been costly in terms of lives, material 
resources, and money. The U.S. spent almost $3 billion (in  direct and indirect
costs) in 1995 to support these failed U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious issue involves the specialized agencies.  Conservatives
believe that agencies such as the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and
United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO) do not merit
American financial  support or membership. Not only are they poorly managed and 
wasteful, but their mandates are counterproductive.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     There is broad consensus that the U.N. needs
reforming.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 1995 address
to  the U.N. General Assembly, proposed a &quot;concrete agenda&quot; for  U.N.
reform. This agenda involves ending programs that have  achieved their purpose,
consolidating overlapping programs,  downsizing regional economic commissions,
and imposing a moratorium  on big conferences.<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Funding for the U.N. system falls into two categories:
assessed  and voluntary contributions. An assessed contribution is the price  of
membership in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.  Countries make voluntary
contributions to specialized agencies they  also wish to support. For 1996, the
Clinton Administration  requested some $1.07 billion for U.S. assessed and
voluntary contributions  to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and
commissions.  Actual 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. spending for these
organizations totaled $1 billion in  1994. By contrast, more than 90 other
countries together account for  less than 1 percent of the U.N. budget, paying
only .01 percent each.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Cases of fraud and abuse erupt with disturbing regularity. In 
1995, for example, $10 million was embezzled from the United  Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Kenya. Various agencies of  the U.N. spent approximately $1
million a day at the height of the  Somalia peacekeeping operation in 1993. This
included renting  hundreds of apartments equipped with air conditioning. In 
December 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile  security
system at its New York headquarters. The reason: The  turnstile clocks would
have tracked the arrival and departure times of  U.N. employees. In 1995, the
U.N. spent some $500,000 for a  two-week conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island  Developing States, including $15,000 to fly
representatives from  the Western Sahara to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has grown into a massive bureaucracy of over 70 
agencies and programs, including the United Nations Research  Institute for
Social Development (UNRISD) and the International  Labor Organization (ILO),
with overlapping mandates. The U.N.  system has over 50,000 employees.

<P><B>*</B>     The United States plays a key role in supporting U.N. 
peacekeeping. Until last year, the U.S. paid nearly one-third of the  annual
$3.5 billion peacekeeping bill (now unilaterally reduced to 25  percent). The
U.S. assigns thousands of American soldiers to  U.N. missions and provides
billions of dollars worth of  transportation, equipment, and other support
services to the U.N. at no charge.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Until recently, traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations 
entailed small observation or peacekeeping missions deployed to  monitor an
already existing peace settlement. These operations  were simple, inexpensive,
unambitious, and usually staffed by  countries like Canada, Sweden, Norway, or
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     With the end of Cold War tensions among members of the 
Security Council, there was an explosion in peacekeeping  operations from 1989
to 1993, with the Security Council authorizing  more missions than it had in the
previous 40 years. In 1990, the  U.N. controlled approximately 10,000 &quot;blue
helmets&quot; in eight  operations at a cost of less than $700 million per year.
By the end  of 1993, there were over 90,000 &quot;blue helmets&quot; in 18
different  operations costing over $3.5 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has conducted 21 observation missions and six 
traditional peacekeeping missions since 1948. These missions have  a mixed
record in limiting armed conflict and promoting  conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has expanded the definition of peacekeeping 
significantly since 1990. Now peacekeeping is called &quot;second  generation
peacekeeping&quot; or &quot;peace-enforcement.&quot;  In these  operations,
peacekeepers have been sent to volatile and dangerous areas  (such as Somalia
and Bosnia) before a conclusive peace was  achieved. These missions have been
large (employing up to 40,000  troops); complex (involving armored combat
formations with combat  air and naval support); dangerous (resulting in hundreds
of  U.N. troops killed in Somalia and Bosnia); ambitious (attempting  to impose
peace through force of arms); and expensive (costing  the U.N. almost $5 million
per day in Bosnia). All have been failures.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     As of August 1995, the U.S. had over 3,200 American troops 
deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. These  operations include
Macedonia, Western Sahara, Kuwait, and Haiti.  The U.S. also provided the great
bulk of NATO air forces to enforce  a U.N.-sponsored &quot;no-fly zone&quot;
over Bosnia-Herzegovina  from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Peacekeeping operations harm U.S. combat readiness. Time 
spent on peacekeeping missions is time not spent learning or  rehearsing
critical warfighting skills. A recent General Accounting  Office report noted
the deleterious effects of peacekeeping on  readiness,<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm">2</A> documenting how it can take 12 to 18
months for a unit to return  to the minimum proficiency standards required by
U.S. doctrine.  This means, for instance, that the U.S. Army in Europe, which
has  deployed most of its units to Bosnia for peace implementation  duty, will
be out of the warfighting business for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. cannot command and control most military operations. 
It does not have the legitimacy, authority, structure, or procedures  to
organize and direct military missions competently. U.N.  command and control is
characterized by confusion and unresponsiveness.  A prime example is the
incoherent command and control  structure used in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. withdrew from the Paris-based United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in  1984 because of
its hostility to free markets and record of waste  and abuse.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In January 1996, the U.S. Army court-martialed Specialist 
Michael 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  New. Specialist New had refused to
wear a U.N. beret and  insignia when his unit was deployed on U.N. duty in
Macedonia,  maintaining that he swore an oath of allegiance to the U.S.
Constitution  and not to the U.N. However, under U.S. law, up to 1,000 U.S. 
soldiers can be deployed at any one time in U.N. missions. Specialist  New swore
an oath to follow all legal orders and was treated fairly,  but his case raises
the broader issue of U.S. participation in U.N.  military missions.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration began with a great deal of  enthusiasm for the
United Nations. President Clinton and his team  believed that with the end of
the Cold War, the U.N. could be  reinvigorated and begin to live up to the lofty
language of its Charter,  which assumes a central role for the organization in
preserving peace  and international security. The Clinton plan was for America
to  provide considerable support for U.N. peacekeeping and other  activities,
including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration initially embraced an  interventionist U.N. Under
the doctrine of &quot;assertive multilateralism,&quot; the  U.S. would advance
its security goals by working &quot;assertively&quot; with  the U.N. rather than
unilaterally or with allies. Central to this  approach was heavy American
support of U.N. peacekeeping. U.N.  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went
so far as to advocate  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  standing U.N. army under his
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton was forced to retreat from this doctrine after  the
failure of the U.N. operation in Somalia, where the U.N.  undertook an ambitious
nation-building mandate for which it was  unprepared. In support of this
mission, President Clinton deployed U.S.  Army Rangers who were assigned to
capture a Somali warlord for  the U.N. In October 1993, American soldiers were
drawn into a  street battle in Mogadishu during which 18 Americans were killed 
and 75 wounded. In May 1994, Clinton backtracked and issued  Presidential
Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25), placing restrictions  on U.S. participation in
U.N. peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The highlight of the Clinton Administration's U.N. reform  effort has been
to establish an Inspector General's office in New  York. For years, Congress has
been pushing this idea. Unfortunately,  this office has only limited scope and
has been characterized as a  &quot;disappointment&quot; by Representative Lee
Hamilton (D-IN) and  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of Congress who
 have long championed the U.N. Driven by budget constraints,  the Clinton
Administration in December 1995 announced the  long-overdue U.S. withdrawal from
the United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress tried to restrict some of the more  egregious Clinton
policies toward the U.N. The House and Senate  passed separate bills in 1995
that would cut U.S. financial contributions  to U.N. peacekeeping and limit U.S.
forces deployed in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Both bills embody provisions
of the  Contract With America. During negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration, language in the defense authorization bill that placed  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  on U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping was dropped.  President Clinton claimed that these limits were a
challenge to his  authority as commander in chief and threatened to veto the
bill if it  contained any such language. Congress backed down and passed  a
defense bill without these restrictions in January 1996. The  President
subsequently signed the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On another front, Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL) in  October 1995
introduced the United Nations Withdrawal Act. This  legislation would require
the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. by  the year 2000, retaining its membership
only in the U.N.'s  independent and specialized agencies. Representative
Scarborough's  bill was referred to the International Relations Committee, where
 it remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration boasts frequently of its participation  in
U.N.-sponsored international conferences. Vice President Al  Gore went to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development  in 1994 and accompanied Hillary
Clinton to the Copenhagen  Social Summit in 1995, and Mrs. Clinton and Health
and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the 1995 Fourth Women's 
Conference in Beijing. These conferences have come under  heavy criticism, both
for their anti-Western agendas and for their  wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In early 1996, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali floated the idea  of imposing
a U.N. tax on member nations. Republican  Senators Robert Dole (KS) and Jesse
Helms (NC) responded in January  by introducing legislation to bar U.S. payments
to the U.N. if it  tries to implement such a tax. The Clinton Administration
opposes  a U.N. tax.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To promote U.S. interests in the U.N. without sacrificing 
American sovereignty or effectiveness, and to ensure that America  does not get
dragged into unworkable peacekeeping operations, the  U.S. should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Limit its total non-peacekeeping contribution to no more  than
$500 million per year.</B> In 1995, America's assessed and  voluntary
contributions to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and  commissions totaled
some $1 billion. Approximately $260 million of  this amount went to the U.N.
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Stop paying assessed contributions to U.N. specialized  agencies.</B>
The few specialized agencies worthy of support, such as the  Universal Postal
Union and the World Meteorological  Organization, should be funded on a
case-by-case and voluntary basis from  the $500 million given to the U.N. This
dramatically reduced level  of spending will allow the U.S. to establish a
fundamentally  different relationship with a considerably scaled-back U.N.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never place U.S. troops under U.N. command.</B> The U.S.  may
choose to support some traditional peacekeeping operations,  such as the one in
Cyprus. However, U.S. forces should not be  placed under U.N. command. The U.S.
can provide support for U.N.  missions without operating in the U.N. chain of
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never give the Security Council veto power over American  foreign
policy.</B> It may be diplomatically useful to gain U.N.  Security Council
support for U.S. military actions, as President Bush did  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  the Persian Gulf War when his
Administration won a  Security Council resolution supporting the expulsion of
Iraq from  Kuwait. However, this support should never be considered essential. 
The U.S. should never allow Security Council politics to keep it  from defending
vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development  Program
(UNDP).</B> One of the bewildering array of specialized agencies  in the U.N.
system, UNDP is charged with &quot;contribut[ing] to a  sustainable expansion of
the world economy.&quot;  Essentially, it is a  foreign aid agency. Not only are
its programs unfocused and  duplicative, but foreign aid has proven
counterproductive in country  after country. Eliminating funding for this
specialized agency will  save the U.S. approximately $120 million a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End funding for all U.N. international conferences.</B> These 
conferences, which cost millions of dollars, are long on rhetoric  and short on
achievement. The 1995 Social Summit, for example,  focused on &quot;Creating
Jobs&quot; and &quot;Building Solidarity,&quot; two  objectives well beyond the
capabilities of a one-time gathering of  national and international bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Reject any proposal to vest the U.N. with taxing authority.</B> 
Senators Dole and Helms have introduced legislation that would  have the U.S.
stop paying its dues if the U.N. tries to impose a tax.  The Clinton
Administration also has voiced its opposition to the idea  of such a tax. The
U.S. should continue to send a strong message  that this trial balloon, floated
by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali  in January 1996 and bound to resurface
within the U.N., is  unacceptable.

<P><B>Q. Isn't it isolationist to suggest that the U.S. reduce its role in 
the U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Opposition to a poorly managed and corrupt  international
bureaucracy in New York is not support for isolationism.  Conservatives support
NATO and other alliances, as well as limited  participation in the U.N. This is
not isolationist; it is international  engagement in support of American, not
U.N., interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are you so opposed to the U.N.?  What right do we have  to impose
our will without first consulting with the  international community through the
U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> When deciding American foreign policy, the President  should
consult with his advisors and the Congress, not the U.N. We  don't need the
permission of the U.N. to protect American freedom  and interests. The U.N. is
plagued with corruption, and many of  its activities, including its foreign aid
programs, perpetuate  dependency throughout the developing world. Moreover, the
U.N.  is merely a collection of often opposing national interests. It is 
ridiculous to suggest that the 180-plus governments in the U.N.   many of which
are dictatorships  represent the democratic will  of the world community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The U.N. is responsible for international peace and  security. How
can the U.S. promote international peace and security if it  is not involved in
U.N. peacekeeping? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite its lofty objectives, the U.N. contributes only  margin
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  ally to international peace and
security. Since its creation in  1945, it has been a bit player on the world
stage. The U.S. remains  the world's principal force for international peace and
security  by maintaining forces in Europe and the Pacific region and by 
participating in alliance structures like NATO. It is highly misleading  to
measure a nation's contribution to the world's security by  gauging its
participation in marginal undertakings like U.N.  peacekeeping. America and its
Western allies ended the Cold War by being  militarily strong, not by
participating in &quot;peace&quot; missions  sponsored by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. An American soldier, Specialist Michael New, was  court-martialed in
January 1996 for refusing to wear U.N. insignia  and serve under U.N. command.
He maintains this violates his oath  to support and defend the Constitution of
the United States. Do  you support him?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As a soldier, Specialist New is obligated by his oath to obey 
the lawful orders of his chain of command. However unwise as a  matter of
policy, New's orders were not illegal. Therefore, he  should face the
consequences of his disobedience. However,  Specialist New should not have been
placed in a position where he  was forced to choose between his duty and his
conscience.  American soldiers should not be placed in the U.N. chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has floated the idea of  establishing
a U.N. tax on international commercial airline flights,  currency exchanges, and
other international transactions. What do  you think about this?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is ridiculous. The power to tax is a sovereign power of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  ernment, which is accountable to
the people in a free society.  The U.N. is accountable to no one but member
governments and  bureaucrats. The U.N. has no sovereignty over its member
states;  nor should it ever have such power. The U.N. is the creation and  the
servant of its member states. In any case, its problems stem  not from a lack of
money, but from having too much money. It is  very disturbing that Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali and others  within the U.N. are trying to make this power
grab.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In the first session of the 104th Congress, legislation was 
introduced to pull the U.S. out of the U.N. Why not go all the way  and simply
take the U.S. out of the U.N.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Security Council can serve some useful purposes. At  times,
for example, it can be a forum for discussion of important  international
issues. However, the U.S. should never feel constrained  by Security Council
resolutions, and U.S. participation in the U.  N. should be scaled back. A major
cut in U.S. funding would go  a long way toward achieving this goal.

<P>Effective intelligence is as necessary today as during the  Cold War.
Despite the end of the Cold War, the world remains a  very dangerous and
increasingly unpredictable place. Threats  to America's interests are real and
growing. They can arise in  regions vital to the U.S. with little or no warning.
America needs a  robust 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  intelligence gathering capacity
both to enable its leaders to  understand these threats and to give them as much
warning of  approaching danger as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. intelligence community today faces  serious problems and
challenges. The morale of the Central  Intelligence Agency has been severely
damaged by the Aldrich Ames spy  case. Moreover, the CIA has failed to predict
crucially important  developments, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The intelligence  community, like the
Defense Department, has been forced to  finance much of the so-called peace
dividend through drastic reductions  in budgets and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many issues must be resolved if the U.S. is to maintain robust  and highly

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The U.S. intelligence community consists of the
Central  Intelligence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the  intelligence
units of the armed services; the National Security Agency,  which monitors and
analyzes worldwide radio-telephone and other  electronic transmissions; and the
National Reconnaissance  Office, which gathers and processes satellite imagery.
The CIA is  forbidden by law to conduct intelligence activities inside the U.S.;
 domestic intelligence and internal security are the responsibility  of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Overall coordination and  direction of foreign
intelligence is provided by the Director of  Central Intelligence (DCI),
although military intelligence operates  with a high degree of autonomy within
this structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The DCI is appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, which means the CIA is subject to a certain degree of  political
pressure from the White House. Ideally, however, the DCI is  objective and &quot;non-political,&quot;
since intelligence findings tailored  to fit political objectives can be
useless, if not actually dangerous  and misleading.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Most U.S. intelligence on foreign activities is derived from 
monitoring electronic emissions (radio and telephone traffic) and  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  satellites orbiting high above
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Information gained from satellites is vital, especially in 
wartime. Satellites allow the U.S. to detect and track missile launches;  to
track the movements of foreign ground, air, and naval forces;  and to monitor
compliance with arms control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Although America's intelligence collection from satellites 
and signals intercepts is highly effective, the U.S. intelligence  community
relies heavily on high technology and neglects  intelligence from human sources
(HUMINT). There is no substitute for  the information provided by trained or
knowledgeable human  observers. People can enter underground or covered
facilities which  satellite sensors cannot observe. Only people can penetrate 
terrorist cells or drug networks, and only human agents can provide  some
assessment of an adversary's intentions.

</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has failed to resolve these  fundamental issues,
or even to undertake any serious reappraisal  of America's intelligence needs.
Nor has Clinton been able to  improve CIA morale in the wake of the Aldrich Ames
disaster.  Instead, the Administration has presided over a reduction of 
intelligence agency budgets and personnel without any clear rationale  or
understanding of the changing role of intelligence in the  post-Cold 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  War world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The intelligence community is being downsized at a rate of  3-5 percent per
year, with some vital components losing as much as  80 percent of their
personnel. Moreover, the Administration has  failed to recognize that the
national intelligence mission has not  diminished substantially with the end of
the Cold War; it has  become broader and more complex. While reducing its
resources, the  Administration continues to impose on the intelligence community
 a growing range of tasks, such as supporting arms control and  other
international agreements being pursued by the White House  and monitoring
developments in trouble spots like Somalia,  Rwanda, Haiti, and the Balkans
where the Administration has  committed U.S. forces to peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By demanding more of the intelligence community while  cutting its
resources, the Clinton Administration is in danger of  stretching America's
intelligence capabilities to the breaking point.  The President is jeopardizing
the intelligence community's ability  to provide strategic warning in the event
of conflict and to  furnish vital analysis to the national command authority in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that the Administration has politicized the  CIA by &quot;cooking&quot;
intelligence findings to support preconceived  positions. Perhaps the most
glaring example has been  the Administration's attempt to downplay the ballistic
missile threat  to the continental United States in order to justify its
opposition  to national missile defense<B>.

Administration and Congress should:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Stabilize the budget, personnel, and

the  Administration to conduct a thorough assessment of the types of

has not been done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Shore up the human side of espionage. </B> Because
America's  high technology is superior, the intelligence community has 
developed a strong technocratic bias. It often neglects the human side of 
intelligence gathering. Technical intelligence is valuable, but it has  its
limits. Only people can get inside an underground weapons  storage facility or,
more important, get inside the thinking of a  potential aggressor or penetrate a
terrorist cell. Improving human  intelligence will require institutional change
that assures career  advancement for officers who are aggressive in recruiting
and  &quot;running&quot; informants and operatives and that allows agency
officers to  use commonsense criteria in recruiting foreign operatives and 
informants. Common sense suggests that foreign informants  sometimes will be
unsavory characters. As long as these informants do  not harm Americans, the
U.S. should not assume responsibility for  all their actions merely because they
are informants or working  on contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Generate more innovation and creativity in the

 science. The problem with U.S. intelligence is not lack of data,  but lack of
imagination and creativity in concluding what the data  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  saying, in discerning the
patterns and trends suggested by the  data. The CIA needs to reward agents in
the field for innovative  collection methods. It also needs to reward analysts
for foresight,  insight, and good judgment in drawing proper conclusions from
the  information collected. The DCI must not merely manage the  Agency but lead
it. That means ending the mindset of risk-averse,  bureaucratic caution that
dominates the CIA.

<P><B>Q. Why do we need spies now that the Cold War is over?

</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America and its allies still face a variety of threats and  new
challenges to vital interests even though the Cold War is over.  The radical
downsizing of U.S. military forces makes it more  crucial than ever that America
have the best possible intelligence, both  to provide early warning of crisis to
the commander in chief and  to provide policy options for dealing with the
complex new  challenges of the post-Cold War world.

<P><B>Q. With the end of the Soviet military threat, wouldn't U.S. 
intelligence assets be put to better use gathering information  on America's
competition in technology and trade?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. government needs to stay out of corporate  espionage.
Some argue that the U.S., while no longer engaged in a  military confrontation
with the Soviet Union, should see itself as  engaged in an economic war with
rest of the world. Such claims are  alarmist at least, and deceptive at best. If
American corporations want  to engage in the normal and legal gathering of
business  information, that is their choice. But diverting U.S. government 
intelligence agencies to spy for U.S. business risks discrediting  the
government's legitimate function. Recent allegations that the  CIA spied for the
United State Trade Representative's office  during automotive negotiations with
Japan are a case in point. Instead  of spying for American corporations, which
are private entities  not deserving of official support, intelligence agencies
should  be monitoring the sales of Russian nuclear weapons and the  movements of
Iranian submarines operating in the Persian Gulf.

America and other Third World countries, even  including some allegedly guilty

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Informants are not the same as field officers, or what  are
loosely termed &quot;agents.&quot;  No one would hold a New York  policeman
responsible for the actions of a drug dealer turned  informant, especially if
the offending actions have nothing to do with the  undercover operation. The
same is true regarding CIA  informants. However, under no circumstances should
the CIA protect an  informant or contract employee who harms a fellow American. 
When such cases come to light, the Agency should terminate the  relationship at
once and report the criminal to the proper authorities,  even if it means losing
a valuable source of information.

<P>America's foreign aid program is coming under increasing  scrutiny, not only
by the American public, but also in Congress.  Although the $12 billion a year
spent on foreign aid represents a  relatively small part of the federal budget,
more and more  skeptics argue that this program is a waste of taxpayers' money.
There  is little evidence to support the contentions of proponents that  foreign
aid is vital to America's national interest. There is even  less evidence that
this money actually helps alleviate poverty in  less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why, then, has foreign aid proved to be one of the hardest  programs to cut
or eliminate?  The main reason is the way the  program is structured. The
foreign aid program has three major  elements. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First</B> is military and security assistance to promote
America's  national security abroad. Consisting of such undertakings as 
anti-narcotics efforts, joint military training exercises between U.S.  and
foreign forces, and grants to foreign countries to purchase  U.S. military
equipment, this program accounts for about 25 percent  of the overall foreign
aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second</B> is humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to aid 
victims of natural disaster and prevent mass starvation. This program  accounts
for some 15 percent of the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third</B> is economic and development assistance to promote  economic
growth in less developed countries. This program  consumes about 60 percent of
the foreign aid budget. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The debate over foreign aid often has centered on funding  levels for these
three major components. During the Cold War, the  U.S. funneled significant
amounts of military and security aid, as  well as economic and development
assistance, to its allies in the  fight against communism. Now that the Soviet
Union has  collapsed, however, critics of the program wonder why America needs 
to spend $12 billion a year around the globe. The Clinton  Administration argues
that the program is still needed to support  America's interests abroad.
Skeptics, many of whom questioned the merits  of the economic aid program even
during the Cold War, argue that  it makes even less sense today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many proposals have surfaced, from abolishing the Agency  for International
Development (AID), the agency in charge of  distributing America's foreign aid
dollars, to moving remaining  funding 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  and programs into existing
departments like State and  Defense. Another &quot;reform&quot; proposal would
increase the budget to face  the new challenges of the post-Cold War era and
re-focus the  program on what is called &quot;sustainable economic development&quot;
of  poorer countries. This is the argument made by the Clinton  Administration.

<P>There is bipartisan consensus that foreign aid needs to be  reformed. The
Clinton Administration's own study on  reinventing government argues that AID
does not have a single, clearly  defined and articulated strategic mission.
Shortly after this study  was issued, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced his  proposal for an enhanced Department of International Relations 
in which AID and other agencies would be abolished and their  functions assumed
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The State Department authorization bill would have moved  USIA, the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and  AID into the State Department. The
bill was derailed by  opposition from the Clinton Administration and Senate
Democrats, led  by Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The House of Representatives 
approved these consolidations in June 1995, and Senator Kerry  and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  (R-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  NC) agreed to a plan to cut the
operating expenses of these  agencies. Consolidation proponents believe that
these cuts will  force the Clinton Administration to move these three agencies
into  the State Department. A House-Senate conference report awaits  approval by
the Senate and the President, who has threatened to  veto the bill.

<P>
</P>
<P>The 1996 appropriations bill for foreign aid has been passed  by both houses
of Congress and signed by the President. This  measure cuts foreign aid spending
from $14.3 billion in FY 1995 to  $12.1 billion in FY 1996. The 1996
appropriations bill also includes  language requiring AID to submit to Congress
a detailed report  outlining the relative levels of economic freedom of foreign
aid  recipients. This report will make it more difficult for AID to  continue to
give money to countries with economically unfree or  repressed economies.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Phase out corporate welfare.</B> America's corporate
welfare  system, which includes the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas  Private
Investment Corporation, diverts money from the pockets of  the American taxpayer
to preferred big businesses. Coddling of  private business by the U.S.
government with tax dollars is not  needed. America already is the largest
exporter in the world, and most  of its exporting companies are doing very well
indeed without  corporate welfare. These funds would be spent far better if left

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Abolish the Agency for International Development, along  with most
of its functions, and move any remaining functions to  the State Department.</B>
AID is the main reason America continues  to waste so much money on foreign aid.
If Congress cannot pass  authorizing legislation that eliminates AID, it should
refuse to  appropriate any money for the agency's operating expenses until  such
legislation is signed into law. Moreover, international  development assistance
does not work. Countries receiving economic aid  for over 35 years are no better
off today than they were before.  Thus, not only should AID be abolished, but so
should the entire  development assistance program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Require the President to certify to Congress that any security 
and military aid sent abroad is necessary to support U.S. national  security
interests.</B> The foreign aid account is more than just  development
assistance; it also includes funds for military and  security assistance. It is
widely claimed that this money directly  supports the national interest abroad
by enhancing U.S. influence in  international affairs. However, many of
America's foreign aid  recipients routinely vote against the U.S. in the United
Nations; the  voting records of the U.N. show that three out of every four
recipients  of U.S. foreign aid vote against America more than half the time. 
<B> </B>If Congress is asked to appropriate foreign aid for the purpose  of
promoting the national interest, it should get more than a  promise from the
White House that it will get the job done.  Congress should require the
President to certify that U.S. foreign aid  supports American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Phase out funding for the World Bank, the International  Monetary 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  Fund, and the other multilateral
development banks.</B> These  multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been no
more  successful at promoting economic growth in less developed countries  than
has AID. In fact, a strong case can be made that they have had  less success
than AID. Since the 1950s, the World Bank and the  IMF have disbursed over $350
billion to less developed countries.  Most of these countries are no better off
today than they were  before receiving their money. In fact, many are worse off.
The  U.S. should phase out financial support to these institutions.

</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you call for cutting aid to the poor at a time  when more
people are living in poverty around the globe than ever  before?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because most economic aid perpetuates poverty. The only  way poor
countries can break out of the poverty trap is to stop  depending on foreign
aid. In this day and age, poverty is not the  natural condition of mankind; it
is a condition imposed by corrupt  governments which repress their economies.
Foreign aid does not  help countries develop. Most long-term recipients are no
better off  today then they were 30 years ago. If poor countries do not  adopt
economically free policies, they will remain poor, no matter  how much money we
throw at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You say foreign aid does not work. How come the  Marshall Plan, the
largest foreign aid program, is considered successful?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Marshall Plan was not development aid. It was a plan  to
rebuild already developed countries. But underdeveloped  countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  are not rebuilding an established
infrastructure; they are trying  to acquire one. They also do not have the
established  free-market economic foundations that post-war Europe had. Thus, 
while money spent in post-war Europe helped rebuild roads and  bridges, foreign
aid in the less developed world has done little good  because no amount of
foreign aid could provide the degree of  modernization and industrialization
which existed in Europe  before World War II.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Agency for International Development has been  extremely
successful in improving child mortality rates, providing  vaccinations, and
helping to feed those in immediate need of food.  How can you support cutting
funding for programs which help to  keep people alive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because Americans, as private citizens, are doing a better  job
than government in helping people. Americans spend some  $12 billion a year on
private overseas charities. AID spends less  than $100 million on disaster
relief and related programs. If  America has helped children and the poor in
less developed countries, it  is mainly because of the work of these private
charities.  Private charities are far more effective than AID, which is a 
bureaucracy that spends some 70 cents of every foreign aid dollar  within
America's borders. It is far better to give to private charities  than to waste
taxpayer dollars on American professors who, on  AID contracts, do nothing more
than write studies of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't foreign aid necessary at least for countries trying to  develop
free markets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No, but it can be useful if properly conceived, managed,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  targeted. Private foreign
investors spend some $18 billion a  year investing abroad. Those private
investments are much larger  than the $12 billion government dispenses each year
in foreign aid.  Foreign investment, not foreign aid, is necessary for  economic
growth. To attract foreign investment, governments must cut  taxes, privatize
business, eliminate regulations, and institute other  similar reforms. In most
cases, foreign governments do not need aid  to implement these reforms (the
obvious exceptions being  former Eastern Bloc nations, which can use it
constructively for  education and training to encourage the creation of market
institutions). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <B>Q.Won't cutting foreign aid result in more Somalias and Haitis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Both Haiti and Somalia are long-term recipients of  foreign
aid. Somalia has been hooked on U.S. foreign aid for 40  years, receiving over
$750 million since 1955. Yet Somalia is  poorer today than it was in 1965. Haiti
has received almost $1 billion  in foreign aid over 51 years, and it also is
poorer today than it was  in 1965. If economic aid is so necessary to create
economic  development in poor countries, why has it not worked in these two 
countries?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't the U.S. foreign aid program at least help  American
businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, it helps some businesses, contractors, and consultants.  But
this should not be the purpose of foreign aid. Choosing  winners and losers in
the market is not the proper business of  government. Rewarding special
interests with federal dollars will not help  poor countries abroad.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You may call it corporate welfare, but shouldn't Washington  be doing
all it can to help American businesses export?  After  all, exports mean jobs
for Americans. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. is the largest exporter in the world and would  remain
so without government subsidies, which help only a few  of America's businesses.
Many now-subsidized trade deals would  be made without this government
financing. Yes, some  businesses seem to &quot;win&quot; from government
subsidies, but the losers are  the American taxpayers who pay for these
programs. This  money should be left in the hands of the people who earned it
rather  than given to those who happen to have powerful friends in  Washington.

<P>Public diplomacy is the means by which the U.S.  government communicates
directly to the peoples of foreign countries.  Essentially, it involves the
information and cultural activities of  the United States government. Public
diplomacy enables the U.S.  government to present its perspective to people in
other countries  and to provide accurate information about the U.S. to those who
 otherwise would never receive it, preferably in a manner other  cultures will
find credible. These efforts take place outside of the  standard channels of
diplomacy  specifically, outside the State  Department, which conducts formal
diplomatic relations with other  nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this age of information, mass communication is rapid,  virtually 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  global, and accessible with
unprecedented ease to a larger  number of people than ever before. Information
can affect mass  sentiment and public opinion in foreign nations, and therefore
the policy  decisions of foreign governments. In certain situations, ideas  and
imagery can have greater impact than bombs and bullets.  Thus, public diplomacy,
particularly the direct dissemination of  policy decisions and the rationale for
making them, remains an  important tool of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A prime example of the impact of public diplomacy is the fall  of the Soviet
Union. The Soviets could not compete in the  modern world without opening up
their captive empire to new forms  of information and communication technology.
Once that  happened, they no longer could isolate their people from Western
ideals  of democracy, free markets, and individual liberty. It was the 
communication and popularization of these ideals which eroded  the legitimacy of
Communism and, as much as Western  military strength, eventually brought the
Soviet structure crashing down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some liberals criticize public diplomacy as a form of  propaganda. They see
it as a camouflage for activities that are improper for  the U.S. government.
This position flows from the Left's  reflexive &quot;blame America&quot;
attitude. Those who hold this view  evidently believe that America's
institutions are deeply flawed, and  that America's founding principles are
irrelevant to nations  struggling to find their way in the chaotic post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some conservatives are critical of public diplomacy as well.  They believe
that America should concentrate on solving internal  domestic problems like
out-of-control deficits and excessive  federal spending. These skeptics believe
that reaching foreign publics  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  American ideals should be
subordinated to other, more  pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While most Members of Congress support official U.S.  broadcasting, there is
no consensus in Congress or in the Administration  on how much the U.S. should
spend on public diplomacy. Nor is  there unanimity on how the official
components of public  diplomacy, such as the United States Information Agency,
should be  organized.

<P>Public diplomacy agencies and media have undergone  significant
reorganization since the Cold War ended. The Board for  International
Broadcasting was abolished at the end of 1995 by  presidential decision, and
funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty, formerly handled by the Board,
will be disseminated  directly through the United States Information Agency
(USIA), an  independent executive branch agency. This emphasizes USIA's role  as
America's primary arm of public diplomacy. However, even  while public diplomacy
is being consolidated under USIA, its budget  has been severely curtailed. The
USIA budget in FY 1993 was  $965 million. The budget for FY 1995 was $520
million.

<P>
</P>
<P>Neither Congress nor the Administration has provided  adequate support for
U.S. international broadcasting. For example,  the Voice of America (VOA), the

congressional  &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; resulting in the loss of 400 uniquely
skilled  professionals and the ability to broadcast in 20 foreign languages.
These  cuts in FY 1996 come on top of others mandated in the FY 1994

reduced to more appropriate levels.  At the same time, the U.S. government must

media, and many forms of popular entertainment.  Why do we need the Voice of
America?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Much of the American popular entertainment that reaches  the
world  rock music and Hollywood films, for example     conveys a jaundiced view
of America, giving some countries one more  excuse to condemn the United States.
And CNN, while virtually  a global network, does not reach an audience nearly as
wide,  diverse, or strategically targeted as the audience for U.S.  government
broadcasting. Nor can CNN speak on behalf of the U.S.  government. We cannot
rely on Ted Turner to give our official  spokesmen the opportunity to tell
America's story, directly and  unfiltered, in a future world crisis. The United
States, as the  world's only remaining superpower, must retain this &quot;surge
capacity.&quot;   Pop culture and Hollywood shouldn't be the only broadcasters 
of American values abroad. America still needs an official voice  to explain its
policies.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the functions of USIA be merged into the State  department?</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some have argued that this would reduce bureaucratic  duplication
and save money, but any savings are offset by the fact  that USIA's basic role 
reaching foreign publics directly  often  conflicts with the State Department's
role in negotiating with  foreign government officials.

<p> 
</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost opinion polls show that Americans are not very interested  in
foreign policy issues. Indeed, a CNN/<I>USA  Today</I>/Gallup poll early in
1996 found that only 14 percent of Americans regard  foreign policy as a top
priority in forming their vote. Nonetheless,  the American people still demand
that America have a strong  foreign policy that fulfills certain expectations.
These expectations  include maintaining America's leadership in the world,
upholding the  respect of other countries for America, and protecting  America's
interests and the country's future. Therefore, even though  Americans may
express little overt interest in specific foreign  issues, they have a latent
expectation that Presidents fulfill certain  expectations. Disappointing these
expectations can prove to be  politically fatal for a President.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American people are not isolationist; rather they are  largely
indifferent to foreign policy issues, focusing instead on more  immediate
domestic concerns. Isolationism implies America  must intentionally work alone
without allies, without concerning  itself with foreign matters at all.
Isolationism also implies trade  protectionism. Opinion polls show that
Americans are not  isolationist. They still want a strong America, although one
that relates  foreign policy problems to domestic concerns. Americans are 
worried about too much intervention abroad, but they understand the  need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  for the U.S. to remain engaged in
global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the end of the Gulf War, there has not been a  compelling issue to
ignite the latent interest of Americans in foreign policy.  If there were a
crisis with a clear impact on American security  and vital interests overseas,
foreign policy would return to the top  of political priorities in the polls.

include as potential enemies Russia,  China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya.
Here are some possible  levels that have bee suggested for U.S. spending. Please
tell me  which one makes the most sense to you. 1. The U.S. spend a bit  more
than its most powerful enemy. 2. The U.S. should spend about  as much as all of
its potential enemies combined. 3. The U.S.  should spend about twice as much as
all its potential enemies  combined. (Poll by <I>Americans on Defense Spending

<P><B>5. Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet December 7,
1995
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This fact sheet provides information on the role and mission of  the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why The U.S. Must Play A Role In IFOR</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The United States has vital political, economic and security  interests in
Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens these interests.  We now have the first real
opportunity to end this war. To seize  this opportunity requires a commitment of
U.S. troops as part of  a NATO peace implementation force (IFOR). The risks to 
the United States of allowing the war to continue are greater than  the risks of
enforcing the peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What U.S. Forces Will Do At First</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will take approximately eight weeks for the entire U.S. force  of
approximately 20,000 soldiers to arrive in the northeastern  portion of Bosnia,
with a division headquarters in Tuzla. Most of  the troops will come from the
1st Armored Division in Germany.  They will travel to Bosnia mainly by road and
rail using routes that  are currently in use and clear of mines. A Nordic
brigade and a  reinforced Turkish battalion will also be located in the U.S. 
sector which will be under the control of the U.S. Army Major  General William
Nash, the commander of the 1st Armored Division.  Eventually a Russian brigade
will also be located in the U.S. sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When this main body of U.S. forces arrives, they will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force
</P>
<P>-      Execute transfer of the U.S. sector from the United Nations  Protec
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  tion Force (UNPROFOR)
</P>
<P>-     Establish Joint Military Commissions
</P>
<P>-     Establish a logistic network
</P>
<P>-     Expand the Tuzla airfield
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two complementary aspects of the overall peace  implementation
mission  civil and military. The civil aspect  includes rebuilding the Bosnian
infrastructure, economic  development, elections, and refugee resettling  not an
IFOR mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The military aspect  the mission of IFOR  is to create a  stable environment
for the civil aspects to proceed. IFOR, including  U.S. forces, will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force by ensuring self-defense and freedom of
 movement for IFOR
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce required withdrawal of forces to respective territories
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Establish a man a zone of separation
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce the cessation of hostilities
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-      Provide a secure environment which permits conduct of  civil peace
implementation functions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NATO and U.S. forces will enforce a peace, not fight a war.  Robust NATO
rules of engagement reflect the philosophy of  sending in a heavy force,
authorized to use deadly force for self  defense, force protection, and to
enforce compliance with the peace plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the U.N. mission, there is no dual key in  NATO's rules of
engagement. Field commanders will have authority to  defend troops under their
command and to ensure compliance  with the military aspects of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFORs first task will be to oversee the withdrawal of  Federation and
Bosnian Serb forces behind the agreed cease-fire line  within thirty days. Once
this is done, IFOR will monitor and patrol a  four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide
Zone of Separation along the  internal boundaries between Federation and Bosnian
Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What Parties Must Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beginning when the peace agreement is signed in Paris on  December 14, the
parties to the agreement  the Bosnian Federation  and the Bosnian Serbs  have
specific time frames by which they  must meet specific obligations, as follows:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     DAY 1 Begin withdrawing forces, removing mines from Zones
 of Separation, making boundaries
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 3 Air defense radar shut down
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 30 Foreign troops (mercenaries, etc.) out of Bosnia.  Military
forces complete withdrawal behind cease fire lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 45 Complete withdrawal behind inter-entity boundary lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 120 Complete withdrawal of all heavy weapons and  forces to
cantonment/barracks areas
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 180 Complete negotiations of arms limits
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Not Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not patrol Bosnia's external borders.
According to  the peace settlement, supervision of Bosnia's external borders
will  be done by other organizations, most likely the International  Commission
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), which currently  performs this function.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not act as a police force. That function will be the
 responsibility of the civilian side of the peace implementation  operation.
IFOR personnel will have the authority to detain any  persons who interfere with
the IFOR mission or those individuals who  may be indicted for war crimes, but
they will not try to track  them down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      IFOR will not be involved in reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, political reform, or human rights efforts. Other civilian  agencies and
organizations will be responsible for those tasks. IFOR  also will not be
involved in arming and training Bosnian  Federation forces, if that becomes
necessary to achieve equilibrium  with Bosnian Serb forces.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>When IFOR Will Leave</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFOR will deploy long enough to give the civil aspects an  opportunity to
take hold and start making an impact on the lives of  the people of Bosnia. With
high confidence, we believe the  military mission can be completed in
approximately twelve months  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  the start of deployment. (If
there were to be a complete  breakdown of the settlement, the President does
have the authority to  withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The civil aspects will continue for many years. However, at  the time of
IFOR's withdrawal, conditions in Bosnia will be  substantially different and
more stable than they are today. The forces  will have been separated, the
territories will have been transferred,  and the cycle of violence will have
been broken. We expect the  newly-elected government to take root and economic
reconstruction to  be under way.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html ">FYI #90</a>, <I>How the Armey-Shelby Flat Tax Would Affect the Middle Class</I></b>, by William W. Beach & Daniel J. Mitchell (March 12, 1996)<br>
<P>
Analyzes exactly how much average taxpayers would save under the proposed Armey-Shelby 17% flat tax. Three tables show the amount of savings within specific income brackets.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">FYI #87</a>, <I>Worst Case Scenario: Flat Tax Would Boost Home Values by 7 Percent or More</I></b>, by William W. Beach & Daniel J. Mitchell (February 12, 1996)
<p>
A widely quoted analysis of the economic effects of the flat tax on housing prices shows a 15% drop in housing values. That study's methodology, however, is seriously flawed. This Heritage econometric analysis shows a 7% to 14 % increase in home values.
<P>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">FYI #86</a>, <I>The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State</I></b>, by William W. Beach & Daniel J. Mitchell (February 7, 1996)
<p>
Comparing a 17% flat tax and a 20% flat tax to current tax rates, this state-by-state breakdown shows the savings states and individuals will experience under a flat tax.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi85.html">FYI #85</a>, <I>Why Liberals Should Support the Flat Tax</I></b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell (February 7, 1996)
<p>
Presents eight features of a flat tax that one would assume to fit the liberal agenda.  Income-based charts show the equality and effectiveness of a flat tax, illustrating how rich taxpayers would pay more in taxes and people who make less than $30,000 would pay no federal tax.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bgup268.html">Backgrounder Update #268</a>, <I>Making Sense of Competing Tax Reform Plans</I></b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell (February 22, 1996)
<p>
Compares the main points of the Forbes, Gramm, and Buchanan flat tax plans, along with the report of the (Kemp) National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">Backgrounder #1055</a>, <I>Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America?</I></b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell (September 26, 1995)
<p>
Examines the problems with the current tax system and compares it to a number of tax reform proposals including the Army-Shelby flat tax, the Specter flat tax, the Value-added tax, the National Sales Tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax.
<p>
<I>NOTE: <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">Backgrounder #1055</a> and <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bgup268.html">Backgrounder Update #268</a> use the same criteria to grade the specific tax reform plans.</I>

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/prfost.html">Policy Review #73</a>, <I>Even Money: A Friendly Critique of the Flat Tax</I></b>, by J.D. Foster (July 1995)
<p>
What kinds of problems could the middle-class taxpayers and business owners specifically face with a flat tax?  A chief economist of the Tax Foundation gives his expert opinion.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/prarmey.html">Policy Review #73</a>, <I>Caveat Emptor:  The Case Against the National Sales Tax</I></b>, by Dick Armey (July 1995)
<p>
Representative Armey outlines the reasons why the United States should avoid a national sales tax. He argues that any sales tax inevitably would become a complex value-added tax that would, among other things, slow the economy and encourage a black market.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1035.html">Backgrounder #1035</a>, <I>Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax</I></b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell (May 25,1995)
<p>
This flat tax analysis examines the positive effects of a flat tax on the economy, including producing economic growth and national wealth, providing simpler filing requirements, and increasing tax collections from the wealthy.
<p>
<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/tp7.html">Talking Points</a>, <I>A Brief Guide to the Flat Tax</I></b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell (March 22, 1995)
<p>
Provides a brief explanation of how the flat tax works and answers some common questions about the tax, emphasizing economic growth and filing simplicity.

<h3>Why It's So Hard To Save</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it. Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The flip side is equally clear: If you tax something, you get less of it. For example, a few years back the government slapped a "luxury" tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000. The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up --  throwing their workers into the unemployment line. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less. Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire). The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent. After one year, you've earned $50. Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it. But that's not enough. The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you. It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year. The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency. And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man. The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again. Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort. If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a better way. A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the <a href="http://www.savers.org">Savers & Investors League</a> of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard. IRAs? In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start. He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less. So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<h3>UNITED NATIONS DAY:  NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION</h3>
By Brett Schaefer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
	On Oct. 24, we all were expected to bear witness to the great achievements of the United Nations. The organization and its supporters scrambled to hide its misdeeds and dust off its few accomplishments. But they failed to conceal the truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United Nations, despite the claims of reform by Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the Clinton administration, remains rife with abuse, waste, fraud and ineffectiveness. Topping the list is wasteful spending on both materials and personnel. In a 1995 article, <i>Money</i> magazine revealed that U.N. employees commonly earn more than twice the pay of comparable positions in New York-based private-sector jobs. In addition to their salaries, the roughly 10,000 U.N. bureaucrats in New York receive an array of special perks including rent allowances and education grants for their children. To top it off, it's all tax free. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These lucrative positions are, for the most part, not even being filled with competent individuals. Vested interests regard U.N. jobs as opportunities for nepotism and high pay for little work. U.N. employees are not held to any realistic standards of employee evaluation. The U.N. bureaucracy is populated by individuals who fail to meet the basic requirements of an effective civil service. The evaluation system is so abysmal that the U.N. leadership has tried to reform it at least five times. Yet the current system, under which 90 percent of U.N. employees received "excellent" ratings in the recent past, continues with only cosmetic changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, such employees aren't anxious to have their work habits exposed. In 1995 the United Nations bought a $1 million turnstile security system for its New York headquarters, but never used it. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have recorded the arrival and departure times of U.N. employees. Heaven forbid: They would have had to work an entire day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the full range of problems remains hidden because, until 1995, the world body refused to establish an inspector general's office to root out waste, corruption and inefficiency. When it finally did appoint an inspector general, it did so reluctantly, under threat from the U.S. Congress to withhold funding. Moreover, U.N. officials weakened the office by having the inspector general serve under the authority of the secretary general and by failing to grant the office an independent budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This incredible commitment to waste and inefficiency has spurred the United States -- which provides 25 percent of U.N. funding -- to periodically withhold some of its dues. This has resulted in arrears of approximately $1.2 billion. Congress has refused to pay these arrears until the United Nations pledges to undertake reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United States has chosen the proper course. The world body is in a perpetual state of financial crisis and is cash strapped. Withholding funding is the most effective way to get the U.N. bureaucracy's attention and encourage reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The first step toward reform must be an independent audit. The problems can't be fixed until we know in detail what they are. This can best be accomplished by an independent inspector general with a competent staff and budget immune to U.N. pressure. The U.N. system has resisted past reform efforts and will not refrain from using budget blackmail to manipulate the inspector general's office. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is also imperative that the inspector general have complete access to all U.N. and related agency records. A primary goal of this audit should be  not only to identify corruption, waste, fraud and abuse, but also to identify which of the United Nation's 70-plus programs are worth continuing, which should be eliminated, and which should be transferred to other organizations that can perform them better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only when such an audit is completed and management and organizational reforms have been implemented should U.S. back dues be paid. For the United States to pay in full before reform is implemented would be like giving a child his allowance before he completes his chores. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only after an independent audit has been performed and U.N. operations reformed  can Americans sincerely say "Happy United Nations Day."

<title>Drunk on Power - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRUNK ON POWER</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more important to many Americans than presidential debates, congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The proper response of the American people to this punitive level of taxation should be clear: revolt. At least that's what another group of Americans did when the federal government levied an excessive tax on their liquor. It was the Summer of 1794. To protest an excise tax placed on their whiskey three years earlier, angry citizens in the Northeastern states rose up against their federal overlords, tarring and feathering government officials and burning down their homes. Before you try this at home, a word of caution: The feds had a pretty strong opinion about the "Whiskey Rebellion" protesters. They shot them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, it's not likely that we'll see today's overtaxed beer drinkers take to the streets. The reason: Beer drinkers have at best a dim understanding that they're even being taxed. The sales and excise taxes that apply to beer are largely "hidden." Consumers see only the final sales price of beer that rings up on the cash register, never realizing that their $15 case costs only $8.50 before taxes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But just because beer taxes are hidden doesn't mean their effect isn't real, both on beer drinkers' wallets and on the economy. Consider: Since 1990, when beer taxes were boosted as part of a larger tax package, the beer industry has lost 60,000 jobs, according to The Beer Institute. When American brewers pay seven times more in taxes than they earn in profits, it's difficult to retain their workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To add insult to injury, the other taxes that were part of the 1990 package -- notably on yachts, private planes, jewelry and furs -- have all been repealed. This is great for people with disposable incomes of around, say, a million dollars, but it does nothing for the little guy who pays the beer tax (nearly two-thirds of all the beer sold in America each year is bought by households earning less than $45,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Fortunately, relief may be at hand. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., has introduced legislation that would cut the beer tax in half -- back to its pre-1990 level. "Because they are concealed," English says, "these taxes engender little opposition from the taxpayers. But they contribute tangibly to the cost of living for hard-working Americans." No kidding. If you buy just one $5 six-pack a week, by the end of the year you've forked over $112 in taxes to the government. That's more than a full day's work for the average wage earner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, English's proposal is sure to meet with opposition from those who think cutting the beer tax will lead to increased alcohol consumption. These folks -- let's call them liberals -- view the tax code as a powerful tool for bending human behavior to fit their preferences. And at the moment, beer drinking is one activity definitely frowned upon by the wine-and-cheese crowd.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ironies are delicious. Not only do liberals, the traditional advocates of "progressive" taxation, wind up supporting a tax that falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans, but these self-styled champions of "the worker" also ignore the fact that the beer tax hurts an industry that employs 2.6 million people -- everything from assembly-line workers in bottling plants to delivery-truck drivers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it, the beer tax is a raw deal. But don't expect change anytime soon. Maybe it's their nature, but too many lawmakers are addicted to controlling people's lives through levies like the beer tax. In short, they're drunk on power.
<p>

Thierer examines how unnecessary regulations hurt Americas international competitiveness, with a particular focus on communications policy, electricity deregulation, antitrust law, and environmental risk regulation. 
<p>
Thierer's work on telecommunications has been featured in <i>The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, The Journal of Commerce, Communications Daily, Washington Telecom Week, Issues in Science and Technology, Consumers' Research</i>, and many other newspapers and newsletters. His proposals on universal service, interconnection policy, foreign ownership restrictions, Internet regulation, and wireless spectrum reform, have been credited as having a shaping influence on telecommunications legislation debated on Capitol Hill.
  <p>
Prior to joining The Heritage Foundation in March of 1992, Thierer spent time in London, England at the Adam Smith Institute where he worked on reform of the British legal system. Currently at Heritage, Thierer is conducting research on the effects of a comprehensive privatization program for publicly-held lands in the western United States.
  <p>
Thierer earned his B.A. in political science and journalism at Indiana University, and received his M.A. in international business management at the University of Maryland.

<title>What Would George Washington Say? -- Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>WHAT WOULD GEORGE WASHINGTON SAY?</h3>
By Matthew Spalding<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Imagine picking up your morning newspaper and reading the headline: "President To Resign; Issues Solemn Warnings To Nation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This startling news greeted readers of Philadelphia's largest newspaper on the morning of Sept. 19, 1796, when George Washington unexpectedly announced his retirement from the presidency of the United States. The nation would have been happy to see him continue.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But our first president wanted to set an example for his successors, and as he left public life he offered the nation a document that is one of the greatest in American history. On its 200th anniversary, Washington's Farewell Address -- although remembered primarily for its advice on foreign affairs -- gives us much insight into how he might view America in the 1990s. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In it, Washington warned us of the dangers of Big Government. He told us to watch out for the tendency of government to encroach on individual freedoms and consolidate its power. What American can say this warning has not been justified by subsequent events? "A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position," Washington said. We could add: Any doubt that might be left can be put to rest by assessing the size and reach of the U.S. government in 1996. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Our only defense against an over-reaching, tyrannical government, Washington insisted, is the Constitution's strict limits on government power. Washington said that unless these limits were carefully adhered to -- that is, unless the federal government exercised only those functions specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and by the authority of the people, and no more -- the nation would become vulnerable to "cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Could Americans' distrust of their elected representatives, their sense that government has overextended its proper authority, and that average citizens no longer have enough say in matters that affect them, be the result of disregarding Washington's warning? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party" and the notorious problem of faction. By this he didn't mean what me mean by "parties," but instead what we call "special-interest groups" pushing their own single-issue agendas at the expense of wider, more serious concerns having to do with the common good. He called partisan spirit "a fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	How many times in recent decades have Americans watched in despair as partisanship overshadowed principle in the nation's capital; as one special interest in Congress prevented another from passing a good law? Washington believed fundamental change in a free government comes about not through clever strategies, "hot button" issues or attack ads but by honest deliberation, patient persuasion, and a willingness to put principle above self-interest.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In his Farewell Address, Washington also told Americans that while their Constitution creates a framework for good government, it could only work if the people govern themselves rightly. In the absence of governmental restraints, the people would have to restrain their own passions and prejudices. Washington meant to encourage religion and morality as "indispensable supports" for political prosperity. He cautioned Americans never to expect virtue from their elected representatives if they were not moral, virtuous people themselves.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Two centuries later social scientists are just discovering what Washington always knew: that religious belief and moral education are the surest social inoculation against crime, drug abuse,  illegitimacy and practically every other social ill one can name. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	By ignoring much of Washington's advice, America has moved far down the path he said had "hitherto marked the Destiny of Nations." Today our government is virtually unlimited and out of control; politics is dominated by base factionalism and personal invective; our culture is adrift from the breakup of community and the family; we increasingly question our national purpose and role in the world.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Amidst these seemingly intractable problems, Americans would do well to look to the father of their country -- and the Farewell Address -- for guidance. His "counsels of an old and affectionate friend," as he called them, are as true in 1996 as they were in 1796.

<h3>DON'T BRAKE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Tyce Palmaffy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Americans have always looked on the Labor Day weekend as one last fling with summer. For most drivers, that once meant a lot of high-anxiety mileage, as they worried about keeping up with traffic while avoiding ticket-happy state troopers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But no longer. Last year Congress repealed  the National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (65 mph on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds).  Now states can set their own speed limits based on local driving conditions. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For more than 20 years, the Democratic leadership in Congress blocked all efforts to overturn this anachronism. In 1995, though, the tide changed. With their robust commitment to limited government, conservative House and Senate freshmen strongly pushed for a repeal -- and were finally successful when President Clinton reluctantly signed their bold legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the repeal's effective date. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 mph, while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The results? Highway patrolmen and state traffic engineers in Montana and in every other state I spoke with -- 11 in all -- report that average speeds have only increased one to two mph. Fatalities have actually decreased in some states. So much for safety advocates' apocalyptic predictions. 	Patrolmen and traffic engineers -- whose reputations depend on drivers' safety --resoundingly supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable speed limits. According to engineers, the proper method of determining limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The posted speed limit should be the speed that 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, drivers set the speed limit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 mph speed limits were unreasonably low -- often five or 10, and sometimes 15 mph below this driver-imposed maximum. The feds, of course, set the low limits in the name of safety. Yet, when people drive at the 85th percentile speed, they "are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," according to engineer Tom Hicks of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, says when the driver-set maximum was 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, "drivers weren't comfortable -- some drove 55, some 65, some 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. 	
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also undermine police effectiveness. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 mph limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking -- a law that threatened rather than improved safety. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 mph speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- such as undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 mph speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed," says Bill Jackman, a representative of the American Automobile Association. "If the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." With repeal of the federal limit, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.	The repeal of the national speed limit may even signal new attitudes in Washington. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others?

<h3>Wasting Your Money </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With all the talk in Washington about slashing budgets, cutting deficits and axing federal programs, you'd think it would be hard (or at least harder) to come up with stories about government waste, fraud and abuse. After all, these are the first things Congress and the White House would do something about ... right?	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wrong. Despite Congress' best efforts to trim the pork, big government is alive and well. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider:<ul>
	<li> Auditors for the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently discovered that the Baltimore Public Housing Authority had purchased eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers; hired a security firm that employed 29 convicted felons; and sold more than $25 million-worth of contracts for building repairs to contractors, some of whom were friends or relatives of Authority employees, without allowing competitive bidding. In spite of these irregularities, HUD recently awarded the housing authority $115 million more to construct 338 new apartment units.<p>
	<li> According to the General Accounting Office, the official auditing arm of Congress, the U.S. Export-Import Bank gave large bonuses to 200 of its 448 employees -- even though only 10 were eligible. Of five federal agencies reviewed for such "bonus abuse," the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force -- but accounted for one-quarter of all bonuses government-wide! <p>
	<li> The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, citizens of Spain, are two of America's richest sugar barons. Their fortune is estimated at $500 million. Because they are considered "domestic growers," the Fanjul brothers also are "entitled" to a government-enforced import-protection subsidy that adds about eight cents per pound to the cost of the sugar we buy. How much of our money are the Fanjul brothers pulling in from this subsidy each year? A cool $65 million.<p>
	<li> Financial mismanagement in the District of Columbia is legendary. In 1994, for example, Lloyd Arrington Jr., president of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), collected a $17,000 bonus on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 for parking and $600 for rented formal wear, dinners and entertainment. By the time his now nine-year old EDFC -- created to loan money to promising businesses 3/4 was audited in 1994, it had made only 17 loans, or less than two per year.<p>
	<li> HUD (again) funded and sponsored a "training session" for 260 public housing tenants and HUD employees in 1995 -- at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort! "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!! Casinos for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing & Touring etc. ... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals," read the invitation. Cost to taxpayers for a "training session" later found by the HUD Inspector General to lack "programmatic substance" (in other words, it was a boondoggle)? $325,000.<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's more -- much more. Like the new $373 million air-traffic-control system -- installed at 16 airports and destined for 47 -- that has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures. It has failed nearly once a week at Washington's National Airport. Or the Public Health Service physician who complained recently to <i>The Washington Post</i> that he is being paid $117,000 per year, plus a $15,000 bonus, to do absolutely no work at all. He made the front page. Or the $280,000 taxpayer-funded study now getting underway in Seattle to determine if a chemical widely used in sexual lubricants makes sex safer for homosexuals. Yes, you read that correctly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe now you can understand why Congress was willing to go to the mat with the administration -- to the point of allowing the government to shut down temporarily -- over federal spending. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These horror stories are just a few of the boondoggles that have been uncovered. Just think what remains hidden from view. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>Truth in Testimony</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html"> Edwin Feulner </a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is it that only liberals care about children and the needy, while conservatives seem more concerned about the well-being of defense contractors? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I ask this loaded question because it says a lot about the advocacy game as it is now played across America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While many groups and organizations do essential, valuable work in communities across the nation -- often without credit or notice -- many national "charity" groups have their hands in the pockets of taxpayers. But this is okay because they "care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the recent "Stand for Children" rally in Washington, organized by the Children's Defense Fund and led by Marian Wright Edelman,  a good friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and a leading proponent of the spend-more school of social welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The CDF's idea was flawless. By using the theme "Stand for Children," CDF made it almost impossible for anyone to question its agenda: more government spending. To do so would appear, "against children." By dubbing this approach "non-partisan," the stage was set for a liberal welfare establishment-media lovefest, with conservatives as the main course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives didn't roll over and accept defeat. Instead we showed that the liberals' motives are not always as pure as they would have us believe. In the case of the "Stand for Children" rally, many of the organizations pushing the rally are on the public take -- receiving a grand total of at least $392 million in taxpayer funding in fiscal year 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No wonder these groups argue so passionately about the need for greater federal funding and are so vicious in attacking anyone who might question it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, these are the very same groups that line up to testify whenever Congress holds hearings on whether welfare spending should be cut. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If that sounds like a conflict of interest, that's because it is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What makes the scam possible is that these groups are not required to reveal the fact that they are feasting at the public trough. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An organization might be getting 90 percent of its money directly from the federal government, and it can still go before Congress -- and the TV cameras -- and argue for more money for this program or that, without ever revealing that it is a recipient of federal funds. No wonder the welfare states keeps expanding. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's no need for a new law, no need for the president to sign legislation to rectify this situation. All the Senate and House of Representatives have to do is change their own rules so that all advocates before Congress must state how much money they receive from the government. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a "Truth in Testimony" rule, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) appearing before House and Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization received $76 million from the federal government in 1993. This just might tend to shed a new light on AARP's heart-rending requests for more spending on programs for the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, union officials testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to reveal that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe some day the media might even catch on and report on the vested interests of many who regale Congress with pitiful tales of welfare woe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Until then, taxpayers should demand that lawmakers ask tax-funded "charities" two simple questions: "What's in it for you?" and "How much is it going to cost the taxpayers?" These are two questions Congress and the media have ignored, at least so far.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>LABOR PAINS</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996</center>

	This Labor Day the country will kick back, fire up the barbecue, and take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of America's working men and women. But will those workers themselves have anything to celebrate?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is, sadly, not much. Despite a seemingly rosy employment picture -- more than 11 million new jobs since 1991 and an unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent -- the real outlook for U.S. workers remains rather grim. Scratch below the surface of these numbers, and the much-discussed economic anxiety felt by America's workers becomes perfectly understandable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For starters, job layoffs are continuing at a blistering pace. In the first six months of 1996, 271,000 Americans lost their jobs, the second-highest number this decade. Layoffs were 28 percent higher than during the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent higher than in 1993, the largest "downsizing" year of the decade.  So far this year, thousands of jobs have vanished in important industries such as telecommunications (43,000), computers (22,000), and automobiles (18,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's more, even those workers able to find new jobs are taking it on the chin: Weekly earnings in their new positions are averaging 8.2 percent less than in their old jobs. For workers aged 45 to 55 -- those with home mortgages and kids in college to support -- the pay cuts are averaging an even higher 14 percent. And to add insult to injury, nearly one of every five displaced workers lands in a new job that doesn't even offer health-insurance coverage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even these folks are better off than the large number of workers who can't find new jobs at all. The fact is, the long-term unemployment rate -- which measures the number of jobless Americans out of work for six months or more -- remains at a stubbornly high 18.5 percent. Compare this with the average of 10.3 percent during the three previous U.S. economic expansions.  Even out-of-work white-collar managers and other professionals have been having a rough time; nearly one in five is still unemployed after six months of searching.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What about those workers lucky enough to hold onto their jobs? Here, too, the news is less than upbeat. Adjusted for inflation, full-time workers' paychecks haven't increased for five years. For men, real weekly earnings have actually dropped by 5.1 percent, and for black and Hispanic men the drop has been even worse, 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The decline in weekly earnings can be partly explained by the disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Since March of 1995, the economy has shed more than 280,000 such jobs. In fact, fewer manufacturing jobs exist today than when the economic recovery began five years ago. In addition, the number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related jobs has dropped by 478,000 since 1992, the number working in administrative support and clerical positions has fallen by 298,000, and the number working in precision production, craft and repair occupations has declined by 13,000 (and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14 million reached in March of 1990). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What all this adds up to, predictably, is anxiety on the part of the American worker. Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe jobs are not very plentiful, according to the Conference Board's most recent survey of consumer confidence, and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's face it: For many American workers President Clinton's declaration that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in 30 years" rings hollow. They seem to understand instinctively what many economists have been saying -- that the Clinton economy's growth rate of slightly more than 2 percent a year is not sufficient to produce a large number of good, stable, high-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is, the economy can grow much faster than it has these past four years. We experienced growth rates of 3.5 percent for most of the 1980s, and the economy produced 19 million new jobs. But that was during a period of lower taxation and fewer regulations on business.  In the current era of high taxes and heavy regulation, 2 percent growth and sluggish job creation may be the best we can hope for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And that's nothing to celebrate.

	The tragic ValuJet crash this spring, according to critics of corporate America, shows once again how the profit motive devalues and debases our society. If only ValuJet management hadn't cut corners to squeeze every possible nickel out of the system, the critics argue, the tragedy never would have happened. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Against this backdrop, let me recommend a new book to you: John Hood's "The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good," published a few weeks ago by the Free Press. Hood's book continues an important discussion launched some 35 years ago by the late John Chamberlain in "The Enterprising Americans." Chamberlain's book was a portrait of the towering figures of American enterprise -- the "robber barons," some called them -- who made America the great innovative industrial power it remains today: Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, Cyrus McCormack, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan.

	Chamberlain's point was simple: That the achievements of American business should inspire all of us, as he put it, "not because the pursuit of business is a sanctified end in itself but because it palpably makes the achievements of higher ends possible." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But do GM, Hewlett-Packard, K- Mart, TWA, Wendy's and other U.S. corporations have a responsibility to society beyond providing goods and services and generating profits?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Advocates of corporate "social responsibility" -- popular on college campuses, in Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlors, at Grateful Dead smoke-ins, and in government regulatory agencies -- argue that companies have an obligation to fight injustice, promote the public's health, diversify the workplace, eradicate poverty and save the planet, either directly, through corporate philanthropy or (most typically) by order of Big Brother. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While most of these are worthy goals, Hood demonstrates, as Chamberlain did before him, that business does more good for more people in more ways simply by sticking to business. In a Policy Review article previewing his book, Hood put it like this: "The corporate social-responsibility movement harbors an unrealistic, ahistorical view of commercial activity," focusing on disasters and villains, while ignoring "the revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider just one small example: the U.S. gold-mining industry. As economist Michael Evans of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management noted in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal article, "private investment, new technologies and enlightened management" have turned the state of Nevada into the world's fourth-largest gold producer over the past 15 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The industry now provides nearly 60,000 high-paying jobs in the state, is known for its "unmatched educational, health and other benefits," and  pays some $120 million per year in state and county taxes. The industry also has spent billions of dollars on equipment built by other U.S. companies, generating additional jobs in other states. With the world demand for gold soaring, even better days could lie ahead.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Except for one fact: Washington doesn't appreciate the contributions of this "heroic enterprise." The government has restricted exploration, discouraged investment and placed a variety of other regulatory burdens on the industry. The net result: If current policies are not reversed, 40,000 mining-related jobs will disappear over the next decade. In two decades, the industry itself will disappear, according to Evans' research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In many ways, the corporate social-responsibility movement is a red herring. As Hood notes, the best corporate citizens are those who create the jobs and amenities we enjoy and "the innovations that make our lives safer, healthier and happier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I hope you will read Hood's "Heroic Enterprise." It will restore your faith in our system.

<h3> Dumb And Dumber</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A certain Mr. Wade Miller of  New Mexico recently called Atlanta's Olympic committee to buy tickets for the Summer Olympics.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"I'm sorry, sir," the voice on the other line replied. "I can't sell tickets to someone outside the United States."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yep -- you heard correctly. The sales office of the U. S. Olympic Committee didn't know that "New Mexico" isn't part of old Mexico. Though he tried, Mr. Miller could convince neither the operator -- nor her supervisor! -- that New Mexico is one of the 50 United States of America. The supervisor, getting on the line when Mr. Miller insisted, told him (you can just hear her tone), "Sir, new Mexico, old Mexico -- it doesn't matter. You still have to go through your country's Olympic Committee." 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When reporters from a Santa Fe newspaper asked for tickets, they were told -- once again -- to contact the Mexican consulate.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When I hear stories like this, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. At first, of course, I laugh -- I mean, it is funny after all. But then I start thinking about why it's funny. And then, I become a little more pensive. If people with so little basic knowledge are able to get jobs with the U.S. Olympic Committee -- as supervisors no less! -- it makes me wonder how many other people like this there are out there, and where they work. A nuclear reactor, maybe? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason we laugh, of course, is because something we all secretly know has been exposed without warning, in all its irony: Our "education system" is now so bad it no longer transmits even the most basic knowledge to a great many people. And those people are becoming such a large proportion of the population that they now show up as employees of organizations as prestigious as the U.S. Olympic Committee.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm not exaggerating or overreacting here. I have a friend who used to be a television news reporter, who once took his camera and crew to the University of Maryland. He wanted to ask university students simple, basic knowledge questions in categories like geography, history, math and science to see whether they knew things anyone at that educational level ought to know. Some of the answers he got will make a believer out of anyone.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two female students tried for a full minute to come up with the formula for finding the area of a rectangle, and finally gave up with embarrassed giggles. One young man couldn't say what part of the world Poland is in. Another simply walked away when asked what, for him, was apparently the stump question: Who was president of the United States during the Civil War?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"What three powers did we fight against in World War II?" was one question. To be fair, my friend says a few came up with the correct answer, with a few hints along the way: Germany, Italy and Japan. Then there was the young man who said, in a confident tone (my friend tells me this is a direct quote): "Well, the first one, I know, is Russia. The second one is Korea. And the third one, I understand, is Pearl Harbor."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pearl Harbor? What on earth is going on here? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A student at a major U.S. university, and he not only can't answer a simple history question every American should be able to answer -- he doesn't even understand what is said to him? Pearl Harbor isn't a "power." It's a little country in the middle of the Atlantic; everybody knows that!
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have to wonder who signed a certificate of graduation from high school for this young man. What "educator" admitted him to a university? And how did he stay there, after he got there?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The answer is simple, and not funny: He's a product of the same politically correct, "socially conscious" educators who have presided over the decline in American education during the past three decades. The reason they have resisted all change in their approach to education is also their great secret: they see this decline as a positive good. After all, academic excellence is just a form of elitism. It will be a great stride forward for social equality when everyone is on the same, dumbed down intellectual level. 	 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What I want to know is: Who should District of Columbia residents call to get tickets to the Olympics? Atlanta -- or Bogota?	 

<p>

<title> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action </h3>

By Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A well-financed, pro-affirmative action propaganda campaign is underway to defeat the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), an amendment to California's constitution that would prohibit the state from granting preference -- or discriminating -- on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sex. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Much of this pro-affirmative action, anti-CCRI campaign is focused on women.  The obvious reason: Women are a bigger voting bloc than minorities, the usual target of such campaigns. If most women can be convinced that race- and sex-based preferences are fair, that could decide the battle. And this is a battle whose outcome could easily affect the lives of both men and women across the nation.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's why it is important to understand why women should reject race- and sex-based "affirmative action." There are at least four reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	First, like men, women believe in equality before the law. They believe racial, ethnic and gender preferences violate the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and voting booth have come not by departing from this creed, but by upholding it -- by showing that America wasn't living up to its own principles of equality. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. No one is better placed than a woman to see the double-edged nature of racial and gender preferences. It is clear to a mother that an institutional preference for her daughter is institutional discrimination against her son. Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys, made precisely this point in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. "I find affirmative action and the like racist and sexist ... Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of unequal opportunity toward our sons."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, women themselves often are treated unfairly under affirmative action plans. Consider the case of Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A Los Angeles resident, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she accumulated a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 -- on a four point scale -- due to credit for advanced placement classes. In addition to working 15 hours a week, McDonald wracked up an impressive list of achievements and awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry. She is exactly the kind of candidate the University of California at Berkeley claims to be looking for: high-achieving, well rounded, but poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In March 1996, McDonald received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." In other words, "diversity" was more important than excellence. Had it not been for the intervention of a lawyer so outraged by McDonald's case that he offered his services pro bono and threatened the University with a lawsuit, Lydia would not be looking forward to spring admission.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from affirmative action, but from equality of opportunity and hard work.  A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of quota-based affirmative action. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from such preferences.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Women have made progress in all segments of the work force in the last 30 years. As Anita K. Blair, executive vice president of the Independent Women's Forum recently pointed out, the most important reason is that women went to college. In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. During the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees -- M.B.A.s, M.D.s and J.D.s -- by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of affirmative action, but of changing personal choices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. Women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned nearly 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Those fighting the California Civil Rights Initiative are saying, in essence, that  women need the government's help in order to compete. But the facts do not support this view. Women should not fall for the sophistry and hypocrisy of organized interests who actually benefit from the perpetual racial and sexual strife caused by affirmative action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all, a society where equal rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial to women as it is to men. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>Tune in to Talk Radio</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Americans who think there's a liberal lilt to the news reporting they hear and read every day no longer have to rely on us cranky conservatives for affirmation. The evidence is now overwhelming. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When asked their political philosophy in a recent survey, 61 percent of 139 Washington bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents said "liberal" or "moderate to liberal." Just 9 percent said "conservative" or "moderate to conservative." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost nine out of 10--89 percent--said they voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. This compares to just 7 percent for George Bush and 2 percent for Ross Perot. As for party affiliation, 50 percent said they were Democrats, just 4 percent Republicans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As for journalists nationwide, 56 percent of the 2,703 surveyed in a huge Los Angeles Times poll conducted in 1985 called themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal." Just 18 percent said they were "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative." Several other studies by media analysts Robert and Linda Lichter, among others, have shown substantially the same. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Does this necessarily mean journalists allow their political beliefs to bias their news coverage? Of course not. But it sure raises certain suspicions when these cool, detached "professionals" get things wrong in a way that makes the conservative Congress look bad and the liberal White House look good. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Take just one example: the debate last year over reforming Medicare, the health-care system for America's 37 million senior citizens. Everyone by now knows that Medicare is rapidly going bankrupt and has to be reformed: There is no choice in the matter. But when conservatives <I>tried to slow down the built-in rate of increase</I> in Medicare spending--not cut spending, mind you, just slow down the rate at which costs are going up--congressional liberals accused them of making mean-spirited "cuts" that would hurt the elderly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did the media respond? Although reporters were shown repeatedly that over seven years Medicare spending would increase by $100 billion over and above current levels--from $4,900 to $7,100 per person--the vast majority of media reports told readers and viewers that the conservative plan would "cut" Medicare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Backtrack three years, to the debate over President Clinton's liberal health-care reform scheme. That plan would have increased Medicare spending at the same rate as the 1995 congressional plan. Yet, the media didn't assail the president for "cutting" Medicare. Like congressional conservatives, President Clinton took pains to make it clear his administration wasn't "cutting" the program, saying: "Medicare [is] going up at three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare cut." The media took the president's explanation at face value. Two years later, they pounced on Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The double standard has become so obvious few bother to deny it. In fact, many observers are beginning to recognize that the "talk radio" phenomenon has come about precisely because there is such a wide gulf between what people know to be true and what the media frequently tell us is true. Would Rush Limbaugh have 20 million listeners if Americans had been hearing both sides of the issues for the past several decades? I doubt it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Talk radio is the steam valve for political discourse in contemporary America. Liberals--not consciously, but effectively nonetheless--have been holding down the lid for decades. But the pressure became too great. Liberals stopped paying attention to one little outlet--AM radio--and all the steam came blasting out in a "rush" (sorry, I couldn't resist).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 So next time a news report gives you the sneaking suspicion that the reporter is spending too much time chatting with Kennedy clones at liberal cocktail parties, you're probably right. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, for some balance, tune in to talk radio.
<p>

<title>Politicking on the Workers' Dime -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> Politicking On The Workers' Dime</h3>
By Edwin Feulner<br>
President,  <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The silly season, otherwise known as the fall elections, is fast approaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And once again, one of the greatest travesties in American politics will be played out: Millions of Americans will be forced to help candidates and promote political positions they don't agree with. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How can such a thing happen in modern-day America? After all, isn't this the land of the free? Not if you're a rank-and-file union member in most states.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For years, big labor has engaged in one of the most undemocratic practices imaginable: using the dues workers must pay to the union as a condition of employment for partisan politicking. This year, with a friend of big labor in the White House, union officials are being more open about it. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney announced a few months ago that his organization would pump $35 million (seven times the amount unions usually spend on elections) into a nationwide campaign to unseat Republican congressmen he considers hostile to organized labor. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two-thirds of the $35 million Sweeney plans to spend defeating Republican officeholders will come from a special "tax" that was imposed on union members in March. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia do not have right-to-work laws. This means working people can be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If they don't like the political choices of union officials, they're out of luck.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The money that organized labor admits spending on partisan politics is vastly overshadowed by various "in-kind" expenditures unions make on behalf of candidates or causes. The late, great labor reporter Victor Riesel several years ago estimated that big labor spends $10 on political mailings, phone banks and other "in-kind" services for every dollar it openly spends on elections. You do the math.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Virtually all this money goes to Democratic candidates and incumbents. Yet, in 1994, exit polls found that 40 percent of union members voted Republican, for the very pro-family, tax-cutting, budget-balancing Republicans Sweeney and his colleagues have targeted for defeat. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So what's  a union member to do? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For starters he or she may seek inspiration from a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In  the case of <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, union member Harry Beck objected to the fact that his union dues were being used to fund political activities he didn't support. Beck challenged his union and won. The court ruled that union members can get refunds on that portion of their dues not devoted to costs associated with collective bargaining. In Beck's case, "that portion" was found to be 80 cents out of every dollar. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, when President Clinton took office, he weakened the impact of the Beck decision by rescinding former President Bush's order that required notices be posted in the workplaces of federal contractors, notifying workers of their rights under Beck. Clinton ordered the notices be torn down. So much for being on the side of workers!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Union politicking is nothing new and unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. However, fair-minded citizens should ask whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities--including helping candidates--with which they may not agree. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is not a partisan issue. If you're a liberal or a Democrat, all you have to ask yourself is how you would react if the tables were turned: How would you feel if John Sweeney planned to spend $35 million in coerced union dues to help Newt Gingrich and his allies? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	You'd be pretty angry.<p>

<h3> RESTORING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>

	Parades, fireworks, barbecues -- it's that time of year when Americans celebrate their bold, 220 year-old experiment in democracy and political freedom. When it comes to religious freedom, however, many people will not be in a celebratory mood.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider: An Illinois school district recently banned any reference to God in student presentations at a commencement program. A California high school prevented students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia barred a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While some Americans accept such bans as enforcement of the principle of separation of church and state, others are up in arms over what they consider outright religious persecution. Due to efforts by religious conservatives, Congress may soon unveil an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent educators from muzzling permissible forms of religious speech. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues -- and a religious conservative -- isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to the First Amendment. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "We still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Making it "work" means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, and Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, work district by district, getting educators and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, or of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debates must always be conducted with respect.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for Rights, Responsibilities and Respect), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Educators Association International, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Texas and Utah -- are moving ahead with the initiative.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, if the program can work in California, it can work anywhere. The student bodies in some California districts speak 90 different languages -- and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Haynes and Thomas have met with school officials and community leaders throughout the state. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and build community support. If  this sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is -- and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Snowline School District in Southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for a church-state debacle: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; officials hesitated when a school board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library; a parent objected when a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the community, trained in the Three Rs program, was ready. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. Rather, it is the government's -- and hence, the public schools' -- religious speech that is restricted. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad," Vondra says.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now there's a lesson in liberty: that neither pluralism nor separation of church and state need hush freedom of speech -- even religious speech -- in our public schools. <p>

<h3> THE RECOVERY OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><br>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When America's founding fathers talked about "citizenship," they meant people -- not political elites -- taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities. This Fourth of July, Americans should think about joining a movement that would restore the founders' vision of how Americans solve their problems.  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm talking about the "citizenship" movement, which aims to rein in Washington so the energy and effectiveness of state and local government and private alternatives to government can be explored to the fullest. One of America's core objectives during the next 20 years should be to recover this tradition of American citizenship. We must restore the link between freedom and personal responsibility, the two great themes of modern conservatism, and an increasingly attractive idea to liberals beginning to see the futility of government solutions. Our hope is that we can overcome much of the divisiveness and incivility that has characterized political discourse over the past several decades.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the principles of the United States: the rule of law, the decentralized government promised by our Constitution, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This distinctively American tradition of citizenship was best described by the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in "Democracy in America," his classic book of 1832. Tocqueville described America as the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were more important -- and more powerful -- than politicians in addressing the problems of their own communities. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is not to say Tocqueville's America wasn't marred by some terrible evils -- most notably the scourge of slavery. But there also were many things of which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison could be proud. It was a republic of self-governing citizens, which is what the founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence from England and wrote our Constitution.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To revive the founders' dream, it is essential to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But just as liberals must learn to accept this fact, conservatives must understand that merely tearing down the Washington establishment will not be sufficient. It is also essential to strengthen the families, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, local governments and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed federal-government programs.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Revivals of private initiative have happened before. The second half of the 19th  and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. A similar wave of social entrepreneurship will sweep America in the next generation. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recovery of American citizenship is the most important unifying principle for Americans in the post-Cold War era. It appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, non-governmental institutions. It appeals to those with religious values who emphasize faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, this idea appeals to nationalists who want to restore a strong sense of American cultural identity. And it appeals to liberals and their love for community activism.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Without local institutions," wrote Tocqueville 160 years ago, "a nation may give itself a free government, but it does not have the spirit of liberty." It is time for all Americans to help rebuild the local institutions that will bring back our spirit of liberty.<p>

<title>Really Stand for Children: Fix Welfare -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
REALLY STAND FOR CHILDREN: FIX WELFARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Senior Analyst for Welfare and Family Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Recently, the nation's capitol was the  scene of  the "Stand for Children" rally organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund. The rally's proclaimed goal was to call attention to the plight of the nation's children; its unstated goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and to criticize those in Congress who have sought reform. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the rally was correct to call attention to the plight of many of  America's children, the irony is that children are suffering because of the governmental policies supported by the rally's organizers. Children are suffering because the liberal welfare state has carpet-bombed the moral foundations of  the inner city, toppling marriage, gutting the work ethic, and leaving a rubble of social pathology in its wake.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The failure of the War on Poverty stems from its flawed premise: a core belief  that "material poverty" is critically harmful to children. According to this view, welfare, by reducing material poverty, can  increase children's well-being and lifetime attainment.  Similarly, since poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, an eroded work ethic, and drug use -- greater welfare spending can readily reduce poverty and most social problems at the same time. From this simplistic logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The "Stand for Children" rally repeated this tired theme.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But history refutes this naive belief in welfare. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If it were true that "material poverty" causes social problems, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods than we do today. On the contrary: Crime, family breakup and most other social problems were nowhere near the levels they are today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families -- not family income -- are what determine children's achievement. Successful families tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education and marriage, which they pass on to their children. Attempting to raise family income artificially through welfare does little to benefit a child, but does a lot to destroy the very values that are key to a child's success.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point many liberals refuse to recognize is that welfare has behavioral side effects. It engenders dependence and illegitimacy, both highly injurious to children's development. For example, among the nearly 5 million families currently receiving AFDC benefits, the total time spent on welfare will average nearly 13 years. A 1994 report by June O'Neill, currently Congressional Budget Office director, shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. O'Neill makes clear that welfare dependence, rather than poverty, is what truly hurts children. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
          	By paying women more money when they have children out of wedlock, welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy, a fact acknowledged by President Clinton but ignored by the "Stand for Children" organizers. Being born outside of marriage and raised in a single-parent home triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children; nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity; doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and doubles the probability a boy will engage in criminal activity and wind up in jail. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We can't help America's children by continuing past mistaken policies. The current welfare system must be replaced; the automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. In the future, welfare no longer should be a one-way hand out; adult recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. And steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen moms. 
 <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We must begin to focus on institutions with a record of success, not failure.  Religious institutions have been dramatically successful in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. One way to give the poor access to this fountain of hope would be to give poor parents education vouchers they could  freely use to send their children to private schools, including religious schools. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Americans should remember that well-meaning, big-government liberals who call welfare reformers "anti-child" are the unwitting advocates of precisely what is hurting America's children: welfare.<p>

<title>Jerry-Rigged Foreign Policy -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
JERRY-RIGGED FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
.

	The Clinton administration is about to make the same mistake in Bosnia it made in Somalia, where 18 U.S. Marines died unnecessarily. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House recently announced it would expand the role of the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia to include scouring the countryside for war criminals. This is something the administration specifically promised not to do, a role that was purposefully left out of the Dayton Peace Accords because of its divisiveness and its potential for indefinitely expanding the Bosnia mission and producing casualties.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is the administration taking this step? It wants to apprehend Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both still exercising control over Serb-held territory. And no wonder: If these two are not apprehended, it will be difficult for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to sanction elections scheduled for September, as called for in the peace accords. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Without elections, no stable government will be established in Bosnia. With no government, withdrawing U.S. troops, as President Clinton promised, may not happen. In other words, the house of cards the president set up in Bosnia could come crashing down. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, if by November election time it doesn't look like U.S. troops will come home soon, the president's Bosnia policy will be revealed for what it is: a jerry-rigged, politically tuned deal that puts U.S. forces at the mercy of events that can spin out of control at any time. To avoid this perception, the White House apparently is willing to risk substantial U.S. casualties -- both Karadzic and Mladic travel with 50 to 60 heavily armed escorts. But if Americans die, a la Somalia, the backlash could be even worse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The whole mess is typical of the foreign policy ineptitude shown by this administration from the beginning. The Clinton team, influenced by its opposition to the Vietnam War, came into office confused about which situations warrant U.S. military intervention, and which do not. It became clear that the president believed  multinational peacekeeping was the wave of the future for U.S. foreign policy. The administration appeared more comfortable with the idea of "foreign policy as social work." This global utopianism led the president to commit America to dubious peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, with sometimes tragic, never satisfactory results. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans realize how many gross errors and misjudgments have been made in foreign policy. Consider:<ul>
	<li>The White House has wasted precious years during which America could have erected global anti-missile defenses. For less than $3 billion it could have upgraded the Navy's Aegis fleet air-defense system as many experts have proposed, spending another $5 billion later on space-based sensors. Instead, the administration has done nothing in the face of CIA estimates that at least 20 countries already have or may be developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.	
	<p><li>The Clinton Pentagon determined that America needed to be able to fight two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously." Yet the president has neglected to provide the funding needed to sustain this capability. 
	<p><li>The administration has zig-zagged on China policy, at times threatening, at other times appeasing, sending confused signals throughout Asia that have undermined U.S. credibility in the region and heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. 
	<p><li>The administration secretly tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro whereby Cuban boat people would be sent back forcibly to Cuba instead of being allowed into the United States. This betrayal of the Cuban people -- overturning 30 years of principled U.S. policy -- was only abandoned after Cuba shot down two U.S. civilian aircraft.   
	<p><li>The White House has organized a multi-billion-dollar deal that will give North Korea two nuclear reactors -- and still we don't know for sure whether Pyongyang has discontinued its budding nuclear-weapons program. 
	<p><li>In Haiti, America spent $2 billion to put in office an avowed Marxist  known for his hostility to the United States, all in the name of "restoring democracy." Whatever it is, the regime now in place is no democracy. 
<p>	<li>Finally, with no U.S. interests at stake, the White House sent U.S. forces to Bosnia, when it could have simply lifted the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and allowed them to defend themselves. Now, worried that failure in Bosnia could threaten its standing in the polls, the White House is playing with the possibility of expanding and lengthening the mission, thus unnecessarily placing U.S. forces in even greater danger.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	This is no way to conduct foreign policy.<p>

HOW TO AVOID THE NEXT BUDGET CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
Vice President for Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	For months now, Congress has been in retreat after being blamed for two partial government shutdowns, the result of its battle with President Clinton over the fiscal 1996 federal budget. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lawmakers are now scurrying to accommodate the president's spending priorities to avoid an election-year bruising over the 1997 budget, even as they try to preserve enough of their own agenda to save face. But no matter how hard they try, they are going to find themselves in yet another battle royal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why?  Is America doomed to suffer government shutdowns year after year, depending only on how vociferously Congress and the White House disagree on budget priorities, tax and spending policy?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not at all. As it turns out, there is a perfectly good reason why Congress and the president seem perpetually at loggerheads over the budget: Because the law is written in a way that makes this inevitable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the 1974 Budget Act, a Watergate-era attempt by Congress to limit the power of the executive branch, the president is excluded from the budget process until it's almost over -- a recipe for the kind of 11th-hour budget showdowns that grabbed the headlines for so many months.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's how it works. Each January the president sends a budget to Capitol Hill, which Congress promptly ignores. In the spring, Congress adopts its own budget resolution based on its own priorities. During the summer, Congress crafts the 13 detailed spending bills needed to meet the budget targets outlined in the resolution, as well as a reconciliation bill making changes in tax and entitlement policy. Finally, in the fall, usually just before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, Congress sends the budget bills to the president, who now has only one way to try to restore his spending priorities: veto the bills and force an end-of-the-year budget fight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The result: With insufficient time to negotiate the details, the government shuts down over a dispute about whether or not Medicare premiums should rise by $6 a month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, the Budget Act also forces spending to go up even if Congress doesn't want it to. When members of Congress sit down to figure out how much to spend on a program in the coming fiscal year, the Budget Act mandates that they take last year's spending level and automatically add in the cost of population growth, anticipated inflation and other factors. This becomes the new "baseline" for spending, which means that even if Congress does not vote to increase the budget for a program, spending increases will happen anyway.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Any member of Congress who proposes to increase spending on a program by less than the baseline projection is accused of "cutting" the program. That's how Congress' plan to boost spending on Medicare by $100 billion over seven years became a "cut."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A reform plan proposed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., would fix the problems created by the Budget Act of 1974. For starters, the budget resolution adopted by Congress in the spring would be a legally binding law, signed by the president, and would set a limit on how much the government can spend in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the resolution would have to pass by an early date, April 15, in Cox's plan.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As a result, Congress and the president would know more than five months before the start of the new fiscal year exactly how much money they have to work with.  This would give the two sides a strong incentive to get the big, controversial budget issues (like tax cuts and entitlement reform) out of the way first, greatly lessening the chance of a last-minute deadlock forcing a government shutdown.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Cox plan also would purge the budget process of the pro-spending bias created by "baseline budgeting." Year-to-year spending totals would be compared in real dollars, not in the inflated dollars of the baseline. No longer would advocates of higher spending be able to call a spending increase a "cut." Spending hikes would be out in the open, rather than buried in the dark recesses of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The United States has experienced numerous budget crises over the past decade -- in 1986, 1988, 1990, and again in 1995-96. Add to this the bias toward higher spending written into the Budget Act and it's clear the time has come for reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why wait for the next budget crisis to expose (yet again) the flaws in the current system? If Congress wants to end the saga of government shutdowns and impose some real spending control, it should fix the system now.

Mason studies the problems that critics say have left Congress unresponsive to the taxpayers and beholden to special interests.  Under his direction, Heritage published The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial Congress (1993), an assessment of pervasive institutional problems and solutions. He also directed Heritage's liaison program with the executive branch, and identified and recommended conservative candidates for key public policy positions. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  and  eight-year  veteran  of  Capitol  Hill,  Mason  previously served as Staff Director to then-House Minority Whip Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss.

<title>The March For Big Government -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
THE MARCH FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Kenneth Weinstein<br>
Director of the Government Reform Project<br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	On June 1, 1996, national attention will focus on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C.  The theme of this march, ostensibly, is something that all Americans can support: "a day ... to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Organizers of the "Stand for Children" claim between 200,000 and 1 million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial "in a non-partisan call to action."  Unfortunately, the principal "action" likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. The reason: More than 100 of the sponsoring organizations are direct federal grant recipients receiving more than $392 million annually. The actual figure is assuredly higher, since that total excludes grants to many affiliate organization as well as all funds received from state or local governments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand's call "to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children."  But an examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children is not a non-partisan, pro-children march. It is a stand for government dependency and ought to be dubbed "The March For Big Government."  Consider:
<ul>
	<li>The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) -- an organization once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, is a chief opponent of  the 104th Congress' efforts to reform welfare.  In 1973, Edelman admitted that because she no longer could stir up interest in government programs by speaking of "poor people," she would emphasize children.  "Children," after all, "might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change."
<p>	<li>Lobbyists appear to be a major constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying groups that push for greater spending on federal programs already costing more than $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service boondoggle, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (The Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in fiscal year 1995). Families USA, a key lobbying organization for Bill Clinton's failed big-government health-care plan, is also a march endorser.
<p>	<li>At least 20 national organizations representing government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, also will be participating in the march.
<p>	<li>The AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative members of Congress this year, is actively promoting the march. Thirty-three of its affiliated unions are serving as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to "take back the Congress" (take it back for whom?), two guests were invited to speak: one was Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. Obviously, she got what she was after.
<p>	<li>At least 50 liberal organizations with no special focus on children, including the Americans for Democratic Action, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, are co-sponsors of the march.
 <p>	<li>As if to remove all doubt about the government-oriented nature of this event, one federal agency has even gotten into the act directly.  The Agriculture Department's $932 million Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service has signed on as a national endorser of the Stand For Children under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. Also, the Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corp., has signed on to the march.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In short, the Stand For Children is yet another a venue for groups that live off the taxpayer to lobby for more money. It is common practice for such organizations to use sympathetic symbols -- yes, even children -- as a "cloaking device" for efforts to expand big government and the welfare state. The fact that few Americans can believe anyone would be so cynical only makes the "cloaking" that much easier. In this case, they want to present their rally as a spontaneous, non-partisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.

<h3>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Presidential advisor James Carville, the highly regarded Democratic political operative from Louisiana's bayou country, helped keep the 1992 Clinton campaign in focus and "on message" with a simple four-word phrase, "It's the economy, stupid."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the White House is smart, this will not be its theme in 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though the White House and national media have been trumpeting the economy's "unexpectedly strong" (as The Washington Post put it) 2.8 percent first-quarter gain, this is modest growth by normal standards -- and voters remain uneasy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Flash back four years: With the American economy just emerging from a two-year recession in the fall of 1992 and many Americans nervous about their economic prospects, Carville's one-note samba -- played over and over again throughout the campaign -- clearly helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House, forcing George Bush to retire to his beloved Texas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to run for re-election. And though the economy is not moving backward (the definition of a recession), it's not setting any speed records either. Fifty percent of major U.S. companies trimmed their payrolls in the 12 months ending June 1995, some of them significantly. Indeed, from March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public -- especially the nearly 8 million people who are working two or more jobs to make ends meet -- know something is amiss. And they are concerned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration's initial response was a mix of denial and cheerleading: the silly claim that the economy is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The White House has had the good sense to back off a bit from this claim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A new study shows why.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">study</a> was conducted by economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> using a highly reliable computer model of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What the model does is simulate economic activity. By feeding the many "variables" that affect the economy into the model -- from changes in tax and budget policy to data on population growth and other demographic factors -- a seasoned economic forecaster can predict future economic activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach and Hodge turned the clock back to January 1993, before the new administration pushed the $241 billion tax hike through the 103rd Congress. Without getting into all of the mind-numbing technical details, they then ran the model on "fast-forward," asking it to tell them what the economy would look like today if tax and budget policy had not been changed in 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What they found was not good news for the White House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They found that another 1.2 million Americans would have jobs today if the economy hadn't been saddled with the tax increase. They learned that the U.S. auto industry would have built and sold an additional 1.1 million new cars and light trucks. And they learned that the typical U.S. wage-earner would have taken home an additional $2,600 in after-tax income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The big numbers are equally disturbing. For example: The overall U.S. economy would have grown an additional $208 billion between 1993 and 1996. And business investment -- the key factor in creating jobs -- would have been $42.5 billion higher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While there has been some quibbling about the exact details of the Beach/Hodge findings, the overall thrust of their work remains unchallenged: Tax hikes hurt, and the huge 1993 tax hike hurt big time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the Clinton administration wonders why American workers are still uneasy about the economy, they should tell the White House: "It's the tax hike, stupid!"
<p>

<h3>Your Right To Know</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a>
<br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. 	Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government  --  and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called "The Right To Know Payroll Form."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Right To Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans With Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security.        
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. 	Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look moneywise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out  --  in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right To Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, all the rest is taken out  --  Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92.  	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government  --  much of it before they even know about it  --  they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Are Conservatives Winning Or Losing? -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>ARE CONSERVATIVES WINNING OR LOSING?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, many Americans thought it was time to dance on the grave of big government. Instead, conservatives themselves bogged down in a bitter eight-year political war with dozens of special interests -- from farmers to welfare workers -- who depend on big government for their livelihoods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When conservatives took control of Congress in 1994, many of us again thought we had scored a victory for smaller government. Wrong again. President Clinton gave as good -- or better -- than he got from the new Congress. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, over the past year big government has continued to get bigger. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't until the president's 1996 State of the Union declaration that "the era of big government is over," that I truly began to believe conservatives finally had won. After all, when an opponent is forced to mouth words he doesn't believe, words that go 180 degrees in the direction opposite his political leanings, in short, the very words his opponents have been saying, this is when he has lost the war -- at least the rhetorical war -- the war of ideas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives will have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of territory they gain in the next few years. Liberalism has not surrendered; and we'd be naive to expect it to. After all, it's just too much fun spending other people's money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, those Americans who were really paying attention had a rude awakening following President Clinton's grand declaration about big government's demise. Untrue to his word, the president's first request to the returning Congress was for $8 billion in new spending for the current fiscal year. His fiscal year 1997 budget offered more of the same: a $358 billion increase over the levels proposed in Congress' seven-year balanced budget plan. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All these efforts will have to be strenuously opposed, and in years to come, gleefully overturned. In the meantime, conservatives will have to buckle down and think about what it means to govern. After all, the Republican Congress has encountered some rough going of late. Is this any surprise? Legislative governance -- that is, passing laws that do what you want them to do -- is not easy. It's like trying to herd cats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatives are unaccustomed to running Congress; they've been backbenchers for decades. This requires an adjustment. It requires a period of learning. There is nothing inherently disgraceful in the failure that comes from such learning -- except not learning.  	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, the conservative agenda articulated in the House GOP's Contract with America remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps too much was attempted. Perhaps compromise was dismissed too easily in the fervent desire for real change. Perhaps the message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media. These are understandable, forgivable mistakes. I say learn and move on.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What do conservatives need to learn? For starters, when they campaign against each other in primaries, they have to stop attacking other conservatives for espousing great conservative ideas. For example, the defining issue of the 1996 presidential campaign should have been -- and still could be -- the <a href="/heritage/taxsite">flat tax</a>. One candidate, so intent upon defeating flat-tax candidate Steve Forbes that he was willing to say practically anything, called the flat tax idea "nonsense." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tell that to Hong Kong, whose flat-tax economy has been the most consistently expanding in the world for the last 30 years! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax is one of the most marketable, most urgently needed -- by Americans of all income levels -- ideas conservatives have proposed in decades. Yet, in their pursuit of political gain, conservative candidates obscured the issue in a flurry of flying fur. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatism's message has been confused in the past year, by the rough and tumble of Washington politics. But that can be remedied. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberalism's message, on the other hand, has become utterly irrelevant to America's aspirations and values. It is beyond redemption. That's why liberals have to cloak themselves in conservative rhetoric just to get a hearing. This bodes well for the future of America. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The principles of conservatism -- free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense -- don't change in the middle of a presidential election or a budget battle. They don't change whether Republicans are in power or Democrats are in power or whether that power is shared, as is presently the case.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I am optimistic about conservatism because what we believe is enduring. I am optimistic because liberalism is a disaster that can no longer be disguised. I am optimistic because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not wishful thinking. And I am optimistic because people genuinely want to get this country back on the right track. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America.

<title>Clinton's War on the Armed Forces - Heritage Commentary
</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Clinton's War on the Armed Forces</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	President Clinton has said, "the era of big government is over." But so far, it looks like it's over for only one area of government -- national defense. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration is looking for a 6 percent cut in the 1997 defense budget. While that may not seem like much, it will further starve an already hungry armed forces wizened by nearly a decade of consecutive budget cuts.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider this: The president wants to cut procurement  -- purchasing of parts, machinery and equipment our troops use in the field on a daily basis -- by $3.4 billion. Yet, when adjusted for inflation, procurement is at its lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War. It hasn't been trimmed -- it's been hacked with a meat cleaver, by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now some of you may be thinking, "Hey, the Cold War is over. Communists are now nothing more than cabana boys in third rate dictator-run countries like Cuba. What could be wrong with a major downsizing of our military? The United States doesn't need to be a super power when there is no other super power to worry about."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The only problem with this line of thinking is that while the magnitude of danger may be less -- no one threatens us with total annihilation the way the Soviet Union once did -- the volatility of danger is much greater. Rogue nations working to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- don't care if the United States is a super power. All they care about is bullying their way onto the world stage -- and they're getting the weapons to do it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recognition of this, the Clinton administration itself has said that the United States needs to be able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously. Yet, the White House has failed to provide the funding that would enable the Pentagon to meet this goal. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to procurement, the Pentagon's "operations and maintenance" budget is being bled to death -- siphoned off into areas not related to combat readiness. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia between 1992 and 1995 have cost American taxpayers some $6.6 billion. None of these missions contributed one iota to U.S. security.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the American military is being weakened by starvation. Consider: In 1995 the Pentagon was not allowed to buy a single new tank. By the year 2005, every tank in the Army will be older than the soldiers driving them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't too long ago taxpayers were told that Pentagon chiefs favored hammers costing hundreds of dollars and toilet seats that should have been gold plated for what we paid for them. There was no excuse, of course, for such excess. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But essential investments in the day-to-day operations of our fighting men and women --  and combat readiness -- should not be confused with the waste of the past.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	President Clinton does the armed forces a disservice when our soldiers and sailors go without essential training because equipment is broken and there are no parts to fix it. Pentagon chiefs are now regaled with stories of maintenance crews "cannibalizing" other pieces of equipment to make Band-Aid repairs on equipment that has worn out.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton administration wouldn't have committed the United States to being able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously if military planners didn't consider such a scenario -- say in Korea and the Middle East, for example -- a distinct possibility. But if the Pentagon isn't given the training, equipment, spare parts and supplies it needs, it can't fulfill this mission.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or, our fighting men and women can be thrown into the middle of a conflict without the proper support, and we can just hope for the best.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is this the administration's military strategy?   <P>

<title>Environmental Flip Flops - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Environmental Flip Flops </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Liberal activists once again have used the occasion of Earth Day to scare people into believing the environment is in such bad shape that more government programs are needed to "protect" us. One favorite theme is the alleged global population explosion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the last five years alone, U.S. newspapers and magazines have published more than 7,200 articles on this subject. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, the latest rave in environmental circles is a new book claiming a devastating drop in male fertility over the past half-century, threatening our very ability to reproduce. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OK, so which is it? Are we about to overpopulate ourselves to death, or die out as a species? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As most Americans realize, environmentalists are constantly sounding the alarm about something or other. Fortunately, most of us know instinctively that a healthy dose of skepticism is in order -- that the doomsday stories are a bunch of baloney (itself alleged to be a health hazard, because of the chemical preservatives in the meat).  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all of the stories involve highly complex scientific issues that a nonscientist can't possibly understand. Which is why its so important to put things in perspective. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The newest "danger" on the horizon involves a somewhat racy subject: sperm. According to the new book, various chemicals in our diets and environment are wrecking havoc with our genetic material, lowering global sperm counts to dangerously low levels and threatening the future of life itself -- man and animal alike.   
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the overheated publicity materials being sent out by the New York publisher, studies have documented "as much as a 50 percent drop in human sperm counts over the last 50 years." Oh really?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Predictably, supporting the book's claims (here's where perspective is important) are some of the same people who have been hollering the loudest about global overpopulation, urging the United States to support United Nations and Planned Parenthood birth-control efforts. Now, instead of financing condoms for Chile and Chad, America is supposed to do something about the fertility deficit in Fiji and France.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is precisely the kind of contradictory flip-flop confusion that raises skepticism about the entire environmental movement.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, the agenda of environmental alarmists is the same as it has always been: Convince the American people that modern chemicals are deadly and evil and stampede the government into spending more money on more programs that will further restrict our choices and freedom.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bottom line, of course, is that environmentalists can't have it both ways. We can't have a global population explosion and a fertility crisis at the same time. As Mr. Spock of "Star Trek" might put it, "It doesn't compute."

<title>How Much Is $1.6 Trillion - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>HOW MUCH IS $1.6 TRILLION?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	With six kids and a single income, I am probably more aware than most where my paycheck goes. One thing I know for sure is that too much goes to government.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government this year -- despite the much-ballyhooed "cuts" the Washington establishment has been bemoaning -- will spend some $1.6 trillion. The House of Representatives will begin debating spending targets for fiscal year 1997 during the first week of May. Make no mistake: Overall spending will go up, not down.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even though I have worked in the nation's capital for more than a dozen years, eight of them on Capitol Hill, two at the Pentagon, and six at The Heritage Foundation, where we routinely analyze programs costing tens of billions of dollars, I don't have the faintest idea how much $1.6 trillion really is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For most of us, even a million is incomprehensible. Have you ever tried to count to a million? Think about it: If you counted non-stop without eating or sleeping it would take approximately 23 days to count to a million. To count to a billion literally would take a lifetime: 95 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Counting to a trillion, assuming we get started right away and don't waste any time, would take about 2,000 centuries -- 200,000 years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us can at least imagine counting for 23 days. A period of 2,000 centuries, on the other hand, is beyond human understanding. As is a trillion dollars.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, government doesn't just count money, it spends it -- and it does so at a phenomenal rate: $4.5 billion a day. Enough to support my family and quite a few others for a very long time.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A lot of the money government spends is borrowed, more than half-a-million dollars per minute, $32 million an hour, or $768 million a day. This borrowed money gets added to the national debt.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite two very costly world wars, it took from the beginning of the American Republic until 1982 -- more than 200 years -- to amass the first $1 trillion in debt. By February 1996, however, the debt exceeded $5 trillion. On April 19, when I last checked, the "national debt clock" on the Internet stood at $5,147,684,202,607.46. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's five trillion, 147 billion, 684 million, 202 thousand, 607 dollars and 46 cents: More than $19,450 for every man, woman and child in the United States, a whopping $155,000 for the Mason family -- enough to purchase a new house and pay a year's worth of college tuition, with money left over.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The story doesn't end here, however. Unless something drastic happens, government spending and borrowing will get worse. Under the current budget, annual government spending will increase to $2 trillion by the year 2002 -- just six years down the road. The debt also will increase: by approximately $150 billion per year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, this spending spree is now largely on autopilot. The cost of mandatory "entitlement" programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, already the largest portion of the budget, will increase 63 percent by the year 2002, while interest payments on the national debt will increase 16 percent. The remainder of the budget, meanwhile --  for national defense, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, maintenance of U.S. ports and parks and everything else -- will grow a relatively modest 14 percent.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unchecked, this crowding-out effect would reach its destructive conclusion in 2010 -- the year my seven-year-old reaches the age of 21 -- when entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time somebody says government spending needs to be brought under control you'll know why. If you forget, just start counting. I'm sure you'll remember long before you reach 5 trillion, 147 billion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>The Truth About Free Trade and Protectionism - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There's a notion afoot that free trade is hurting the U.S. worker, that it is causing corporations to downsize and lay off their employees, and that the answer is for the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions against foreign countries like Japan. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In reality, this would be very unwise. History and economic common sense show that the "trade wars" approach to the world marketplace simply doesn't work. Consider the following myths: 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<b>Myth #1</b>: Free trade has allowed manufacturers to go overseas to obtain cheap labor, destroying America's manufacturing infrastructure and losing American jobs. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If U.S. manufacturing companies were moving overseas in droves, manufacturing as a percentage of the total U.S. economy would have suffered a steep decline. Instead, it has maintained a constant level of about 21 percent of the total economy for three decades. And if cheap labor were the big draw people like Pat Buchanan and H. Ross Perot say it is, U.S. companies would be invested up to their eyeballs in countries like Haiti, Somalia and the Dominican Republic. Obviously they're not, or these countries wouldn't be destitute. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #2</b>: We must protect high-paying manufacturing jobs from foreign competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: Not if such protection costs an even greater number of jobs in other industries and causes consumer prices to rise. Consider for example, U.S. import quotas on automobiles, which caused the price of new American autos to increase by 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. The auto industry claims these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs. But they also reduced sales -- by about 1 million cars. This drop forced some 50,000 layoffs by the late 1980s. In other words, even though protectionism saved some 22,000 jobs, it caused a net job loss of 30,000.  Some "protection."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: America by far is the world's leader in technological innovation and is the world's largest manufacturer of computer microprocessors, semiconductors, advanced consumer electronics, health equipment, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer software, and host of other information technologies and high-tech products. Over time, competition from other nations like Japan is making us do better, not worse.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #4</b>: U.S. trade deficits -- especially with Japan -- mean America is becoming poorer while others become richer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If this were true, the United States wouldn't be the economic powerhouse it is today. The real reason the United States has a trade deficit with Japan is because there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese. In order for America to have a trade "balance" with Japan, each and every Japanese would need to buy twice as much from America as Americans buy from Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: History shows that as the U.S. trade deficit increases, unemployment actually decreases. For example, as the U.S. trade deficit leaped in 1983-84 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted. Conversely, when the trade deficit shrank, from 1989 to 1991, unemployment began to increase. The reason some major companies lay off large numbers of workers has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with burdensome regulatory policies here at home.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6</b>: U.S. companies will go under unless the government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign governments to purchase more U.S. goods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: U.S. companies who use this scare tactic to stampede lawmakers into passing protectionist policies are trying to protect themselves from competition, both foreign and domestic. If American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter? The U.S. auto industry -- so beat up by the Japanese years ago -- is now winning. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year and is making cars that are better built, have fewer flaws and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. They have free trade to thank, not government meddling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, while it may be tempting to blame other countries when U.S. companies downsize or lay off  workers, there is no evidence that free trade is hurting us, or that "trade wars" are the answer. Rather, it shows that free trade is the road to prosperity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>How Republicans Can Win the Environmental Debate - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE</h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Earth Day (April 22) was painful for Republicans. Unless they develop a new strategy on the environment, they will continue getting "gored" on the issue. Not because they failed to communicate their vision, but because they don't have one.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton administration sent its troops to the congressional districts of vulnerable Republican freshman in Congress to blast them on their environmental record. "Green" activists similarly conducted a media blitz attacking the "anti-environment" GOP.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberals have been successful at portraying the new Republican Congress as "planet pavers" who want to "roll back" environmental protection laws, all to satisfy polluting industrialists who contributed to the GOP's political coffers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans, meanwhile, have been waging the environmental debate almost exclusively with  regulatory "horror stories"-- tales of real Americans suffering under oppressive environmental laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These anecdotes work, but only to a point.  For example, most Americans would react with anger to the story of Earl Miller, my own dry cleaner in Arlington, Va., who lost his family business after 30 years because he could not afford a new (and largely unnecessary) $40,000 machine required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Republicans have relied too heavily on such stories. As much as Americans  want the government to stop harassing people, they fear (understandably) that if the "regulatory safety net" disappears, we would return to the days of billowing black smokestacks and burning rivers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the Republican message so far -- that we need to balance environmental protection with the demands of economic growth -- has fallen like a lead balloon. Many people are convinced the argument is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even though environmental regulations cost the U.S. economy an incredible $171 billion annually, balancing this cost against a child's life is a losing proposition. Unless  Republicans can show that their policies protect jobs, eliminate unfairness, and do a better job protecting the environment and public health than the big-government approach, environmental issues will continue to be their Achilles' heel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is, well intentioned liberal environmental policies can kill. For example, according to a Harvard University study, current regulatory policies cost 60,000 lives per year. Why? Because the government squanders huge sums of money guarding against minuscule risks -- the theoretical loss of life due to trace amounts of chemicals on fruits and vegetables, for example -- while it ignores much greater risks. Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis calls this "statistical murder." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Superfund and property rights reforms before Congress provide excellent opportunities to improve the environment and save more lives. Under the hazardous waste "Superfund" cleanup program, created in 1980, only about 20 percent of the 1,374 sites on the list have been cleaned up. Lawmakers should let people know they want to accelerate cleanups that are now delayed because trial lawyers -- big allies of the White House -- soak up 21 percent of Superfund's money. More lives would be saved because of faster cleanups of the worst sites posing the most risk to Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, Republicans should explain that protecting the rights of property owners can actually benefit threatened species. Right now, under the Endangered Species Act, regulators can financially ruin families by taking away their ability to use their land, without compensation. This is unfair and counterproductive. It creates an incentive for property owners to make sure no one finds out about endangered species that may live on their land. The bumper sticker "shoot, shovel, and shut up" tells the whole story.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans must recognize that the American people legitimately expect freedom from harmful pollution. That doesn't mean they should embrace the  environmentalist agenda, which opposes letting businesses find the best way to comply with environmental safeguards, and is hostile to free-market solutions. It does mean, however, that they must publicly acknowledge that polluting a neighborhood is not a conservative value. They should stress the need to prioritize risks and explain why market approaches often work better than regulations -- not only for preserving liberty and economic growth, but for the environment as well. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy and a clean and healthy environment. Republicans can win the environmental debate if they meet this challenge, and give people all three. With a positive vision, they can do just that.

<title>A Tax Code To Love? -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> A Tax Code To Love?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>March 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Don't look now but it's that time of the year again. The dreaded tax season is here. To say that most Americans don't like the current tax system understates the obvious. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's because it truly is a mess. Americans struggle to comply with a tax system that has more than 400 different forms. The amount of time individuals and businesses spend collecting all the needed data and filling out all the required forms: an estimated 5 billion hours each year.  What a waste!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	And compliance isn't cheap. Individuals, families and businesses spend an estimated $200 billion per year on accountants and lawyers to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service. Just think how crazy that is: The government will throw you in jail if you don't pay taxes according to a scheme it has made so confusing you have to hire a lawyer to figure it out! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There has to be a better way. And there is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By now I'm sure you've heard all sorts of claims about an idea that is frequently discussed by economists, realtors, policy-makers and presidential contenders alike: the flat tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Just so you know, the reason so many people in high places want you to reject the flat tax is because they are the ones leeching benefits from the current system, and they don't want anybody messing with their cash cow.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax works like this: All taxpayers would pay the same tax rate, for example, 17 percent. No confusing tax schedules, no steep accountants fees; just one form, the size of a postcard. The rich would pay far more in taxes than the everybody else -- contrary to critics' claims -- since, after all, 17 percent of a million dollars is a lot more money than 17 percent of $35,000. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">study</a> by my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation recently showed that the flat tax <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/0waisdocid%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th.src%3ATEXT%3A79219%3A1%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B2%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B3%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B4%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B5%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B6%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B7%3D%2500%3B">proposed</a> by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., -- one of several proposals under consideration -- would lower taxes on all income groups, especially the poor and middle class. The plan's generous deduction, $33,000 for a family of four, would exempt most low-income households from any federal income tax. Some 24 million families that pay taxes now would pay none under the plan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Also, unlike the current system, which may tax the same dollar up to four different times (the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, the capital gains tax, and the estate tax), dividend and interest earnings from savings and investment would not be taxed. In other words, instead of being penalized for investing your money, you would be taxed just once 3/4 when you earn the money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This would encourage more Americans to put their money to work in the economy -- and instead of dragging the economy down, the tax system would start revving it up.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, one of the most attractive features of a flat tax is its simplicity. Everyone who has wrestled with a Schedule C or a 1040 form or has had to collect receipts for every charitable contribution in the mad rush to get everything in the mail by April 15 could simply -- and quickly -- fill out a postcard-sized form. What literally once required hours could be done in a few minutes during your lunch hour! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But before you get too excited, remember: A lot of special interests don't want to part with the advantages (a tax break for this, a loophole for that, a deduction here, an allowance there) that the current tax system gives them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Practically everyone agrees that America's tax system needs a major overhaul. Instead of spending precious time cursing the tax code, perhaps our lawmakers will soon replace it with one that everyone (except the special interests, of course) can love.

<title>Lower Education --  Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2>Lower Education</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever wonder why most young people -- even those who have attended prestige colleges or universities -- don't seem to know a whole lot about life or the world around them? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It could be because in the headlong pursuit of top-rated sports teams, expensive, over-specialized research facilities, and -- let's be frank -- money, America's most prestigious colleges and universities have forgotten their basic task: to teach students something about history, literature, mathematics, the natural sciences, foreign language, philosophy and English. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason most "Generation Xers" don't come away from college with such a "bottom-line" education is simple: It's no longer required of them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I don't make this accusation lightly. According to a study just released by the National Association of Scholars (NAS), America's leading schools of "higher" education have eliminated most of the core academic requirements once considered essential to a liberal-arts education. At the 50 colleges and universities identified by U.S. News & World Report as "America's best," the commitment to a structured general education "has largely vanished" over the past 30 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, there has been "a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political and scientific foundations of their society," the NAS study shows.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, the study merely quantifies what many of us have been observing about American education for decades: U.S. educators have forgotten what education is all about. According to NAS President Stephen Balch, America is "in danger of losing the common frame of cultural reference that for many generations has sustained our liberal, democratic society."  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to the NAS study, the number of top schools that require what we used to call "freshman English" has dropped to just over one-third. Only 12 percent still require math; only 34 percent require students to study science; only 2 percent require the study of history; only 4 percent have required courses in philosophy; and not a single one of the top schools requires students to study great literature.    
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even the school year has been shortened, from an average of 191 days in 1964 to only 156 classroom days in 1993. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"To a considerable extent, the structured curriculum was dashed to pieces during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the rage in higher education was a radical libertarianism based on notions of `relevance' and the assumption that a special insight belonged to youth," the NAS study states. As a result, colleges and universities today "can no longer guarantee that students acquire a basic knowledge of their civilization and its heritage." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The product of all this, in the words of my late friend, philosopher <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a>, is "lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away." We end up with students "able to ascertain the price of everything -- but the value of nothing." 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's what you get, dear parent, for $10,000 to $25,000 per year and rising, when you send your son or daughter to America's most prestigious colleges and universities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If I were you, before I spent that kind of money, I'd get my hands on the NAS study, send it to the president of the college or university your child has chosen, and demand a response.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Clinton's New Budget: And the Winner Is..Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>CLINTON'S NEW BUDGET: AND THE WINNER IS ... BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The new budget President Clinton released this week was supposed to attack big government. Big government won.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over seven years, President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget proposes $358 billion in higher spending and $232 billion in higher federal tax revenues than the balanced budget submitted to him by Congress last fall, which he vetoed. That amounts to $3,580 in higher spending and $2,320 in higher tax revenue for every household in America. So much for "the end of big government."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what about the deficit candidate Clinton vowed to slay within five years if elected? Compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the president's new budget adds $125 billion in new red ink through the year 2002.  That amounts to increasing the debt burden on every household by $1,250.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But give the president credit -- for some exceptionally brazen budget gimmickry. On paper, his fiscal year 1997 budget balances by 2002, but only by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.  Consider:  The White House budget purports to save nearly $600 billion over seven years, but only 40 percent of those savings would come during Clinton's second term in office, if he wins.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, it's a lot easier to balance the budget when some other president will bear the brunt of responsibility for deficit reduction. Under the 1997 Clinton budget, the first president and Congress of the next century would have to find 63 percent of the savings -- not just from political lemons like foreign aid, but from favored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not only does the president leave the spending mess for someone else to clean up, he hogs popular tax cuts for himself. Under his budget, middle-class families would get a tax credit for each child, increasing in value from $300 in 1997 to $500 by 1999. But in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget, Clinton's child tax credit vanishes.  The result in that year: an $18 billion tax increase on families with children. But this doesn't worry the White House either, since some future president will have to deliver the bad news.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What's more, the president's budget offsets these tax cuts with big tax increases.  All told, the White House budget contains $99.7 billion in tax cuts and $62.4 billion in tax increases.  New taxes exceed the president's proposed seven-year Medicaid savings ($59 billion) and surpass by half his proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion).  In the end, the net tax cut is $37 billion, or just 3 cents of every $1,000 taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And let's not forget: This is the same president who said he would work with Congress to craft some kind of capital-gains tax cut.  But not only does his budget propose no such tax cut, it calls for $4 billion in higher capital-gains taxes over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, the president's budget treats entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare -- the real engines behind uncontrolled spending growth -- with kid gloves. In fact, spending on entitlements steams ahead by $370 billion, or 50 percent, over seven years.  For all "mandatory" programs, spending would grow from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar in 2002.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This threatens not only the country's solvency, but the future of entitlement programs themselves.  In less than 15 years, spending on entitlements and debt interest will consume nearly every dollar in the federal budget, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform headed by Sen. Robert Kerry, D-Neb., and retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The president's response? His budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over seven years -- not nearly enough to save the program from collapse.  For Medicaid, the situation is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, runaway costs could force states to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion. And the president's proposed "reform" -- placing a cap on how much the federal government will spend per Medicaid beneficiary -- could slap $47 billion in new costs on already cash-strapped states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is one area of the budget, however, where the White House does propose real change: spending on presidential "pork" gets a big boost. Clinton's budget outlines a sweeping agenda of new spending initiatives on priorities important to politically influential special-interest groups: education (teachers' unions), high technology (corporations) and the environment ("green" activists). Compared to Congress' balanced budget, the president would shovel an extra $106 billion over seven years to programs supported by such groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it. The president's budget -- while claiming, technically, to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- is just more obfuscation, smoke and mirrors. It is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it.

<title>The Unfinished Agenda on Unfunded Mandates - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>THE UNFINISHED AGENDA ON UNFUNDED MANDATES</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	One year after Congress passed a law to deal with the problem of "unfunded mandates," the results are not encouraging.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans have any idea that Washington forces all sorts of laws and regulations on state and local governments -- concerning everything from storm-water drainage to health care for illegal immigrants -- without giving states and localities so much as a penny to pay for them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State and local government officials and business leaders met recently in Washington to examine the preliminary recommendations of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). This is the body Congress assigned last year to examine how "unfunded mandates" are hurting state and local governments, as part of its <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?r104:./temp/~r104uCqz::+@1(S.+1)++">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the ACIR's recommendations show, unfunded mandates are still busting state and local budgets, diverting much-needed money from law enforcement, fire fighting, education and other activities people really need. In short, Congress accomplished little with last year's reforms. This should come as no surprise. After all, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/11?r104:./temp/~r104YVpC::unfunded+mandates+reform+act+">
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995  did absolutely nothing to address existing mandates -- except to have the ACIR study them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the study is proving useful. Based on information from the National Governors' Association and dozens of other state and local governments and organizations, ACIR identified 14 mandates it sees as the biggest problems. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The report recommends that seven federal laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, no longer apply to state and local governments. Another seven laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, should be made more flexible or be funded more by the federal government instead of forcing state and local governments to pay.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the report has its shortcomings. It doesn't say anything about how unfunded mandates affect the private sector and whether reforms should extend that far. There also are countless environmental, health and education mandates the report doesn't address. And while the ACIR acknowledges that laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act may not have a legitimate scientific basis, the ACIR's report doesn't reach into whether the laws themselves should be changed. Asking Congress to exempt states and localities from laws that are ill-conceived in the first place sets a bad precedent and creates a double standard for treatment of the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the ACIR report just scratches the surface of a huge problem. Costly requirements imposed by Washington are undermining the fiscal health of state and local governments. For example, every three years the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify 25 new substances localities must test for in their water supplies -- forcing cities across America to bear the cost of testing for substances that literally have been banned for decades. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another example: A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cb22.html">study</a> by The Heritage Foundation showed that state spending on Medicaid will increase from $32 billion in 1990 to $104 billion in 2002, a 325 percent boost, if there is no reform of the current program. States like California and New York will have to raise additional billions just to pay for their share of this program.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfunded mandates can force states to raise taxes; reduce spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement or some other service; or both. For example, in September 1995, Fairfax County, Va. reported that half its non-school budget is being consumed by programs and mandates issued by Congress and the Virginia General Assembly, for which the county receives no funds. In February, the county executive was forced to propose one of the largest tax increases in the county's history, as well as dramatic reductions in education and social service programs.. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite their limitations, the ACIR recommendations should give states and localities hope. They confirm that the burden of unfunded mandates is real and significant. The ACIR's final report could create the foundation for a new round of legislative initiatives. These could range from full federal funding of mandates to outright repeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	However, if state and local communities expect change, they will have to continue badgering Washington through legislation and the courts. Unless states and localities are vigilant in keeping Congress and the president focused on addressing the problem of unfunded mandates, there will be no reform at all. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Washington will be all too happy to keep passing the buck.

<title>Drifting Toward a Taiwan Crisis - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRIFTING TOWARD A TAIWAN CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 8, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a blatant show of intimidation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is now firing missiles at targets just miles from Taiwan's largest cities.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The missiles are intended to undermine the Republic of China on Taiwan's democratic government -- which will hold its first-ever presidential election on March 23.  
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And why shouldn't the PRC feel perfectly free to bully one of America's best friends in Asia and its 7th-largest trading partner? After all, the Clinton administration has done little to give China pause as to the consequences of such acts. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, instead of clearly spelling out what America's response would be if the communist Chinese attack Taiwan -- thus discouraging such aggressive acts -- the blundering Clinton foreign policy team has lent encouragement to the Chinese. For example, an unnamed State Department official told U.S. News & World Report last October that U.S. military action was unlikely. "We would not be in a position to react with force," the official was quoted as saying. "We would not elect to do that, I'm sure," he added.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Certainly not. Of course, a 12-year-old could figure out that even if this were true -- which it shouldn't be -- you don't go telling a potential adversary about it. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration not only shouldn't be saying such things, this should not be its policy either. The administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan, period. Nor should it rule out the use of force if the Chinese decide on such a reckless course. In fact, instead of standing by while the PRC lobs missiles in Taiwan's direction, the United States should be holding naval exercises in the region: to send a message of our own. Instead, when the U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz made a run through the Taiwan Strait in December, administration officials -- who could have just kept their mouths shut! -- were quick to assure all parties that the move was due to inclement weather in the Pacific. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By failing to tell China's leaders where America stands, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could enslave the citizens of Free China, place every U.S. ally in Asia at risk, and wipe out what little confidence our Asian allies might still have in our reliability in a crisis. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before it's too late, President Clinton must make sure Beijing understands that America feels a moral obligation to defend Taiwan, and that it will do so, come what may. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After all, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- U.S. law -- states that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." The president should reaffirm that it will regard violations of Taiwan's rights as a threat to U.S. security and will act accordingly. He should tell China it could face not only severe economic sanctions -- ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo -- but also the full military might of the United States.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such steps should be taken now, before the real shooting starts. After it starts, America can only lose. Even if a PRC-initiated attack on Taiwan didn't spread any further -- and there's no guarantee that it wouldn't -- China would have successfully challenged America's ability to protect its allies. Other challenges would follow, in Asia and elsewhere.      
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the reason China is threatening to come to blows is that it's scared of tiny Taiwan. Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States last June -- to speak at a class reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University -- China has been rattling its saber. Chinese amphibious and airborne military assault exercises involving 20,000 troops, 40 ships and 100 aircraft -- designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan -- preceded the island's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway now. China fears that Taiwan will be seen as a model for political reform on the mainland, and is resentful of Taiwan's growing economic prosperity, based on a Western-style free market. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most portentous of all, the PRC may be preparing for a more decisive confrontation with Taiwan in the future. In a speech Jan. 30, Premiere Li Peng said that "During the period [1996-2000] ... settling the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese people." Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that "the important role to be played by the Army in taking back Taiwan," was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the face of such challenges, President Clinton so far has chosen to hide his head in the sand. This makes America appear weak, not just to China, but to Taiwan and our other Asian allies as well. If America doesn't even have the nerve to talk tough to China before a crisis erupts, why should anyone believe we would defend Taiwan with force in the event of an attack? 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There need not be a military crisis over Taiwan. All it would take to insure that it doesn't come would be some tough talk and a little saber rattling of our own. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What's so hard about that?    
<p>

<title>Why We Should Be Worried About Russia - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 February 29, 1996<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Russia has the potential to become a far more dangerous and unstable adversary than the Soviet Union ever was. Yet, as the April summit between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin approaches, U.S. and international policy-makers seem oblivious to developments that daily make a future belligerent regime in Russia more likely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $10.2 billion loan, and the U.S.- run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Clinton strongly endorses the IMF loan, hoping it will bolster Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will only encourage Russia on its destructive course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If a hard-line communist like Gennady Zyuganov were to carry the presidential election this June, which looks increasingly likely, IMF credits would be going to precisely the kind of regime that could resume threatening the United States and Europe with nuclear weapons. There is a chance that these loans would never be repaid since, under a communist government, Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economic reforms in Russia are grinding to a halt. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining radical reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics, whose power and influence are gaining strength. Vladimir Kadannikov, Chubais' replacement, directed Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, in 1995 Russia's inflation rate raged between 120 and 130 percent, budget deficits remain very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading Yeltsin administration officials such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, along with communist deputies in the Duma, are seriously considering reversing privatization and stopping economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, election pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to powerful industry groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry and $2.2 billion in back wages has been promised to public-sector workers. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion; $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector; half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and more than $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces. All of these are panic-driven political payoffs by a frightened regime fighting for its survival.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to be providing policy advice to Russian leaders on decreasing tax rates to boost private enterprise and encouraging investment to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Only when investment, both foreign and domestic, is able to create prosperity for the Russian people will the tensions tearing the country apart be eased.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has become such an investment risk that more than $12 billion a year is leaving the country  to be deposited in foreign banks. Such capital flight -- the result of incoherent economic policies -- is starving the Russian economy of investment and taxable income and creating political unrest. Even as it asks the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving sizable debts owed to it: $8 billion owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi; $3 billion owed by the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua; and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, Russia continues to prosecute the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war is costing more than $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most ominous of all, the country may be on the brink of a takeover by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the unreformed communists who has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  Leading in opinion polls, he is followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared he will restore the Russian empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration should not lobby the IMF on behalf of Russia. More money  is not what Russia needs. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by a future anti-Western leadership. Instead, President Clinton should take the lead in ensuring that all aid to Russia is conditioned on the adoption of free-market and democratic reforms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Otherwise, the foundation for a Russia more dangerous than the Soviet Union will continue to be laid.

<title>Raising the Bar - Heritage Commentary</title>

<center>
<h3>RAISING THE BAR</h3>
By Nina Shokraii<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the debate over affirmative action about to begin in Congress, opponents of racial quotas and preferences should be ready to offer a better way of creating opportunity for racial groups that have been victims of discrimination.  The answer is high academic standards for everyone.
<p> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics.  Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending a message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that when there are high expectations, black and Hispanic children can meet them.  Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores are artificially raised to compensate for racial status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Take, for instance, the experience of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School, located near the site of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.  Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American.  But by the end of the sixth grade, Esquith's students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight Shakespeare plays.  His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.  Their performance of "Measure for Measure" will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class?  The same way outstanding teachers always do.  He sets high standards and gives his students the help they need to meet them.  Esquith begins teaching his class at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.)  By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile and the district in the 47th percentile.  On the English test, they produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language. If not for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grassroots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math.  Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra vs. Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.  Lerner believes schools should make the minimum competence exam the standard for grade-school graduation and also should require children to pass an advanced competence test like the Scholastic Aptitude Test to graduate from high school.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests.  According to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, only 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test.  And of these 17 states, only New York  has made significant strides. Thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City.  Although the results of the first year reveal a rise in course-failure rates among African-Americans and Hispanics, the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of affirmative action present myriad empowerment ideas, such as school-choice vouchers, when challenged to offer alternatives. But as the experiences of teachers like Esquith demonstrate, promoting high standards has proven to boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The best kind of affirmative action is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.

<title>Liberalism's Last Stand -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<font size=6>Liberalism's Last Stand</font><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>February 23, 1996<BR>
</FONT>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are making a big deal out of President
Clinton's rebounding poll numbers, seeing in them a repudiation
of Congress' conservatism. Nice try, but the budget battle between
Congress and the White House - the occasion for the president's
popularity spike - is actually liberalism's last stand.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Traditionally three pillars have propped up the
liberal nanny state: the federal tax system, entitlement programs
and special-interest pork. The budget debate, by placing the national
focus squarely on fiscal sanity and common sense, has dealt a
severe blow to all three.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Start with entitlements. Even after the 1994 elections
gave conservatives control of Congress for the first time in a
generation, nobody expected lawmakers to tackle the No. 1 enemy
of fiscal restraint: entitlement spending. Yet one year later,
serious efforts are underway to reform three of the four largest
entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and cash welfare (known
as Aid to Families with Dependent Children).  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are willing to go to incredible lengths
to defend the status quo -- for example, by lying about Medicare
&quot;cuts&quot; when spending would rise from $4,800 to $7,100
per beneficiary. Entitlements used to be the liberals' ace in
the hole when Americans thought the &quot;rich&quot; were funding
them. But now that we know who's really paying -- our children
- even Americans who believe strongly in the entitlement programs
concede we have to make reforms.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Further frustrating liberals is the fact that the
days of freewheeling pork-barrel spending are coming to an end.
While Congress' 1996 spending bills contain their share of pork,
there's a lot less than in the past. The transportation appropriations
bill, for example, eliminated all &quot;highway demonstration
projects,&quot; which cost taxpayers millions of dollars a year.
As the traditional beneficiaries of the pork-barrel system liberals
are grieving its impending demise.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Finally, there's taxes. It is inconceivable that
anyone but the most hidebound liberal would argue that America
needs a tax hike. On the contrary, the debate today is not over
whether to cut taxes, but by how much. This is true even though
Congress is in the midst of a historic effort to balance the budget.
Liberals hoped the need to eliminate the deficit would compel
Americans to accept high taxes as a necessary evil, at least for
the time being. Not so. Most Americans want both a balanced budget
and tax cuts. If that means cutting spending more, so be it.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Moreover, the budget debate is only the first round
in the larger fight over taxes.  As those of us who served on
the Kemp Commission on tax reform (which recently came out in
support of a flat tax) know full well, the current system has
virtually no defenders. Not only is it too costly, forcing Americans
to send an average of one-fourth of their income to Washington,
but it is unfair, overly complex, anti-investment and punitive.
 How in the world are liberals going to defend such a system?</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals love to point out that the 104th Congress
has accomplished only a small part of its agenda. Yet from a conservative
standpoint this is a huge victory. By simply changing the terms
of the debate, conservatives both in and out of Congress have
seen to it that the country's inexorable march toward bigger government
has been halted in its tracks.  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> On the issues that matter -- taxes, entitlements,
and the corrupt and costly pork-barrel system -- the conservative
philosophy has routed liberalism. That's why the budget debate
 which is really a proxy for the larger battle over the size and
scope and government -- is liberalism's last stand.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>FDA: The Smoking Police<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Is the government supposed to protect us from everything
that could possibly harm us? Or are there some areas where we
should be responsible for taking care of ourselves?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Take teenagers and smoking. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and its Commissioner David Kessler are getting ready to
pounce on America with a litany of new regulations aimed at stopping
teens from smoking. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> The FDA's proposed restrictions include:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning cigarette vending machines and self-service
displays in stores;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Requiring tobacco companies to launch a $150
million-per-year nationwide TV ad campaign to discourage underage
smoking;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning the use of tobacco brand names on T-shirts,
hats, keychains and lighters; and</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning brand-name sponsorship of sporting events,
such as the Virginia Slims tennis tournament.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Of course, we all agree underage teenagers shouldn't
smoke; that's not the issue. The issue is whether the FDA should
launch yet another extravagant regulatory crusade whose nuisance
value will likely outweigh any benefits. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Remember: this is the FDA that conducted the 1991
raid that captured 24,000 half-gallons of Citrus Hill &quot;fresh
choice&quot; orange juice, all because the agency didn't like
the way the o.j. was labeled! Are the food and drug police now
going to swoop down on every mom and pop grocery store to make
sure teen employees aren't smoking in the boy's room? </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Apparently so. Since 1990, the FDA's staff has grown
from 7,600 to 8,700, and its budget has ballooned from $598 million
to $760 million. They've got to do something with all that extra
manpower and money.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> So, now they're going to send out an army of regulators
whose job will be to make sure mom and pop conceal cigarettes
from view - as if this ever stopped a teenager from doing something
he or she was determined to do. Store workers will have to take
time out to deal with every tobacco transaction, since cigarettes
will only be sold from behind the counter and not from self-service
displays. The watchdogs will probably even send in teenagers paid
to test the system. If something slips through the cracks, out
come the handcuffs!</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Come on. American University student and former
Heritage Foundation intern Jennifer Murray may have said it best
in a recent essay when she accused President Clinton of forgetting
what it's like to be a teenager. &quot;Formula-One racing cars
painted with tobacco company logos, billboards at sports events,
advertisements in magazines (particulary of those men on horseback)
- none of these had anything to do with my [former] tendency to
light up,&quot; Jennifer confessed. &quot;The main contributor
was something President Clinton's 'solutions' would only encourage:
rebellion.&quot; The new federal regulations, far from preventing
teens from smoking, &quot;by focusing additional attention on
the forbidden, could actually entice them,&quot; Jennifer warns.
 </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Isn't there someone more qualified than the FDA
orange juice police to address this issue? Such as parents?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Let's get real. As Jennifer pointed out, &quot;Banning
cigarette ads and vending machines will do more for President
Clinton's wavering image than it will for teens.&quot; Does anyone
really believe the president is lying awake at night worrying
about teen smoking? I kinda doubt it. But he is worried about
being popular in an election year. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Smoking sure isn't as popular as it used to be.
And everybody cares about kids.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> You do the math.<BR>

<h3>THE EMERGING INTERNATIONAL MAFIA</h3>

By <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Sen. Charles Grassley</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even as America wages a fierce battle against organized 
criminal gangs here at home, the threat to U.S. interests from an emerging international crime cartel 
grows more serious every day. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Groups like the Colombian Cartels, the Asian Triads and the 
Italian Mafias -- long destabilizing factors in their host countries -- are becoming significant players 
on the international stage, carrying out their criminal activities across borders and threatening the 
stability and interests of numerous countries.  In short, they have become an international security 
threat.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fresh evidence of this growing threat comes from Colombia, 
where President Ernesto Samper is under pressure to resign for allegedly taking massive campaign 
contributions for his 1994 presidential race from the Cali cocaine cartel. Whether these particular 
charges are true or not, groups like the Cali cartel -- which is already responsible for up to 80 
percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States -- are increasingly able to operate above the 
law, buying off or even killing the government officials who are supposed to work with U.S. law-
enforcement agencies to crack down on crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's worse, the cartels, triads and Mafias are now forging 
alliances with criminal organizations in Russia, Mexico and Nigeria, giving these organized crime 
syndicates a truly international reach.  They are becoming an international crime corporation with 
illegal franchises spanning the globe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ability of these groups to operate with complete 
disregard for local or international law -- not to mention common decency -- now threatens to 
destabilize a number of countries, especially poor states that are trying to implement economic and 
democratic reforms.  By corrupting government officials and undermining legitimate business 
enterprises, these criminal cabals threaten to set back progress in developing nations by many years, 
and in the case of Russia, could forestall reform indefinitely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The list of crimes the new international criminal 
organizations are involved in is long.  They traffic in drugs, people, and chemical, biological and 
nuclear material.  They perpetrate billions of dollars worth of fraud against banks, businesses and 
governments.  They destroy lives, undermine economies, diminish confidence in political and 
economic reform, and spread corruption and violence.  In short, they have become an international 
security threat. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What to do?  Clearly, we need to devise a new foreign policy 
to deal with these criminal groups -- to put them out of business and in jail.  In his recent speech to 
the United Nations, President Clinton acknowledged the growing threat posed by international 
criminal groups and called for stronger efforts to fight these organizations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such efforts must achieve several goals: dismantle the major 
criminal groups, stiffen the penalties for engaging in international crime, and foster international 
cooperation to counter the actions of criminal elements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At home, U.S. policy-makers can take concrete steps to help 
meet these goals.  We must beef up intelligence capabilities against key groups and their leaders.  
We must work with other countries to strengthen their legal systems and police forces.  We must 
enhance our ability to monitor the flow of money to prevent criminal organizations from abusing 
international financial and banking systems.  And we must increase international awareness of the 
threat these groups pose and forge a united front to bring them to justice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No country is immune from the debilitating influence of 
international organized crime. The political corruption scandals in Colombia and Italy, the 
challenge to democracy in Russia, the brazen ruthlessness of the Mexican Mafia, and U.S. streets 
awash in drugs -- all are the product of ruthless criminal organizations willing to trample human life 
and dignity in their rush for ill-gotten gain. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the most powerful country on earth, the United States has 
an obligation to lead the world in crafting a tough, international response. Just as President Bush 
cobbled together a coalition to counter the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, so too must President 
Clinton start to work with any interested nation in challenging the threat posed by the new 
international crime cartels.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unlike Colombia, the United States has not yet faced a 
political threat from international criminal activity.  But we see the impact of the international 
crime on our streets every day, in the wasted lives and drug violence tearing our cities apart.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Cold War may be over, but America still has enemies in 
the world. Emerging international crime cartels are simply the latest.  The United States cannot 
afford to ignore this problem, but must begin to fashion a foreign-policy response as tough as the 
stand we take against criminal groups here at home.
<p>

chairman of the Senate Anti-Narcotics Caucus, is adapted from his recent speech at <a

<title>Welfare Reform and the Death of Marriage  Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>WELFARE REFORM AND THE DEATH OF MARRIAGE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress is considering adopting a welfare reform plan 
recently put forward by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, the governors plan blithely ignores 
Americas No. 1 social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of  American children born last year were 
born out of wedlock. The illegitimate birthrate is now rising one percentage point every year. In the 
black community the out-of-wedlock birthrate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of  
marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihans warning was dismissed at the time, but the 
breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst 
nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimate birthrate among whites is 
now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised 
his alarm. The white family is now teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the 
same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Family collapse is the root cause of other social problems: 
poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more 
likely to be poor than are those born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent 
homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock when compared to girls 
from intact non-welfare families. And a boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as 
likely to engage in crime when compared to a similar boy who is poor, but living with a father and 
a mother.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nations governors have responded to this grim 
reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan they have declared that there are three 
key elements to real welfare reform:  1.) providing more government-funded day-care;  2.) 
increasing child-support payments from absent fathers; and 3.) imposing time limits and work 
requirements (with lots of loopholes) on welfare recipients. The rise in illegitimacy and collapse of 
marriage do not merit even a token comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the governors. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thus, over the last year, the welfare debate has 
undergone a radical metamorphosis from a focus on combating illegitimacy to a focus on providing 
public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of 
illegitimacy entirely, the governors plan instead appears as preparation for a future in which 
marriage plays a sharply diminished role, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the 
needs of an burgeoning population of single-parent families.  The triumph of the left on this aspect 
of the debate has been complete: Fighting illegitimacy is out and funding government day-care is 
in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is 
unneeded: If left alone, the governors will, on their own, tackle the problem. But the governors 
silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of 
reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge or mention 
the collapse of marriage and the rise of illegitimacy in their plan, the governors are implicitly 
condoning and (through paralysis) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They 
are clearly embarked on a path that will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born 
out of wedlock and raised in government day-care centers. This is not reform. It is a national 
disaster.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The governors plan, borrowing heavily from the 
reform schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails with the interests of 
Americas huge welfare bureaucracy -- an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will 
trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning 
rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an explosive rise in welfare and social-service spending in 
the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed 
legislation, Congress is committed to spending nearly a half trillion dollars over seven years to 
subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, day-
care, job training and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 
to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The governors welfare reform plan would distort 
priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight 
illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a tragedy. Marriage in America is dying. The 
governors have prepared not a rescue plan but a coffin. Many in Congress now seem resigned to 
assuming roles as undertakers. The simple fact is that welfare reform is nonsense as long as the 
illegitimate birth rate continues to rise. The silence of the governors on the issue is deafening. The 
welfare debate has become like a tea party on the Titanic in which the participants politely refrain 
from mentioning that the deck is tilting 40 degrees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and are sorely 
lacking.

<P>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By John Walters<BR>
</FONT>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></CENTER>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The budget debate between President
Clinton and Congress is about a lot more than the current level
of federal spending and whether or not taxes should be raised.
It's about who should be responsible for addressing America's
social problems. For example, who should take care of America's
drug problems?</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> President Clinton wants Washington
-- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge.
The congressional leadership argues that big government has failed
to address America's human needs. They want to return responsibility
to where it has historically rested -- with families, neighborhoods,
communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.
</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The president's position was illustrated
when he threw down the gauntlet in his State of the Union address:
&quot;I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free
schools.&quot; Clinton was referring to June 1995, when he vetoed
legislation to limit the Department of Education's &quot;Drug-Free
Schools and Communities&quot; program. With teenage drug use rising
rapidly since 1992, the president has calculated that Congress
can't successfully oppose anti-drug programs for America's youth.
But this completely ignores the question of who is responsible
for taking action.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Because the congressional leadership believes
the federal government should let communities tackle their own
problems, it voted last year to cut the $465-million budget for
Clinton's anti-drug program by 60 percent. With cameras rolling,
Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans
&quot;extremists&quot; opposed to drug education. In other words,
as far as the president is concerned, Congress' opposition to
federal anti-drug programs equals opposition to doing anything
about the teen drug problem. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Of course, no one doubts the importance
of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important
responsibilities, including bringing international drug traffickers
to justice, stopping interstate commerce in illegal substances,
and cracking down on money-laundering schemes. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> But teaching children that drug
use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents
and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions,
schools and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient
for conveying this very personal message to children on a consistent
basis.</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Moreover, the program in question
provides just $7.25 per pupil each year. By the time this money
makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies,
many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests
that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young
people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so without a
federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Drug-Free Schools program began
in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war
on drugs. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain
the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that
crack use had peaked in 1985 and then declined rapidly -- proving
that efforts on the part of parents and communities were working
long before any federal program tried to help them.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Yet, the federal
government increased funding for Drug-Free Schools from $200 million
in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, paying little attention
to what was happening to the money. Meanwhile, according to former
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson, &quot;The health-education
lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another
personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote
controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and
enriched health-education consultants.&quot;
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Before Michigan
Gov. John Engler stopped it, $32 million in anti-drug funds was
diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health.
More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and
toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the &quot;experts,&quot; do
not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the
human torso used just one time. In Washington, D.C., a school
used federal anti-drug money to take its basketball team to a
restaurant. And according to congressional testimony, 400 students
at Dallas' Sunset High School received &quot;A&quot;s for a federally
funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no
teacher.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However well-intentioned, the nationalization of efforts
to solve problems that should be dealt with on the local level
undermines local and national responsibility and accountability.
By claiming that effective anti-drug education can only come through
federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a
disservice.</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Parents, teachers and community
leaders should stop leaving to the federal government a responsibility
that really belongs to them. </FONT>

<h3>WHY THE BUDGET DEBATE MATTERS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 15, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CBO, OMB, baseline budgeting, reductions in the rate of 
growth.  To most Americans the budget battle between Congress and the White House has been 
impenetrable, a duel over accounting methods "explained" in acronyms only the initiated can 
understand.  No wonder many Americans are tuning out, or worse, focusing on the only part of 
the debate they can grasp -- the partisan sniping.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a shame. The budget debate is the most important 
political discussion this nation has had in a generation -- a debate over what kind of country we 
want the United States to be.  On one side are those who want the federal government to possess 
unlimited resources, the better to fix every conceivable social problem the country might face.  
For debate purposes, these are the liberals. On the other side are those who believe the federal 
government's power should be strictly limited, the better to preserve personal freedom and allow 
individuals to keep what they earn.  These are the conservatives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The budget is the battlefield on which these two visions for 
America clash, and no issue highlights the divide between these two camps more boldly than 
taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For conservatives, the tax issue boils down to one simple 
question: Whose money is it anyway? If, as conservatives believe, the money people earn 
belongs to them, then taxes should be kept as low as possible.  Which means current tax rates 
need to be cut.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Liberals focus on a different question: How will tax cuts 
affect Treasury receipts?  The measure of tax "fairness" is not whether Americans are forced to 
pay too much, but whether the government has all the "revenue" it needs to run its myriad social 
programs. In this view, the American people not only have a duty to pay steep taxes, but should 
feel honored for the opportunity to help create utopia right here in the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Or take another hot-button issue: welfare.  The debate is not 
about "ending welfare as we know it," as the president vowed to do during the 1992 campaign.  
In truth, we all want to end welfare as we know it: liberals, by increasing spending on a variety 
of programs that, after the Great Society's many failures, will finally (they hope) replace welfare 
with work;  conservatives, by spending less and weaning people off their dependence on 
"compassionate" government.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On foreign policy,  the budget debate casts into stark relief 
serious differences over America's role in the world. It's probably true, as liberals claim, that they 
do not view America as the world's policeman.  In reality it's worse: They view America as an 
international welfare agency whose social workers (read: soldiers) can and should criss-cross the 
globe doing good deeds like keeping peace and building nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	None of this is said to disparage liberals as people.  With 
the best intentions they have guided -- or misguided -- our national policies for the better part of 
the 20th century.  But now liberalism is choking on its own political success.  It's overarching 
goal -- a vast federal government mobilized to redress all social ills -- has been achieved, but at 
the cost of almost $80,000 in public debt for every family in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite its continuing failure at the polls, liberalism refuses 
to go quietly.  In the current budget battle,  liberals have ruthlessly employed the only weapons 
remaining in their arsenal: fear and distortion.  For example, the proposed Republican balanced 
budget calls for a 7 percent annual increase in Medicare spending; liberals portray this as a 
"cruel" cut.  GOP efforts to return power and responsibility to the states are portrayed as a secret 
scheme to kill school lunches or hurt the poor.  And plans to rein in the spiraling costs of 
Medicare, which is heading for bankruptcy as sure as this is 1996, is depicted as an attempt to 
deny health-care benefits to the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is that kind of misrepresentation that betrays the fatigue 
liberalism is feeling these days.  It has no new ideas to offer, no agenda other than preserving the 
status quo.  For this reason the current budget battle may very well be one of the last debates in 
which 1960s-style liberalism even has a voice.
<p>

<HTML><title>Compulsory Union Dues Pay for Politics  -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>COMPULSORY UNION DUES PAY FOR POLITICS </h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 1, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Democrat Ron Wyden's victory in the Oregon special election is sure to spark speculation about which party will win big this November, it also shows how the money of average Americans can be used against their wishes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After all, the AFL-CIO and other labor unions provided tremendous support for Wyden's candidacy. And all too often labor union officials rely on compulsory dues to finance political activism. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The pro-Wyden effort provides a glimpse at organized labor's plans for the 1996 elections. The AFL-CIO recently announced a plan to spend more than $35 million this year -- seven times the usual amount -- on electioneering. Unfortunately, many of these activities will be financed involuntarily by rank-and-file union members who may disagree with the agendas of union officials. Republican and Democratic unionists alike are compelled to pay dues to the labor officials; these dues are then used to pay for many political activities.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Congress may soon debate campaign finance reform legislation. Ending this unjust abuse of hard-working men and women should be a part of any true reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the past few months, a sleeping giant awoke when the AFL-CIO elected a new  leadership dedicated to advancing a far-left political agenda.  When John Sweeney took over the union's leadership late last year he pledged greater political involvement by the organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After his installation as AFL-CIO president, Sweeney swiftly moved to put a new face in charge of election activities by naming former Clinton administration Labor Department official Steve Rosenthal as the union's political director. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich declared, "Steve Rosenthal will be a valuable asset in the new leadership's mission to revitalize the nation's union movement." Sweeney said Rosenthal's task would be "building a powerful, progressive national movement of working people."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The just-completed special election in Oregon to fill the seat of former Sen. Robert Packwood provided the new leaders a chance to flex their partisan muscles. According to AFL-CIO documents, there were more than 25 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) devoted full-time to the efforts to elect a Democratic senator. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Political director Rosenthal bragged, "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to an estimated 40,000." The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces with at least 11 other unions, organized labor was able to mount a considerable presence in this one race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Letter Carriers, and the Teamsters. The considerable firepower these organizations mustered resulted in more than $183,000 in political action committee (PAC) donations to the democratic candidate. Not a single dollar of union donations went to the GOP nominee. Are all union members Democrats? We doubt it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, these direct donations were only a small part of the picture. No doubt many of the organizers, mailings and phone banks were financed directly by the unions at substantially more than the cost of the PAC donations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics came under scrutiny by the media and the voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for ads they ran blaming the death of a teenage worker on the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it off the air. Fair-minded union members of either party could strongly object to such tactics. Yet, their dues more than likely paid for them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politicking is nothing new. There is no question that labor unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. But as the clamor for campaign finance reform continues, it behooves members of Congress to consider whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities whether they agree with those activities or not. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate support and neither should their organized labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions are used for politics.  Aggressive political activities by labor unions must not be funded by coercion. Congress should end these corrupt practices.
<P>

<h3>Remember the Victims of Communism</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

January 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	In America we have memorials commemorating those who died in the Civil War, both 
World Wars, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, the holocaust, and the civil rights movement.  But 
we have no memorial to the 100 million casualties of the most brutal genocide ever visited upon 
the human race:  communism.
<p>	Fortunately, this glaring oversight is about to be rectified.  In 1993 -- more than 75 years 
after the Bolsheviks first embarked on their glorious revolution -- Congress approved and 
President Clinton signed legislation authorizing a memorial to the victims of communism.
<p>	It's long overdue.  In all of world history, no political ideology has sent more people to 
the slaughterhouse than Karl Marx's utopian pipe-dream.  Even Hitler, certainly one of history's 
most demented butchers, killed only one-tenth the number of people that Marx's disciples killed. 
Yet, most Americans have no idea just how bloody communism's legacy is. 
<P>	How many Americans, for example, know that between 1917 and 1987 the communist 
dictators in the former Soviet Union murdered 62 million people? How many know that China, 
has killed more than 38 million people?  These two communist regimes alone have stamped out 
100 million human lives -- 25 million more than died in the Black Plague, formerly the world's 
deadliest disaster.
<p>	And this doesn't even include the body count from the smaller communist regimes:  
Cambodia, 2 million dead at the hands of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge; Vietnam, 850,000 sacrificed 
to the greater glory of Ho Chi Minh; Ethiopia, tens of thousands slaughtered during Mengistu 
Haile Mariam's "Red Terror"; and Cuba, whose death toll, while certainly in the tens of 
thousands, only Fidel Castro knows for sure. 
<p>	As much as some would like to downplay the horrors of communism (frequently because 
they viewed the United States as a threat to mankind equal to the regimes committing these 
horrors), communism's signature has never changed: death.
<p>	Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it, the philosopher George Santayana 
said.  That's why a memorial to the victims of communism in the nation's capital is necessary 
and proper.  
<p>	Future generations must know that when you impose a ruthless ideology by force -- no 
matter how "well-intentioned" -- the result is human carnage.  So it is with a deep sense of honor 
that I've accepted an invitation to serve on the memorial's advisory board.  
<P>	Fittingly, the memorial also will celebrate those heroes who made possible the West's 
victory over tyranny. As observed by my colleague and long-time Cold Warrior Hugh Newton -- 
to whom credit goes for the idea of an anti-communist Hall of Heroes -- without the likes of 
Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Lech Walesa and Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn, among others, we'd still be worried about trading missiles with Russia, rather than 
trading goods.
<p>	As befits a memorial to the victims of government-sponsored violence, the project will be 
funded entirely with private money.  The goal is to raise $100 million -- one dollar for each of 
the 100 million victims of Marx and Mao.  
<p>	In addition to a roll call of every victim of communism that can be identified and the Hall 
of Heroes, the memorial also will feature a Hall of Infamy -- artifacts of communism's 
inhumanity to man, including a section of the Berlin Wall, a re-creation of a barracks from the 
Soviet Gulag, a "room" at the Hanoi Hilton and a cell at Castro's infamous Isle of Pines.
<p>	If you would like to join many of us and contribute to the creation of this memorial, I 
encourage you to do so.  Just write to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, P.O. 
Box 1997, Washington, DC 20013-1997.  Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao will never be forgotten, 
and neither should their victims.

<title>Chic Prejudice -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<center>
<h3>Chic Prejudice</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	Each year in homes across America anxious parents and high school students undergo the 
familiar ritual of trying to decide which college or university to attend. In recent years, several 
widely-respected national magazines have helped spawn a small cottage industry that rates the 
best of the nation's institutions of higher learning.
<P>	One of the most widely-read of these surveys is the one compiled by the <i>U.S. News & 
World Report</i>. Another is a survey offered by <i>Money Magazine</i>. While <i>U.S. 
News</i> offers what I think is a rather objective analysis, the same cannot be said for 
<i>Money Magazine</i>'s recently published 9th annual college survey. 
<p>	I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to find explicit anti-religious bias in the Money survey. 
 After all, the magazine is owned by Time Warner, Inc., whose corporate leaders take a long time 
to learn why they shouldn't publish murderous song lyrics by hoodlum "artists." And the U.S. 
media in general have been under fire for years for religious bias they apparently consider 
permissible, even chic.
<p>	But I was outraged when I heard <i>Money</i>'s response to a complaint from Thomas 
J. Savage, president of Jesuit-run Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo., which was 
purposefully excluded from the 1996 <i>Money</i> survey, having been included in 1995. As 
Jillian Kasky, <i>Money</i>'s associate editor for statistics, wrote back to Savage: "We exclude 
colleges whose primary purpose is to turn out members of the clergy, colleges that require an 
affirmation of faith from students, colleges where the curriculum or extracurricular activities 
significantly reflect the ideology of a specific faith, and colleges where religious study of any 
nature is a significant academic requirement."
<p>	On its face, this is a perplexing standard. Why should a college -- any college -- that 
seeks to produce people of high moral character and fortified personal religious beliefs be  left 
out of such an important survey? How is it that other Catholic schools such as Georgetown 
University -- also run by the Jesuits -- and the University of Notre Dame made the survey while 
Rockhurst and other lesser-known schools did not? 
<p>	This begins to look like prejudice of the worst kind: the kind that falsely bows and 
scrapes before the high and mighty while sticking it to the little guy. 
<p>	Such prejudice is also ignorant, both of the place of religion in education and of its 
history in the United States. After all, all education used to be religious education -- run by 
clergy, the most highly educated class in any Western society. Many of America's best-known 
colleges, Harvard University among them, began with the sole purpose of educating men for the 
clergy. None of this was seen as inconsistent with the highest intellectual standards. Why? 
Because it wasn't. 
<P>	A fact unknown in the chic salons of Time Warner and the high and mighty media 
newsrooms is that today many scientists see a lot more room for belief in a Creator -- as a result 
of 20th-century discoveries in quantum physics, astrophysics, molecular biology and many other 
disciplines -- than did their 19th-century counterparts.  As Henry Margenau, retired Yale 
professor of  physics and natural philosophy and a colleague of Albert Einstein, told a friend of 
mine a few years ago, "High school science teachers, Carl Sagan, people like that -- they still 
carry around the old bias against religion. But to the real scientists -- the ones making the 
discoveries -- religion no longer poses a problem for them."  
<p>	There are still a few parents and students in this country who choose a college for reasons 
other than its proximity to pubs, beaches, malls or nightclubs. With the frightening decline in 
standards, values and civility ripping at America's moral and social fabric, colleges that offer 
students moral, as well as practical instruction still rank high on many families' lists.
<p>
	Too bad they don't even show up on <i>Money Magazine</i>'s list.

<title>Wrong Way to Honor Reagan -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3><i>Wrong Way To Honor Reagan</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	What's the best way to pay tribute to a former president?  
<p>
	Well, some have had their faces chiseled into the sides of a famous mountain. A few have 
earned -- pardon the pun -- a stamp of approval, with their likeness adorning stamps issued by the 
U.S. Postal Service. Others appear on our dollar bills and coins. And some even get buildings 
named after them. Usually this makes a good deal of sense. Usually -- but not always. 
<P>
	Consider what's happening in Washington. A soon-to-be-famous building -- or maybe I 
should say, infamous -- now called the Federal Triangle Project needs a name.  
<p>
 	Located two blocks from the White House, this half-a-billion dollar government colossus is 
millions and millions of dollars over budget, lavish beyond compare, and almost four years behind 
schedule.  
<p>
	The building has 3.1 million square feet of space -- second in size only to the huge 
Pentagon complex, which has 3.9 million square feet. It sprawls across 11 acres and rises 10 stories 
high, with five more levels underground. When the complex opens in December 1996, it will have 
85 elevators, eight escalators, a six-story atrium, 13,000 doors, limestone exteriors, a limestone 
rotunda, 904 windows, several live-performance theaters, a health club, an elaborate food court, 
storefront offices, and plans for a 620-seat auditorium and movie theater. Now the bureaucrats can 
enjoy a movie during their extended coffee breaks! 
<p>
	As the most grandiose government building ever erected, the Federal Triangle Project 
represents the ultimate monument to government waste. 
<p>
	So whose name do you think they want to put on this monstrosity? Lyndon Johnson, who 
launched the government's failed $5.4 trillion War on Poverty? Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., 
maybe? He's long been known as Mr. Pork Barrel on Capitol Hill.  
<p>
	Nope. Actually official Washington has proposed naming the building after the man who 
tried hardest to stop wasteful government spending, the anti-waste crusader himself: Ronald 
Reagan. 
<p>
	Incredible, but true. Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan. and Sen. Daniel P.  
Moynihan, D-N.Y., want to honor the former president by naming the structure the Ronald 
Reagan Building and International Trade Center. 
<p>
	They ought to know better. Reagan is the one president in recent memory most identified 
with fighting big government. In his eight years in the White House, he waged a relentless battle to 
bring big government to heel. Now they want to honor this valiant effort with a building costing 
$656 million: the most expensive government building ever.
<p>
	Someone needs to stop this travesty. Ronald Reagan wanted to reduce the size of 
government, not expand it. He wanted to get the bureaucracy off the backs of the American people, 
not house it in palatial splendor. Naming this bureaucratic Taj Mahal in his honor seems the least 
fitting tribute I can think of.
<p>
	Ironically, some of the agencies hand-picked by Clinton administration officials to move 
into the complex would have been eliminated during the Reagan era if Congress would have gone 
along.
<p>
	There are lots of  better ways to honor President Reagan than by putting his name on this 
government monstrosity. As his son, radio talk-show host Michael Reagan, said recently, Ronald 
Reagan should be on Mount Rushmore. Not Mount Wastemore.

<h3>SPECIAL INTERESTS STILL GET YOUR MONEY</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

	Washington loves to wring its hands over a complex problem few people understand, 
enact reforms that don't really solve it, and then crow about having made the world a better place 
when election time rolls around. This is exactly what will happen as a result of a "reform" 
enacted last year ostensibly to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and political activity.
<p>	The problem, in a nutshell, is this: There are many special-interest lobbying groups that 
get much of their funding from you, the taxpayer. Instead of finding out whether you agree with 
their cause and asking for a contribution, these groups take the lucrative shortcut of going to 
Congress. They convince lawmakers to grant large sums to certain programs and then sign up to 
receive funding through those same programs. In effect, they've found a way to get your money 
whether you agree with their cause or not.
<p>	It's easy to muddy debate over such a problem with dire predictions of suffering and 
mayhem if this or that group is no longer able to raid the public trough. So, the public is rarely 
permitted to see the real issue clearly. But this time around, the debate became clear enough that 
even lawmakers -- and lobbyists -- worried about a backlash. They enacted a reform that seemed 
to do something about taxpayer-funded lobbying. Only problem is, they left open a loophole 
wide enough to drive a busful of lobbyists through. 
<p>	Under the new law, big lobbying groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens 
(NCSC) and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), known by their tax-code 
designation of 501(c)4, may no longer receive federal grants or contracts, since the Internal 
Revenue Code states that these groups may engage in an unlimited amount of lobbying. Both the 
NCSC and AARP currently benefit from $70 million to $80 million in taxpayers' money each 
year, amounting to 96 percent and 20 percent of their budgets, respectively.
<p>	But the measure doesn't prevent these groups from simply forming 501(c)3 charitable 
organizations which can accept federal money. In fact, both the AARP and NCSC already have 
such affiliated groups. No wonder the defenders of welfare for lobbyists launched no opposition 
to the new lobbying reform provision. They understood it was not a threat. 
<p>	Unfortunately, this isn't the only problem with the new law. For example, the reform 
focused solely on 501(c)4 lobbying groups, while ignoring labor unions and other big taxpayer-
funded groups such as Planned Parenthood, which represent a significant share of the existing 
abuse. The simple fact is that no special-interest group that engages in lobbying or political 
activity should be subsidized by the taxpayers. The question isn't whether or not the causes these 
groups espouse are just, or whether or not you agree with them. The question is whether all 
Americans should be forced to pay for them, whether they want to or not.
<p>	This isn't a liberal vs. conservative issue. The American people are a diverse population 
with differing political views. To force hard-working taxpayers to contribute to political causes 
they may abhor is wrong. It is just as bad to fund the NCSC, the AFL-CIO, or Planned 
Parenthood -- three major offenders --  as it would be to send grants to the National Rifle 
Association or Christian Coalition.	
<p>	The new year brings new opportunities for Congress to end these abuses. For example, 
the appropriations committees should examine programs like the Labor Department's Senior 
Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) that serve as slush funds for lobbyists. The 
SCSEP provides $320 million (out of a $400 million allotment) to just nine lobbying groups like 
NCSC and AARP to subsidize their operations.
<p>	Congress should compel witnesses testifying before congressional committees to divulge 
any federal funding they receive. In addition, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., has suggested a "Let 
America Know Amendment" that would force taxpayer-subsidized groups to disclose the extent 
of their political advocacy. Both of these reforms would go a long way toward increasing 
awareness of this vitally important issue.
<p>	But most important, Congress should close off any and all avenues and loopholes by 
which lobbying groups can receive taxpayer funding. This should be high on the list of 
unfinished business this year.

<title>Guess Who's Getting Your Campaign Contribution? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>GUESS WHO'S GETTING YOUR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION?</h3>
By Corinne Coldwell<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	You know that voluntary check-off box on your federal income-tax form for contributing 
to presidential campaigns? Who do you think is collecting all that money? President Clinton, 
maybe? Or Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., and the other GOP contenders for the nation's highest 
office? 
<p>	As a matter of fact, many legitimate presidential contenders have collected "presidential 
matching funds" this year. But so has a candidate whose platform includes a provision to 
colonize Mars.
<p>	Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was released from prison two years ago after duping his 
supporters out of $34 million for a 1988 presidential bid, is among the many candidates who 
have applied for matching funds to finance his latest campaign.
<p>	LaRouche began his perennial bids for the presidency when public money became 
available 20 years ago. In fact, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) decision to deny LaRouche 
public funds in 1992  -- when he was running his presidential campaign out of prison -- was 
overturned in court last year, granting him $568,534 in taxpayer dollars. 
<P>	With such lavish funding, he is able to promote his paranoid suspicions, for example, that 
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has spied for the Russians, and that Queen Elizabeth II 
is involved in the international drug trade. 
<p>	Since 1976 millions of Americans have designated some of their tax dollars to fund 
presidential campaigns, unaware that this setup allows people like LaRouche to tap into the 
public trust fund. The money becomes available to "qualified" candidates through the FEC.  
<p>	But since the FEC is a government body, it is not allowed to make political judgments. 
And since the public funds are not guided by taxpayers' philosophical commitments to particular 
candidates, tax dollars inevitably wind up going to political extremists attracted by government 
subsidies.
<p>	For example, last November LaRouche submitted a request for matching funds to the 
tune of $261,235, outpacing legitimate presidential contenders Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
($240,524), Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., ($157,553), Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn.,  ($71,039), 
former Tennessee Governor and Education Secretary Lamar Alexander ($205,471) and 
California Governor Pete Wilson, ($71,571), who subsequently dropped out of the race.  
<p>	There's more. Take the case of Lenora Fulani, the New York City psychologist who 
inexplicably calls herself a "major-minor" candidate. Calling for free medicine, free housing, and 
free education, this perennial leftist candidate has never explained how she would pay for these 
services. But she's found a convenient way to pay for her campaigns: the taxpayer. From 1984 to 
1992, she received $3.5 million in taxpayer funds, even though her support never has reached 1 
percent. She is expected to run in 1996 as well.  Given her history, she will be certified to receive 
matching funds once again.
<p>	One would think Congress would be working to change the situation. Yet, a bipartisan 
campaign-finance measure currently making its way through the Senate (with a companion bill 
being drafted in the House) does not deal with public financing.  
<p>	Fewer and fewer Americans are checking the matching-funds box. While 28.7 percent of 
taxpayers designated $1 to campaigns in 1980, only 14.5 percent checked the box in 1993. In 
fact, participation has fallen off so dramatically that Congress increased the check-off to $3. By 
trebling the check-off in 1993, receipts rose by $43.7 million despite participation being halved. 
<p>	The public no longer supports taxpayer-subsidized political campaigns. While public 
financing supporters say it will help tomorrow's Lincoln shoot for the moon, in reality it is 
helping today's LaRouche reach for Mars.

Richard Weaver's seminal book "Ideas Have Consequences" could be our theme today, despite the fact that it was published almost 50 years ago. The remarkable growth of the Internet proves again the power of ideas to reshape how Americans communicate with each other, and the world. <p>
The Heritage Foundation's World Wide Web site was created to spread the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense, the same ideas which caused a political revolution in the 1994 elections. As Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich declared just after the election: "Heritage is, without question, the most far-reaching conservative
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally across the planet." 
<p>
As a leader in both the political and communications revolutions taking place today, The Heritage Foundation will continue to demonstrate the power of our ideas well into the 21st century.

<p>
As members of Congress consider legislative proposals that will lead us into the next century, it is important that we understand the demographic composition of the districts they represent. This book does just that. We have used 1990 Long Form Census information, and ranked the Congressional Districts in numerous key categories, including the total amount of public assistance districts get, the total amount of farm income, the number of people who have a mortgage, just to name a few. In all we have 97 different categories to look at.<p>The layout of these reports is straightforward. <p>



<pre>
              People Over 65 -- Percent
       Congressional District Average:	12.5%

		State	CD	%	Deviation

	1.	FL	22	31.1%	5.49
	2.	FL	13	30.9%	5.44
	3.	FL	19	28.1%	4.62
	4.	FL	10	26.2%	4.03
	5.	FL	05	25.7%	3.88
	6.	FL	14	25.6%	3.87
	7.	FL	16	23.9%	3.36
	8.	FL	09	21.7%	2.70
	9.	AZ	03	19.7%	2.13

</pre>





<ul><li>The ranking is simply where the Congressional District is in relation to the other 434 and the District of Columbia.<p><li>The CD identifies each district with the two letter state abbreviation, and the Congressional District number within the state. 
<p>
<li>The # or % is the actual information. For example, the % of Asians in a district.
<p>
<li>The deviation is a little more complex. This is to show how far from the average a particular district is. It answers the question of whether the district is just slightly different from the national average, or significantly different. It also allows you to see the difference between two districts more clearly as well. 
<p>
<li>For more information on the U.S. Census Bureau, visit their web page, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>

</ul><p>
We hope this book will give readers a better understanding of all the Congressional Districts and what issues members might be concerned about.

<h3>Rebirth, Return, Reunion:  Hungary's Euro-Atlantic Agenda</h3>

By <b>His Excellency Arpd Gncz</b><br>
President of the Republic of Hungary<br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<P>
It is a great pleasure and honor for me to be able to brief you, an audience of one of the most prestigious policy think tanks of the United States, on the principal foreign policy endeavors of Hungary. In your full-fledged democracy, the activity of research institutes devoid of the burden of day-to-day politics but dedicated to the thorough analysis of long-term processes and historical causality plays an important role beside the protagonists of politics. When it comes to shaping U.S. foreign policy, people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue no doubt pay heed to the work of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> as well as the opinion of its researchers. I, therefore, address you now not only as researchers and people interested in the subject, but also as persons who have influence, to a lesser or greater extent, on the United States' foreign policy towards the Central European region, including Hungary, and thus on the success of Hungary's foreign policy objectives.
<p>
<b>Rebirth</b>
<p>
For well over 40 years Hungary, similarly to other Central European states, lived torn from the bosom of her natural European environment. In the wake of the imposition of Soviet rule, the Iron Curtain that fell across the center of Europe and along Hungary's western border hermetically isolated Central and Eastern Europe from the western part of the continent. The countries under Soviet rule were forcibly subjected to the inhumane and unnatural experiment of building communism. While east of the Iron Curtain the world witnessed the continuous destruction of human, moral, and material values, the United States and Western Europe registered never-before-seen democratic and economic progress, thus bringing about the cooperation of the community of prosperous democracies.
<p>
The non-viable Soviet regime eventually collapsed under its own weight, due in no small measure to the fact that it was simply unable to keep pace with the rate of development and the arms race dictated by the United States. It is clear today that the staunch anti-communist stance of President Reagan, accused of reviving the Cold War chill, in no way slowed the agony of the communist system; on the contrary, it reduced its duration considerably. In 1989 the zombie states of Central Europe came around from 40 years of inertia and set about building, on the ruins of communism, an open and democratic society working on the principles of a market economy. The undertaking has turned out to be a lot harder than was expected, in either East or West. The countries of the Central European region have had to come to grips with a gamut of difficulties posed by the simultaneous change of the whole political and economic system. This constitutes an unparalleled historical challenge for the region and, I daresay, the whole of the Euro-Atlantic zone as well.
<p>
The complexity of the tasks surfacing with the transformation is well illustrated by the example of Hungary. Democracy and the idea of an economy based on private property and healthy competition came as no novelty to Hungary. Perchance not all of you know that the basic principles of democracy and the thought of freedom had touched Hungary way back in the mid-19th century. Although the war of independence waged against Habsburg absolutism was lost in 1849, its ideals lived on and materialized to a large extent in the wake of the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867. Lajos Kossuth, leader and symbol of the Hungarians' freedom fight, is remembered to this very day as the champion of liberty not only in Hungary, but also in the United States, where his bust stands in the Capitol. It is also worth recalling that Hungary, albeit only as part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, formed an integral part of the economy and culture of Europe at the turn of the century, and her legal system met the requirements of the age.
<p>
All the above-mentioned traditions notwithstanding, the transformation following the events of 1989 has been an extremely painful process, particularly from the point of view of the economy. Nothing characterizes better the enormity of the undertaking than the fact that transforming the structure of the economy has called for exceptional efforts even from Hungary, a country that was the first and only state in the communist bloc to introduce gradual market reforms from 1968 onwards.
<p>
The fundamental institutions of democracy -- a multi-party system, free parliamentary elections, accountable government, independent courts, and the freedom of information -- had all been created by the end of 1990. Adapting to a market economy, however, entailed negative phenomena with repercussions to date, such as galloping inflation and unemployment, the waning of whole branches of industry, and the bankruptcy of state enterprises. Although these phenomena are obviously understandable for an economist, they provoke discontent among the people. The change of structure has, nevertheless, been completed by now, and today the economy is governed by market mechanisms. The private sector now accounts for some 60 percent of production. In 1994 the economy began to register a slight growth. Over 70 percent of Hungary's foreign trade is carried on with industrially developed countries. Besides, the influx of foreign capital into Hungary in the last six years has amounted to some 9 billion U.S. dollars, more than in any other country of the region. I am pleased to see that U.S. companies lead the way in the field of investment in Hungary with an approximately 40 percent share. Such favorable changes, together with strict financial stabilization measures, are creating the bases of long-term development.
<p>
In addition to the radical transformation of home affairs and the economy, Hungarian foreign policy has also undergone change. Hungary has turned towards the West again and is determined to return to the community of Western democracies. With the experience of the past well heeded, this time the overtures towards the West do not imply burning the bridges towards the East. Hungary has a vested interest in maintaining good relations with all the countries of the region. This intention, as well as our effort directed at our Euro-Atlantic integration, enjoys the backing of all the parliamentary parties and public opinion.
<p>

<b>Return</b>
<p>
Hungary thus has irreversibly launched a program to try to catch up with the developed world politically and economically, and hopes to be able to join as soon as possible the Euro-Atlantic integrational organizations, primarily NATO and the European Union. Our integration would not be complete without our membership in the OECD and the defense organization of the European Union, the Western European Union.
<p>
Our Euro-Atlantic integration is a means to an end and a symbol at the same time. It is a means to an end because, we firmly believe, securing lasting stability and prosperity hinges on Hungary becoming a member of NATO and the European Union. Twentieth century history has proved without the shadow of a doubt that the Central European region must not be abandoned or left to wither into a grey zone. Both world wars broke out partly as a direct consequence of expansionist powers regarding Central Europe as spoils of war. We are justified in stating that Hungary and her neighbors, with the exception of some tragic states of the former Yugoslavia, have to face no external threat at the moment; therefore, her Western integration is not a matter of life and death right now. Yet it is precisely the bitter experience of the past that urges both Hungary and her neighbors to preempt even the shaping of potential crises and drop anchor firmly in the community of Western democracies. Integration is a symbol too, as it indicates as clear as daylight that Hungary, a country that holds values and pursues objectives identical with those of the Western democracies, has the right to seek her due place in the Euro-Atlantic community.
<p>
It is in the sphere of the economy that the European Union could best promote the stability of the region and Hungary. On the one hand, it is a well-known fact that economic growth and the resulting prosperity considerably reduce animosity between different countries. On the other hand, the common market system of the Union is what could make Hungary's market, small just by itself, and production capacity really viable. The integration accomplished within the European Union is at the same time the symbol of reconciliation and cooperation in Europe. Although not primarily a defense organization, the Union provides, nonetheless, some form of guarantee against both outside aggression and conflicts between member states. Integration results in a kind of mutual dependence that excludes the possibility of inner hostility while shaping a bloc that, by its mere size, may serve as a deterrent. In the wake of the change of regime, Hungary did not delay in widening and institutionalizing her ties with the European Union, and is by now linked to the organization through an association agreement. Parallel to this, domestic processes have been launched in the fields of economic policy and law harmonization, which are prerequisites of admission to the Union. Hungary made an official announcement of her intention to join in the spring of 1994 and hopes to become a full-fledged member of the Union by the end of the millennium. Allow me to focus from this point forward on NATO above all else, since it is in this organization that your country plays the leading role.
<p>
In the course of the Cold War, NATO proved that it could deter any potential outside aggression and that its members could rely on the organization's "hard" security guarantees. The engine of the alliance's success was the United States, whose brave leaders of vision realized that the security of America and the security of Europe are inseparable, and that it is worth making sacrifices in the interest of common security. Beside the actual military defense and the U.S. nuclear shield, we must not fail to remark the alliance's good influence on relations between the members, in particular on relations between France and Germany.
<p>
Although the Cold War has ended and the Soviet Union has fallen apart, history has not come to an end, as Francis Fukuyama predicted a few years ago. On the contrary, the war in the Balkans and the conflicts raging in the former Soviet republics have shown that new and less predictable dangers encroach on the peace of the Euro-Atlantic region. The circumstances may have changed, and the tasks ahead may be different, yet NATO and an active United States presence in Europe are still needed as much as ever. Hungary, having taken the initiative to dissolve the Warsaw Pact, came to the early recognition that in order to ensure her long-term security she would have to become a member of the Union and join NATO. One cannot emphasize enough that Hungary's hope of becoming a member of the alliance is in no way directed against others. In other words, Hungary would not wish to use her eventual membership to the detriment of her neighbors in the region. On the contrary, it is in our interest that other Central European countries also be able to meet the requirements set for joining and be admitted to the organization, since security can be envisaged only in a wider context. Just to give you an example, the security of Romania and Slovakia, for instance, has a strong bearing on the development and security of Hungary, and vice versa.
<p>
Speaking of Hungary's intention to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, and the future of the Central European region, the question arises:  What interest does NATO, and particularly the United States, have in expanding the organization and, thus, covering the subsequent defense expenditure?  Among the numerous reasons, allow me to mention the most significant ones.
<p>
Guaranteeing human and minority rights and ensuring conditions for a free-market economy and democracy rank among the foreign policy priorities of the United States. In order for these values to prevail without any risks in Central Europe, not only today but in the future, the stability of the region must be increased, for which the expansion of NATO presents itself as the most convenient means. In the course of the Cold War, the world would have been swept to the verge of a catastrophe in the form of another world war had the United States endeavored to insist on the prevalence, even beyond the Iron Curtain, of the values she held dear. Today American values could spread and American interests could be guaranteed without a single gunshot and without any risk of a world war.
<p>
The United States has a vested trade interest in the stability and smooth economic development of the region, seeing that this region is becoming an increasingly significant market for U.S. products and investment. Expanding NATO may constitute a lasting means of securing this market. By the same token, the mere fact of NATO membership may exert a stimulating influence on investors, ever fearful of political risks.
<P>
We are positive that Hungary's NATO membership would benefit the security structure of the organization and, indirectly, the whole region and even the whole continent, in the geopolitical sense, as:
<p><ul>
<li>It would contribute to increasing stability in the Central European region;
<p>
It would ensure NATO an access route to the Balkans, which, despite the peace process currently under way, can be expected to continue as a region of instability in the future; and
<p>
<li>The Hungarian Army would contribute, albeit only to a modest degree, to the many-sided development of the alliance's military strength and even more favorable positions.
<p>
<li>NATO membership is a foreign policy goal based on substantial social consensus in virtually all the countries of the region. The expansion of NATO would, therefore, have a favorable effect on the faith our societies have in Western values, would increase their sense of security, and would prevent the eventual upsurge of frustration, which could well emerge should the extension be prolonged for too long.
</ul><p>


<b>Reunion</b>
<p>
Now that we have reviewed what motivates Hungary to approach NATO and what interest NATO has in extension, it is worth summing up briefly what we have actually done with a view to joining.
<p>
The fact that the Atlantic alliance has recognized the need for eastward extension and has launched the preparatory process for the admission of new members is an encouraging sign for us. We particularly welcome the initiatives in this issue of U.S. politicians, both in the Administration and in Congress. We regard the Partnership for Peace initiative, outlined in the fall of 1993 and launched in 1994, as an integral part of the road leading to membership. Not forgetting her size and possibilities, Hungary for her part endeavors to make the most of the opportunities offered by Partnership for Peace by taking part in the different operations and training programs. I was thrilled to hear that the Hungarian units taking part in Operation Cooperative Nugget, held in Louisiana this summer, stood their ground excellently. The mere fact of a joint operation tells a tale in itself. Just think it over. No more than six years ago, we would have laughed at the idea of the units of a small member state of the Warsaw Pact joining American and other allied troops for a military operation somewhere along the Mississippi.
<p>
Beyond Partnership for Peace, other forms of excellent cooperation now characterize relations between Hungary and NATO and NATO member states. For Hungary it was a great honor that the North Atlantic Assembly, NATO's parliamentary organ, held its May 1995 conference in Budapest, since it was the very first time it had held its session in a non-member state. The fact that NATO intelligence aircraft, the famous AWACS, carry on their activity in Hungarian air space in connection with the crisis in the Balkans provides promising bases for our future institutional cooperation. The joint U.S.-Hungarian military rescue operation held recently in Hungary was also a success. Military and technical compatibility, cited as a precondition for admission, is considerably improved by the Hungarian Army's increasing number of defense arms purchases from American companies.
<p>
We are fully aware that in today's world, security transcends the military aspect and embraces political, economic, social, and even cultural areas. Hungary does her utmost in order to ensure that her own peace and that of the region rest on stable foundations. Joining NATO as soon as possible serves our interest, but only as part of a complex process that aims, in the final analysis, at increasing the stability of the whole Euro-Atlantic region.
<p>
Keeping this objective in mind, Hungary pays particular attention to the most all-around possible strengthening of relations with her neighbors. Hungary looks upon the Hungarian minorities living in the neighboring countries as the cement of bilateral relations and not as a source of conflict. I must emphasize at this point that relations between Hungary and neighboring Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine are virtually problem-free. This spring we were able to sign a basic treaty with Slovakia with a view to accomplishing comprehensive progress in our relations and regulating the situation of the minorities. The agreement has already been ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, and we hope the Slovakian legislature will soon follow suit. We have conducted negotiations with Romania for nearly a year in order to draft a similar document, but unfortunately no breakthrough has yet come during the talks. I wish to stress that signing a basic treaty, while important, is not the sole element of relations between Hungary and Romania. We strive to deepen bilateral relations in all areas regardless of whether there is or is not a basic treaty. What gives us hope for the future is that economic, trade, and military ties are developing well between Hungary and Romania. All the aforesaid goes to show that Hungary has no problem with any of her neighbors that could even remotely hold the threat of a "second Bosnia," as is occasionally alleged by some who oppose the extension of NATO.
<p>
In connection with a more comprehensive interpretation of security, I wish to mention the pivotal role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE, among whose members the United States plays an active part, is the only Euro-Atlantic institution with wide-ranging security competence. Hungary, in her role as Chairman- in-Office, has recognized the OSCE's unique opportunities in the field of confidence building, crisis prevention, and management, and strives to make the most of them.
<p>
In 1995, under Hungary's chairmanship, the organization opened a mission in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, and appointed three ombudsmen responsible for human rights, thus considerably enhancing the activity of the Sarajevo mission. Another mission, soon to be inaugurated in Croatia, is also to serve the comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. These missions everywhere spare no effort to reach a peaceful settlement in the conflicts. In Chechnya this led to the signing of an agreement between the warring parties on July 30. If the guns in the Balkans are silenced for good, the OSCE is ready to undertake an increasingly active role in consolidating peace and the process of rehabilitation following the conflict. In the same manner, the OSCE provides an institutional framework for Russia to discuss Euro-Atlantic security issues. This function of the organization is expected to gain more impetus as NATO expansion materializes.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hungary did not delay in setting off on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration, and she is now doing her utmost, both in the area of preparing the country and in her foreign policy, to become a full-fledged member of NATO and the EU as soon as possible. The fact that Western democracies and integrational organizations have recognized the importance of the chance to open towards the East and are willing to cooperate with the fledgling democracies of Central Europe is a source of encouragement for us. And yet, opinions are voiced over and over again criticizing the too speedy reintegration of Hungary and her neighbors in the region and questioning the justification for NATO extension. Such opinions are fearful of accepting new responsibilities and the consolidation, not to mention the possible defense, of the Central European democracies. Any delay or uncertainty may eventually exact a high price, since there is no excluding the possibility of the situation in these fledging democracies growing critically worse due either to their own internal problems or to any unfavorable developments in the region east of them.
<p>
Our common task and responsibility is, therefore, possibly even greater than it was in 1989, when the picture was rather more simple. All the hard work of recent times may have been in vain unless Hungary and her neighbors in the region are able to drop anchor as soon as possible, and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven. In conclusion, permit me to quote the great statesman, President John F. Kennedy:  "The United States will pay any price, bear any burden in defense of freedom around the world.... "<sup>1</sup> If President Kennedy's message still holds good, bearing a not-too-big burden today, for the same purpose and right on the finishing line, cannot constitute a matter for discussion. The burden must be borne.

<h3>Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy: What Literature Teaches About the Collapse and Recovery of Home and Family</h3>
<p>
By <b>David Patterson</b><br>
Associate Professor of European Literature, Oklahoma State University
<p>
The second <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, October 19, 1995.
<P>
In a Heritage Foundation lecture titled "The Fraud of Multiculturalism," <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirkmem.html">Russell Kirk</a> noted that "cultural restoration, like charity, begins at home."  And he was quite right. For cultural restoration entails the restoration of what is most high, most dear, most enduring. And the ground for all such things is the home. The home is the place where our names are first uttered with love and therefore where we first discover that we mean something. It is the site where both human beings and human values first make their appearance in the world. It is the center from which we define and understand the nature of everything we encounter in the world. The home, then, is not one thing among many in a world of things; nor is it merely the product of a culture. Rather, the world of things derives its sense, and a culture its significance, from their relationship to the home. Without the home, everything else in the world or in a culture is meaningless.
<P>
Just as the home is not one thing among many, the human relationship from which it arises is not one among many. I am speaking, of course, of marriage, or, more properly, of holy matrimony. The sanctity of the home is rooted in the sanctity of marriage. And the holiness of human life is rooted in the holiness of this union through which life is born into the world. Indeed, from ancient times marriage has been a metaphor for the expression of the relation between the human and the holy. In the Christian tradition, for example, the Church is called "the Bride of Christ."  And according to the Jewish tradition, the two tablets given to Moses at Sinai signify a bride and groom, indicating that Israel is betrothed to God as a wife is betrothed to her husband. Marriage alone makes it possible to overcome a fundamental condition of exile and thus dwell in the world. Why?  Because in the union of holy matrimony the seed of the home is planted. That seed comes to life when a wife becomes a mother and a husband becomes a father; it comes into being upon the birth of a child, when the family comes into being. The home, then, might be better understood not as a place or a thing, but as an event in the life of the holy.
<p>
Viewed as such an event, the emergence of the family that constitutes the home is far more than just a biological phenomenon or even a natural wonder. A mother, for example, is not just one who gives birth, but one who emanates light, love, and compassion. Through her humanity receives a revelation of the light created upon the first utterance of Creation, the light that sanctifies all Creation. Indeed, only through the wife and mother of a household does blessing fall upon a home; for as the bearer of life she is most intimately aligned with the miracle and mystery of life. Indeed, she and the Creator of life at times share the same name. In Hebrew, for instance, the Creator is sometimes referred to as <i>Ha-Rachamim</i>, or "the Compassionate One," a term that has the same root as the word <i>rechem</i>, which means "womb." 
<p>
Similarly, the father of a family is more than the sire of some offspring. If he is a father, then he is also a teacher who by his example imparts to his children and his community something about truth, tradition, and moral responsibility -- about what there is to stand for and what we must refuse to stand for. A man, therefore, does not fully grow to manhood until he becomes a father; that is, until he becomes such a teacher and sets such an example, whether he actually sires children or not. That a father bears such a significance is demonstrated by the condition of families and communities that have been abandoned by their fathers.
<p>
Finally, the child born of the holy union of husband and wife signifies the dearness of all life and is a manifestation of holiness itself. If the world endures thanks to a direction we pursue, then it endures thanks to the child. For the child sets before us a direction and therefore a future, in which our most sublime aspirations, our most moving inspirations, and our most urgent questions might be decided. Those who have gazed into the eyes of an infant only seconds old and who have then looked up to behold the world transformed know what it means to realize, if only for a moment, what is infinitely precious. Infinity, you see, comes in small packages.
<p>
This gazing down upon the child is a looking up toward a height that elevates humanity from the realm of biology to the realm of spirituality. Here a survival of the strongest and the fittest is overtaken by a dwelling in the dearest and the highest. Without the home humanity loses this dimension of height that ordains and sanctifies all of being. Without the family we are left to a flat land that is a waste land and wander in an exile steeped in emptiness and indifference. Because the home and family have such a significance for human life, human meaning, and human values, a concern for the collapse and recovery of the home forms a significant part of much of the world's literature. For literature is not just a mirror held up to life. More than that, it is an interaction with life in the light of the truth that sustains life; it is part of the human seeking that takes us forever homeward. 
<p>
In order to illustrate this point, I have selected three literary masterpieces that address these issues in various ways. While they come from very different times and cultures, they represent a human condition that is as common to all humanity as motherhood, fatherhood, and childhood. They are the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer, William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, and Leo Tolstoy's novel <i>Anna Karenina</i>. Let us consider, then, the various perspectives on home and family that these texts offer us. In doing so, we may see why these works, like home and family, are among the permanent things.

<p>
<b>An Exile's Movement Homeward: The <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer</b>
<p>
Most of us know the <i>Odyssey</i> as a tale of adventure, in which the hero undergoes various trials on his return to home and family from the Trojan War, a war fought over the break-up of a home. The adventures of Odysseus have a mythical quality that may at first keep his ordeals at a safe distance from us. But if we take a closer look at this tale, we discover its deeper, universal aspect precisely in its mythical features. For in myth, as Joseph Campbell has shown, a shallow mind may perceive only the local scenery, but a deeper mind encounters "all the stages of the Way from the ethnic to the elementary idea, from the local to the universal being, which is Everyman, as he both knows and is afraid to know."  In the case of Odysseus the stages of the Way lead not only from the local to the universal being, but also from exile to home, which is the dwelling place of Everyman, as he learns what there is to fear and what there is fear for.
<p>
Every tribulation that Odysseus must endure, then, entails overcoming a threat to the integrity and the sanctity of home and family. Here we shall consider a few familiar examples to make this point. Recall, for instance, what transpires in the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There, says Odysseus, anyone who ate of the lotus would "forget the way home."  What immediately comes to mind in this connection is the threat that drugs pose for every family in every home. But why, exactly, do drugs pose such a threat? 
<p>
First there are the obvious reasons:  Drugs lead to health problems, the squandering of resources, and a plummeting into irresponsibility. But Homer notes a deeper, more insidious threat to the home that underlies the obvious ones:  It is the loss of memory. In the <i>Republic</i> Plato teaches us that "we must not list the forgetful soul among the lovers of wisdom, but we require a good memory."  A good memory is the memory of the Good, which is the mark of wisdom itself. If the Good first manifests itself in the home, then wisdom entails an understanding of the significance of the home. And since the home is the place where our names are first uttered, the memory of home includes a memory of who and what we are, which is the memory of the responsibility to and for the Good that only we can meet. To be sure, to bear a family name is to bear this memory. Therefore, according to a Jewish legend, when we die and the Angel of Death comes to take us to the Holy One, we must answer a question before we can find our way to God:  What is your name?  For to know the answer to this question is to know the Good that opens up the path to the holy, which is the path that takes us homeward.
<p>
What must be remembered, moreover, as Homer indicates, is not just the home but the way home. The home is not something permanently given but something permanently sought, so that memory here is memory of a direction. And that makes it the memory of meaning. For to have meaning is to have a direction, and to have a direction is to be in motion toward a good that is yet to be fulfilled. Memory, then, orients us not only toward a good established in the past, but also toward a good to be sought in the future. And this good, in the words of Martin Buber, "is the movement in the direction of home," which is sustained by memory. Therefore, drugs threaten that movement homeward because drugs bring on oblivion, and in our world we have made oblivion into a multibillion-dollar business, not only in the drugs we peddle, but in the diversions we promote. Indeed, so dear to us is our deadly sleep that we ignore, ridicule, or even kill people who try to shake us from it.
<p>
In Homer's tale, as in our own time, then, we find that violence follows in the wake of oblivion. For after the Land of the Lotus Eaters Odysseus comes to the Land of the Cyclopians, where, says Homer, there are "no laws" and "no one cares for his neighbor."  There the Cyclops Polyphemos declares to Odysseus,
<p>
<bq>"Stranger, you are a simple fool, or come from far off, when you tell me to avoid the wrath of the gods or fear them. We do not concern ourselves over Zeus of the aegis, nor any of the rest of the blessed gods, since we are far better than they."</bq>
<P>
With these words -- and with the consistency of a logician -- Polyphemos proceeds to devour the companions of Odysseus.
<p>
The one-eyed monster here has a vision of only one thing:  a power that justifies anything -- that is what makes him monstrous. Where power is the only reality, there is no law other than the law dictated by the one in power. The monster does not act for his neighbor but manipulates his neighbor, even to the point of consuming him. And he has no regard for God because he sets himself up in the place of God, thereby regarding himself as better than God and in need of no one. Hence, he has no home that he might open to others but seals himself up in a tomb-like cave, like an animal holed up in his lair, without wife or children.
<p>
Violence toward others does violence to the home because violence is an assault on the Holy One who sanctifies the home in the sanctification of the family through holy matrimony. And because humanity comes into being with the appearance of the family, violence aimed at God is perpetrated upon humanity. "He who kills, kills God," Elie Wiesel has repeatedly said; the Eternal is eternally the victim. By contrast, those who would nurture life rather than take life enter into marriage and form a family by bringing life into the world. This nurturing of life entails not only bearing children, but also affirming the sanctity of the other human being, beginning with our husband or wife. Matrimony derives its holiness from this saying of you to another person in such a way that we attest to the holiness of the other that derives from the Holy One Himself. This relation that lies at the heart of the family makes all other relations meaningful. For this is the relation that opens up a higher truth that is opposed to power. As we see in the case of the Cyclops, without this truth that is revealed in the home there is no law or care for our neighbor. And so it is no coincidence that those who do violence to others generally come from broken homes. When homes break up bodies get broken.
<P>
The oblivion that leads to violence against others also takes the insidious form of a subtle violence done to oneself, as well as to others, in the mode of sensuality. Here, as in the case of violence, getting physical means being reduced to a purely physical, animalistic nature, as Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> suggests. After escaping from the Cyclops, Odysseus makes his way to the island where the sorceress Circe lives. There his men are tempted by the voluptuous beauty of the sorceress, who gives them fine foods poisoned with a drug "to make them wholly forget their native land," as Homer says. And she then turns them into pigs. But they had already forgotten their native land as soon as they acted on the sensual, and they had already lost their human image as soon as they succumbed to their animalistic nature. When animal instinct overtakes moral responsibility, the human form becomes the form of a pig, and the home is reduced to a sty.
<p>
In contrast to this succumbing to temptation we have the refusal to succumb on the part of Odysseus when he was marooned on the island of Calypso. There he tells the goddess,
"I know that...Penelope can never match the impression you make for beauty and stature. She is mortal after all, and you are immortal and ageless. But even so, what I want and all my days I pine for is to go back to my house and see my day of homecoming."
<p>
Like Circe, Calypso possesses all that sensual beauty can offer. But the home is constituted by the spiritual, and not by the sensual. And the difference lies in the caress. In the groping and grabbing of sensuality, we manipulate and appropriate the other for ourselves, for our own pleasure. The caress, however, is an opening and offering of the self to another, whether it is between husband and wife or parent and child. It is an instance of a contact not between skin and skin but between soul and soul -- that is what makes it spiritual rather than sensual. The caress, therefore, seeks what cannot be touched. It seeks what lies at the heart of the home, and it reveals what lives in the heart of the family. For without the loving caress, neither home nor family can come into being.
<p>
Thus the <i>Odyssey</i> culminates in a husband's caress of his wife, and it ends with his embrace of his father. His return to his family includes a return both to the one with whom he brings life into the world and to one who lies at the origin of his life. Returned to both, Odysseus returns to a responsibility for life, which means:  He returns to the family.
<P>
The threat to the family, however, comes not only from without, as in the tale of Odysseus, but also from within. This brings us to the next work we shall consider.
<P>

<b>The Undermining of a Family: Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i></b>
<p>
<i>King Lear</i> is a drama about the premature collapse and failed recovery of a monarch's household. While Homer's epic generally unfolds in the external geography of adventure, Shakespeare's play focuses more on the internal struggle of a soul trying to regain a native ground that has crumbled out from under him. But what exactly threatens the home and family of the King and, indeed, brings them to ruin?
<p>
The home and family in this drama come to ruin as the result of a fundamental confusion about nature and natural law, where natural law may be understood much as Thomas Aquinas understands it. Natural law, he explains in the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, is "the participation in eternal law by rational creatures," and eternal law is defined as "the rational governance of everything on the part of God."  The idea here is that God operates by design and that, since they bear the image of divine being, human beings have a responsibility to become part of that design. The rational governance of Providence implies an ordering of the world with the aim of pursuing the Good, that is, with the aim of attesting to what is most precious in life. Natural law, therefore, establishes a bond between the human being and divine being; it summons humanity to take up a path that would nurture and sanctify life, as God sanctifies life when He pronounces it to be "very good."  Inasmuch as the relation between the holy and the human finds its first expression in the home and family, the life that unfolds in this realm bears witness to a natural law expressive of a sacred aim in life.
<p>
King Lear's confusion, then, is a fundamental confusion about the life that unfolds in the home, and it is revealed in his relation to the surviving members of his family, his daughters Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia. In the play's opening scene Lear does not offer his daughters a loving embrace expressive of a higher relation, according to the family bond determined by natural law. Instead, he arranges a business transaction, whereby he tries to purchase their words of affection by offering them portions of his wealth. Two of his daughters, Regan and Goneril, are eager to exploit this confusion that undermines the family:  They exchange the testimony to life as determined by natural law for lifeless property. And so the seeds of death are sown.
<p>
The bond of love that is established by natural law to sustain the family, on the other hand, is precisely what Cordelia invokes when she declares to her father,
<p>
"I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond, no more nor less." (I.i)
<p>
It is not that Cordelia knows her place, but rather that she knows what is placed on high. Inclined toward a higher responsibility, she obeys the commandment of natural law, and not the whim of the King. But Lear insists upon the false authority of his own whims:  Rejecting Cordelia's simple affirmation of her bond, he refuses what natural law commands. Refusing the commandment of natural law, he loses his relation to the eternal law that sustains the home and sanctifies the family. And so he is left homeless, turned over to the merciless power of the elements as exemplified by the storms in the fields. There he has no dwelling place, for there he is exiled from the truth of natural law.
<p>
Usurping the authority of natural law, Lear loses his identity both as the king of a realm and as the father of a family. Here we realize that the task with which natural law confronts us is not simply to follow some rule, but to be who we are. And who we are is defined by the eternal truth that sanctifies the family. Thus, as soon as Lear violates his family by casting out Cordelia, his daughter Regan notes that "he hath ever but slenderly known himself" (I.i). For he knows himself only by the power of manipulation, and not by the truth of family relation. Once he becomes powerless in the face of his daughters' deception, Lear himself cries out, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?"  (I.iv). He does not know himself because he does not know himself as a father, and he is a father before he is a king. To know himself as a father would be to know the natural law that binds him to his daughters in truth, and not through power.
<p>
Therefore, as we recall, Cordelia alone speaks the truth, for she alone knows the bond of nature that ties her to her father and, through her father, to a higher truth. Hence, it is she, says Shakespeare,
<p>
"Who redeems nature from the general curse<br>
Which twain have brought her to." (IV. vi)
<p>
Cordelia works this redemption by restoring to Lear the relation between father and child -- and with it the higher relation -- that her sisters have undone. But this undoing was also Lear's doing. Like most of those who exchange the truth of natural law for the power of human arrogance, he reaps what he has sown. The man who had understood himself only in terms of the power he could wield is overpowered and eventually crushed by the two daughters who would wrench power away from him. 
<p>
The corruption of nature and the destruction of the family exemplified by Regan and Goneril manifests itself not only in their treatment of their father, but also in the violence that they bring down upon Gloucester by blinding him. The central figure in the play's subplot, he is a father who is betrayed by his child Edmond and who mistakenly suspects his son Edgar of betrayal. Like Regan and Goneril, it is the bastard son Edmond who is the "unnatural villain" (I.ii), as Gloucester states it, and whose villainy includes the betrayal not only of his father, but also of Cornwall and Albany, the husbands of Regan and Goneril, respectively. For part of his power play involves making promises to take up with each of these wives who are Lear's daughters. And, having betrayed their father, they are all too willing to betray their husbands and chase after Edmond.
<P>
Thus, the violation of the relation between parent and child entails the violation of the relation between husband and wife:  The family is assaulted at every turn by those who would be a law unto themselves in a usurpation of natural law. And so when Albany suspects his wife's treachery, he says to her, 
<p>
"O Goneril,<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature which contemns its origin<br>
Cannot be bordered certain in itself."  (IV. ii)
<p>
That nature which contemns its origin -- the child who dishonors her father -- is a perverted nature that despises the family. Despising this origin of humanity, such a nature has nothing to limit its contempt for humanity. Goneril, then, divorces herself from all the limitations of natural law, which, as we have seen, is our link to the eternal law that sanctifies the family and all of humanity. Thus divorced from the family, Goneril is cut off from the origin of all that is holy in human life and ends by murdering her two sisters. And the murder of Cordelia, of course, results in the death of her father Lear.
<p>
Set in a time that came long before Shakespeare's time, this play continues to speak to us in our own time. As a commentary on our own humanity, it sheds light on the ways in which we, too, stand by and tolerate the assault on the family. It tells us, for example, something about the sickness of a society that hides away its parents to die in "homes" that are the antithesis of a home and that leaves the care of its children to people who are not their parents. It reveals to us a connection between murder and adultery, between the hand that steals, the mouth that lies, and the eye that covets. For all of these things belong to a nature that contemns its origin and therefore has nothing but contempt for the family. All of them result from the undermining of the natural law that lies at the center of the home and that links the life of the family to the life of the eternal. 
<p>
In these last five transgressions I have mentioned you will recognize the second five of the Ten Commandments. Here we may recall an ancient Jewish teaching, according to which the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets in order to designate two realms of relation. The first five commandments pertain to the relation of <i>adam la Makom</i>, or the human relation to the divine, and the second five pertain to the relation of <i>adam l'adam</i>, or the human relation to other human beings. What is of interest to the concern at hand is this:  The commandment to honor mother and father belongs to the first category. Which means:  The integrity of the family belongs to the integrity of the divine. Holding to the sanctity of the family, therefore, is prior to the sanctification of all other realms of human relation. Once Lear's daughters violate the family and destroy the home, there is no crime that they cannot commit. And justify.
<p>
Thus, the truth that comes to us through <i>King Lear</i> arises in an antiquity that long precedes it and lives in a modernity that far exceeds it. Truly among the permanent things, this truth finds another expression in a literary masterpiece that appears nearly three centuries after Shakespeare's play. Which brings us to the third work to be considered.

<p>
<b>Families Lost and Found: Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i></b>
<p>
Tolstoy's masterful novel <i>Anna Karenina</i> has found its way into the popular culture through various film versions, including one starring Christopher Reeve that was made for television. Generally speaking, the popular view of the novel that has resulted from these films is that it is the tale of an exciting but tragic love affair between a frustrated housewife and a dashing young aristocrat. Like many popular conceptions, however, this is a misconception. Tolstoy's aim in his portrayal of the adulterous love affair is to expose the moral corruption that leads to the dissolution of the family. And he makes this point by contrasting Anna's love affair with Levin's marriage.
<p>
A key to the contrast that Tolstoy sets up is the figure of the child; indeed, as we have noted, it is with the appearance of a child that a family comes into being. Should anyone suppose that Anna's affair with Vronsky is exciting and wonderful, we have only to recall Tolstoy's account of how this indulgence devastates her son Seryozha. He is described as "the compass which showed [his mother and her lover] the degree of their divergence from what they knew was right, but did not want to see."  It is not as a judge, however, that Seryozha reveals to them their divergence from what is right. Rather, it is as a victim. Because he is a child, he represents a precious but fragile possibility for life; because he is a child, he embodies the meaning and direction that open up a future in which some redemption from a life void of meaning may be sought. Hence, the child is the core of home and family. And the child is just the one who is betrayed in Anna's illicit love affair.
<p>
"I love two beings only," says Anna of Seryozha and her lover Vronsky, "but the one excludes the other."  And we know which one she chooses. After she has left her family, one of Seryozha's "favorite occupations," says Tolstoy, "was keeping a lookout for his mother during his walks."  But she is almost never to be seen. Once she has a child by Vronsky, in fact, we are told that "the separation from her son...did not trouble her," since she had grown so attached to the daughter she had by Vronsky "that she rarely thought of her son."  And yet the declaration of her love for "two beings only" was made long after the birth of her daughter. This attachment too, therefore, is soon eclipsed by her preoccupation with Vronsky's love for her and with a personal happiness that is forever longed for but never realized. 
<p>
Why is it never realized?  Because in truth Anna loves no being other than the counterfeit being she has fashioned by making herself her own heroine in a romance whose outcome is determined from the start. Living with her lover in a house that is not a home and in an arrangement that is inimical to marriage, she exchanges a family life for the illusion of a love life. To her, happiness is my happiness, and not the happiness of her family. Thus, becoming a sign only of herself, and not of the significance of the other human being, Anna is drained of all significance. Like Narcissus at the pool, she gazes into the mirror of her self-styled fairy tale until, as Tolstoy says, she no longer recognizes herself. For she has lost the image of wife and mother that would be the basis of such recognition. The only action that remains for her to establish some significance in life is to take her own life. This she does without a thought for the children who would be orphaned by her action.
<p>
What is missing from Anna's love for Vronsky is precisely the love that forms the basis of the family, which is a love for the other person expressive of a higher relation. It is the love for the holy, as it is evinced by the love between husband and wife, the love that puts the holy into holy matrimony. Only when marriage rests on such a foundation can a family come into being. In <i>Anna Karenina</i> Tolstoy illustrates this point through the tale of Levin, which is the tale of a movement into life that runs counter to the story of the title character.
<p>
Modeled after the author himself, Levin is a man who is engaged in a constant struggle for meaning in life. And it is through the pursuit of family life that meaning in life finally opens up to him. In contrast to Anna, who sets up a household with a man to whom she is not married, Levin enters into marriage with Kitty under the auspices of the Church. Despite his religious skepticism at the time, he embraces the prayers said at his wedding. When, for example, he hears the words "Give unto them perfect love, peace and help, O Lord," he is struck by them, thinking, "How did they know that it is help, yes, help, that one needs?"  And when he hears the priest say, "Who unitest them that were separated and who hast ordained for them an insoluble union in love," he realizes, "How profound those words are and how they fit with what one feels at this moment!"  Thus, he sees that the words addressed to One who is above consecrate the marriage between two here below.
<p>
Levin continues to engage in a struggle for life's meaning in the face of death even after he is married. But, "thanks to his wife's presence," says Tolstoy, this struggle "did not drive him to despair:  in spite of death he felt the need for living and loving."  For his wife's presence signifies the presence of the sacred in his life, as it was invoked on the occasion of his marriage. Unlike Anna, who sought to be loved by Vronsky outside of marriage, Levin seeks to offer his love to the wife he has taken in holy matrimony, and that is what sustains him in life. Knowing his wife, he comes to know something of life's origin; moving toward life's origin, he moves toward a meaning in life that is stronger than death.
<p>
Through this love that links him to the origin of life, he joins with his wife to bear life into the world. Here too, of course, the figure of the child is crucial to the condition of the home and family. Contrary to Anna's disregard for her children, Levin sees in the birth of his child a revelation of something beyond the human. And so we read, "The birth of a son, which they promised him, but which he still could not believe in -- so extraordinary did it seem -- appeared to him on the one hand such an immense and therefore impossible happiness, and on the other hand such a mysterious event that the assumed knowledge of what was going to happen and, as a result of it, preparations as for something ordinary, something human beings themselves were responsible for, seemed scandalous and degrading to him."  Thus, upon the birth of his child -- if only for a moment -- his skepticism gives way to a deeper vision, to a higher vision, and a prayer comes to his lips in spite of himself, as though the prayer had a life of its own. All his doubts, says Tolstoy, "fell away, like dust, from his soul. To whom else was he to appeal, if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love to be?"  The vessel of this revelation?  A newborn babe.
<p>
This vision of a mystery that transcends the handiwork of humanity is precisely a vision of the family. The vision unfolds as the family emerges in a place where there had been two but there are now three. And it is the vision of the family that makes it possible for Levin to receive the meaning in life that he has sought all along, a meaning that is as essential to the soul as bread is to the body. Near the end of the novel he meets a peasant who offers him the key to what he had struggled for, expressed in deceptively simple terms:  Live for God, and not for yourself. At first these words seem so simple to Levin as to be meaningless. But then he thinks to himself, "Well?  Did I not understand those meaningless words?"  And he answers himself, "No, I understood them just as he understands them:  I understood them perfectly and better than I understand anything in life, and I have never in my life doubted it or could doubt it." 
<p>
And yet he does not fully grasp the truth of the peasant's words until he sees his wife and son nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Seeing their lives threatened, he sees what his own life is for. What does it mean to live for God and not for yourself?  It means living for your family and thereby creating a home through which the holy may enter life and instill it with meaning. As God breathed life into the first human being, the family breathes life into all humanity. Only where such a breath is drawn can dwelling happen. And only where dwelling happens do we approach a realm called home.
<p>

<b>Concluding Thoughts</b>
<p>
While the literary masterpieces we have considered are varied in their approach to home and family, they do have a few things in common. In all three cases, for example, the assault on home and family entails a violation of holy matrimony. Recall, for example, the suitors who invade the home of Odysseus, Edmond's designs on Regan and Goneril, and Anna Karenina's love affair. And we find that when the holiness of marriage is threatened, the holiness of human life is compromised:  The suitors plot to kill Telemachus, Goneril plans the murder of Cordelia, and Anna ends by killing herself.
<p>
In all three cases, moreover, the issue of a wife's fidelity is directly tied to the presence of the mother. Because Penelope remains faithful to Odysseus, she remains a mother to Telemachus; therefore, it is thanks to her that Odysseus has a home and family to return to. Anna Karenina cannot take up with Vronsky without abandoning her child Seryozha; in contrast to her betrayal we have Kitty's faithfulness to Levin, which ultimately makes it possible for Levin to realize what is most dear in life. And in Shakespeare's play the mother is absent altogether because the devotion of a wife to a husband is altogether absent; there the absence of the mother is symbolically manifested in Lear's alienation from the earth itself when he is turned over to the chaos of the stark elements.
<p>
Similarly, all three works address the role of the father as a teacher and a witness. Odysseus is able to restore the integrity of his home, which includes a return to his own father, because he has attested to the higher relation that home and family signify. When, as in the case of Lear, that testimony is absent, the home and family collapse; Lear's tragedy is that by the time he realizes who he is as a father, the consequences of his absence as a father are already in place. And in Tolstoy's novel we find that only when Levin becomes a father does there open up for him an avenue to the Most High enabling him to recognize his responsibility for what is most sacred here below.
<p>
All three of these masterpieces also bear witness to the importance of the child to the sanctity of home and family and to the meaning of life itself. Before he relates the trials of Odysseus, for example, Homer establishes the position of Telemachus as the son of Odysseus and as the heir to his wisdom. If Penelope makes it possible for Odysseus to return to a home established in the past, Telemachus receives a legacy that posits a future necessary to the family. In the case of Lear, the presence or absence of the child parallels the presence or absence of his own identity. Lear is who he is -- and therefore might become more than he is -- only through his relation to Cordelia. In <i>Anna Karenina</i>, we recall, Anna's child reveals to her a moral path that she is summoned to follow, and Levin's child shows him the way to salvation. Indeed, in all three of these works the child bears a salvific significance.
<P>
What does all of this tell us about our own condition and the salvation that we are all in need of?  In a word, it tells us that if we are not mothers, nothing has value; if we are not fathers, we ourselves are nothing; and if we have no children, everything is meaningless. And yet, as never before, the mother, father, and child are under massive assault in our society. As in the literary works we have considered, that assault begins with an assault on holy matrimony, which is an assault on the holy itself. Divorce rates, for instance, are staggering, and they are higher among people who live together before they get married than among those who do not. Why?  Because those who live together out of wedlock have no regard for the sanctity of marriage. 
<p>
Premarital and extramarital sex, moreover, is not only tolerated -- it is romanticized and is therefore encouraged. Sex, I have been told, is a way of "getting to know someone."  No longer, then, is the sexual relation understood to be an expression of a higher relation, whereby a husband and wife join with the Creator to bring life into the world. Indeed, the last thing that most people want when they engage in sex is to become a mother or a father. Therefore, the question raised in the sexual relation is not "How do I express my devotion to God through this relation to another human being?"  but rather "Am I protected?"  And yet the more we are concerned with this protection, the more we plunge into ruin.
<p>
Because the sexual relation is central to bearing life into the world, our views on sex are directly tied to the value we place on human life. And as sex becomes more casual, motherhood and fatherhood become more corrupt. Instead of viewing motherhood as a blessing, we view abortion as a right. Women who have babies and decide to be mothers by staying home with their children are taken to be either deprived or deficient and are made to feel that they have to apologize for some transgression. As for fathers, they are held to no standards at all. Many abandon their families altogether, and when fathers are absent communities collapse into a combination of lotus eaters and Cyclopians -- those among whom the life of the other human being means nothing.
<p>
I am not speaking only of city neighborhoods where most households are headed by single mothers. No, the entire land has taken on the aspect of the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There is no evidence more convincing or more terrible to support this than the fact that the most common form of death among children between 15 and 19 years of age is the death related to drugs and alcohol. This has come to be the case not because our children have failed to learn what we teach them, but because they have learned all too well and have followed our teachings to their logical conclusions. These are the teachings that regard the family as a social unit, and not as a center of life's sanctity; that regard the ego as the center of the universe, and not as the seat of responsibility to and for the other human being; and that take morality to be a cultural curiosity, and not a means of expressing our relation to the God who summons us to be moral.
<p>
As in the case of Odysseus, violence follows in the wake of the lotus. And, of course, violence in the streets finds its way into the home. It goes by the scandalous name of "domestic violence."  Domestic violence is not the cause of the breakdown of the family; it is the result of that breakdown. For domestic violence is the outcome of a loss of the sacred in life, and the family is the primary ground for the manifestation of what is sacred. A man who understands his relation to his wife to be an expression of a relation to the Most High is far less likely to beat her than a man who has no such understanding. A father who sees that his children are a blessing from God and the basis of all there is to hold dear is far less likely to abuse them than one who has no such insight.
<P>
But we shall remain blind to this understanding and insight as long as we send women into wars, give the nod to abortions on demand, grant divorces without grounds, romanticize adultery, and accord so-called homosexual marriage the same status as a marriage that can bring children into the world. Much more than the signs of changing times, these are the signs of the loss of meaning; much more than the manifestation of cultural evolution, they are a manifestation of cultural collapse. As Abraham Joshua Heschel once said, "We have bartered holiness for convenience, loyalty for success, wisdom for information, prayers for sermons, tradition for fashion."  Which amounts to saying:  We have traded the home for the void and the family for the abyss.
<p>
Cultural restoration not only begins at home, as Russell Kirk has pointed out; it begins with the restoration of the home and of the family that constitutes the home. If home and family are indeed among the permanent things, as the literature we have discussed indicates, they require a permanent vigilance. For the permanent things are the most precious things. And nothing is more fragile than what is most precious.

<h3>The Mystic Chords of Memory: Reclaiming American History</h3>
<b>By Wilfred M. McClay</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">The Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures</a>, Delivered December 
13, 1995
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am delighted to be with you this afternoon and to have a role in the Heritage Foundation's worthy 
project of commemorating Russell Kirk's many contributions to American intellectual life. My own 
task today is to explore the subject of historical consciousness in America -- a subject about which, 
strange to say, Russell Kirk actually did not write a great deal, at least not addressing the subject 
directly. But he didn't need to. His entire life and work were nothing less than an extended 
elaboration of that very theme. Historical consciousness seemed to have been infused into the air he 
breathed and mixed into the soil of the ancestral land in which he chose to live. No place or thing, 
however ordinary, was too humble for him to grant it the dignity of a story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One notices this historical tendency even in Kirk's language. It has a most peculiar lilt, which often 
charms and sometimes startles the reader with its unexpectedly fanciful and antique echoes. (As an 
example of the latter, I remember being shocked when I read Kirk describe a leading social critic as 
an exemplar of "defecated intellect" -- shocked, that is, until I looked the word up, and saw that 
Kirk used the word in an older and more etymologically informed sense than my own, strictly 
scatological understanding.) What struck many readers as mannered or affected diction in Kirk was 
actually something quite different. It was evidence of his strong conviction that words, like people, 
are living things, bearing living pasts deserving of recognition and respect. That was typical of him. 
He had the ability to make even the dullest things gleam with the luster of historical imagination. 
With all due respect to Governor John Engler, who inaugurated this series of lectures, who would 
have thought that Michigan could ever be made a name to conjure with?  Yet Kirk made his many 
readers curious to see his beloved "stump country" and to explore the tiny burg of Mecosta. 
Although his Gothic and Romantic tastes drew him to old European cathedrals, Roman ruins, and 
other such haunted sites, he was not prone to sigh, in the perennial complaint of American writers 
such as Hawthorne and Henry James, that America was too new or raw or commerce-minded to be 
the stuff of art. On the contrary, Kirk knew how to see monuments, and ruins, everywhere he 
looked. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What others called "junk" Kirk thought of as "cultural debris," which is a short way of saying that 
Kirk took a long view of the disorders of our contemporary American world, seeing them in light of 
the thousand follies and disorders that have come before us in the human procession. Historical 
consciousness gave him a broad, capacious vision, which always insisted that the civilization we 
enjoy has deep living roots. Those roots of American order extend back in time not only to 18th-
century Philadelphia, but further back, to London, Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem. Virtually 
everything he wrote testified to his intense awareness of the immanence, inescapability, and 
indispensability of the past, and not only the past of the previous generation or two, but the distant 
past -- the past of the Law and the Prophets, of Solon, Cicero, Augustine, the English constitution, 
Montesquieu, Burke, Lincoln. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's career, then, went against the American grain, and it did so in two different ways. In the first 
place, he was an intellectual genuinely at ease in America. He may have fancied himself a 
Bohemian Tory, but he was never that most tiresome of bores, "the alienated American 
intellectual," a restless species that grazes in herds of independent minds. He knew he was fortunate 
to live in a country free and prosperous enough to permit him a career as an independent writer, and 
he never forgot that fact. But at the same time, he was never an uncritical celebrant of American 
culture. He loved his country, but he did not idolize it. Instead, he held it accountable to a 
transcendent standard, against which he often found it seriously wanting. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In particular, Kirk lamented the deification of progress, the cult of absolute equality, the advance of 
the Leviathan state, the licentiousness of the autonomous self, the transvaluation of values, and 
other such modern abstractions that have transformed and eroded the American republic. While he 
vehemently opposed ideology in all its forms, including conservative ideology, he at the same time 
lamented Americans' fixation upon short-term, practical, problem-solving, results-oriented, and 
utility-maximizing thinking in place of a deeper reflection upon the proper ends of things. Kirk, 
then, was trying to do something characteristic of traditionalist conservatives: fight on two fronts at 
once. He was defending the American way of life against its cultured despisers -- while at the same 
time challenging many elements of that way of life by holding it up to its classical and Judeo-
Christian antecedents. He comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable -- and sometimes 
they were the same people. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk was not the only one to act this way. Many American conservatives feel caught in a similar 
bind. Most of them are dyed-in-the-wool patriots, and yet they wonder whether the very America 
they so ardently defend is only too willing to sell its birthright for a mess of pottage -- or, for the 
more ideologically inclined, a pot of message. Even here at Heritage, which is a very busy, worldly 
place, teeming with clever people and clever ideas addressing themselves to the immediate concrete 
policy questions and debates of the day, one is likely to encounter that very American question: Of 
what use is historical consciousness? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The dangers inherent in this characteristically American attitude are wonderfully illuminated by a 
joke I heard the other day, which with your indulgence I will retell -- not only because it bears 
directly upon the point, but because storytelling seems a very Kirkean way to get at a Kirkean truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tale begins with a tourist, wandering through the back alleys of San Francisco's Chinatown, 
where he comes upon a little antique shop, filled with curious pieces of statuary and other art 
objects. What especially catches his eye is a beautifully wrought, life-size bronze statue of a rat. He 
asks the elderly shopkeeper for the rat's price. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The rat costs twelve dollars," says the shopkeeper, "and it will be a thousand dollars more for the 
story behind it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Well, you can keep the story, old man," responds the tourist, "but I'll take the rat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After buying the rat, the tourist leaves the store, carrying his newly acquired statue under his arm. 
As he crosses the street in front of the store, he sees two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall 
into step behind him. He looks nervously over his shoulder and starts to walk faster. Soon more rats 
appear and begin to follow him. In a few minutes rats are coming out of every sewer, basement, 
vacant lot, and landfill, forming themselves into swarms and packs and massing in step behind him. 
People on the street point and shout at him as the pursuing rats force him into a trot, and then a dead 
run. But no matter how fast he runs, the rats, now squeaking and squealing grotesquely, stay right 
behind him. By the time he reaches the water's edge, the line of rats trailing him extends back for 
twelve city blocks. Finally, in desperation, the tourist leaps as high as he can up onto a lamppost 
and hugs it by one arm while, with the other, he flings the bronze rat far out into the waters of San 
Francisco Bay. To his amazement, the hordes of rats race right by him and follow the statue, 
surging over the breakwater and leaping into the Bay -- and then promptly drowning. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whereupon the tourist hurries back up to the antique shop. When he appears at the door, the 
shopkeeper smiles knowingly and says, "Ah, yes, sir. So now you've seen what the statue can do, 
and you've come back to find out the story?" 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No, no, no," replies the tourist excitedly. "Now I want to buy a bronze statue of a lawyer!"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There's nothing more rich with cultural meaning than humor. Clearly the main point of this joke is 
its hardwired animus toward lawyers. But there's another point, too. The tourist in this story is a 
man interested only in immediate results, and things, and in what those things can be deployed to 
do. He couldn't care less about "knowing the story."  And the punch line assumes that we pretty 
much agree with him. If the statue eradicates lawyers, who cares how it works?  A picture may be 
worth a thousand words, but no story is worth a thousand bucks. Such is the characteristic 
American attitude toward the past -- You can keep your story, old man; I'll take the rat. But the 
tourist makes a completely unwarranted universalistic assumption -- that all bronze statues from 
this shop will have the same effect. How can he know that, until he has heard "the story?"  His lack 
of interest in "the story" is not only philistine; it is foolish. Hasn't he learned that you get what you 
pay for?  Yet this is the sort of mechanistic attitude, which has rightly been called "crackpot 
realism," that Kirk always had to battle -- as do all of us who care about the American past and 
about the state of our historical consciousness. For you can't really appreciate the statuary of 
American political and institutional life, or know the value of American liberty and prosperity, 
unless you pay the price of learning the story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, we also now have another, very different, problem: that the older "story" of the 
American past is increasingly regarded, especially by our academic historians, as nothing but a 
story of rats, which is another way of saying that the struggle to reclaim historical consciousness in 
contemporary America has to occur on two different fronts, too. It is one thing to believe the past is 
unworthy of our attention. It's another thing to assert that it is unworthy of our respect. We now 
confront both of these attitudes at once, and it is hard to say which is the more threatening. It is 
alarming to have our suspicion confirmed, most recently by a Department of Education survey of 
22,000 American schoolchildren, that our young people are learning next to nothing about 
American history. But it is equally alarming to contemplate what passes for historical study in the 
academy, the arena in which our leaders are educated. There the reign of identity politics and 
political correctness has, if anything, only fortified its hold in recent years. It sometimes seems that, 
to paraphrase the old blues song, if it wasn't for bad history, we wouldn't have no history at all. 
Indeed, it is a melancholy thing to reflect, as I sometimes do, that the only consolation to be had for 
the execrable courses our students endure is the fact that they won't remember them after they 
graduate. Unfortunately, though, they may not remember any of the good stuff either. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It's time, then, to recover some fairly basic truths. Historical consciousness is to civilized society 
what memory is to individual identity. One cannot say who or what one is -- one can't say one is 
anyone, or anything, at all -- without some selective retention of experience and source of 
continuity. One cannot learn, use language, pass on knowledge, raise offspring, or even dwell in 
society without the aid of memory. Without memory there are no workable rules of conduct, no 
standard of justice, no basis for restraining passions, no sense of the connection between an action 
and its consequences. There can be no sense of the future, as a moment in time we know will come, 
because we remember that other tomorrows have come, too. And there can be no recognition of the 
sacred, no act of consecration or devotion to the unseen -- for nothing exists but the proximate and 
the sensate. A culture without memory will necessarily be barbarous, no matter how 
technologically advanced and sophisticated, because the daily drumbeat of artificial sensations and 
amplified events will drown out all other sounds, including the strains of an older music.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our day, even the academic study of history has begun to yield to such barbarism. For an 
increasing number of younger historians, the whole point of studying the past is to "prove" that all 
our inherited institutions, beliefs, conventions, and normative values are arbitrary -- mere "social 
constructions" in the service of ignoble power -- and are therefore utterly without legitimacy or 
authority. In this view, it is absurd to imagine that the study of the past could have any purpose 
beyond serving the immediate needs of the present -- and anyone who thinks otherwise is either 
disingenuous or stupid. The very idea of being enlarged or drawn out of ourselves by encountering 
the strangeness of the past -- and the strange familiarity of the past -- now seems quite beside the 
point. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's view of the matter was different, first of all because, for him, the past was a land of 
enchantment, pervaded with flitting shadows and ghostly presences. But it was also the source of 
what little real solidity there is to be found in the world. The study of the past, he believed, should 
cause us to recognize the ways that the past has authority over us. For historical consciousness, as 
he understood it, is not merely an awareness of the past and of one's own connection to it. It is the 
cultivation of respect for what cannot be seen, for the invisible sources of meaning and authority in 
our lives -- for the formative agents and foundational principles that, although no longer tangible, 
have made possible what is worthy in our own day. To borrow from the language of religious faith, 
the tutelage of historical consciousness teaches us what it means to walk by faith, and not only by 
sight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We see, then, that historical knowledge and historical consciousness are two very different things; 
and the acquisition of historical consciousness, properly understood, will have to be something 
different from the academic study of history -- though the latter does not preclude the former. The 
acquisition of historical consciousness means learning the discipline of memory, which is far more 
than a matter of personal memory -- though that is, of course, where it begins and ends. Historical 
consciousness means learning to appropriate into our own moral imagination, and learning to be 
guided by, the distilled memories of others, the stories of things we never experienced firsthand. It 
means learning to make these things our own, learning to look out at the world we experience 
through their filter, learning to feel the living presence of the past inhering in the seeming inertness 
of the world as it is given to us. Of course, discernment between and among memories is of great 
importance. Not all are worth preserving, and not all are reliable. Here is where the practice of 
professional historians has been especially valuable, in preserving so much that would otherwise be 
lost and in ferreting out the evidence for certain propositions while uncovering the faulty basis for 
others. But the advocate of historical consciousness is likely to give preference to those memories 
whose importance and reliability have been established not merely by a select committee of the 
American Historical Association, but also by the passage of time. To repeat, historical knowledge 
and historical consciousness are different things, and the latter can never become the province of a 
historical priesthood.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An outside observer cannot easily tell when an individual's vision of reality itself has been 
transformed. No one else can see with another person's eyes, feel with another person's heart. But 
let us imagine a visitor to the battlefield at Gettysburg who knows the history of that battle and war, 
knows the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and knows something of subsequent American 
history -- not only knows these things, but has digested and internalized this knowledge. That 
visitor will experience something very different on his visit from what an uninformed eight-year-
old child will see. What the educated observer sees when he gazes at the modest grassy bump of 
Cemetery Ridge will be, in a sense, more real than what the unimpressed young child sees, even 
though they are looking at the same thing. Such an example undercuts the positivistic notion that 
we live in a world of inert facts to which we impute values. Insofar as we are historical, 
remembering creatures, we inevitably participate in the meanings that we apprehend -- a mysterious 
form of participant knowledge that is, as John Lukacs argues, something very different from mere 
subjectivity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Part of what makes our visitor different, too, is the fact that he comes to Gettysburg as a part of 
what sociologists call a "community of memory."  His reactions are not determined merely by his 
idiosyncratic impressions, though he may well have had some, or by his extensive knowledge, 
however detailed it may be. Instead, he is one of many people who remember what happened in 
that place, and in some way he is connected to all of them, to all who are bound together by 
remembrance of that story. In the end, communities and nation-states are constituted and sustained 
by such shared memories -- by stories of foundation, conflict, and perseverance. The leap of 
imagination and faith, from the thinness and unreliability of our individual memory to the richness 
of collective memory, that is the leap of civilized life; and the discipline of collective memory is the 
task not only of the historian, but of every one of us. Historical consciousness draws us out of a 
narrow preoccupation with the present and with our "selves," and ushers us into another, larger 
world -- a public world that "cultures" us, in all the senses of that word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historical consciousness is, then, part of the cement that holds America together and makes us 
willing to strive and sacrifice on her behalf. One might think of the Gettysburg Address as an 
exemplary text in this respect, since it sought to give meaning to the suffering of the present 
precisely by reference to the visionary sacrifices of the Founders. Instead of deconstructing the past 
in the name of the present, it reinterpreted the present by reference to the past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even better example, however, is Lincoln's first inaugural address, from which the haunting 
phrase in my title, "The Mystic Chords of Memory," is taken. To understand what sort of appeal 
Lincoln was making with these words, we need to recall the setting in which the address was given 
in March of 1861. In the wake of Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860 without the support of 
a single Southern state, seven states from the Deep South had already left the Union, and the crucial 
border states were on the verge of doing so as well. The Union that Lincoln so greatly cherished 
seemed to be dissolving before his eyes. With this inaugural speech, Lincoln began his attempt to 
counter this disintegration. He made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, the union of states 
under the Constitution could not be broken, for it was meant to be a perpetual union, rather than 
being revocable at the whim of a single state or combination of states. The speech takes a variety of 
turns, offering legal, political, moral, and prudential reasons for its case. Its tone is by turns both 
conciliatory and stern. But with its final clinching paragraph -- added (it is said) at the suggestion of 
William Henry Seward -- the speech soars to immortal heights: 
<p><blockquote>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. 
Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The 
mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to 
every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus 
of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our 
nature.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a rich, complex, intricately balanced sentence, built around a delicate musical image. The 
"chords of memory" will eventually be "touched" by our better angels -- one can almost envision 
them plucking the strings of a harp -- and once those memories have been made vibrant, they will 
elicit other sympathetic vibrations, the intervals and overtones that energize and "swell the chorus 
of the Union."  These are "mystic" chords, which means that they must come from a divine, 
mysterious source; and these mystic chords somehow have the power to link "every battlefield and 
patriot grave" to "every living heart and hearthstone" in the land. When they are sounded, the 
mystic chords have the power to connect past and present, inner and outer, private and public, 
household and polity, locality and nationality in a single harmonious whole. During times of 
confusion and crisis, such as the nation was then facing, it could find composure and direction in 
recalling the Spirit of '76 and the Founders' heroic sacrifices. Citizens will draw strength and 
comfort from associating their love of the nation with the same warm devotion that attaches them to 
their own hearths.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Lincoln, though, the battlefields and patriot graves deserved our reverence not simply for 
sentimental reasons, or out of reverence for our ancestors' great sacrifices, but because of the cause 
for which they sacrificed. It would not have been enough had they merely died for the 19th-century 
equivalent of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They died, as Lincoln expressed it in the 
Gettysburg Address, in order that government of the people, by the people, and for the people "shall 
not perish from the earth."  They died, he asserted, to sustain the possibility of a nation "dedicated 
to the proposition that all men are created equal."  The mystic chords of memory, then, also draw us 
back to first principles and to an understanding of America as a nation self-consciously founded, at 
a distinct moment in time, with particular ends in view. From this perspective, the United States is a 
nation with a uniquely creedal sense of national identity -- a nation, as Chesterton put it, with the 
soul of a church. In this view, one becomes an American less by <i>descent</i> than by 
<i>consent</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, Lincoln's oratory offered two different effects of invoking the mystic chords of memory -- 
first, as reminders of an inherited way of life and, second, as reminders of a set of universal 
propositions. This duality is at the heart of a longstanding debate about the nature of American 
institutions, and indeed it now presents itself at the heart of contemporary debates about 
multiculturalism, immigration, and national identity. Is America a transnational nation, founded 
upon certain abstract and universalistic principles which it both exemplifies and promotes?  Or is it 
a civilization built upon a series of specifically Western European, and largely British, historical 
accretions with language, laws, customs, conventions, institutions, and belief systems arising 
organically out of those particular legacies?  Such questions are exceedingly difficult to answer 
with finality, and the balance between them may remain contested for as long as the United States 
stays in business as a country. It is hard to imagine either one of the perspectives they represent 
ever being excluded from our sense of national identity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now let me turn to the possibility of "reclaiming" the American past, alluded to in my subtitle. 
What is meant by this?  First, a recognition that genuine historical consciousness ought to be the 
common possession of all. Quite simply, a democratic nation needs a democratic history. By this I 
do not mean the sort of fashionable history that ignores politics and constitutions and intellectual 
elites and insists upon viewing the past exclusively "from the bottom up."  There is in fact a kind of 
unconscious scorn buried in the assumptions behind such writing -- as if political and intellectual 
history is beyond the common people's means, and as if no one could be expected to be interested 
in anything that does not involve them directly. Surely, however, such assumptions are false. 
Instead, we need to encourage serious historical writing that is sufficiently accessible to shape and 
deepen the public mind. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here, too, one will need to battle on two fronts, challenging both the ignorance of the public and the 
malfeasances of the scholarly establishment. The American public has to want to reclaim its 
history, and it will have to be willing to work at it and overcome the tendencies so well illustrated 
by the rat joke. But that willingness will come far more easily if something can be done about the 
combination of political ideology and professionalization that has enveloped historical writing in 
recent years. The dangers of ideology are fairly obvious; but the dangers of exclusive 
professionalization are nearly as great. Though the professionalization of historical writing has been 
a source of many great improvements in our historical knowledge, it has wounded our historical 
consciousness. The time may have come to rethink the matter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent dust-ups over the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian and the National History 
Standards are revealing in this respect. In both cases, the American public reacted decisively, and 
negatively, to what it saw as efforts by anointed experts to hijack the American past and transpose 
the mystic chords into a minor key. What has been most notable in both episodes has been the 
surprised and outraged reactions of the historical profession (or more precisely, of its spokesmen). 
The responses have run the gamut: astonishment, shock, fury, wounded dismay, dripping 
condescension. And I regret to say that even now I do not think my colleagues quite grasp what has 
happened to them. It has long been fashionable in academe to talk about who "owns" history and to 
make very democratic noises whenever the matter is under discussion. But all the while, it seems as 
if the professional historians have not doubted that <i>they</i> own it, or at least deserve to, and if 
one could take control of the American Historical Association and other professional organizations, 
one could transform history in a manner nearer to one's heart. They now have discovered that what 
flies in the hermetic world of academic scholarship will not fly with the great American public. In 
the Enola Gay episode in particular, the use of a public, and publicly funded, commemorative 
exhibition to put forward a revisionist interpretation of the American war effort in 1941-45 crossed 
a line, and the public would not tolerate it. And they were right not to.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me hasten to add that I am not saying history ought to be all comforting myth. Nor am I 
suggesting that historians should never challenge conventional wisdom. On the contrary; we badly 
need such challenges. But surely this does not mean historians enjoy <i>carte blanche</i> 
protection against being themselves challenged in turn, particularly when they choose to address 
sensitive public issues. Indeed, the public has a responsibility to offer such counterchallenges, 
whenever appropriate, to test and ventilate the findings of academicians. That is part of what it 
means to have a democratic history and democratic discourse. Yet it was precisely the mounting of 
such challenges that most offended the historical clerisy: The <i>effrontery</i> of all those World 
War II veterans, thinking they knew something important about the war that had escaped the 
attention of the Smithsonian's baby-boomer curators!  The future may well bring many, many more 
such acts of effrontery as the public's patience with the follies of higher education wanes -- and, 
may it be hoped, as their interest in reclaiming the past waxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It will, however, take more than challenging academic revisionism to accomplish much along these 
lines. The two fronts I spoke of before symbolize two problems that are, in fact, mutually 
reinforcing. Revisionism would have little power in a country that was less ignorant of its past. The 
docu-slanders of Oliver Stone would be laughed out of court. So would the childish fantasies of 
<i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Hence, in engaging the second front, we must resist the temptation to 
blame others, to play the game of anti-anti-Americanism, and instead face up to our weaknesses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this connection, it seems to me that Russell Kirk was right to stress that technological progress 
and the unhindered market are not the answer to everything. Notwithstanding their many blessings 
and benefits, one cannot ignore the pathologies and casualties they engender -- and the loss of 
historical consciousness has been one of them. We live in a culture of such ceaseless, turbulent 
change -- economic, social, technological -- that for many of us it seems almost ridiculous, and 
certainly quixotic, to be speaking of chains of continuity linking generations past with generations 
to come. Indeed, the emerging postmodern understanding of the self counsels that it is fruitless, and 
even unhealthy, to seek continuity and consistency within one's self. Better to be a protean self, 
hanging loose, refashioning one's identity as changing circumstances dictate. Postmodernism is 
itself symptomatic, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a pervasive tendency within our society. It 
may be crackpot realism of the worst sort to think we can go on this way very much longer, 
particularly if it is true that the social problem at the bottom of all others -- the disintegration of the 
family -- is ultimately a problem of discontinuity between the generations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our popular culture conspires in a thousand ways to reinforce our sense of discontinuity and 
generational isolation. Consider, to take but one example, what has happened to professional sports 
in our time. When I was a boy, professional sports formed a central part of my life. They provided a 
tremendous source of common experience linking me not only with my own friends, but with my 
father and mother and members of their generation. I had a typical American boy's fascination with 
baseball statistics and delighted in my then-extensive knowledge of them. I did not realize it at the 
time, but those statistics were also a source of historical consciousness. For to enter seriously into 
the world of baseball statistics is to become aware of a world much larger and longer than your 
own, to see all major-league baseball players competing in one great continuum of slugging 
percentages, earned-run averages, and stolen bases. One becomes a kind of historian. I learned to 
care not only about the active players I followed, like Boog Powell and Brooks Robinson, but about 
long-gone players my parents had followed, like Dizzy Dean, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio; and that 
was a wonderful bond between us. I will always have a soft spot for the St. Louis Cardinals, even 
though I grew up following the Baltimore Orioles, because the Cardinals had been my parents' team 
when they were young. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I do not have any such soft spot, however, for the Indianapolis Colts. Nor do I expect to care much 
about the Baltimore Browns football team. When I was a boy, I was well aware that professional 
sports was a business. But I could never have imagined the degree to which it is now little else. We 
now have not only the free agency of players, but the free agency of franchises; and the rules, 
materials, schedules, game sites, players -- everything about the game -- are considered plastic and 
subject to revision. This is the triumph of utility-maximizing over all else, and I cannot help but 
think professional sports will ultimately be undone by it. In my own case, there is no magic left, 
and I am relieved that my own son has no interest in professional sports. Another chain of 
continuity broken.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even so, there will always remain the irreducible lure of seeing excellence in performance, a 
healthy antidote to the cult of victimization and self-pity that has swept our culture. But one cannot 
feel that lure without first having a consciousness of the larger historical context which so engaged 
me as a boy, that universe of statistics and records. After Cal Ripken, Jr., broke Lou Gehrig's 
consecutive-game record this past year, he spoke some very simple but hauntingly appropriate 
words which captured this fact perfectly. As you may remember, there was some feeling that 
Ripken ought not break the record, that to do so robbed Gehrig of his distinction. But Ripken knew 
that the opposite was true: that he best honored Gehrig by competing with him. If Gehrig were 
looking down on this, Ripken said, he would not be thinking about the record; he would instead 
reflect that here was "an example of what is good and right about the great American game."  It was 
a simple, wonderful statement -- one that, in its own way, sounds the mystic chords of memory, 
stretching from every batter's box and bleacher seat to every hearth and TV room in this broad land. 
It recognizes that a determination to achieve and a reverence for the past are by no means opposites. 
But of course, Ripken would never have used the words he did had there not been so much that is 
neither good nor right about the great American game in its present condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have delved into the example of baseball, but I could have picked any number of features of our 
popular culture -- our popular music, our extreme geographical mobility, our disintegrating 
families, our declining churches and voluntary associations, our mania for the bulldozer and the 
wrecking ball. Indeed, I think there is a growing recognition of these problems across the 
intellectual spectrum. It is important, however, to formulate the problem rightly. It is not the 
<i>commodification</i> of all things (to use a trendy, overused word) but the <i>fungibility</i> of 
all things, which is to say their <i>impermanence</i>, that afflicts us -- the fungibility of 
marriages, lovers, jobs, habitations, even genders. It is not just that all things are for sale, but that in 
the process all things are being made commensurable and interchangeable, and therefore ultimately 
homogeneous. An odd goal for a world that professes to prize diversity but is in fact frightened by 
it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of which should give added force in our minds to Kirk's permanent emphasis, in season and out 
of season, upon "the permanent things."  But it should also remind us that the recovery of historical 
consciousness is not merely an intellectual matter, a matter of rereading the great books and 
reemphasizing the roots of American order, as Kirk called them. It is also a very concrete matter, a 
matter of taking stock of the way we live, of what our pastimes and pleasures, our families and our 
marriages, our habits and our aspirations all say about our sense of connection to the past -- and, 
therefore, about ourselves. Karl Marx insisted that the past did not deserve our reverence; it was 
nothing but a snare. "The tradition of all the dead generations," he declaimed, "weighs like a 
nightmare on the brain of the living."  He was wrong about that, as about so much else. But too 
many of us live, whether we know it or not, as if we believed he was right. Perhaps it is time for 
that to change.

<TITLE>What Is The Third Generation? -- Heritage</TITLE>


</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><IMG SRC="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></a></center>
<P>
<H2>Third Generation</H2>
<hr><p>

The term Third Generation describes a generation of conservatives whose primary purpose in Washington is to roll back the liberal policies of the last 60 years. First Generation conservatives were the intellectuals, including Russell Kirk, Bill Buckley, and James Burnham. Far removed from power, these intellects drew the philosophical map for later generations. 
<p>
The crushing defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 sparked the Second Generation of conservatives -- men and women dedicated to putting conservatives in office.  The Third Generation of conservatives emerged from Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980.  Liberals, discredited intellectually by the First Generation, and defeated politically by the Second, were dismayed as swarms of young conservative activists came to Washington to chip away at their centralized power.
<p>
In January of 1984, The Heritage Foundation initiated the Third Generation project to identify young conservative leaders and bring them together in an informal setting to discuss the issues challenging them today and in the future.  Since then, Third Generation members have met every other Wednesday night for lectures and refreshments in Heritage's Lehrman Auditorium. 
<p>
While the initial goal of the Third Generation project was, and is, to identify and network young conservatives, its importance to the success of conservative policies runs much deeper. As a speaker said several years ago, "the central mission of the Third Generation is to continue to build the lines of communication between the various interests within our movement and develop a set of signals so that we can all move in one direction, to accomplish a common objective the rebuilding of America along the principles established by this country's founders."

<h2><i>Family Economics:  What to Expect for Your Infant's First-Year Costs</i></h2>

	As any working parent knows, having children can be a costly adventure. But has anyone put a figure on what the average costs per child are in 1995 as compared with 1960?  Of course!  Your hard tax dollars are at work once again.  The US federal government, and a few other sources,  have come up with a few statistics that any expecting parent or current parent needs to know:
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p><ul> 
<li> The Census Bureau states that American births should remain at about 3.9 million per year thought the turn of the century.
<p>
<li> Roughly 17% of family income is spent on an infant under one year, as compared with 21% of family income in 1960.  (And day care wasn't even part of the spending equation in 1960!)
<p>
<li> Day care now accounts for 14% of total spending on an infant under one year.
<p>
<li> In 1960, average family income was $30,120  -- that was back when the usual family only had one parent working.  Of that salary, $6,203 was spent on an infant under one.  Today, the average family income -- with two parents working -- is $44, 800.  Of that amount, $7,610 is spent on an infant under one, according the Agriculture Department.
<p>
<li> In 1995,  the majority of spending per infant was spent on child care and food, with clothing and health care following.  In 1960, the majority was spent on food (Remember: day care was not even a consideration then), with health care and clothing following.
<p>
<li> According to Lifestyle Change Communications, here's a specific breakdown in first-year costs:
<P><table border=0 cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7>
<tr>
	<td><b>diapers</b></td><td><b>$570</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>nursery</b></td><td><b>$1,200</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>furniture</b></td><td><b>$995</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>bedding/bath</b></td><td><b>$223</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>toys</b></td><td><b>$199</b></td></tr></table>
</ul><p>
	Even though 48% of women are in the work force, as compared with 27% in 1960,  their families are still spending less in the first year, in terms of family income, than their parents spent on them back in 1960.  Any way you look at it, babies really are big business!

Prior to her work for the foundation, Miller worked in the Bush Administration as a special assistant for domestic policy and public liaison for Vice President Dan Quayle.  She was also a staff assistant in the Reagan Administration, where she assisted in the compilation of research data on the major domestic and foreign policy events which shaped the Administration.  This project served as the basis for President  Reagan's memoirs, and are on display at the <a href="/townhall/hall_of_fame/reagan/preslib.html">Reagan Presidential Library</a>.
<p>
A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miller is married to a Civil War buff from North Carolina who insists she has "southern traits."  Her husband, Matt, works on Capitol Hill, and they have two daughters. The first, Reagan Lee Miller, is named after President Ronald Reagan, the reason they both entered politics.
<p>
Miller has her B. A. and J.D. from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

<TITLE> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
 -- November 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>November, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><h3> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
</h3></CENTER><HR>
<P>
<dd>	Consider the many conservative policy proposals which have been enacted recently, or are on your "wish list." Think about the tremendous popular support many of these plans enjoy. . . .Then realize that the courts have overturned some of these programs already and may well derail numerous others. 
<P>
<dd>
	The combination of litigious, liberal advocacy groups and a judiciary too often willing to make law, rather than interpret the Constitution threatens to negate many of the gains conservatives have made in the war of ideas and at the ballot box. As soon as a program such as school choice or the California Civil Rights Initiative passes, a lawsuit is immediately filed to prevent its implementation. 
<P>
<dd>
	What we seem to get in many cases is a tyranny of judges -- <I>de facto</I> rule by jurists whose power is unchecked and who see fit to mold society to suit their own personal concepts of justice. Most often, this judicial activism reinforces the reigning liberal orthodoxy which has taken hold of American legal institutions.
<P>
<dd>
	As conservatives prepare to wage many crucial battles in the courts, the Federalist Society has built a network designed to overcome legal abuses and to return America to a legal system which operates according to the design of the founders.
<P>
<dd>
	The Federalist Society advances traditional legal principles such as limited, constitutional government; individual freedom and responsibility; traditional values; and the rule of law. Our 22,000 lawyers, law students, academics, public officials, and other concerned citizens actively forward these ideals locally and nationally.

<P>
<dd>	The Society's 145 Student Division chapters at law schools across the country and 60 Lawyers Division chapters in major legal centers provide us with a grass-roots community presence nationwide.
	<P>
<dd>The combination of our strong local base and our national stature allows the Federalist Society to promote the serious inquiry which generates solutions to vital legal and policy questions. Our members are increasingly involved in every stage of the public policy process from recognizing political opportunities to building intellectual and academic support to winning legislative debates. 
<P>
<dd>	We aim to involve in the public policy discussion Citizen-Lawyers who will fight the legal and policy battles crucial to our principles. Today, there is much of this work to be done.
<P>
<dd>
	The following list of activities highlights some of the ways in which the Federalist Society is forwarding its goals:
<P>
<dd>
	Our <b>E.L. Wiegand Practice Groups</b> create a national network of active attorneys dedicated to traditional legal principles. The 15 topics covered by the Practice Groups include: Civil Rights, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Environmental Law, Free Speech, Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Religious Liberties. By mobilizing our members in this manner, we will have a large impact on the development of law in each of these areas.
<P>
<dd>
	The Society's <b><i>Pro Bono</i> Resource Network</b> links Federalist Society lawyers with like-minded groups and individuals needing legal assistance. Through this outreach, our members use their professional talents on behalf of the principles in which they believe.
<P>
<dd>
	The <b>ABA Watch Project</b> centers around a semi-annual <i>ABA Watch</i> newsletter, the first of which was released in August at the American Bar Association convention. This periodical publicizes the activities of the ABA. In so doing, we expect to generate a great deal of discussion about the organized bar and the fears of many that it has become a left-wing advocacy group.
<P>
<dd>
	Of course, the Society's core programs -- local chapter meetings, national and regional conferences, and publications -- will continue to promote traditional legal principles. 
	<P>
<dd>
In sum, the Federalist Society educates the legal community and the general public about the proper role of the legal system, activates legal professionals on behalf of conservative causes, and provides assistance to friendly local, state-wide, and national groups.
	<P>

<B>U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook 1996</B>,<br>
 compiled and edited by John Dori and Richard Fisher
<br>
The Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Center<hr>
<P>
John Dori, Research Associate of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, and Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, have compiled the 11th annual U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook. The authors note that U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995. The rise in exports to Asia outpaced the growth of exports to all other regions of the world. To help policy makers and the public understand the key issues facing the world's most dynamic region, the Asian Studies Center has compiled key social, political, economic, and military statistics on the United States and 33 countries in East of South Asia. this year's edition includes a chart summarizing the findings of Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom. 91 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

 by John Hillen<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1096, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States must enact a staged removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Bosnia in order to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to the region. Specifically, according to Hillen, the U.S. should keep only a limited number of support troops in Bosnia in 1997, and there should be no U.S. ground troops in a new follow-on implementation force. The follow-on implementation force should be European-led, and eventually lead to European responsibility for the regional peacekeeping burden. All U.S. troops should be removed by 1998, for, according to Hillen, America's main purpose in NATO is not to police ethnic conflicts in Europe. The peacekeeping responsibility should come under such European organizations as the Western European Union or the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe after NATO's departure.  11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc143.html">Building a Better U.S. Partnership With Australia</a>,</b><br>
 by Robert O'Quinn<br>
<I>Asian Studies Backgrounder</I> No. 143, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Robert O'Quinn, Policy Analyst at the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States should build a better partnership with Australia to protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has recently become a major player in the region. This has been due to Australia's efforts over the past ten years to deregulate its economy and dismantle its extremely protectionist trade policies that nearly brought the country to economic ruin by the 1980s. Australia has embraced the dynamic Asian market and reoriented its diplomatic and economic ties toward Asia and the United States. O'Quinn notes that the U.S. cannot duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and diplomacy have presented to Australia. To secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region, according to O'Quinn, Washington should cooperate with Canberra on trade and security issues. Specifically, the President should: ask Congress to end the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs that have prevented further trade liberalization in Australia; ask congress to allow intracoastal-coastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels to reduce logistics costs for American firms; ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues; ask congress to take further steps all around to liberalize trade, especially in areas of conflict between the U.S. and Australia; and strengthen U.S. military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra <I>Tomahawk</I> long-range cruise missiles and by including Australia in the development of a future Asian missile defense network. 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.or

<B>Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce</B>, <br>
by James Sheehan<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<hr><P>
James Sheehan, Research Associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, discusses international hazard waste regulations and their impact on international commerce. The Basel Convention was signed in 1989 to create a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes. It has three primary objectives: 1) reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 2) ensure that hazardous wastes be treated and disposed of as close as possible to their source of generation; and 3) minimize hazardous waste generation at source. Sheehan argues that global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change the root causes of environmental degradation. He notes that illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government bureaucracies. International trade  does not directly cause environmental degradation, and international trade controls cut off developing countries from important materials and supplies that only international markets can supply. Many developing countries see environmental demands by industrialized nations as new forms of protectionism designed to close markets. Sheehan argues that the U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel Convention. According to Sheehan, the U.S. should reject even the possibility of global trade regulation and an export ban. Free trade and government controls are incompatible concepts. He concludes that developing countries must stand firm against the green trade restrictions of the Basel Convention. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.

<P>
In this essay, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann, Senior Fellows at the Hoover Institution, write about the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The authors note that the fall of the Soviet Union represented the downfall of a secular religion. Economically, politically and militarily, Soviet communism was a failure. They argue that Gorbachev was an unwitting agent of decolonization, and that Yeltsin represents the architect of Russian reconstruction.  42 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA  94305-6010, 415/723-3373, fax 415/723-1687, Internet 	<a href="http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html">http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html</a>.

<B>ESTIMATING OSHA COMPLIANCE COSTS</B>,<BR> 
BY HARVEY JAMES<BR>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 135, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
According to a study by economist Harvey James, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes greater regulatory compliance costs to the economy than previously estimated. Based on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) commissioned by OSHA of 25 major rules issued by the agency after 1980, he estimates that manufacturers in 1993 paid an additional 46,300 each year on average per firm for the 25 OSHA regulations established since 1980. James's analysis has revealed some interesting facts, including: Construction firm spending exceeds $700,000 annually per firm to comply with just one hazardous waste operations regulation; OSHA rules on air quality and process safety are the most costly in the manufacturing sector with costs exceeding $9,000 and $36,000 a year per firm, respectively; the cost of compliance with OSHA's lead standard is nearly $400,000 a year for affected manufacturers; and OSHA's study of the economic impact of proposed Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) projects total compliance costs at over $10 billion a year. James argues that in order to expose the full impact of OSHA regulations, a reliable survey of compliance expenditures needs to be established. He proposes a survey similar to the Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures (PACE) reports made annually by the Census Bureau for the EPA. James concludes that there is reasonable basis for establishing a regulatory budget for OSHA. 29 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>The Last Monopoly: Privatizing the Postal Service for the Information Age</b>, <br>
Edited by Edward Hudgins<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
The Cato Institute presents a collection of essays on returning mail delivery to the free market. The first chapter is by U.S. Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. He tries to make a case that there is a national consensus to keep government in the business of delivering the mail, but that the right amount of deregulation will allow the U.S. Postal Service to compete on equal footing with other couriers. He maintains that universal mail service "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government," is necessary to bind the nation together. James Cambell looks at the creeping expansion of the postal monopoly. Peter Ferrara argues that their are inherent problems with a postal monopoly that have meant rates as much as 50 percent higher than they would be if competition were allowed. Stephen Gibson, Executive Director of the Bionomics Institute illustrates how the Information Age is bypassing the "Machine Age Postal Service." Economist  Thomas DiLorenzo and Richard Geddes contribute essays on "Natural Monopoly Myths" and "Patterns of Private Delivery," which undermine the case for privatizing the assets of the USPS and thereby moving postal services entirely into the free market. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher proposes converting the USPS into an employee stock-ownership company. And Douglas Adie, author of Monopoly Mail, proposes breaking up the U.S. Postal Service, into regional divisions that would then be sold off. 138 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href=:mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</a>.

<b>What to Do About Universal Service Subsidies: Support for High-Cost Areas</b>,<br>
 by Wayne Leighton<br>
<I>Issue Analysis</I> No. 39, Citizens for a Sound Economy<hr>
<P>
Wayne Leighton, Senior Economist for Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses the issue of Universal Service Subsidies for high-cost telephone service areas. The 1996 Telecommunications Act continues, and potentially expands, current universal service subsidies to high-cost telephone servicing areas. The Federal State Joint Board and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been granted considerable authority under the Act to significantly expand the current arrangement of subsidies. Leighton argues that a more limited approach could be taken by relegating more authority over universal service issues to state-level regulators and that subsidies should be brought to a minimum. The size of universal service subsidies, according to Leighton, should be based on the most accurate cost estimates. Methods for cost estimates based upon historical costs tend to inflate the amount of actual expenses incurred, while hypothetical estimates rely on a regulator's calculations. He concludes that for high-cost markets, competitive bidding may offer the most effective way to determine the minimum amount needed to provide a universal service subsidy. This would still guarantee the same quality of service to high-costs areas, while at the same time bringing competition to the market. This competition will drive costs down and efficiency up. 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse</a>.

<p>
Ron Utt, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and Dan Hickey, Special Assistant to The Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Domestic Policy Issues, have compiled a third report on instances of waste and excess in government spending. Utt and Hickey list the names and phone numbers of the people in charge of each government agency where the financial abuses took place. Cases of waste and excess includes: 1) The expenses from the widespread misuse of Vice President Al Gore's recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards; 2) 93 percent failure of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) units in maintenance inspections, while 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles were purchased for the central office staff despite the availability of only one pickup truck for HANO maintenance crews; 3) Massive subsidies for such absentee ranchers and farmers as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and celebrity news reporter Sam Donaldson; 4) Amtrack's proposed use of $40 million in taxpayer money to set up costly new service between Boston and Portland, Maine, that will take longer than existing inexpensive private bus service; 5) Information from internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports that shows that up to one-third of the total funds spent on some projects are lost through gross misuse such as contributing to parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference; and finally, 6) Cases of food stamp abuse such as that by a Tennessee woman with assets valued at over $350,000 receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period, and another instance where food stamps were used to by caviar. Finding room for tax relief can begin with eradicating such flagrant waste as the examples listed in this paper. 4 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-49

According to the authors, failings in current procedures, notably the insistence that tax changes do not affect the overall economy, systematically mislead policy makers, resulting in tax policies that may cost the American public hundreds of billions of dollars yearly.

<b>The Case for an Across-the-Board Tax Rate Reduction</b>, <br>
by Bruce Bartlett<br>
<I>Policy Backgrounder</I> No. 140, National Center for Policy Analysis<hr>
<p>
Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, puts forth the case for reducing tax rates across the board. He points out that total taxes as a share of the GDP were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 -- 31.3 percent. American paid $151.1 billion more in federal taxes than if federal receipts had remained at their 1992 level of 19.2 percent of GDP. Reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 15 percent would lower federal receipts as a share of GDP to what they were in 1992. The across-the-board tax cut would not solve the tax problem. A tax reduction must be accompanied by spending reduction. As long as federal spending consumes over 20 percent of our national output, it will be impossible to lower taxes as much as is needed. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>The Moral Case for the Flat Tax</b>,<br>
 by Steve Forbes<br>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 10, Hillsdale College<hr>
<P>
Former Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes puts forth a moral case for the Flat Tax. Forbes stresses how the current tax system leads to political, civic and cultural corruption. The current tax code is mind-numbing and complex, according to Forbes, and the leading source of corruption in Washington. Lobbyists and special interest groups are the largest private sector industry in Washington. Over half of them work to convince politicians to manipulate the tax code in their favor. A flat tax would close all loopholes and throw the lobbyists and special interests out of work. An unfair tax code and excessive taxation leads to civic corruption by taking away a citizen's sense of self-reliance and integrity. Many Americans view the current tax structure as "legalized plunder." Forbes points out that this has a corrosive impact on an individual's sense of responsibility and trust, two necessary components for society to thrive. Despite the trillions in American taxpayer money that has been spent in the name of "compassion," there is more crime, more illegitimacy, more illiteracy, more drug abuse, more broken families, and more members of the permanent underclass than ever before. A flat tax that exempts the poorest citizens would help end the cultural corruption that has resulted from failed big-government programs. Forbes concludes by arguing that the federal government cannot provide the moral influence necessary to preserve families, reawaken faith, restore values, solve social problems and create prosperity. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<B>Do Automobile Fuel Economy Standards Work</B>,<br>
 by Michael Sykuta <br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 133, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
Michael Sykuta, a Research Associate and lecturer in business administration at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, argues that automobile fuel economy standards do not work. According to Sykuta, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards have not achieved their original objective of reducing gasoline consumption. He finds that the United States consumed 40 percent more gasoline than when the CAFE law was passed in 1975. His findings offers evidence that  freeze, if not a repeal, of CAFE standards should take place. Proponents of CAFE regulation argue that standards must be increased to further reduce the consumption of gasoline and its environmental side-effects. However, Sykuta found the following: average passenger vehicles on the road today are 59 percent more fuel efficient than the average cars of 1975 and continued through 1982, not because of CAFE standards, but because changes in product designed that began prior to 1975 as a response to prevailing market forces; the average fuel economy of the total U.S. fleet continued to rise after 1982 as the older and less efficient cars were slowly replaced with the newer more efficient cars, however the average fuel economy of all cars has leveled off in recent years; and, CAFE regulations have not achieved the goal of reducing American consumption of foreign oil. Sykuta reasons from his data covering a 44-year period (1951-1994), that average gasoline consumption per car is most significantly related to the price of gasoline and to the average fuel efficiency of the total U.S. fleet, not just new cars. He argues that, at least through 1982, the price of gasoline, not CAFE standards themselves, is the key determinant of average fuel efficiency. He concludes that federal government attempts to reduce gasoline consumption with a mandated fuel-economy standard shows no sign having an impact on the amount of gasoline consumed on a per vehicle basis. Overall, Cafe regulations have only served to create additional bureaucratic burdens on automobile ma
nufacturers. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Community-Run Fisheries: Avoiding the "Tragedy of the Commons"</b>, <br>
 by Donald Leal<br>
<I>PERC Policy Series</I> No. 7, PERC<hr>
<p>
Donald Leal, PERC Senior Associate, discusses how coastal communities can avoid overfishing. He presents several cases where fishing territories have been effectively protected and fish populations preserved through community-run fisheries. Leal mentions early native Alaskan fisheries, and today's ZECs (zones of controlled exploitation) in Quebec. In the examples, he shows that fishing areas can be protected from overfishing with minimal government involvement. Citing studies on well-managed, commonly-owned property, he illustrates that well-defined boundaries, a strong community tradition, and absence of government interference can preserve resources and avoid the "tragedy of the commons." He concludes that government has failed to regulate fishing successfully, and that a self-regulated fishery is an idea whose time has come. 27 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<I>State Backgrounder</I> No. 1097/S, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, and Robert Heck, a former Justice Department official, have prepared a study on how state and local officials can fight violent juvenile crime. Wootton and Heck argue that a high-tech approach might be the answer. six percent of hard-core juvenile offenders, or "superpredators" commit up to 63 percent of all violent juvenile crime. According to Wootton and Heck, state and local law enforcement officials should build computerized case files on these criminals and make the information available to every public agency that deals with youth-police, prosecutors, courts, parole officers, schools and social workers. There is already a similar system set up in more than 150 communities across the United States and Canada called Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP). SHOCAP enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals. Wootton and Heck mention that Congress can aid efforts to fight juvenile crime with such legislation as the Violent and Repeat Juvenille Offender Act of 1996, and the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996. Ultimately, they argue, violent juvenile crime must be fought by smart, tough and tenacious officials at the state and local level with the most efficient and sophisticated resources for tracking the violent habitual offender.  17 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>Legal Services for the Poor: Is Federal Support Necessary?</b><br>
 by David Wilkinson<br>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<P>
David Wikenson, former Utah Attorney General, and the first Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91), questions whether the federal government should spend $283 million to fund legal services. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded agency designed to support legal services organizations that serve the poor. Conservative critics of LSC have charged that LSC funds are improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials. Liberal supporters of LSC argue that LSC-funded organizations spend most of their resources representing the poor in routine legal cases such as land-lord-tenant disputes. Whatever the case may be, Wilkinson argues, there are adequate private and non-federal resources currently available to meet the legal needs of the poor. Legal service providers receiving LSC funds also receive at least $324 million from private and other public sources. Furthermore, there are an additional 1,350 providers of legal services to the needy who receive no government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. On top of that there are 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers who perform an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work each year valued at $3.3 billion. Wilkenson concludes that if Congress is serious about balancing the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, then it may want to reconsider the next LSC budget. If LSC were abolished, there would still be at least a half billion dollars available each year for legal services for the needy. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Factories Behind Bars</b>,<br>
 by Morgan Reynolds<br>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 206, <hr>
<P>
Morgan Reynolds, NCPA Senior Fellow, calls for putting prisoners to work. Currently there are unnecessary legal restrictions keeping tens of thousands of prisoners from doing productive work behind bars. Reynolds proposes repealing the laws that restrict trade in prison-made goods. He also proposes recruiting private-sector businesses to supply jobs, once the restrictive laws are abolished. America's prison population is projected to grow to 1.6 million in the next decade. Only about half of all prisoners do any kind of work at all and most of that is part-time work on prison upkeep. According to Reynolds, it should be possible to create jobs for one of every four prisoners during the next five to ten years. If just 60 percent of prisoner earnings were allocated to compensating taxpayers, this would save about $2.4 billion annually, or slightly less than 10 percent of the cost of prison support. Reynolds points out that there is no reason why prisoners shouldn't help to pay for their own upkeep instead of having taxpayers pay for it all. Beyond taxpayer relief, productive work for prisoners would alleviate idleness in prison life, and increase the likelihood of responsible behavior upon the prisoners release. 29 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<hr>
<p>
James Cibulka, Professor and Chair of the Department of Education Policy, Planning and Administration at the University of Maryland, examines what has happened to educational reform in Wisconsin. He finds that Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction (DPI) is still bogged down with outdated "command-and-control" principles. He points out that while private sector organizations have undergone a "management revolution" achieving much greater efficiency, DPI has not reorganized itself to promote high student performance, local initiative, and accountability for high performance at all levels. Cibulka offers recommendations for improving DPI in three general areas: 1) greater regulatory flexibility; 2) improving accountability policies; and 3) a new approach to state leadership and a state-level partnership. He concludes that a new focus on high performance can be achieved within a system with a tradition of strong local initiative. He calls for a new model for education administration that is a state-local partnership. 23 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

This study attempts do the following: a) analyze the issues that GPPF thinks Georgia parents care most about; b) reduce the available statistical information to a concise and understandable form; c) isolate data from Georgia's public high schools only; and d) issue a publication that is accessible and easily comprehensible to the state's general population. The criteria that they used for ranking the schools were the Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, the percentage of students completing a college preparatory curriculum (versus a less vigorous curriculum), dropout rates, and, the number of weapons violations per 100 students. GPPF argues that parents are entitled to know about the quality of their children's schools. For the majority of parents, assessing the quality of a school is a mystery shrouded in unfamiliar terms and endless data. GPPF says that this report should be used to open dialogues between parents, teachers, administrators, government officials, and civic organizations. 35 pp. CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>The End of Welfare: Fighting Poverty in the Civil Society</b>,<br>
 by Michael Tanner<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
Michael Tanner, Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, discusses the corrosive effect of U.S. welfare policy, despite its good intentions. He points out that since the start of the War on Poverty in 1965, the federal and state governments have spent more than $5.4 trillion to end poverty. Despite the enormity of this 'investment' the result has been, primarily, more poverty. He argues that our welfare system is unfair to all. Taxpayers must pay the bill for failed programs. Society is hurt when its mediating institutions of community, church and family are increasingly pushed aside. Most of all, argues Tanner, the poor are hurt with welfare by being trapped in a system that destroys opportunity for themselves and destroys hope for their children. Welfare should be judged on its results, not its intentions. Despite the acknowledgment from all sides that the system has failed, Tanner argues, both liberals and conservatives, continue to believe that government can solve the problem of poverty. Tanner maintains that the answer to poverty does not lie with government. He argues that a new paradigm to fight poverty must be based on civil society instead of government or political society. Civil society, "while stressing self-reliance and individual initiative, would also provide a vigorous network of private, localized, nonbureaucratic charities that are far more capable than is government of helping those people who need temporary assistance." Tanner also criticizes the recent welfare reform legislation. According to him, welfare cannot be reformed, and instead, should be ended. He explains why liberal and conservative welfare reform won't work, and he elaborates on how civil society can replace welfare. This book also includes an appendix listing and describing major welfare programs. 225 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.

<b>The Tenth Amendment: The Promise of Liberty: Strategies to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal and State Governments</b>
American Legislative Exchange Council<hr>
<p>
With this paper, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has put forth strategies to restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments that is implied with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In October of 1995, ALEC and other organizations, held a national federalism summit to look at ways to restore the Tenth Amendment. The result of the summit was four proposals which, they believe, merit further consideration. 1) Set up a mechanism to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures, the power to require Congress to reconsider laws or regulations that interfere with state authority. 2) Set up a mechanism that would allow the states to propose specific amendments to the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the United States Congress. 3) Set up statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address the problems of conditions attached to federal spending grants, regulations and mandates. 4) Passage of a federalism act to enhance the political safeguards and give states a more effective voice in congressional deliberations. For each of these proposals ALEC recommends the following: 1) The National Government of the People Amendment, which would allow state legislatures to repeal intrusive federal legislation and regulations; 2) The States' Initiative, which would empower the People through their state legislature to ratify constitutional amendments that enjoy broad support but that Congress has failed to propose; 3) The Accountability in Government Initiative, which would end the three intrusive federal practices of regulatory mandates, unfunded mandates, and the imposition of impermissible conditions on federal spending grants; and 4) The Federalism Act, which would directly address discrete aspects of the current imbalance between the federal and state governments. 17 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1094.html">From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt</a></b>,<br>
 by Ken Weinstein and August Stofferahn<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1094, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at The Heritage Foundation, and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant at the Government Reform Project, examine organized labor's use of compulsory membership dues to finance their leadership's political agenda. An activist labor movement was a major force in the last election, and may be the most significant new force in American politics. However, Weinstein and Stofferahn point out, much of labor's new agenda has nothing to do with workplace issues, is not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and is outside of the mainstream of American politics. In the past few decades, organized labor has moved from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful, high-spending lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Weinstein and Stofferahn document labor's move to the left. They illustrate how organized labor has come to be dominated by government employee unions, instead of the traditional industry-based unions. Specifically, they show how the AFL-CIO have drastically departed from American Federation of Labor founder, Samuel Gompers', rule of separating labor from partisan politics. Organized labor has recently taken stances on issues that have nothing to do with collective bargaining and workplace conditions. For example, in 1995 the Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO led a campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Organized labor leadership has also taken stances on abortion, racial and gender preferences, welfare and the federal budget. This paper also goes into detail about the epitome of labor's leftward shift and blatant political partisanship, the National Education Association. In their conclusion, Weinstein and Stofferahn, point out that politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues. They argue that unions should not finance their political activities with compulsory membership dues. The
re is judicial precedent from the 1988 Supreme Court Case <I>Communication Workers of America v. Beck</I>, that declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>What About the Religious Left? Politics  Motivates and Bankrolls The Interfaith Alliance, Americans United Works to Keep Religion Out of Public Square</b>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<p>
In recent years the mainstream media has thoroughly covered the "religious right," often times generously quoting those eager to bash them, and implying that their rising influence may corrupt the American political system. <I>Organization Trends</I> points out that left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. This issue focuses on two groups, the Interfaith Alliance (TIA), and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. Calling itself a "faith-based" group, TIA engages in the same activism with similar methods as the Christian Coalition. The Interfaith Alliance distributed the same type of voter guides that earned the Christian Coalition criticism for excessive religious influence. Yet, TIA's guides, which ranked liberal candidates better, caused no such outcry. This 501(c)(4) organization was started with Democratic party money, and a look at the organization's leadership and activities uncovers its position clearly within the left of the political and cultural spectrum. This issue also covers the activities of another group having to do with religion and public life, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. TIA, a self-proclaimed "mainstream faith-based" group, is ironically allied with this group that is dedicated to eradicating the public expression of religion. In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to deter churches from distributing Christian Coalition voter guides, and warning churches that doing so could threaten their tax-exempt status. The issue concludes by observing that TIA apparently has no agenda of its own, other than bashing the Christian Coalition. TIA is most often quoted in the media as a "religious" organization denouncing the Christian Coalition. The author suggests that the liberal left only has a use for TIA because of the activism of religious conservatives. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005,

<b>The Adoption Option: Compassion that Works</b>,<br>
 by Ken Connor and Camille Godwin<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 7, Foundation for Florida's Future<hr>
<p>
Ken Connor, Chairman of the Board of Care Net, which represents the largest network of crisis pregnancy centers in North America, and Camille Godwin, an attorney in Tallahassee, FL, promote the option of adoption in the situation of a "crisis pregnancy." They argue that adoption can be a "win-win" situation for the people affected. The child gains a loving, stable and secure home, the adopting parents win by becoming parents of the child for whom they have longed, and the biological parents obtain the relief from the burdens of an unexpected or unwanted child. Connor and Godwin say that this makes it in the public interest to encourage and facilitate the adoption process. They discuss the current adoption procedures in the State of Florida, the obstacles to adoption, and the disadvantages of foster care. Connor and Godwin put forth several legislative and public policy suggestions to improve the adoption and foster care system: streamline judicial proceedings, increase access to information about adoption, reduce the financial obstacles for prospective parents, remove race as an obstacle to adoption, promote community-based responses to adoption and foster care issues, and encourage employer-based initiatives to promote adoption. They conclude by arguing that adoption must become a priority public policy issue. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<hr><p>
<dd>The cover story of this issue, <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/shokraii.html">"Free at Last: Black America Signs Up for School Choice</a>," by Nina Shokraii, examines the growing support for school choice amongst African-Americans. Most black political leaders actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, yet their constituents are looking more and more to options other than decaying public schools ---which have a disasterous record of teaching black children. Shokraii, Director of Outreach Programs at the Institute for Justice, documents the school choice movements in black communities in Milwaukee and Cleveland, and charter school movements in California and Michigan. It is quite evident that standards, discipline, and parental involvement of private or charter schools are bringing more black parents to fight for schools choice. Shokraii concludes that school choice and charter schools are becoming the civil rights movement of the 1990s. This issue also includes the following articles: <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/symp.html">"Welfare Reform: Can the States Fly Solo?"</a> by Eloise Anderson, Vance McMahan, Don Taylor and Jason Turner; <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/lungren.html">"Three Cheers for Three Strikes</a>," by California Attorney General Dan Lungren; and <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/radan.html">"The Freshman's First Principles</a>," by Rep.

<B><I>Crisis</I></B><br>
Novemember 1996<hr><p>
<dd>
A notable article in this month's issue of <I>Crisis</I> discusses the bad economics of the pastoral letter of America's Catholic bishops, <I>Economic Justice for All</I>. Michael Joyce, President and CEO of the Bradley Foundation, contrasts <I>Economic Justice for All</I> with Pope John Paul II's <I>Centesimus Annus</I>. At the core of the comparison is how the respective writings proscribe ways to help those in need. Joyce points out the bishop's pastoral has much to say about the needy, but nothing to say to them. The letter calls for "an economy that truly respects persons," and even proposes measures to be taken by government as specific as a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Act. It calls for reforming social sytems in order to secure dignity for the needy, yet it never lists an action or task for the needy themselves. Joyce argues that <I>Centesimus Annus</I> cannot be read without a clear sense that the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is not quite so subordinate. While the Pope acknowledges that there is a need for political, economic, social, and cultural commitment to the poor, he maintains that the decisive commitment must be made within the heart and conscience of the human person and not depend on asking government or other institution to solve the problem. 60 pp.  CONTACT: 800/852-9962.

<B>Competitive Enterprise Institute</B><HR>

<P>
In October, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a First Amendment challenge to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' (ATF) ban on statements concerning the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements. A substantial body of research has shown that moderate alcohol consumption significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in adults. While these findings are now widely accepted and have been incorporated into the federal government's new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ATF still prohibits their inclusion on products or advertisements.
<p>
CEI had petitioned ATF in 1995 to allow such statements, and included the following suggested language: "There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease." ATF did not respond to the petition. Consumer Alert, a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in the free flow of information to its members and a supporter of the CEI petition, is also a party.
<p>
CEI is relying on an extensive body of Supreme Court precedent protecting so-called commercial speech. Most recently, two Court decisions, <I>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.</i> and <I>44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island</I>, held that information on alcoholic beverage labels and ads is protected by the First Amendment against government restrictions.

<b>Flooding Farm Reveals Government Double Standard</b>
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is guilty of using double standards when it comes to its dealings with small farmer Roy James, according to Defenders. Mr. James's farm abuts the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (Tyrrell County, North Carolina). A drainage problem in the refuge causes the farm to flood. Due to the flooding, Mr. James loses at least 40% of the productivity of his farm every year, and suffers further losses from erosion and the cost of paying to have the water pumped off the land. FWS admits to causing the flooding, but simply refuses to resolve the problem.
<p>
Mr. James offered to exchange land with FWS, but FWS declined because the land "does not have significant enough wildlife values to be advantageous." So after two years of flooding, Mr. James had the U.S. Soil Conservation Service draw up specifications for a dike. He built the dike with some fill from the refuge land. Ironically, when the government's land was physically invaded, FWS took immediate action, threatening to sue Mr. James for damages. In fact, Mr. James was forced to compensate the federal government in order to avoid litigation, but has yet to receive a dime from the government for its years-long physical invasion of his land. Defenders is now representing Mr. James seeking damages on his behalf.
<p>
<b>Last Developer in Is a "Rotten Egg"</b>
<p>
A wetland designation by the Army Corps of Engineers has derailed investment-backed expectations of the owners of industrial-zoned property in Centerville, Utah, leaving a handful of property owners with no economically beneficial or productive use of their property.
<p>
The land at issue was purchased by several investors in the early 1970's. The local government zoned the area industrial and encouraged its development as an industrial park. By pooling their resources, the landowners built public roads and other infrastructure, and began to develop their individual lots. After half the lots were develop and Mr. Smith began developing his lot, the Army Corps ordered him to cease because the land, according the government, is now "wetland."
<p>
In fact, however, Mr. Smith's dry land is only wet when rain water runs off the adjacent developed parcels onto his undeveloped parcel. Now that the parcel has been declared a wetland, Mr. Smith faces the unfair reality of not being able to make any beneficial or productive us of his property.
<p>
<b>Sales Contract Canceled Due to Government Interference</b>
<p>
Anyone who still claims that wetland designations do not diminish land values should look closely at the case of <I>Robbins v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</I>. In 1976, Mrs. Robbins purchased as investment property, 34 acres in Paris, Tennessee to fund her retirement. The land is zoned commercial and lies along the main highway leading to the "Lands Between the Lakes" Park, a popular national tourist destination. Following her husband's death in 1994, Mrs. Robbins decided to sell the property. She had no problem finding a buyer, and the parties executed a sales contract. The purchaser deposited one third of the sales price in escrow to secure the purchase.
<p>
Three days later, the buyer canceled the contract because unbeknownst to Mrs. Robbins, the land is now deemed "wetland." In spite of the fact that the property is surrounded by commercial building and directly abuts a highway, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the property exhibits the characteristics of federal jurisdictional wetlands.
<p>
Mrs. Robbins has asked Defenders to seek compensation for the property on her behalf. Her just compensation claim is based on the fact that the federal wetlands delineation interfered with her contract for sale, reduced the property to nominal value, and destroyed its development potential and marketability.
<p>
<b>97% Open Space Is Not Enough</b>
<p>
Teton County, Wyoming is 97% public land, consisting of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and state lands. Only 3% of the county is privately owned: 1.5% is held by large ranchers and 1.5% (the only developable land in the county) is held by landowners whose families typically hold the land to subdivide for future generations.
<p>
Michael Shidner is one of those property owners. He owns 35 acres, which he planned to divide three ways. Under the latest Teton county comprehensive plan, however, Mr. Shidner will  not be able to subdivide unless he places a conservation easement over 70% of his property. In addition, he must agree to cluster the homes, since the area is considered winter habitat for endangered species.
<p>
Defenders will argue in a lawsuit that the permit conditions violate the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, which requires conditions to be "roughly proportional" to the burden created by the proposed us of the property. The permit condition faced by Mr. Shidner far exceed the burden that a few homes would create in a county that is already 97% open space.

<b>Religious School Choice in Vermont</b>
<p>
On August 26, 1996, IJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Chittenden Town School District against the Vermont Department of Education and its commissioner. The Department had denied general state aid to the District because it was prepared to pay tuition to a religious high school among other schools its students attend. (Vermont towns that have no public high schools send all their students to whatever school, public or private, their parents choose.) The issue is whether religious schools can be included in the tuition program.
<p>
The District withdrew its preliminary injunction request and agreed not to pay tuition to the religious schools until it received a favorable ruling from the Superior Court. The Department agreed to send the aid to the District and expedited discovery in the case. The judge stated he would issue his ruling quickly after discovery and briefings were complete. IJ hopes for a declaratory judgment in the District's favor this fall.

<b>Landmark Continues Milwaukee School Choice Defense</b>
<p>
Representing State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams and low income families, Landmark Legal Foundation continues its defense of the Amended Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The amended program allows families access to religious private schools under the nation's first school choice plan, which Landmark successfully defended in 1991 and 1992. Landmark, joined by other school choice advocates, recently filed papers asking a Wisconsin state court judge to declare the amended program constitutional. The judge likely will rule against the religious school access provision, however, and the issue is certain to be determined in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, hopefully prior to the 1997-98 school year.
<p>
<b>Landmark to Appeal Ruling on State-Created Insurance Company</b>
<p>
Landmark Legal Foundation will ask the Missouri Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a Missouri state-subsidized insurance company. Representing Casualty Reciprocal Exchange ("CRE"), Landmark will tell the Court that the Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company ("MEMIC") also unfairly competes with private insurance companies and is a risk to taxpayers because of important financial reserve requirements from which it was exempted by Missouri Director of Insurance Jay Angoff, also a defendant in the lawsuit.
<p>
MEMIC, in its most recent quarterly report, disclosed that it underestimated its 1995 year-end losses and related expenses by more than $11,000,000. 
<p>
MEMIC was created in 1993 by the legislature, which provided MEMIC a $5 million taxpayer-financed loan for the company's startup capital. MEMIC also was given the authority to revenue bonds for additional capitalization -- both in direct violation of Missouri's Constitutional provisions prohibiting the use of state funds for private loans and investment.

The landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc v. Pena</I>, won by MSLF on June 12, 1995, has reached the final stage before the Colorado federal district court. The Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado after it "alter(ed) the playing field" regarding the standard to be used in reviewing race-based decision making by Congress. Overturning two earlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that the "strict scrutiny" standard applies to Congress. With the completion of briefing by both parties, the case is scheduled for oral argument on December 20.

<b>Michigan Property Owners Seek Supreme Court Review</b>
<p>
Two lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court holding left undisturbed by the 7-7 split of the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <I>Stupak-Thrall, et al. v. United States of America, et al</I>., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) denied two lake front property owners the right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake, as Michigan law permits them. This despite the language of applicable federal law that "valid existing rights" are protected. On behalf of the property owners, who MSLF have represented since they first filed their lawsuit, MSLF sought Supreme Court review asserting that the USFS has rendered the "valid existing rights" language "meaningless" and that the federal government's use of the Property Clause to regulate private property is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
<p>
<b>Babbitt's Park Service Goes Back to Drawing Board</b>
<p>
After MSLF's victory on behalf of commercial climbers, the National Park Service (NPS) has obtained the permission of the Wyoming federal district court to return to the drawing board to determine how it may implement President Clinton's Executive Order regarding regulating federal land for Native American religions. MSLF had obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the NPS from closing Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming to commercial climbing. Regardless of the NPS decision, MSLF will return to court to seek damages for its client and to prevent other Establishment Clause violations within the Monument.

<b>Clinton Plan to Empty Idaho Reservoir in Jeopardy</b>
<p>
The National Marine and Fisheries Service plan to empty a reservoir in northern Idaho, ostensibly to "save" the salmon was dealt a blow in federal district court when the court requested further briefing on whether the specific statute creating the dam controlled over the general Endangered Species Act (ESA). The controversy is in Clearwater County, Idaho, where the government is seeking to drain a reservoir created by Congress for power generation, recreation, and timber transport. The government says those purposes are subservient to the command of the ESA.

<b>Local Law Enforcement Conscripted into Federal Service</b>
<p>
Named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, the Brady Act requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on gun buyers during that period to determine whether there is any legal reason to stop the sale. Theoretically, this law addresses the salutary purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be robbers and murderers. But in reality, the Brady Act goes far beyond that purpose and conscripts local law enforcement officers into federal service, forcing them to compromise their local responsibilities by engaging in time-consuming, costly, and futile paper work for the federal government. What is more, no financial reimbursement is made.
<p>
Background checks under Brady go beyond felons. The law also applies to anyone who may be "otherwise prohibited by law from buying a gun." That means local sheriffs and chiefs of police must search through medical records to determine if a gun buyer has ever been committed to a mental institution or is an illegal drug user who has evaded arrest. Law enforcement officers must also check the records of fugitives, dishonorable military discharges and expatriate citizens. Civil court records must also be checked for restraining orders imposed on spouses in domestic relations cases. As if impressing local officers into federal service was not enough, the law includes an unconscionable provision that could subject them to fine or imprisonment or both for failing to make a "reasonable effort" to complete the work for the federal government.
<p>
The Brady Act's unfunded mandate was the "last straw" for Ravalli County, Montana, Sheriff Jay Printz and Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff Richard Mack, both of whom are being shut into their offices and tied to their desks to complete the background check requirement. These law enforcement officials would much rather devote their resources to protecting the citizens than doing bureaucratic paper work-of questionable efficacy-for the federal government.
<p>
Both Sheriffs Printz and Mack sued and won trial court rulings striking down that position of the Brady Act requiring background checks. In both cases, the lower courts agreed that the law illegally commandeered local officials for a federal program. However, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions ruling that the Brady law's background check requirement is constitutional and its intrusion upon state sovereignty minimal. The sheriffs' appeals are now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Legal Foundation is arguing that the federal government has no constitutional authority to force local law enforcement officers to carry out a mandate that materially impairs their ability to serve the local citizens whom they were hired to protect.
<p>
<b>Farmers Forced to Advertise Competitor's Products</b><br>
<I>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc.</I>
<p>
According to Thomas Jefferson, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical." So why does Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc., a peach and nectarine grower in California, pay lots of hard-earned money to help pay for a generic advertising message that says its competitors' fruits are as good as its own? Because the federal government is forcing this grower to.
<p>
Government "marketing boards," which essentially are agriculture cartels made up of farmers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have vast discretionary powers and can punish farmers who don't abide by their edicts. One of the boards' dubious functions is to force farmers to subsidize generic advertisements that extol the virtues of certain commodities in general. Remember the dancing raisins, "Got Milk?" and "It's the Cheese" ads? Such campaigns were financed through mandatory fees paid by individual growers. According to <i>Forbes</i> magazine, commodity boards for agricultural products have raked in over $750 million a year from U.S. farmers through coerced contributions. (The government pays out an additional $90 million of taxpayers' money for overseas promotions.) In California, about 50 such boards collect some $125 million from growers yearly.
<p>
Where do government bureaucrats get the idea in the first place that it is their job to tell business owners how to promote their own products? Forcing producers of agricultural commodities to pay for generic commercial ads is antithetical to the principle of free market enterprise. It is also a blatant violation of the constitutional free speech right not to be forced to pay for messages with which one disagrees. This is why Pacific Legal Foundation is helping Wileman Brothers & Elliot challenge the government's mandatory fee program in the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to federal regulations and marketing orders, Wileman must pay an assessment for a generic advertising program with which it disagrees. Moreover, the payments reduce Wileman's ability to pursue its own individual advertising program.
<p>
PLF argued to the U.S. Supreme Court last week to strike down the government's "marketing order" that assesses small farmers to pay for government-concocted advertising programs.

<b>Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Parents' Rights Case</b>
<p>
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case that could have a considerable impact on parents' rights. In <i>M.L.B. v. S.L.J.</i>, the court will consider whether a state court can condition an appeal for the termination of parents' rights on their ability to pay court costs in excess of $2,000.00.
<p>
In the case, a Mississippi lower court terminated a mother's parental rights to her 7 and 9-year-old children. She appealed the case to the state Supreme Court but could not afford to pay the costs involved. The court refused to waive the fee and dismissed her case. The Supreme Court must now decide if parents' rights are, in fact, fundamental liberties.
<p>
<b>California's Policy Restricting Employees' Religious Expression Unconstitutional Says Ninth Circuit</b>
<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a California state agency's policy against religious advocacy and display of religious artifacts is unconstitutional. The ruling reverses the finding of the lower court.
<p>
The Rutherford Institute represented state employee Monte Tucker, who placed "By Monte Tucker, SOTLJC" in a computer screen program he designed. The acronym stands for "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ." Tucker's supervisor threatened him with suspension if he refused to remove the acronym. The department then issued a policy forbidding religious advocacy during work hours and storage or display of any religious artifacts except n closed offices.
<p>
<b>The Rutherford Institute to File Class Action Suit Against Dept. Of Health 
and Human Services</b>
<p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a class action lawsuit against Donna Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services for allowing county officials to profit from depriving disabled foster children of their rightful monies.
<p>
The suit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Service has violated federal law by failing to follow the Social Security Act's mandates to ensure that foster children receive their rightful benefits. This policy has in essence encouraged Contra Costa County to prevent handicapped children from being adopted in order to keep funds intended for foster children. The suit claims that he violations occurring in Contra Costa County are indicative of foster care in other counties nationwide.

<p>
<b>Commercial Free Speech Defended</b>
<p>
In <I>AAA v. Kessler</I>, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of advertising groups challenging the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations of tobacco advertising, WLF filed a brief arguing that the regulations imposed by FDA violated the First Amendment rights of advertisers and the adult public. FDA's regulations, announced on August 28, 1996, and set to begin taking effect in early 1997, impose sweeping restrictions on tobacco advertising, including: (1) requiring black and white, text-only advertisements in all media, i.e., billboards, print media, point of purchase, and direct mail, except on those locations or print media that are "adult-only;" (2) prohibiting billboards within 1000 feet of schools or play areas, effectively eliminating all billboards in urban areas; and (3) banning the use of any tobacco brand name in sponsoring any cultural, sporting, or musical event, and on all types of secondary product, such as t-shirts, umbrellas, lighters, etc. WLF argued that the regulations are unlawful because the government has available to it several obvious and non-speech related methods to attack the problem of youth smoking. Moreover, even if some restrictions on advertising could be lawful, the broad and sweeping restrictions imposed by FDA are not "narrowly tailored" to the harm they were intended to address and would primarily restrict the free speech rights of adults. FDA cannot properly, for example, ban the use of tobacco brand names to sponsor all sporting or cultural events when many of these events have minimal, if any, children in attendance. WLF's clients on the brief include race car drivers, Mario Andretti, Don Garlits, Al Unser, Rusty Wallace, and Cale Yarborough, U.S. Representatives Richard Burr, Cass Ballenger, Howard Coble, and David Funderburk, and U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth.
<p>
<b>Excessive Antitrust Penalty Challenged</b>
<p>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit arguing that a $10 million fine imposed on a family-owned bakery company that kept its bread prices below the national average during the relevant period should be set aside as grossly excessive and unlawful. In <i>United States v. Mrs. Baird's Bakeries</i>, the evidence was undisputed that, during the time of the alleged pricing conspiracy, Mrs. Baird's bakery held prices steady and, indeed, even reduced its prices on several occasions. Despite this, Texas federal Judge Jerry Buchmeyer imposed the maximum statutory fine, one of the largest antitrust fines in U.S. history. Mrs. Baird's is now in bankruptcy. In its brief, WLF argued that there was little evidence of price fixing, and that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the maximum fine.
<p>
<b>Objection to HUD's Rulemaking</b>
<p>
WLF filed formal comments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requesting that HUD immediately rescind an interim rule that would abolish the right of respondents in fair housing complaint proceedings to obtain discovery from witnesses and the complaining party. The interim rule is procedurally and substantively defective on a number of grounds. HUD flagrantly violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and its own policy by not publishing the interim rule as a proposed rule for public comment. WLF also took strong objection to HUD's primary rationale for abolishing rights of respondents, namely that it would expedite the investigation process. WLF research discovered that the main cause of delay is <i>agency</i> inefficiency; it takes HUD, on average, 53 days from the time a housing complaint is filed until HUD even <i>begins</i> an investigation.

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Ethics and Public Policy Center will sponsor a lecture series to examine "The Impact of Religious Conviction on the Politics of the 21st Century." All lectures will be held at SAISin Washington. The purpose of the series is to assess evidence of a worldwide resurgence in religious belief and to reflect on the implications of such a development at the end of the current millennium. Specifically, the project will address the following questions: What are the origins of the revival of religious fervor at the end of the 20th Century? How far and how long will this revival go? What are the chief elements of the critique of the secular order mounted by the various religions and ethical traditions enjoying a resurgence of popularity? To what degree are the religion-based critques rooted in common assumptions and compatible responses to the perceived shortcomings of secularity? What are the implications of this phenomenon particularly as they relate to international politics: prospects of war and peace, economic development, and the definition of human rights and social justice?

<TITLE>Third Wave of Think Tanks -- October 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>October, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Wave of Think Tanks<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>


<P>
<dd> Tip O'Neill once said &quot;All politics is local.&quot; He was
correct, but failed to mention an important corollary, that all
policy is local too. That's why we have formed the Allegheny Institute
for Public Policy -- the nation's first think tank devoted exclusively
to bringing free market solutions to local government.
<P>
<dd> Market oriented think tanks have come in three distinct waves.
In the 1970s, they began operating in Washington and laying the
intellectual groundwork for the Reagan revolution. In the 1980s,
in keeping with Reagan's revived spirit of federalism, conservative-movement
dollars and energies started working in the states as well. Intellectual
capital was &quot;block granted,&quot; as a number of entrepreneurial
policy analysts left Washington to found the second wave of policy
research groups. These state-based think tanks went on to provide
the intellectual infrastructure for the reinvention of state governments
in places like Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin, Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania,
Bill Weld's Massachusetts, and John Engler's Michigan. These groups
put welfare reform, charter schools and school choice on the public
policy map.
<P>
<dd> The time has come for a third wave -- the formation of locally-oriented
think tanks.  As dollars devolve from Washington to local governments,
taxpayer accountability should devolve as well. It would be ironic
if at the same time sound economic principles are revived in Washington,
that government programs might avoid accountability to these principles
by escaping to local bureaucracies still mired in the 1960s model
of big government.
<P>
<dd> Even before the devolution revolution, more dollars were spent
by local governments than by states or the federal government.
As devolution progresses this will become more true. Even federal
and state programs are frequently administered by local governments,
or by local subdivisions. Domestic government programs are ultimately
applied at the local level.
<P>
<dd> Although the Allegheny Institute is the first of this third wave
of local policy advocacy, it is unlikely to be the last. After
less than one year in business, we were approached by a group
from California interested in forming a similar organization modeled
after the Allegheny Institute. Due to the hard work of founder
Don Blake and others, and a little guidance from us, California
now has the benefit of the Table Mountain Institute near Sacramento.
Requests for help in starting local think tanks have come from
other places even farther away than Sacramento-Nigeria and Italy
for example. In addition we have received requests for advice
from several state think tanks that wish to start local policy
projects in their home states. Furthermore, our ideas have been
cited by all three local network television affiliates, all the
local radio news outlets and talk shows, and the local newspapers,
as well as the CBS radio network, and national newspapers such
as <I>USA Today</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
 <dd>Why all the attention? It has come largely because of our close
involvement in the restructuring of the government of Pittsburgh's
Allegheny County. This county, the second largest local government
between New York and Chicago, was under the rule of liberals for
over 60 years. In the last election, two conservatives won on
a privatization and deregulation platform. The crown jewel of
their platform was a 20% tax cut their first day in office.
<P>
<dd> The only way to make large tax cuts that work is to force the
bureaucracy to compete with the private sector to see who can
achieve the most efficient service delivery. This form of privatization
is sometimes called managed competition. Drawing upon research
by the Reason Foundation, we have published extensive research
on the benefits of privatization. In fact, there are over a dozen
privatization initiatives being implemented right now in Allegheny
County, including the only privatization of a property-assessments
department in the country and the first full privatization (sale)
of an airport in U.S. history.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about privatization, but about harnessing markets
in other ways. We are engaged in the creation of a pilot program
for electricity de-regulation. We estimate that a full-scale electric
utility consumer choice program could add 5 or 6% to the regional
domestic product. In addition, we are working with the county
economic development department to quantify the amount of burden
placed on the economy by local government, with a view toward
a streamlined business-friendly permitting process.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about markets either, it's also about culture.
Working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise we are helping to shift social service programs from
the political society to the civil society, to remove a permissive,
redistributive, liberal, social-service bureaucracy and replace
it with a flexible, results-oriented, low-cost provider network.
<P>
 <dd>Less a &quot;think tank&quot; and more a &quot;do tank,&quot;
the Allegheny Institute is taking the conservative intellectual
revolution to the laboratory of real life. Not satisfied with
having produced 30 full-length reports (and 40 editions of our
Newsfax) in our first year and a half of operations, the Allegheny
Institute has set out to prove not only that &quot;ideas have
consequences,&quot; but that <I>conservative</I> ideas actually
work at the local level.

<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1092, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Sweeney argues that since Mexico's
economic meltdown in 1994, both the Clinton Administration and
the 104th Congress have allowed America's once-respected leadership
role in Latin America to erode. The Administration and the Congress
have been reluctant to put expansion of NAFTA on the fast track
and instead have allowed the tremendous foreign policy successes
of the Reagan and Bush administrations to fall apart. If this
retreat is allowed to continue, writes Sweeney, U.S. economic
and security interests in the region could suffer a &quot;sustained
decline.&quot; 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<P>
Joshua Muravchik, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, argues that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy
is misguided and that this has lead to the erosion of American
military supremacy. According to Muravchik, Clinton's foreign
policy has been a &quot;jumble of improvised responses to crises
and to foreign and domestic political pressures and calculations
of electoral advantage.&quot; The author writes that Clinton nearly
doubled his proposed defense cuts so he could appear to look like
he is reducing the budget deficit, while not having to reduce
domestic spending. A symbol of Clinton's low priority given to
defense is his order for sharp reductions in the development of
strategic defenses. Muravchik also argues that Clinton's policy
with China, North Korea, Serbia, and Somalia, have substantially
hurt America's credibility abroad. Overall, Muravchik concludes,
Clinton's tenure as Commander and Chief has narrowed the wide
margin of security that came about with the demise of America's
Cold War rival. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute,

<B>The World Bank's Procurement Myth, <BR>
</B>by John Thibodeau
<P>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 43, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
John Thibodeau, Director of Research at Probe International, a
Canadian environmental group, reports that the World Bank's soft-loan
window, the International Development Association (IDA), is losing
many contributions due to its failed projects and the bank's increasingly
risky loan portfolio. The United States recently decided not to
contribute any new money to IDA in 1997, with any future funding
beyond that uncertain. Thibodeau argues that the World Bank has
launched a misleading public relations campaign to convince Congress
and the American public that U.S. taxpayers' contributions to
IDA are beneficial to the American economy. The World bank says
that such contributions are returned in the form of contracts
for U.S. companies. In reality, Thibodeau points out, U.S. firms
receive only about $0.23 in contracts for each $1.00 the United
States contributes to IDA. The IDA gets billions of taxpayer dollars
for bad projects and pork-barrel contracts for a few American
firms. Thibodeau concludes that Congress and lawmakers from other
donor countries should see through the World Bank's desperate
attempt to seek more funds and refuse to waste their constituent's
tax dollars on IDA in 1997 and beyond. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute,

<B>The Innovation Age: A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution,

<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Peter Pitsch, Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and the
former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications
Commission, shows why the United States cannot maintain its preeminent
position in information technology unless it reforms a number
of outdated regulatory restraints. Pitsch shows how artificial
regulations on a market, such as telecommunications, stifles the
progress and productivity that innovations were designed to stimulate.
Pitsch illustrates the superiority of a market-based approach
to regulation, and uses the theories of Austrian school economists
Hayek and Schumpeter to point out the flaws of planned economies.
Overall, Pitsch creates a positive image of what the future can
hold with an open-road policy toward the telecom industry. 120

<B>Lights Out on Federal Power: Privatization for the 21st Century,
</B><br>
by Michael Block and Rep. John Shadegg
<P>
<I>Future Insight</I>, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation<HR>

<P>
Michael Block, Senior Fellow at the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
and John Shadegg, United States Congressman from Arizona, urge
the privatization of federally owned power facilities. Power Marketing
Administrations (PMAs) were created during the New Deal to provide
a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas. Block
and Shadegg argue that demographic changes since the 1930s mean
that many of the areas deemed in need of subsidized power are
no longer rural or undeveloped. They argue that PMAs force taxpayers
to provide subsidized power to the rich, and they distort and
hinder competition and productivity in the electric energy market.
Block and Shadegg outline how the federal government should sell
three PMAs. Selling off this large source of frozen assets would
generate nearly $4.5 billion, and help reduce the budget deficit.
Finally, to overcome interest-group oppostion to PMA privatization,
they propose that the current consumers of PMA power be given
the option to purchase shares in the newly privatized PMAs. 7

<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, <BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, CEI Fellow in Regulatory Studies, illustrates
that compliance with federal regulations, which are officially
off-budget, have quietly expanded into costs greater than the
entire GNP of Canada. According to Crews, regulatory costs absorb
almost 20% of the average family's after-tax budget. Politicians
can avoid accountability for more expenses to taxpayers by passing
mandates and regulations that transfer costs to business and consumers
and are not reflected in the budget. Crews warns that a Balance
Budget Amendment may pressure Congress to push even further regulations
that put costs off-budget. He calls for Congress to establish
rules that new agency regulations require Congressional approval,
and to establish a limited regulatory budget. Overall, Crews calls
for making regulatory costs as transparent as direct taxes, and
ensuring that Congress bears direct accountability for every dollar
that agency regulations cost voters. 23 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>A Revolution in Regulation: New York Must Treat Employers as
Customers to Compete for the Growth and Jobs We Need</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
New York's regulatory bureaucracy is a primary reason that the
state has an image of being hostile to business-and a record of
losing jobs to other locations. In addition to the hassle of overwhelming
amounts of red tape, these regulations can hurt or even shut down
businesses by imposing prohibitive fees, fines and taxes. Employers
must be treated as customers if New York is to compete for the
jobs and growth it needs, according to the Public Policy Institute.
The Institute recommends several steps to achieve regulatory reform,
arguing that key draft regulations should be rewritten before
they become additional burdens to companies. Also, needless regulatory
costs imposed by the Labor Department and the workers' compensation
system should be eliminated. Overall, the report recommends the
laws that limit the powers and responsibilities of regulators
should be enforced, and innovative use of new technologies to
achieve regulatory goals should be allowed to happen. 67 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Regulatory Costs in Profile, </B><br>
by Thomas Hopkins
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 132, Center for the Study of <BR>
American Business<HR>

<P>
Thomas Hopkins, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of
American Business, illustrates the vast extent of regulatory costs
in virtually every segment of the U.S. economy. 60 different federal
agencies enact and enforce countless regulations that result in
hidden compliance costs of $668 billion annually. In this book,
Hopkins presents estimates of annual private-sector compliance
costs with federal regulation for 1977 through 2000, and focuses
on the differences in compliance costs among firms. The figures
show that regulatory compliance costs facing all U.S. businesses
rose by $10 billion or more annually in the four years ending
in 1992 after a decade in which such costs generally moved downward.
With the figures presented in this book, Hopkins hopes to bring
a better understanding of the scope and incidence of compliance
costs to help facilitate a more rational debate about the role
and effects of government agency regulations. 25 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Capital Versus Labor? The Dubious Economics of Class Conflict,
</B><br>
by Alan Reynolds
<P>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper</I>, No. 195, Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute,
responds to the recent mood of hostility toward investors, property
owners, and corporate managers in recent press commentary on the
U.S. economy. Such hostility, according to Reynolds, seems to
be an encouragement toward class warfare between &quot;workers&quot;
and &quot;shareholders.&quot; He argues that the data contradicts
the assertions that workers and shareholders are  natural adversaries.
He points out that workers benefit only when productivity increases,
and that productivity depends on capital investment, which depends
on saving. It is punitive tax policies that explain the recent
sluggish productivity growth that has brought stagnation in employee
wages and compensation. Overall, Reynolds argues, the economy
needs more, not less capital, and the only way to end the stagnation
of employee wages is to decrease punitive tax rates against saving
and investing. 9 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center,

<B>An Analysis of the Dole-Kemp Tax Cuts, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Issue Brief</I>, Institute for Policy Innovation<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins, Senior Research Fellows at the
Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the proposed Dole-Kemp
tax cuts. Their analysis finds that the Dole-Kemp plan would boost
the U.S. real growth rate by roughly one-half a percentage point
over the next six years. They scored the proposed tax plan using
both static and dynamic methods. After adjusting for greater incentives
to work, save and invest, the economy, according to Robbins and
Robbins, would be 4.5 percent larger than it would have been without
the tax cuts, and would produce about 2.8 million new jobs. The
growth would offset 35 percent of the $551.3 billion static revenue
loss between 1997 and 2002. A standard distributional analysis
shows that 60 percent of the Dole-Kemp tax cuts would go to taxpayers
earning under $100,000. They also found that although the people
with the lowest 20 percent of incomes pay less than one percent
of federal income taxes, they would receive the greatest percentage
boost of after tax income in higher wages. 16 pp.  CONTACT: The

In 1988, the Washington Research Council made a systematic review
of Washington's state taxes, and found the tax system to be fundamentally
sound. Since then, however, there have been a number of changes
in tax rates and bases. This paper, updates WRC's review of the
state tax system using five criteria: economic neutrality, fairness,
administrative simplicity, transparency, and stability. The report
 also provides a history of Washington's state taxes, including
a list of major tax events from 1889 to the present to show how
the state's tax structure has changed over the years. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Public Subsidies, Private Gain: Stop Violating the Oregon Constitution,
</B><br>
by Professor Dale Rubin
<P>
<I>Fiscal Insight</I>, No. 13, Cascade Policy Institute<HR>

<P>
Dale Rubin, Professor of Law at Willamette University, examines
how public subsidies lead to private gain, and how this procedure
violates the Oregon Constitution. He points out that legislators
explain that public expenditures that directly benefit private
individuals, such as professional sports teams, are legal because
they are extended for a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Rubin argues
that this response is simply wrong. He explains that the Public
Purpose Doctrine was not made in order to provide legislators
an excuse to spend taxpayer dollars on whatever project they choose.
In fact, the Oregon Constitution contains clear and unambiguous
clauses that explicitly prohibit the legislature and political
subdivisions from giving any aid to private individuals or corporations.
Rubin argues that the courts' misuse of the Public Purpose Doctrine
has made it possible for public entities to spend public dollars
on almost any private project despite a specific constitutional
prohibition. Rubin argues that the constitutional provisions prohibiting
the commingling of public and private funds have been rendered
meaningless by modern court decisions. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Cascade

<B>The Prisoners of Charity: Welfare 'Reforms' in New York Have Done Little to Break the Cycle of Dependency</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute finds that welfare reforms in New
York have done too little to break the cycle of dependency of
its recipients. After Congress enacted legislation in 1988 intended
to move welfare recipients into the workforce, New York took an
expensive detour to implement legislation that emphasized &quot;back-to-school&quot;
rather than &quot;back-to-work.&quot; These programs were a failure
and caused the percentage of welfare recipients in the job market
to actually drop. The Public Policy Institute argues that in order
for any welfare-to-work strategy to be successful it, must incorporate
programs that make work pay. They also argue that private sector
jobs need to be made to look more attractive compared to welfare
benefits. While raising the minimum wage reduces the number of
entry level jobs, lowering welfare benefits could send more people
into the shelter system-at a greater cost financially and personally.
Instead, the Institute suggests a &quot;fill-in-the-gap&quot;
approach that allows more wages to be kept before welfare benefits
are reduced. They conclude that overall successful reforms will
begin when it is acknowledged that the poor want to, and can,
take responsibility for their future. The report includes a foreword
by United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 47 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Arizona's Charter Schools: A Survey of Teachers</B>

<I>Arizona Issue Analysis</I> No. 141, Goldwater Institute<HR>

<P>
During the Spring of 1996, the Goldwater Institute conducted its
second annual Charter School Survey. The first survey was directed
at parents. The latest survey was aimed at charter school teachers.
Arizona is home to approximately 30 percent of the nation's 350
charter schools. Approximately 16,000 students will attend such
a school during the 1996-97 school year. The results of this survey
tell a great deal about these charter schools, including teachers,
school and classroom configurations, teaching methods, parental
involvement, and students receiving instruction. Additionally,
the survey describes why educators are choosing to teach in charter
schools and offers a glimpse of charter school organization and
school development. 40 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank

<P>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 16, Pioneer Institute<HR>

<P>
This paper is the transcript of a forum sponsored by the Pioneer
Institute on the state and direction of the Boston Public School
System. The forum included these four panelists: James Peyser,
Executive Director of the Pioneer Institute, and member of the
State Board of Education; Neil Sullivan, Executive Director of
the Boston Private Industry Council; Kristen McCormack, charter
school founder and former head of Federated Dorchester Neighborhood
Houses; and Edwin Melendez, Member of the Boston School Committee,
and Director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute at the University
of Massachusetts/Boston. In the opening remarks given by James
Peyser, the failure of school reform is blamed on the underlying
structural defect of public schools-the monopoly power of school
districts. He also argues that spending priorities have been out
of line. While real per-pupil spending has rise by 53 percent
from 1967 to 1991, only 4 percent of it went to regular education-the
core of schools. He argues that public school education priorities
have been driven by politics rather than the needs of the students,
the desires of parents, or the strategies of educators. Peyser
lays out a plan for structural reform of the Boston Public School
System in which there will be a system of schools, rather than
a unitary school system, that will place parents, students and
educators at the center, and will end the political and bureaucratic
constraints that have made past reform efforts fail. 11 pp. CONTACT:

in School,</a> </B><br>
by Dorothy Hanks
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 120, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dorothy Hanks, Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation,
examines how the Milwaukee School Choice Program, enacted in 1990,
has helped poor children succeed in school. Milwaukee's program
was the nation's first publicly funded school choice program,
and gave low-income parents vouchers to send their children to
private schools. Hanks relays the findings of a recent assessment
of the program by Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of
Houston Center for Public Policy, and Paul E. Petersen of Harvard
University's Program in Education Policy and Governance. Their
study reveals that the reading scores of choice students were
3 to 5 percentile points higher in their third and fourth years,
respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school
students. On math scores, Greene and Petersen found that choice
students were 5 and 12 percentile point higher for the third and
fourth years respectively. Hanks explains, in detail, how the
study was performed, and how it corrected the methodological errors
of previous studies on the subject of school choice. She also
lists a number of other bodies of research that back up the Houston-Harvard
analysis on the value of private schools among urban poor and
minority students. In the conclusion, Hanks emphasizes that the
success of Milwaukee school choice is now a matter of record,
and that it is time for state legislators and members of Congress
to allow low-income children to escape the failing urban public
schools. 5 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

Despite the presence of serious flaws in current environmental
laws, conservatives have failed to develop a coherent vision of
how these laws ought to be reformed, writes John Shanahan, Environmental
Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the debate
about reform usually results in conservatives being falsely characterized
as &quot;anti-environmental.&quot; Shanahan offers an examination
of how conservative critics of our existing environmental policy
can better emphasize the good intentions of present law, and at
the same time, argue for elimination of the sometimes senseless
and oppressive regulations that burden the economy. He shows how
liberal policies have brought little in return for exorbinant
costs, and calls for tapping into the powerful forces and positive
incentives of the market and property ownership-incentives that
reward responsible behavior. Shanahan concludes that Americans
can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously
increasing economic freedom and growth. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris

<B>The Cross and the Rain Forest: A Critique of Radical Green

<P>
Robert Whelan, Assistant Director of the Health and Welfare Unit
of the Institute of Economic Affairs, Joseph Kirwan, a Catholic
Scholar, and Paul Haffner, a lecturer at Pontifical Lateran University,
examine the religious pitfalls of an unqualified embrace of environmentalism.
The authors recognize the necessity of protecting the environment,
but warn that radical environmentalism is essentially hostile
to the Christian tradition in its views of God, human beings and
animals. The authors challenge the radical environmentalist ideology
and present an alternative Christian ecology. 163 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Securities Regulation and the New Law, <BR>

<P>
<I>Briefly</I> No. 1, National Legal Center for the Public Interest
<HR>

<P>
This issue of <I>Briefly</I> focuses on the impact of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The act was passed last
year over the veto of President Clinton, and is aimed at ending
the worst abuses of securities class actions. Included are four
panel speeches discussing different aspects of the Act. The first,
by Edward Yodowitz, a Securities Defense Litigator at Skadden
Arps, discusses proportionate liability, pleadings and motions,
and the safe-harbor provision of the new Act. Next, Mark Gitenstein,
a strategist in the Act's passage, warns about a California ballot-initiative
which threatens to reverse the good done by the Act. Howard Krongard,
former General Counsel of Deloitte &amp; Touche, examines the
impact of the Act on the accountant/client relationship. Finally,
Steven Toll gives a plaintiff's perspective. The transcript of
the discussion session following the panelists prepared remarks
is also included. 34 pp. CONTACT: National Legal Center for the

 <B>Supreme Court Says Government Must Live Up to Its Contracts,
</B>by Herbert Fenster and Hugo Teufel, <I>Legal Backgrounder</I>.
Fenster and Teufel argue that the U.S. Supreme Court's <I>Winstar</I>
decision was a significant victory for all those who contract
with the government. The Court ruled that the government illegally
broke its contract with several savings and loans and ordered
that they be paid damages. 4 pp.

<B>Securities Fraud Proposal Threatens California's Economy,

California Proposition 211 will make it easier to file frivolous
shareholder lawsuits and that it attempts to circumvent the 1995
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Roth explains the damage
that a baseless shareholder securities fraud suit caused his company
and argues that under this proposition many more small businesses
would be subject to legal harassment and forced settlements.

 <B>Era of Big Governments Continues With Scrutiny of Menus,

examines recent actions by the FDA, FTC, and the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia which are likely to change
the way restaurants monitor and make claims about the health or
nutrition-related benefits of their fare. It appears that FDA
and FTC, after focusing their powerful regulatory tools on packaged
foods, are now turning attention to the other major segment of
the food industry, restaurants. 4 pp.

 <B>The FTC's Global Competition Report: Will It Alter Scrutiny

examines a recent Federal Trade Commission staff report on international
competition and discusses what impact it may have on merger review.
As the rate of mergers increases, antitrust regulators have in
turn increased their scrutiny. However, the author points out
that the staff report urges that regulators closely examine the
positive efficiencies the merger creates, and its resulting net
social benefit.  4pp.

 <B>Federal Court Chips Away at the Superfund Monolith, </B>by
Seth Jaffe, <I>Legal Backgrounder</I>. Jaffe analyzes a federal
district court decision that refused to impose liability on  a
company that had contributed to a hazardous waste site. The court
ruled in this manner because the defendant's waste was not the
substance requiring, under the Superfund law, that the site be
cleaned up. Such a rational approach to Superfund, the author
argues, should be affirmed and follow in other cases. pp.

<B>The Political Revolution That Wasn't: Why Term Limits Are Needed
Now More Than Ever, <BR>
</B>by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I>, No. 259, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
The issue of term limits will be on fifteen different state ballots
in November. The initiatives are designed to overturn last year's
Supreme Court decision that voided federal term limits. Doug Bandow,
Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, argues that term limits are
needed, but, that the only way to achieve them is by a constitutional
amendment. Since Congres is unlikely to voluntarily approve one,
Term-limits supporters need to convince 34 states to call for
a convention to draft an appropriate amendment. Bandow believes
that if the states call for a convention that it would encourage
Congress to propose an amendment, in the same way that the Seventeenth
amendment came about.  16 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

Barry Maley, Director of the <I>Taking Children Seriously </I>program
of the Centre for Independent Studies, discusses the importance
of marriage despite the fact that legal, economic and cultural
change makes marriage less necessary and easier to end. In this
paper, Maley looks at ways to give marriage greater legal support
without creating undue obstacles to divorce. He advocates introducing
fault into divorce settlements as a way to indirectly re-enforce
the institution. &quot;Fault&quot; in divorce proceedings is where
one party-for reasons such as violence, substance abuse or child
neglect-is at fault in the marriage and that this should therefore
be taken into account in a divorce settlement. Maley concludes
that this reform would create clear standards of marital conduct
and give incentives for standards to be observed. 32 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Family Autonomy and the Charter of Rights: Protecting Parental
Liberty in a Child-Centered Legal System, </B><br>
by Cindy Silver
<P>
<I>Discussion Paper</I> No. 3, Centre for Renewal in Public Policy<HR>

<P>
Cindy Silver, a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia, examines
family autonomy and the Canadian Charter of Rights. She observes
that a radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of
the family and state has developed. The state is taking an evermore
active role in protecting child rights as defined under the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Silver discusses
the impact on the family of state attempts to both define and
protect &quot;the best interests of the child.&quot; She reviews
certain recent cases that deal with the state superseding parental
rights over a child, and calls for affirming the importance of
the family by, once again, giving explicit recognition within
the Canadian constitution. Finally, she lauds a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that renewed recognition of the family
and provided a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial
polices of the state in cases involving the parent-child relationship.
