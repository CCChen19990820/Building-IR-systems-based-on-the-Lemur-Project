<STRONG><I>Conference on Accelerator-Driven Transmutation
Technologies and Applications</I><BR>
Kalmar, Sweden, 3 June 1996</STRONG></center>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
I am very happy to be given the opportunity to address
the opening of this Conference on Accelerator-Driven
Transmutation Technologies and Applications.
<P>
It is a wonderful time to come to this industrious and
historic part of Sweden. The Conference is also an excellent
demonstration that imaginative and ingenious thinking and
research continues in nuclear science and technology -
undeterred by the fact that the public's and media's current
enchantment is with biotechnology and information technology.
Indeed, although today nuclear weapons are dismantled faster
than the owners can dispose of the fissionable material, a part
of public opinion seems to have made it a creed that almost
anything nuclear - not just weapons - is tantamount to evil. In
the host country of this Conference it is even prohibited by law
to plan or design new nuclear reactors for domestic deployment!
<P>
I am convinced, however, that the dramatic, fascinating
- and in a few cases tragic - chapters that have been written so
far in the world's log book of nuclear science and technology
will be followed by many more chapters. This Conference is
testimony that there is no lack of authors. Chernobyl was not the
end of nuclear history.
<P>
Indeed, at a time when billions of people in the world
need more energy to help them rise from physical toil and poverty
and when a further increase in the use of fossil fuels is
raising serious fears about throwing the world's climate off
balance, how can we but welcome intensified research and
experimentation with all sources of energy - fission, fusion,
renewables - and, for that matter, with a more efficient use of
energy? Don't tell the poor that they should change their
lifestyles! They want nothing rather than changing their
lifestyle - into one that uses drastically more energy!
<P>      
I propose to discuss the potential role of nuclear power
as an energy source in the future perspective and I shall do so
against the background of its past development and current
situation.
<P>   
There is absolutely no doubt that global energy use will
increase sharply in the decades to come. The world population
continues to increase and billions of people, especially in the
developing world, want to live better. We know that especially
the use of electricity - the most versatile secondary energy -
will expand sharply. The World Energy Council forecasts that the
world use of electricity will increase by 50 to 75% by 2020.
Currently countries like Bangladesh and Tanzania use less than
100 kWh per capita and year, while Sweden uses some
15 000 kWh per capita and year. Even so the Swedish use
of electricity is continuing to expand. Who can doubt that other
industrial countries - in Europe and elsewhere - at current
use levels, which are half or less than that of Sweden, will
increase their use of electricity?
<P>
This far there is not much controversy. Nor is there -
in principle - disagreement on the proposition that energy and
electricity should be generated and used in increasingly
efficient ways. Today we can drive twice as far on a litre of
gasoline as we did a few years ago. Light bulbs have been made
that give us the same light as the old ones while using
drastically less electricity. We may also plan and design our
future societies and dwellings in ways that may reduce some
energy use in transportation and heating. Yet, when all this -
and more - is said the degree of optimism varies as to how much
will be saved by individuals and industry and how soon. Although
we can now drive further on a litre of gasoline than earlier, we
have more cars. Although our light bulbs will save fuel, we shall
have more lights. Although district heating will be more
efficient, room temperatures go up and more air conditioning is
used, etc. Certainly there will be a more efficient generation
and use of energy - if the market is allowed to set the prices -
but certainly there will also be a strong increase in energy use.
<P>
It is when we get to the question <I>where</I> the energy and
the electricity is to come from that disagreements intensify.
There are still areas in the world where significant hydro power
can be harnessed. Doing so will evoke some protest, as we have
seen, e.g. in India and China, but much of this remaining
potential - especially in Africa - will no doubt gradually be
exploited. When we approach the respective roles of fossil fuels,
renewables and nuclear power, the disagreements sharpen further.
<P>
Before the world encountered the oil crises and before
it had become aware of major environmental problems, the
<I>cheapest energy</I> was considered the best energy. The
sailing ships, propelled by wind, were replaced by steamers using
coal, because the latter were more economic. And the steam
engines were replaced by combustion engines using oil, because
the latter were more economic. Similarly in cooking and heating,
wood and other biomass have been replaced by coal, oil, gas or
electricity as more economic.
<P>
The arrival of nuclear power was greeted with tremendous
enthusiasm. It promised
highly economic energy - especially electricity. It was
later further welcomed as a response
to fears that the oil supplies might again be
interrupted by political measures and as a response
to the concerns that the oil and gas resources will run
out and that substitutes will need to be
found. Industrially developed countries like France and
Japan, with no oil or gas resources,
concluded that they ought to reduce their dependence on
imported oil and they looked to nuclear
power as a means of diversifying their energy basis and
becoming less dependent on external
energy sources.
<P>
Nuclear power got off to a flying start. By 1980 it
generated 8.4% of the world's electricity. In 1996 it generates
17% - only 2 percent less electricity than all the world's hydro
power. However, already by 1980 the environmental concerns about
<I>wastes</I> from industry and energy generation began to add
new dimensions to the discussion of choice of energy sources. The
acid rains causing damage to forests and lakes were linked to the
burning of fossil fuels and the very long-lived radioactive
wastes of nuclear power caused concern. The result in many
countries was a public unease with both. For nuclear power this
unease was strengthened by the Three Mile Island accident in
1979. Although no release of radioactivity occurred into
the environment, it illustrated the risk of a nuclear core melt.
The Chernobyl accident ten years ago informed the whole world
what the consequences could be of a power reactor accident with
release of radioactivity into the environment, adding public
resistance to nuclear power in many countries.
<P>
During the same period some other important and relevant
developments have taken
place. The construction and operation of nuclear power
have become more expensive as many
new, mostly safety related demands, have continued to be
added by regulators. As simultaneously the world price of fossil
fuels,
including gas, has decreased in real terms,
nuclear's economic competitive edge has been reduced,
neutralized or lost - depending upon what country one talks
about.
<P>
Another factor is increasingly making itself heard,
namely the concern that the carbon
dioxide emissions that are inevitably linked to the
burning of all fossil fuels and that cannot be
neutralized in an economically viable way, may, together
with other gas emissions, e.g.
methane from the fossil gas production and transport,
contribute to a gradual global warming -
a change of climate even within the next 100 years.
<P>
The effects of these various factors have been much
discussed, especially in the
advanced industrialized countries. Neither steps to
expand nuclear power, nor measures which
would increase the burning of fossil fuel, find favour
with voters in most of those States.
Fortunately, in many cases not much new capacity has
been needed in the last decade as an
overcapacity of electricity generation has existed. The
net result for nuclear power has
nevertheless been a gradual stagnation in construction
of plants in the Western industrialized
world.
<P>
In Sweden a referendum in 1980, after TMI, supported a
phasing out of nuclear power but declared that until renewable
sources of energy became available a maximum of 12 reactors
would be permitted to operate. In Austria a referendum in 1978
had the result that a newly built nuclear plant never came into
operation. After the Chernobyl accident a referendum in
Italy led to the closure of the few nuclear plants which were
operating in that country and a halt in the construction of a few
reactors underway. In Switzerland a referendum established a
ten-year moratorium on further nuclear plants. In Belgium
industrial plans for an additional nuclear plant were turned down
by the government and in the Netherlands the government has
refrained from proposing any new nuclear capacity. In Germany,
the UK, Spain, the US, Canada and Finland there has likewise been
a stagnation in nuclear construction - early in the US, later in
the other countries. France is still building more plants, but at
a slow pace. Only in the economically booming East Asia is there
a strong expansion in nuclear power during the last ten years: in
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (China) and China. India and
Pakistan are expanding slowly.
<P>
In the former Soviet Union and in East Europe projects
and plans from the earlier
Communist regimes are in most cases continued. In the
Czech Republic, where large tracts of
land were destroyed by excessive use of coal, the
Temelin plant with two 1000 MW nuclear
reactors is completed, with Western instrumentation put
into the Soviet designed reactors. In
Mochovce, Slovakia is acting similarly regarding two 440
MW plants. Bulgaria might possibly
pursue two 1000 MW reactors at Belene. Romania has
completed one pressurized heavy water
reactor of the Candu type and might build a second - if
resources are found. Ukraine and
Russia are completing many plants under construction and
Russia is planning more plants.
Poland, on the other hand, stopped the construction of
two 440-MW Russian-designed VVER plants at Gdansk.
<P>
In the developing countries interest in the nuclear
option is limited. The high initial
capital requirement is a deterrent factor in many cases
and the stagnation in most of the
technology-exporting countries has probably also a
psychological effect. Brazil may finish the
construction of a second plant and Cuba might finish one
or two. Mexico is already operating
two. Egypt no longer seems to be in a hurry, while Iran
seeks Russian assistance to complete
the building of two reactors that Siemens started to
build long ago in Bushehr. Indonesia discusses a nuclear power
programme but there are no
firm decisions. The same seems to be true for Turkey.
<P>
One country, the IAEA's host country Austria, seems
militantly opposed to nuclear
power, advocating a "nuclear power free zone" in Central
Europe. A few - Denmark, Ireland,
Luxembourg and Norway - seem more passively negative.
Most governments, I think it is fair
to say, are passively favourable. In the face of various
militant anti-nuclear movements and
opinions, the governments generally take a low profile.
They are in holding pattern. Some
political parties - notably green ones - are on the
other hand vocal opponents.
<P>
In view of the stagnation of nuclear power in the
Western industrialized world and the increasing public concern in
these countries about the possible climate effects of an
increased burning of fossil fuels, it is of interest to see what
<I>actually</I> is done to meet the slowly increasing energy
demand in these countries. 
<P>
We find a great deal of talk about the need to reduce
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions - and even a Climate Convention -
through conservation and a greater use of renewables. This has
now for quite some time been the dominant recipe - the "correct
thinking" - at intergovernmental meetings devoted to the
environment - like the Rio and Berlin conferences. It has also
been the dominant message from the International Panel on Climate
Change - IPCC - which last year presented one scenario under
which the world, to mitigate a possible threat of global warming,
would by 2100 cover 80% of its energy needs by biomass.
<P>
The present reality and that of the next decades look
very different from these recipes. The fossil fuels - coal, oil
and gas - are totally dominating commercial energy use - with no
stagnation in sight. For electricity generation thermal power has
a share of 63%; hydro 19%; nuclear 17%; geothermal 0.5% . Solar
power, wind power and biomass together have a smaller
share than 0.1%.
<P>
According to the International Energy Agency (OECD)
publication "Oil, Gas and Coal
Supply Outlook" published in 1995, natural gas is the
fastest growing fossil fuel. It is not very
surprising: gas is still relatively cheap and the
construction combined cycle gas powered plants
relatively rapid; it emits no SO<SUB>2</SUB> or NO<SUB>x</SUB>.
It does add, however, to global CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions,
though less per energy unit than do coal and oil. Gas use is
expected to increase by 55% in absolute terms from 1992 to 2010.
In the same time period the annual coal production is
expected to increase dramatically:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>in Australia from 178 million tons to 290 million tons;
<LI>in China from 1138 million tons to 2100 million tons;
<LI>in India from 240 million tons to 485 million tons;
<LI>in South Africa from 182 million tons to 326 million tons;
<LI>in the USA from 823 million tons to 1070 million tons.
</UL>
<P>      
If one would dare to assume that the coal thus mined
will be burnt one must conclude that the
current course is not toward that restraint in
CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions which environment ministers and
international conferences talk about. Indeed, only two
weeks ago it was reported that the
European Commission in Brussels has concluded that the
Union will not attain its target of
stabilizing its CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions at the 1990
level by the
year 2000. Based on figures submitted
by the environment departments it concluded there will
be a <I>3% increase</I>. And the
International Energy Agency of the OECD, basing itself
on figures submitted by energy - departments, is reported to have
concluded that there
would be a 15 % increase . . . (see "The
Independent" of 20 May 1996).
<P>
It has often been said - at least here in Sweden - that
if only the power industry were
given the clear signal that nuclear is out and
renewables are to be in, then industry will produce
the effective renewable energy technologies which it is
now alleged to have no incentive to
promote. Coming from quarters that are frequently
enemies of high technology this professed
faith in the unlimited ability of the engineers and
scientists is perhaps based more on wishes
than on conviction. For my part, I am convinced that the
lack of generally commercially
competitive wind power, solar cells and biomass burning
installations is no result of a
conspiracy of oil, coal, gas or nuclear engineers and
industries. In all likelihood there would
be a lot of money to make for any enterprise that
succeeded in making any of these renewable
energy sources commercially competitive. There is also
no lack of public research money
going into the effort - and a great deal of resources
are also ploughed into the endeavours by
the private sector. Yet, so far, these endeavours do not
look promising for the foreseeable
time. Despite the welcome gradual progress that has been
made in the effectiveness of
renewable sources, these are not expected - by neutral
analysts such as the International Energy
Agency of the OECD or the World Energy Council - to
reach but very modest shares of the
world energy use in the foreseeable future. One reason
may be the great efforts which are
needed to "harvest" the energy of low density energy
sources. While coal, oil and gas, not to
speak about uranium or plutonium, are concentrated
volumes of energy, solar rays, gusts of
wind and branches of wood are dispersed sources of
energy. It takes much effort to collect
them. It is not that it cannot be done, but it requires
very large - and therefore expensive -
collecting arrangements. It has been calculated, for
instance, that replacing the 1200 MW(e)
two units at the Swedish Barseb&auml;ck nuclear power plant
with biomass would require planting        
some 11 000 km<SUP>2</SUP> or almost a third of the
surface of
Scania (the southernmost region of
Sweden) - with energy forests (Arnold Lund&eacute;n).
<P>
The optimistic signals we hear much of the time about
these energy sources as being realistic alternatives to fossil
fuel and nuclear power do not appear correctly to reflect
reality. When government subsidies cease, these renewables
<I>mostly</I> become uneconomic. The fanfare with which they are
heralded is often in inverse proportion to their significance.
Much has been said, for instance, about the success of wind power
generated electricity in Denmark. The
Danes have some 3800 windmills. Yet, only 3% - or 1.2
TWh - of Denmark's electricity is
aeolian. Most of the rest is generated by a fast growing
number of coal power plants: the coal
generated electricity in Denmark increased from 15
TWh/year in 1980 to about 30 TWh/year
now! And further increases are planned. It is not
without interest to compare the emissions
from electricity generation in the Danish coal and wind
power mix and that of the Swedish
hydro-nuclear power mix. The figures are for 1992:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Danish electricity generation emitted 26 m tons
CO<SUB>2</SUB> -
Swedish 2 tons;
<LI>Danish electricity generation emitted 130 000 tons
SO<SUB>2</SUB> -
Swedish 2000 tons;
<LI>Danish electricity ~eneration emitted 82 000 tons
NO<SUB>x</SUB> - Swedish 4000 tons.
</UL>         
What I have said about wind power, solar power and
biomass should not be interpreted
as objections to further research and experiments on
renewable sources of energy. I support
it. But it should be understood as a critique of the
message that now or in the medium term
other renewables than hydro power are an economically
competitive alternative to fossil fuels
or nuclear power.
<P>
I think all those who are genuinely concerned about the
environment - and we should
all be - owe it to ourselves to tackle the issues
realistically rather than serving dreams. If this
is not done the result may be that we all get to the
greenhouse through the dreamhouse!
<P>      
We need to rank our fears. Do we fear the nuclear wastes
and the small risk of nuclear
accidents so much that we renounce using nuclear power
as the significant means it can be to
restrain our burning of fossil fuels? Or do we fear the
risk of global warming through CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions, methane leaking and the like so much that we
are prepared to live with the risks
connected with nuclear power - such as they are now or
as they can be reduced in the future?
Or do we fear both nuclear and fossil energy so much
that we are ready to pay drastically more
for energy and cover large tracts of land with
windmills, solar cells and fast growing trees,
provided, indeed, that all these sources of energy are
found to be as environmentally benign as
they are claimed to be? Until now, no clear cut and
unison answer has been given. We
muddle on. Several concrete cases suggest there is until
now a resigned tolerance to fossil
based energy. Nuclear power evokes more protest.
<P>   
When the Austrians closed their nuclear plant, which
would have used some 30 tons of
low enriched uranium per year, they built as a
substitute two coal-fired plants which burn five
train loads of coal per day - amounting to about 1.5-2.0
million tons of coal per year. Belgium
allowed a gas fired plant instead of the contemplated
nuclear power plant. Mexico has opened
two nuclear plants on the Gulf, but is building more
coal plants on the Pacific. Indonesia has
talked about a nuclear plant but is covering its rapidly
increasing energy needs by the burning
of fossil fuels. China and India seem determined to
expand their nuclear sectors, but their coal
sectors seem to expand even faster. One is not surprised
to find an OECD/IEA report on the
world energy outlook predict that energy-derived
CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions will increase by almost 50%
by the year 2010.
<P>
At an Asian summit conference on environment in Manila
in February last year,
Western participants are reported to have expressed
concern about the rapidly increasing use
of coal and other fossil fuels in the expanding Asian
economies. Understandably Asian
participants replied: "It is you in the industrialized
West who have messed up the atmosphere.
Don't expect us to slow our development by renouncing an
expanded use of coal." They could
have added: "If you want an equitable solution, we could
allocate a certain CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission right
per capita ...".
<P>         
<B>      Let me draw some conclusions:</B>
<OL>
<LI> The fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are now
totally dominant and will remain the main
commercial sources of the world energy for the
foreseeable time - preferably
increasingly with cleaning equipment that drastically
reduces the emissions of SO<SUB>2</SUB> and
NO<SUB>x</SUB>;
<P>
<LI> However, the increasing emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and other
gases linked to fossil fuel use may
pose dangers which we should not expose ourselves to.
The least we should do is to
search for so-called no regret solutions, i.e. solutions
which we would not much regret
having taken even if the supposed dangers proved to be
false alarms;
<P>
<LI> As there appears to be no economically viable way of
neutralizing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions at the
burning of fossil fuels, we may seek increasingly to
switch from coal to oil to gas to
reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and to rely more on
non-CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emitting economically viable energy
sources;
<P>
<LI> Nuclear power is a demanding technology but it is the
technology that for the foreseeable time has the greatest
potential to give significant amounts of energy with      
viable, it <I>does</I> provide
minimal contribution of greenhouse gases. As it is
economically viable a "no regret" option. Even a drastic
expansion of nuclear power might not, alone, give
the response we need to the greenhouse threat - but it
could go a rather long way.
Uranium and thorium resources will not be a limiting
factor;
<P>
<LI> The technologically advanced countries which have the
capacity to operate nuclear power safely, should make increasing
use of it, while restraining their own use of fossil fuels,
leaving to the technologically underdeveloped countries to expand
their use of the less difficult technologies to generate energy
by fossil fuels;
<P>         
<LI> Research and development should continue on all
sources of energy as on conservation, urban planning, etc.;
<P>
<LI> All efforts should continue to further reduce the
risk of accidents connected with nuclear
power, to develop further the solutions which already
exist for the disposal of nuclear
         wastes, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and the trafficking in nuclear
material, to develop new types of nuclear reactors that
are safer, simpler and even more
economic than the current generation and to find broader
use of nuclear power than just electricity generation.
</OL> 
<P>
I shall use the rest of my time to develop these points.
<P>
A much expanded reliance on the nuclear option can be
made more attractive to the
public - or less worrisome - through further action on a
number of points.
<P>
The<I> first</I> is further <I>information.</I> The
public needs to be aware that no energy generation
and use is without <I>some</I> cost and risk; that it is not
meaningful to look at the cost and risk of
an energy source in isolation but only in comparison
with the cost and risk of the alternative
source or the cost and risks connected with being
without energy. Scientists and engineers and
their professional associations have a role to play in
this educational effort. They have often
greater credibility than politicians and media people. I
have no doubt that correct risk
assessments would place nuclear power in a better light
- relative to the alternatives. The IAEA
is trying to contribute to such risk comparisons in a
project pursued together with a number of
other intergovernmental organizations.
<P>
The <I>second</I> point relates to the <I>safety </I>of
plants generating nuclear power. Increased
safety results continuously from improved constructions
and new constructions and from
improved methods in management, operation and control.
The reactors put into operation
today offer greater safety than the early ones and the
new types around the corner - whether
those that are evolutionary and build on current
experience or those that are "developmental",
innovative - offer yet further improvements in safety.
Similarly, today's methods of operation
and supervision help much to further strengthen safety.
By the end of 1995, 437 nuclear power
units were in operation in 31 countries in the world.
The total accumulated operating
experience was at that time 7696 reactor years. The
feedback to operators, managers,
supervisors and regulators of those years of experience
is considerable. It is also expressed in
guidelines, standards and conventions adopted under IAEA
auspices. A determined collective
effort is made to ensure that safety is high in nuclear
reactors <I>everywhere</I> - to create an international nuclear
safety culture. The Summit in
Moscow on 20 April this year focussed
precisely on this issue and expressed the joint
determination of the world leaders - I quote - "to
work together to ensure the safety of nuclear power and
to promote security for nuclear materials".
<P>          
President Yeltsin advocated <I>inter alia</I>
international co-operation to construct new types
of nuclear reactors, not only in the field of fusion -
where such co-operation is ongoing - but
also in the field of light water reactors, high
temperature reactors and breeders. There is a fair
amount of such co-operation going on. Indeed, the IAEA
provides fora for the exchange of
information and experience in the work which is pursued
around the world on several types of
reactors, including those which I just mentioned.
However, more far-reaching co-operation
may include sensitive commercial interests and falls
outside the scope of the IAEA mechanisms.
<P>
The<I> third</I> point relates to <I>nuclear wastes.</I>
Here, again information is crucial. We would
need to launch the concept of "alternative wastes". No
one wishes to belittle the problem of
safely disposing of wastes that remain radioactive for
very, very long periods of time. But this
problem should be viewed in parallel with the problems
connected with the alternative wastes
which would result from other sources of energy, e.g.
coal, some of which remain toxic forever
and much of which are released into the atmosphere,
raising the risk <I>inter alia</I> of climate
change. One can sometimes get the impression that the
concern is greater about the risks posed
by radioactive wastes after the next ice age than about
the risks of a climate change next century and other consequences
caused by the wastes of
fossil fuels.
<P>
Although solutions exist for the safe disposal of
civilian nuclear wastes and there is no
reason to delay national decisions, international
co-operation should ensure that the conduct is
responsible everywhere. An international convention
laying down minimum standards regarding
the disposal of nuclear wastes and the management of
spent nuclear fuel is now being negotiated
under IAEA auspices. This basic international
legislative instrument should be ready for
signature next year.
<P>      
When I look at the considerable and competent scientific
and technical work that has
been done on the safe disposal of nuclear waste, I
cannot but find it somewhat paradoxical that
some of the people who claim to be most concerned about
the danger of nuclear wastes, are the
very same people who most fiercely oppose site
investigations needed to solve the problem!
<P> 
Groucho Marx once said he did not understand why we
should do something for future
generations. After all, they never did anything for us!
Well, I think we all disagree and feel
that we must not leave a poisoned and depleted world to
future generations. We recognize that
our generation, which is benefiting from using nuclear
generated electricity, must ensure the
safe management of the nuclear waste we cause.
Transmutation may, one day, play a role in
this regard, but it should not be taken as an excuse for
relaxing our current work on waste
disposal. Governments should help to bring this work to
a successful end and should not allow
themselves to be sidetracked or paralysed.
<P>
One more reflection on the nuclear waste issue: in his
speech to the Moscow Summit
on 20 April, President Yeltsin said that Russia regarded
- I quote - "the joint establishment of
regional storage facilities with scientific and
financial input of all interested parties ... as a
promising area of co-operation."
<P>
In the Western industrial world at present "correct
thinking" demands <I>national</I> waste
disposal solutions, apparently regardless how much more
advantageous international co-operation and regional solutions
might be. I confess great sympathy for the concept voiced by
President Yeltsin. A smaller number of highly developed,
well sited, well equipped and well managed regional nuclear waste
disposal installations - based on agreements freely entered into
- would seem to me to be a more rational solution for
the world than a greater number of
smaller installations spread over the world. Are we or
are we not a "global village"?
<P>    
I am pleased to note, finally, that my own country,
Sweden, together with Norway and
several other States, are engaged with Russia in a joint
endeavour that relates to nuclear waste
disposal in Russia. I am also happy to note that the
IAEA is providing some co-ordinating and
secretariat services to this endeavour.
<P>      
A <I>fourth</I> point relates to <I>non-proliferation</I> of
nuclear weapons, nuclear disarmament and
the security against <I>trafficking</I> in nuclear materials.
The end of the cold war and the detente
which has followed globally and in many regions have
improved the prospects of non-
proliferation. Latin America, Africa, the South Pacific
and South East Asia today have treaties
establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and the global
Non-Proliferation Treaty was prolonged
for an infinite time last year. This is all progress -
but much remains to be done. Nuclear-
weapon-free zones are needed also in the Middle East and
on the Indian subcontinent. And
further reductions of the arsenals of the nuclear-weapon
States must be a part of an accelerating
nuclear disarmament. The weapons grade plutonium from
dismantled weapons must be
disposed of and a discussion is now going on regarding
the options in this regard. Accelerator-
driven transmutation may prove to be one of them.
Non-proliferation pledges and nuclear
disarmament commitments must also be coupled with a
greater readiness of States to accept effective control. Ever
since the discovery of the
clandestine nuclear weapon programme in
Iraq, the IAEA has been intensely engaged in efforts to
strengthen the safeguards system.
Much experience in verification has been learnt in Iraq
and is now being implemented
elsewhere. But some new approaches and measures for
effective control require acceptance by
States. These measures must be non-discriminatory. They
are inevitably somewhat of a burden
to each State, just as our walking through the metal
detectors at airports is an inconvenience.
Such inconveniences have to be accepted, however, in the
interest of reducing the risk of
clandestine nuclear weapons development. The Moscow
Summit underlined the need for the
strengthened IAEA measures. It also stressed the need
for joint measures and co-operation to
prevent the smuggling of nuclear materials and the
IAEA's role in that co-operation.
<P>         
I should like to conclude where I began this
presentation, namely with, if I may say so,
the "frontier" nuclear thinking, the new chapters in the
nuclear log book. I have mentioned
fusion, which may be far off as a commercial energy
source, but on which important research
is pursued in international co-operation. I have
referred to the breeder reactors, which are
almost "unmentionable" in modern "correct thinking", but
which do exist in France, Russia,
UK, Kazakstan, Japan and India. Should there be any
worries about the finite nature of the
world's uranium resources, we should recall that breeder
reactors extract sixty times as much
energy from uranium as thermal reactors do. We might
also refer to the ongoing research on
the thorium fuel cycle. Fuel availability is not likely
to be a problem in a future expanded use
of nuclear power. One might rather ask if such expanded
use should not focus or refocus on
some new energy demanding functions. The major portion
of the world's primary energy usage
is consumed in the forrm of heat. The temperature
requirements for industrial heat applications
vary greatly from low temperature heat for district
heating up to high temperature process heat
for coal gasification and hydrogen production. Processes
requiring temperatures of up to 300&#176;C can be supplied by
water cooled reactors while breeders
may be applied to processes requiring
up to 540&#176;C. The high temperature gas cooled reactor can
reach process heat temperatures of
950&#176;C. Thus, nuclear energy has the potential to provide
not only electricity, but also heat for
many of the world's industrial heat application
processes. Desalination of sea water to cover
the increasing shortage of drinking water is another
possible application of nuclear energy. It
is a subject which several States are discussing under
IAEA auspices. An expanded use of
nuclear power could provide electricity in the presently
hydrocarbon guzzling transportation
sector: trains for medium distances, trolley buses,
tubes and electric cars for urban areas.
Perhaps even nuclear propelled ships for heavy sea
transports. Why only submarines, aircraft
carriers and ice breakers?
<P>         
The Conference that you open today eminently represents
nuclear frontier thinking. It may have great relevance in the
field of safe operation of electricity generating nuclear plants.
It may affect the nuclear waste question in fundamental ways and
even impact upon the question of non-proliferation.
<P>      
I am fully aware that your subjects and ideas are bristling with
problems and difficulties and that some view your endeavours not
negatively but with mild scepticism. I am confident
that you will take that in a stride. The IAEA is proud to be a
co-sponsor of this Conference and the Agency is engaged in a
number of actlvities and programmes that relate to your subject
and work.
<P>   
I wish you a hearty appetite on your tantalizing subjects and
much success. The sooner you bring us the ultimate solutions to
safe nuclear power, safe nuclear waste and non-proliferation, the
better.

Implementation of IAEA Safeguards in 1995

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>                                                                        
The Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  meeting in
Vienna, June 10-14 1996, reviewed the implementation of IAEA safeguards last year.
<P>
The Agency did not find any indication in 1995 of the diversion of  nuclear material, or of
the misuse of any facility, equipment, or  non-nuclear material placed under safeguards. It
therefore concluded that  such items remained in peaceful use or were otherwise accounted
for.  However, the Agency was still unable to verify the initial declaration made  by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The DPRK is not in full  compliance with
its safeguards agreement.
<P>
At the end of 1995, Agency safeguards agreements were in force with 125  States (and
Taiwan, China), 66 of  which (and Taiwan, China) had nuclear  activities and were inspected.
Safeguards were also implemented in 5 States  with bilateral or multilateral agreements
covering specified nuclear or  non-nuclear material, facilities or equipment, as well as at
designated  installations in the five Nuclear Weapon States. During 1995, 554 nuclear
facilities and other locations containing nuclear materials were inspected. A total of 2285
inspections were carried out requiring 10167 person-days of inspection effort.
<P>
The Agency employs approximately 200 field inspectors for this work,  and the budget for
this activity in 1995 was US $88,603,000, plus a further  US $14 million of extra budgetary
funds contributed by 8  Member States. Most  of  the Agency's inspection work is carried out
under agreements pursuant to  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was
extended indefinitely  in May of 1995.
<P>
 In a separate action last week, the Agency's Board of Governors also agreed to  establish a
special Committee to negotiate a new legal document that  would be attached to existing
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements. This document would give the Agency more
information about the nuclear activities of a State and an increased access to relevant
installations in the State. These broader rights would strengthen the present  verification
system and markedly enhance the Agency's ability to detect possible clandestine undertakings.
<P>
Other highlights from the Agency's activities in 1995:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the Agency maintained in 1995 - and still maintains - a team of  inspectors in Iraq and
in the DPRK;
<P>
<LI>in the United States of America, safeguards were applied on nuclear material released
from the US military programme in 1995 and voluntarily placed under Agency safeguards, in
addition to material already released in 1994;
<P>
<LI>verification of the initial inventories of nuclear materials submitted by three Newly
Independent States of the former Soviet Union -- Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine -- was
begun.
</UL>
<P>
Although, in 1995, the Agency's safeguards activities were effective, several implementation
difficulties have been encountered. These included technical difficulties with the Agency's
surveillance equipment and also administrative restrictions imposed by several States on the
designation of inspectors and on the availability of long-term multi-entry visas for inspectors.
The Agency is taking steps to resolve these problems.

Division of Public Information. Telephone: +43-1-2060-21275

Strengthening of International Nuclear Inspection Regime --
IAEA Board of Governors Moves to Finalize Detailed Provisions
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>                                               
At its regular mid-year meeting in Vienna (June 10-14), the Board of Governors of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) gave a green light to moving ahead
to finalization of increased rights and responsibilities for the Agency's safeguards
inspectorate. 
<P>
Having considered a Secretariat document, the Board agreed to establish a
Committee presided over by the Chairman of the Board to draw up for its
consideration a draft model protocol designed to supplement existing safeguards
inspection agreements between the IAEA and non-nuclear weapon Member States,
defining inter alia the nature of additional access to information and to
nuclear-related locations for the Agency's inspectors.
<P>
The Board acknowledged that additional information, including the taking of
environmental samples and increased physical access would strengthen the Agency's
ability to detect undeclared nuclear material and activities. It emphasized that the
new measures should strike a balance between the Agency's need for information and
access on the one hand and the State's need to protect its legitimate interests and to
respect its constitutional obligations on the other. It further emphasized that
implementation of these measures should be subject to strict rules of confidentiality
to be observed by the Agency, with regard both to information received and to the
entire process of verification.
<P>
The Board further considered that, in order to strengthen the Agency's capability to
detect in the States concerned undeclared nuclear material and activities in an
effective manner and increase the efficiency of the safeguards programme,
cooperation is needed from all States. In this connection, it welcomed the willingness
expressed by the Nuclear Weapon States to consider how best to contribute to the
implementation of the strengthened programme under consideration.

<P>
The Committee will begin its work in early July under current Board Chairman
Ambassador Joost van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen of the Netherlands, report progress to
the Board when it next meets in September, and report the outcome of its work to
the Board at its December meeting this year.
<P>
Commenting on the Board's action, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said: "This
latest and welcome step clearly provides the necessary momentum and reflects the
desire of IAEA Member States, in the light of experience gained in Iraq and
elsewhere in recent years, to reinforce the IAEA's ability not only to verify declared
nuclear inventories and States' adherence to non-proliferation pledges, but also to
detect indications of activity that could be indicative of a possible violation of such
undertakings."

     This peer review, requested by the US DOE's Carlsbad Area Office, will be
organised jointly by the NEA and IAEA as part of the services offered by the two
Agencies in the field of radioactive waste management to their Member countries.
<P>         
     The WIPP is designed to permanently dispose of transuranic radioactive waste
generated by defence-related activities. Transuranic waste consists primarily of
clothing, tools, rags and other disposal items contaminated with radioactive elements,
mostly plutonium.
<P>         
     Located in the State of New Mexico, 42 km (26 miles) east of Carlsbad, WIPP
facilities include disposal  rooms excavated in an ancient, stable rock salt formation,
654 m (2150 ft) underground.
<P>         
         As in most countries with nuclear programmes, the preferred method for the
disposal of long-lived radioactive waste, such as transuranic waste, is its long-term
isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological
formations. The WIPP site was selected and constructed to meet the criteria
established by the responsible US regulatory authority, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) for the safe long-term disposal of transuranic waste. A formal licence
application, for the disposal of transuranic waste at this site is to be submitted by the
DOE to the EPA. This application, called the Compliance Certification Application,
will include an assessment of the long-term safety of the repository after its closure.
<P>
The objective of the joint NEA/IAEA peer review will be to examine whether the
post-closure assessment of the WIPP is appropriate, technically sound and in
conformity with international standards and practices.
<P>         
         For the purpose of the review, the NEA and IAEA will constitute a joint
secretariat and appoint a group of independent international experts in the various
disciplines involved in long-term safety assessments, such as geology, geochemistry,
material sciences, radiation and environmental protection, and nuclear safety. The
expert group will include representatives from nuclear regulatory         bodies,
radioactive waste management agencies, universities and research institutions.
<P>         
        The review will start in October 1996 and be conducted over a 6-month period,
on the basis of detailed documentation provided by the US Department of Energy
and discussions with the specialists involved in this project during a visit to the
WIPP. A report containing the international expert group's findings will be
transmitted to the Department of Energy.
<P>         
         Through such peer reviews, it is possible to benefit from the experience of the
world's leading experts in nuclear waste disposal and radiological safety assessments
and to take into account the approaches followed by other advanced countries
towards the safe disposal of long-lived radioactive waste. These reviews are in line
with the NEA and IAEA common objective of promoting the adoption of safe policies
and practices for the disposal of radioactive waste in their respective Member
countries.

<B><LI>Chernobyl</B><P>     On 26/4/86, Chernobyl-4 exploded releasing 200 times as much radiation as Hiroshima
and Nagasaki combined. The accident played a substantial role in collapse of Soviet
Union; environmental and economic costs can not yet be estimated. First reaction of
officials was cover-up; locals were told it was just a fire and there was no danger
so people suffered unnecessary radiation before evacuation of first 100 000. Maps
showing extent of radiation were released in 1989 and more people were evacuated.
As facts were known, Ukraine and Belarus were outraged; reaction mobilized national
movements which changed Soviet politics. Chernobyl accident reportedly destroyed
Soviet Defence Minister's belief that a nuclear war could be fought and won. Partly
because of cover up and partly because of prior poor health data, full health
effects unlikely ever to be known; Russia uses official figure of 31 deaths,
Ukrainian Government estimates 8000 and Ukrainian Greens, 32 000. Ukrainian
official figures report 4229 deaths since 1986 as result of accident which include
2929 'liquidators'. 800 000 heavily exposed 'liquidators' are scattered around CIS.
Clear evidence of wave of childhood thyroid cancer; too soon to know effects on
adults. Other illnesses also being tracked. US expert says post-Chernobyl thryroid
cancer cases 'could have been prevented' if authorities had provided foods such as
uncontaminated powdered milk. Families living in contaminated areas have twice as
many genetic mutations as expected and they will be passed to future generations.
Exposures continue; 400 000 people have now been evacuated and at least 300 000
more live on dangerously contaminated land. 30-million drink contaminated water.
Belarus estimates it spends 15% of GDP on Chernobyl; Ukraine 5% of budget. Poverty
said to scare Ukrainians more than Chernobyl aftermath. A few hours before
Chernobyl anniversary, minor release of radiation when filter was changed at
Chernobyl-3 detracted from commemorations; radiation was cleaned up overnight and
no threat to environment; incident was said to be because of careless work. Fires
around Chernobyl earlier in week hurt no one and there was only minor rise in
radiation. Details of 11/95 incident which was reclassed at INES level '3'. Swiss
energy politics after 1986 accident reported. Germany closed eastern European NPPs
following accident and future of nuclear power there influenced by it. Immediately
after accident, in Munich radiation rose for a short time to ten times normal level
and plants and wild animals are still affected by caesium. Western help for
Chernobyl said to be 'out of control'. Austria commemorates Chernobyl. Following
Chernobyl, Austria has campaigned for closure of NPPs in neighbouring lands. Visit
to 'sarcophagus' and tour of site reported. US medicines flown to Chernobyl
victims. President Yeltsin thanks those who fought the fire 10 years ago. Police
confronted protestors near Chernobyl as thousands of mourners gathered round a
monument to dead in Slavutych, a new town built to rehouse staff after explosion.
Belarus President says authorities have no moral right to prevent people returning
to Chernobyl region. Chernobyl symbolizes 'everything wrong with Ukraine's energy
sector'.

A total of 476 nuclear power plants were operating or being built
around the world
in 1995, based on data reported to the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA)
Power Reactor Information System (PRIS).  During 1995, four
nuclear power plants
with altogether 3290 MW(e) were newly connnected to electricity
grids in India,
Republic of Korea, UK and Ukraine, bringing the world's total
number of operating
reactors to 437 in 30 countries and Taiwan, China.  Additionally,
a total of 39
reactors were reported as being constructed in 14 countries.
<P>
     Nuclear power's share of electricity production remained
high in 1995, in
seven countries - Lithuania, 85.59; France, 76.14; Belgium,
55.52; Sweden, 46.61;
Bulgaria, 46.43; Slovak Republic, 44.14; Hungary, 42.30; -
representing close to half
or more of their total electricity use.  All in all, 17 countries
(including Taiwan,
China) relied upon nuclear power plants to supply at least a
quarter of their total
electricity needs.
<P>
     Worldwide in 1995, total nuclear power generation grew to
2227.94 terawatt-
hours of electricity.  This is more than the world's total
electricity generation - 1912
terawatt-hours - from all sources in 1958.  Overall nuclear power
plants provided
approximately 17 percent of the world's electricity production in
1995.  Cumulative
worldwide operating experience from civil nuclear reactors at the
end of 1995 was over 7696 years.

International Conference "One Decade After Chernobyl:  Summing up
the Consequences"

<HR>
<P>
The nuclear accident at Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 had a heavy
impact on life, health
and the environment.  It caused agony to people in Ukraine,
Belarus and Russia and
anxiety far away from these countries.  The economic losses and
social dislocation were
severe in a region already under strain.  I think our thoughts at
the opening of this
Conference should first go to the many people who have suffered,
or may yet come to
suffer, as a result of the accident.  I propose that, as a
tribute to the countries and people
affected, we begin our Conference by standing up in a minute of
silence.
<P>
     At the outset of this Conference let me further note that,
although much help has
been rendered by public and private organizations to alleviate
the situation, there
continues to be a crying need for further assistance to the
peoples and countries to whom
the Chernobyl consequences are a formidable burden added to an
already very difficult
situation.  We urge such assistance. 
<P>


     If the first reaction must be one arising from human
solidarity, our second reaction
should be a demand for rigorous scientific analysis.  The errors
in technology,
organization and management, which caused the accident, must be
identified to prevent
any repetition and the damages caused by the accident must be
accurately assessed and
diagnosed so that rational remedies may be applied.
<P>
     The causes of the Chernobyl accident are by now rather well
traced and identified. 
Only a few months after the accident the IAEA organized a major
conference at which
nuclear experts from all over the world were enabled, here in
Vienna, to hold a first
thorough discussion of the matter.  Since then further
information has been forthcoming
and improved our understanding.  As a result of analyses
undertaken important technical,
managerial and regulatory steps have been taken with regard to
all Chernobyl-type
(RBMK) reactors.
<P>
     Other lessons from Chernobyl have prompted the conclusion of
new international
conventions.  Already in 1986 the General Conference of the IAEA
adopted one
convention concerning emergency assistance in case of a nuclear
accident and another
convention to ensure that instant information would be available
to facilitate protective
measures in case of any future nuclear accident.  Two years ago a
general international
convention on nuclear power reactor safety was adopted which we
expect will soon come
into force.  Through these and many other measures, including new
international safety
services, governments and utilities have gradually sought to put
in place a global nuclear
safety culture that will reduce the risk of accidents occurring
and mitigate the
consequences of any accident that may yet occur.  As safety is
not a static concept, this
culture will continuously evolve with new technology and
experience.
<P>

     Let me mention yet another example of lessons learned. 
After the Chernobyl
accident the public was confused by governments applying widely
diverging standards as
to what constituted an acceptable level of radioactivity in
different types of foodstuffs. 
Strawberries which could be safely eaten in one country, could be
rejected in another,
etc.  After considerable work uniform international standards are
now available.
<P>
     The Conference which we open today is not focussing on the
causes of the
Chernobyl accident but on the consequences of it, a subject on
which many investigations
have been made but on which less consensus has been available. 
Yet, if decades of
painstaking scientific research has brought a large measure of
important knowledge and
consensus about the consequences of the nuclear bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it
should also be possible, by applying respectable scientific
methods, gradually to attain a
consensus about the consequences of the Chernobyl accident.  To
move toward such
consensus is the aim of this Conference.
<P>
     Much work has been done in the past ten years - not least by
the three
organizations sponsoring this Conference - to compile relevant
data and to analyse them. 
Under the guidance of an international scientific committee the
IAEA, together with a
large number of sister organizations, in 1989 embarked on the
International Chernobyl
Project to assess the measures taken to enable people to live
safely in areas affected by
radioactive contamination.  It involved more than 200 experts
from 23 countries and was
the beginning of an ongoing co-operation with the
intergovernmental organizations
represented here today.  The conclusions of this early
assessment, which were submitted
to global expert discussion in 1991, have been generally
sustained by subsequent scientific
inquiries.  In updated form they will be reviewed by this
Conference.  One of the
conclusions of this early inquiry, namely that an increase in the
incidence of thyroid
tumours could be expected, seems tragically to be borne out by
subsequent data.
<P>
     The sessions of this Conference will also provide extensive
information about and 
opportunity for discussion of the large scientific programmes of
the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU), in particular of
the major technical
conferences organized by WHO in Geneva last November and by the
European Union,
Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine last month in Minsk. 
This Conference will
also be familiarized with the work done by the United Nations,
UNESCO and others. 
Much work relating to the consequences of the accident naturally
consists in efforts of
alleviation rather than investigation.  Let me mention, as an
example, the
countermeasures developed through an IAEA-FAO project, sponsored
by the Norwegian
Government, to lower the levels of radioactive caesium in cattle
by administration of an
inorganic compound known as "Prussian Blue". 
<P>
     During this week a wealth of material will be presented and
laid open for
international discussion and critical analysis.  Responsible
Ministers from Belarus, the
Russian Federation and Ukraine will inform the Conference on the
social, economic,
institutional and political impact of the Chernobyl accident.
<P>
     I would like to pay tribute to the many people who have put
so much effort into
the preparatory work of the Conference.  I have in mind
scientists of the co-sponsoring
organizations and many scientists from the three Republics, who
have worked, over the
last year in particular, to bring the results of their ongoing
work to a point at which it
could be reported here.
<P>
     To facilitate the discussions of the Conference, background
papers on key issues
have been prepared.  They are the result of months of work by
teams of scientists from
around the world to assemble and present the current state of
knowledge in these key
areas.  Altogether 34 scientists worked on the six papers
produced in this way.  I express
my thanks to them.  I also want to thank the distinguished
scientists on my right -
Academician Illyin, Professor Rolevich and Dr. Kholosha, the
members of the advisory
committee who monitored all aspects of the preparation of the
Conference.
<P>
     It would be unrealistic to expect consensus among the
scientists here on all issues 
presented.  However, it might well be possible, on the basis of
the scientific data now
available, to reach broadly supported answers to many of the
principal questions which
have been publicly discussed in the past years.  If so, this
Conference would have served,
ten years after the Chernobyl accident, to solidify our knowledge
and understanding of the
consequences of the accident and thereby help to better alleviate
them.
<P>
     It will be the arduous task of the Conference President, the
Minister of the
Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety of the
Federal Republic of
Germany, Dr. Angela Merkel - herself a physicist by education -
to prepare, with the
assistance of a bureau of senior scientists, conclusions and
recommendations arising from
your discussions.  I warmly thank her for undertaking the task of
chairing the
Conference.  On behalf of the sponsoring organizations I now
formally declare the
Conference open.  Before asking Minister Merkel to take the chair
and before requesting
my co-hosts, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, Director General of the WHO,
and Mr. Hendrik
Tent of the European Union, as well as Mr. Griffiths,
representing the United Nations, to
address the Conference, I have the honour to read to you a
message from the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Speech of Dr. Hans Blix, Director General, IAEA
at ICTP at the Ceremony transferring its operation to UNESCO</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International
Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Trieste, 11 January 1996</H4>
<HR>
<P>
Director Virasoro, dear Colleague Dr. Mayor, distinguished
guests,
<P>
The idea of creating an International Centre for Theoretical
Physics was put forward at the Fourth IAEA General Conference in
1960 by the Head of the Pakistan Delegation, Professor Abdus
Salam. The resolution was co-sponsored by the representatives of
Afghanistan, the Federal Republic of Germany, Iran, Iraq, Japan,
the Philippines, Portugal, Thailand and Turkey.
<P>
After further fruitful discussions and various panels of experts
the 1962 General Conference approved the creation of the Centre. 
In 1963 the offer of the Italian Government of a site in Trieste
was accepted by the Agency and in October 1964 the Centre opened
its first headquarters in downtown Trieste.
<P>
Over more than three decades, the ICTP has been playing an
increasingly important role in the development of scientific
knowledge and in the exchange of scientific expertise between
the industrialized countries and the Third World.  The Agency is
proud to have been closely associated with this expansion.  The
Centre is today playing a unique role as a forum for scientists
from all over the world and as one of the instruments
strengthening science.  In a world where communication is
dominated by sound bites and simplifications, the obstinate and
disciplined respect for critical, logical thinking in science
becomes an even more important factor for the mental balance of
our societies.
<P>
In the first decade of its life the Centre flourished, mainly in
the areas of nuclear physics and nuclear data, high energy
physics, atomic physics, fusion physics and mathematics.  It set
up mechanisms which provide excellent learning opportunities for
scientists, especially from the developing countries.
<P>
Since the IAEA is to promote the transfer to technology related
to the applications of nuclear technology, it was natural that it
would also encourage research in physics and in other sciences, a
knowledge of which is a prerequisite to the use of nuclear
technology.
<P>
However, an increased demand from the scientists of the Third
World prompted Abdus Salam to extend the sphere of activities of
the ICTP to other branches of theoretical physics and to
mathematics.  This development was facilitated by the fact that,
in 1970, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), which is concerned with all scientific
areas, joined the IAEA as an equal partner for operation of the
Centre.  Today, the ICTP covers, in addition to the fields I
mentioned, broad areas of physics related to energy, solid state
physics, environment, medicine, biology, space science, lasers
and mathematics, including computer science in its various
aspects.
<P>
The last 15 years have seen an incredibly fast and admirable
development of the Centre's activities in terms of scientific
programmes and number of scientific visitors.  This expansion,
which was accompanied and made possible by an increase of the
funding, mainly by the Italian Government, is a result of the
vision, prestige and work of a man, Professor Abdus Salam, and
the excellent staff members in ICTP.
<P>
In this process of expansion, the share of programmes which do
not fall inside the major mandate of the Agency has continuously
increased, so that eventually it appeared natural to switch the
major administrative responsibility from the IAEA to UNESCO. 
This, of course, does not mean that the IAEA's interest in the
programmes of the Centre is declining.  The IAEA will continue
its support to those programmes of the ICTP which are in line
with its statutory obligations and it continues its financial
support at the same level as before.  We are only transferring to
UNESCO the administrative responsibility for the Centre.
<P>
All administrative matters necessary for the transfer have been
satisfactorily finished by the excellent work of staff members in
legal and personnel divisions of both UNESCO and IAEA.  I thank
them.  The informal Steering Committee Meeting was already held
last December with the representation of UNESCO, IAEA and the
Italian Government for discussions of future programmes and the
budget of ICTP.  The Scientific Council, which is strengthened by
addition of new members, will also be organized soon for
scientific review and discussions of programmes towards new
directions.
<P>
Let me conclude:  the extraordinary success of the ICTP over the
thirty years as a place for co-operation and as a landmark for
physicists and mathematicians from developing countries is due to
the vision, competence and energy of its creator, Abdus Salam,
and his collaborators together with the outstanding support of
the Italian Government.  I want to use this occasion to pay
tribute to this far-sighted work.  I want also explicitly to
thank Professor Budinich and Professor Bertocchi and the Staff
Council.  Together they have through the years created a
micro-United Nations, where all nationalities have been joining
hands for an important, peaceful mission:  the constant expansion
of human knowledge and understanding of the physical world
we live in.  I wish we had a centre that was equally successful
in improving hard knowledge and understanding of the social and
political world we live in.
<P>
Lastly, let me express my confidence that under the new and
dynamic leadership of the Director, Professor Miguel Virasoro,
and his motivated staff and under the stewardship of UNESCO and
Mr. Mayor, the Centre will continue to play its unique role in
the transfer of scientific expertise and superior research.  ICTP
will also continue to function as a forum of excellence for
scientific contacts among scientists from all over the world.

<CENTER>
<H2>Concluding Press Conference<BR>
International Forum on the Safety of RBMK Reactors</H2>
<P>
<I>(Editor's Note:  This is an unofficial summary of the press briefing and not an official record.)</CENTER></I>
<P><HR><P>
Further improvements -- and the financial assistance to make them -- are needed to upgrade the safety of RBMK reactors,  fifteen of which are operating in three 
countries -- Lithuania, Russia, and Ukraine -- and to reinforce the structure known as the sarcophagus built around the Chernobyl reactor destroyed in the 1986 
accident, in the view of international nuclear safety experts.
<P>
At a press conference 3 April 1996 at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Prof. Adolf Birkhofer of Germany, Academician V.A. Sidorenko of Russia, and Mr. A.E. Smyshlyaev 
of Ukraine responded to questions about safety issues discussed by experts attending the International Forum:  One Decade After Chernobyl -- Nuclear Safety 
Aspects,  held 1-3 April and jointly organized by the IAEA and UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs.  Conclusions of the Forum -- which Prof. Birkhofer served 
as Chairman --  are being reported to the International Conference on Chernobyl being convened in Vienna  8-12 April by the IAEA, European Commission, and World 
Health Organization.
<P>
Major points made at the press conference:
<UL>
<LI>Prof. Birkhofer said he now had a better understanding of the complicated RBMK reactors and of the remedial measures and safety improvements that had been -- 
and were still being -- made.  Pressed to say whether he would want to see any reactors withdrawn from service, he said he personally would favour that action 
in some cases.  However, he said this was a matter for the national regulatory/licensing authorities in the countries concerned, not for Western nuclear 
engineers who could only assist, co-operate and give their opinions and advice to the affected States and their own authorities.  He stressed that, irrespective 
of whether a unit was slated to be phased out or not, safety improvements -- with Western financial support -- had to be made.
<P>
<LI>Regarding the possibility of a serious accident, Prof. Birkhofer said an explosion like the one which destroyed Chernobyl Unit 4, an RBMK reactor, should no 
longer be possible at RBMKs given the safety improvements that have been made.  However, he said he could not state categorically that an explosion could not 
happen.  Whereas the same combination of circumstances that led to the Chernobyl accident in 1986 could virtually be ruled out (given the technical changes that 
had been made to RBMKs), there was a residual risk of multiple fuel channel failure that could trigger a large release, given the lack of a containment structure
like the ones surrounding Western-type reactors.  But an explosion triggered by a reactor excursion, compounded as it was in 1986 by operating and regulatory 
violations, was very unlikely to recur today. 
<P>
<LI>Academician Sidorenko said he regretted that to date Western financial and hardware assistance had been relatively insignificant.  The biggest sum was US $30 
million promised by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), but this was still in the pipeline.  Only in the last two years had the 
emphasis shifted to technical assistance, which he welcomed.  However, he believed about US $130 milllion per unit was the scale of assistance required to 
improve safety levels adequately.  He added that the oldest Russian RBMK units were having their operating permits extended only one year at a time, permitting 
review of their performance, the improvements that had been made, and decisions about further required improvements.
<P>
<LI>Concerning the Chernobyl sarcophagus, Prof. Birkhofer said there were two risks that had been discussed at the Forum:  the possible collapse of the roof and 
the possible recriticality of a small amount of undamaged fuel if it came into contact with water.  On the first of these possibilities, he said the existing 
sarcophagus by necessity had been built in extremely arduous conditions, without some of the normal construction features that would ensure structural integrity 
and resistance to extreme outside pressures.  In such a case, radioactive dust could be resuspended and escape, affecting the site and the 30 kilometer exclusion
zone.  This being so, there is a need to take short-term measures to buttress the structure, pending decision on and implementation of a second sarcophagus 
structure.  On the second issue, recriticality, Prof. Birkhofer said this was a remote risk but something that could not be dismissed, based on theoretical 
studies conducted in Russia and Ukraine.  If such an event occurred, with water leaking into the sarcophagus and coming in contact with the fuel, then this 
could result in a radioactive release both inside and outside the structure, but probably not producing sufficient energy to provoke an explosion.  There was a 
need to help Ukraine finance further studies and analysis in this area to obtain a better idea of the current status and improvements that are needed, taking 
account of Russian and Ukrainian expertise.

<H2>INTERNATIONAL IAEA FORUM ON THE SAFETY OF RBMK REACTORS </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
The nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, which was destroyed in the accident ten years ago was a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant known by the Russian acronym RBMK. Today 15 RBMK power reactors are producing electricity in three States: 11 units in Russia, 2 in Ukraine and 2 in Lithuania. To review remedial measures and actions taken since the Chernobyl accident the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Department for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations will organize in Vienna from 1 to 3 April 1996 an International Forum on Nuclear Safety Aspects of RBMK Reactors. In addition the Forum will discuss questions of the containment structure of the protective building built around the accident reactor at Chernobyl - the so called sarcophagus.
<P>
Over the past decade, a considerable amount of work has been carried out by Russian designers and operators to improve the safety of RBMK reactors and to eliminate the causes that led to the Chernobyl accident. As a result, major design and operational modifications have been implemented. However, safety concerns remain, particularly regarding the first-generation units.
<P>
In addition to these actions taken by the Russian designers and operators, the IAEA has  initiated in 1992 the RBMK safety programme with the aim to consolidate results of various national, bilateral and multilateral activities and to establish international consensus on required safety improvements and related priorities. Through this programme international assistance is provided to both regulatory and operating organizations with a basis for technical and financial decisions. Activities of the IAEA's RBMK safety programme are co-ordinated with those of an international consortium on the "Safety of Design Solutions and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants with RBMK Reactors" established under auspices of the European Commission.
<P>
The IAEA has now prepared a consolidated list of design and operational safety issues for RBMK reactors. It suggests safety upgradings in the following fields: Core Design and Core Monitoring, Instrumentation and Control, Pressure Boundary Integrity, Incident and Accident Analysis, Safety and Support Systems, Fire Protection and Operational Safety.
<P>
Discussions at the International Forum will concentrate on the Causes of the Chernobyl Accident; Remedial Actions; National, Bilateral and International Safety Improvement Programmes; and Chernobyl Sarcophagus. There will be reports on the current status and safety improvements of the RBMK reactors at Chernobyl, Ignalina, Kursk, Leningrad and Smolensk.
<P>
The papers presented will be available and there will be a press briefing on Wednesday, 3 April 1996, at 16.00 p.m. in the IAEA Meeting Room C07 V at the Vienna International Centre .

<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) serves as the world's central intergovernmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field, and as the international inspectorate for the application of nuclear safeguards and verification measures covering civilian nuclear programmes. A specialized agency within the United Nations system, the IAEA came into being in 1957, a few years after US President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed the creation of an international atomic energy agency in his historic <A HREF="atoms.html">Atoms for Peace</A> speech before the United Nations General Assembly. Today, a wide range of IAEA products, services, and programmes incorporate the co-operative efforts and interests of the Agency's <A HREF="member.html">124 Member States</A>.

<H3>UN Security Council Resolution 255 (1968)</H3> 
<I>(Adopted by the Security Council on 19 June 1968)</I>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
<I>The Security Council,</I>
<P>         
<I>Noting</I> with appreciation the desire of a large number of States to subscribe to the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and thereby to undertake not 
to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other 
nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices 
directly or indirectly, not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or 
other nuclear explosive devices, and not to seek or receive any assistance in the 
manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,
<P>         
<I>Taking into consideration</I> the concern of certain of these States that, in conjunction 
with their  adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 
appropriate measures be undertaken to safeguard their security,
<P>         
<I>Bearing in mind</I> that any aggression accompanied by the use of nuclear weapons 
would endanger the peace and security of all States,
<P>
<DL>

<DD>1. <I>Recognizes</I> that aggression with nuclear weapons or the threat of such
aggression 
against a non-nuclear-weapon State would create a situation in which the Security 
Council, and above all its nuclear-weapon State permanent members, would have to 
act immediately in accordance with their obligations under the United Nations 
Charter;
<P>
<DD>2. <I>Welcomes</I> the intention expressed by certain States that they will provide or 
support immediate assistance, in accordance with the Charter, to any non-nuclear-
weapon State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that 
is a victim of an act or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons 
are used;
<P>
<DD>3.  <I>Reaffirms</I> in particular the inherent right, recognized under Article 51 of the 
Charter, of individual and collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a 
Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures 
necessary to maintain international peace and security.

<H3>UN General Assembly Commends Work of the IAEA</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
In a resolution adopted this week, the United Nations General Assembly commended the IAEA for its nuclear 
verification efforts in Iraq and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and welcomed measures being 
taken to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system. The resolution was adopted in New York 1 November 1995.
<P>
The General Assembly further affirmed its confidence in the role of the IAEA in the application of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes; it urged all States to strive for effective and harmonious international co-operation in carrying 
out the work of the Agency; and it stressed the need for the highest standards of safety in the design and operation 
of nuclear installations so as to minimize risks to life, health and the environment.
<P>
The resolution further stated that the General Assembly:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"Welcomes the measures and decisions taken by the Agency to strengthen and fund its technical co-operation 
activities, and calls upon States to co-operate in implementing the measures and decisions pursuant thereto;"
<P>
<LI>"Appeals to all States to ratify or accede to the Convention on Nuclear Safety;"
<P>
<LI>"Welcomes the measures taken by the Agency in support of efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials or 
other radioactive sources;"
</UL>
<P>
In commending the Agency's work in the DPRK, the resolution stated that the General Assembly:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"Commends the Director General and the Secretariat of the Agency for their continuing impartial efforts to implement 
the safeguards agreement in force between the Agency and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including 
their efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as requested 
by the Security Council, expresses concern over the continuing non-compliance of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea with the safeguards agreement and urges the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to 
cooperate fully with the Agency in the implementation of the safeguards agreement and to take all steps the 
Agency may deem necessary to preserve, intact, all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and
completeness of the initial report of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the inventory of 
nuclear materials subject to safeguards until the Democratic People's Republic of Korea comes into full 
compliance with its safeguards agreement;"
</UL>
<P>
In commending the Agency's work in Iraq, the resolution stated that the General Assembly:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"Also commends the Director General of the Agency and his staff for their strenuous efforts in the implementation of 
Security Council resolutions <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/legal/unsc687.html>687 (1991)</A> of 3 April, 
<A HREF=/worldatom/glance/legal/unsc707.html>707 (1991)</A> of 15 August and <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/legal/unsc715.html>715 (1991)</A> of 11 October 1991, 
expresses deep concern that Iraq has, since 1991, withheld from the Agency information about its nuclear-weapon 
programme in violation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715 (1991), 
and stresses the need for Iraq to cooperate fully with the Agency in achieving the complete implementation of the 
relevant Security Council resolutions."

STATEMENT TO THE FIFTIETH SESSION OF THE<BR>
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
</H3>
<P>
<H4>
Dr. Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
International Atomic Energy Agency<P>
New York, 1 November 1995
</H4>
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
     On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, it might be
appropriate to review some of the main achievements and challenges facing the international
community in the field of competence of the IAEA, which was created to foster international
co-operation in the field of the peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy. 
<P>
<STRONG>The NPT Conference</STRONG>
<P>
     International efforts to promote the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and to
prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons have resulted in the non-proliferation regime,
with the Non-Proliferation Treaty at its centre and the IAEA providing the function of
verifying compliance with non-proliferation pledges.  In May this year, the Review and
Extension Conference of the NPT decided to extend the Treaty indefinitely.  This decision
underlined the broad and solid commitment of the then 178 parties to the Treaty.  In my
view, the extension decision and the principles and objectives and the strengthened review
process which were also adopted should be read as a collective commitment to the
exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and the renunciation of nuclear weapons; a
commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States not to acquire such weapons; and a commitment
by the weapon States to nuclear disarmament with the ultimate goal of eliminating these
weapons.
<P>
     The outcome of the NPT Conference has far-reaching implications for the future work
of the IAEA.  The Agency's role as a center for international co-operation in the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy was confirmed and the IAEA was expressly recognized as the
competent authority responsible for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements. The
Conference called on NPT parties with concerns regarding non-compliance with safeguards
agreements to direct such concerns, along with supporting evidence and information, to the
IAEA for it to consider, investigate, draw conclusions and decide on necessary actions in
accordance with its mandate.  The Conference further called for support of the Agency's
efforts to strengthen safeguards and to develop its capability to detect possible undeclared
nuclear activities.  I take this as a sign of trust in the Agency's existing role in the field of
verification.
<P>
     The Conference also expressed its support for an expanded IAEA role in verification.
It recommended that nuclear material released from military use be placed under IAEA
safeguards as soon as practicable, and that safeguards should be universally applied once the
elimination of nuclear weapons has been completed.
<P>
     The NPT Conference called for the early conclusion of an agreement to end the
production of nuclear material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and
endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones.   It also set 1996 as the target
date for the completion of a nuclear test ban, universally recognized as a vital component of 
the non-proliferation regime and an important step towards nuclear disarmament.  There is
an emerging consensus that IAEA safeguards would be an essential element of the
verification of a cut-off  agreement.  It is also to be expected, if the existing nuclear-weapon-free zone 
agreements are an indication, that the Agency would have a verification role in any
future nuclear-weapon-free zone.  With regard to a comprehensive test ban it is relevant to
note that such a ban - verified by the IAEA - is already in force for the more than 170 non-nuclear-weapon 
States who have accepted comprehensive IAEA safeguards on all their
nuclear activities.  These States are obliged not to use any nuclear material for explosions
and IAEA safeguards are required to verify that this obligation is respected.  What role the
Agency might be asked to assume under a comprehensive test ban treaty is still a matter of
discussion at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Entrusting the IAEA with the
verification function of a CTBT would undoubtedly save resources, which would seem
natural at a time when efforts are urged to avoid duplication, overlap and unnecessary cost
in the UN family.  It would also permit more rapid implementation.
<P>
<STRONG>Strengthening of the IAEA Safeguards System</STRONG>
<P>
     Credible IAEA verification of States' compliance with their nuclear arms control
pledges is becoming an increasingly important factor in global security and nuclear
disarmament.  The lessons of Iraq and the increasing demands placed on IAEA safeguards
have necessitated that its safeguards system be strengthened and made more cost-effective. 
In particular, governments and the public now demand that the IAEA safeguards system
should have the capacity to detect any secret, undeclared nuclear material and installations. 
There is also a greater understanding and readiness to accept that such verification must
comprise no-notice inspections, greater freedom of movement for the inspectors and use of
the most modern means of detection and communication.  The Agency's efforts to develop
a strengthened safeguards system have focused on three essential elements.  The first is
increased access to information about a State's nuclear activities, the second is broader access
to sites and locations within a State, the third is maximum use of new and available
technologies to increase detection capacity and, in due course, to reduce the frequency of on-
site inspection.  I am pleased to note that the Agency's Board of Governors has already
accepted the first part of the Agency programme to strengthen its safeguards system, the so-
called Programme 93 + 2.  The Secretariat is in a position to implement these new measures
after the required consultations with Member States.  The second part of the programme,
which relates to measures requiring additional legal authority, is due for consideration by the
Agency's Board of Governors within some months.  The test of any new measure is that it
enhances the effectiveness of the system and is cost-effective.  Experience gained in field
trials of some of the new measures suggests that they can be implemented without much
additional intrusion or cost to the States.
<P>
     On the other hand, a significant increase in the IAEA's verification effort in terms
of cost and resources may result if nuclear material released from the military programmes
of nuclear-weapon States are placed under IAEA safeguards, as urged by the NPT
Conference. Verification of some such material released from the weapons programme of the
United States was started a year ago.  These expanded efforts could require new
arrangements to ensure that the released material would permanently remain under safeguards
and that the financing of such verification is assured.
<P>
<STRONG>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)</STRONG>
<P>
     Last year I reported that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was not in full
compliance with its safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT.   This continues to be the
case.  In the framework that was agreed to between the DPRK and the USA on 21 October
1994, the DPRK agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its graphite-moderated reactors
and related facilities and stated its intention eventually to come into full compliance with the
safeguards agreement. As you are aware, the Security Council, confirming that the DPRK's
safeguards agreement remains in force and binding, requested the Agency to take the
necessary steps to monitor the freeze. With the authorization of  the Board, we have been
doing this inter alia through the maintenance of a continuous presence of Agency inspectors 
in the DPRK.  I can confirm that the freeze has been put into effect and  has been maintained
to date.  For the DPRK to come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement,
however, it must enable the Agency to verify effectively the accuracy and completeness of
the DPRK's declaration of its nuclear material subject to safeguards.  Until this co-operation
- long overdue - comes about, it is essential that all necessary steps be taken to preserve
information that may be relevant to the eventual verification of the DPRK's initial
declaration.
<P>
     Technical meetings have been held with the DPRK on a number of occasions to
discuss activities that are required by the Agency for it to fulfil its obligations under the
safeguards agreement including monitoring the freeze.  Since the first of these discussions
in November last year, arrangements have been made which enable the Agency to meet many
of its obligations.  However, a number of issues remain to be resolved, including the
measures required for the preservation of information.
<P>
<STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>
<P>
     Let me now turn to Iraq.  As I reported to the General Assembly last year, it is our
conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapon programme
have been identified and destroyed, removed or rendered harmless.  This assessment was not
based on faith in Iraqi statements, but on data gathered during inspection, on information
provided by the suppliers and Member States and, to a great extent, on analysis of the large
number of original documents which were obtained in Iraq early in the inspection process. 
Since August 1994, IAEA inspectors have been continuously present in Iraq to perform 
on-going monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions.  This does not exclude the further conduct of inspections for the purpose of
investigation, should such an investigation be called for, for example, to verify new
information.
<P>
     Recently the IAEA received additional information on Iraq's former nuclear weapons
programme by way of new declarations, voluminous documents and other materials, which
were transmitted to the IAEA and UNSCOM by Iraq following the departure of the former
Iraqi Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization.  What we have been told is that in
1990, Iraqi authorities instituted a crash project to take safeguarded highly enriched research
reactor fuel and transform the fissile material for use in a nuclear weapon.  It is uncertain
whether Iraq would have been able to overcome the considerable technical difficulties
involved in this project.  As it was, the project was made impossible by damage inflicted on
the nuclear research centre at Tuwaitha by the January 1991 bombing and the safeguarded
nuclear fuel was fully accounted for in the IAEA post-war inspection.  The new Iraqi
declarations, along with all of the documents and materials to which I have referred, are
currently being carefully examined for any new data.  What can be concluded at this stage
is that Iraq's withholding of information, documents and materials clearly constitutes a breach
of Iraqi obligations under the Security Council resolutions and that the crash programme was
in violation of the safeguards agreement and the NPT.
<P>
<STRONG>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones</STRONG>
<P>
     As requested last year by the Agency's General Conference, the Agency has continued
to assist the African States in their effort to establish an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone
and in particular to help elaborate its verification regime.  A draft treaty text which, inter
alia, entrusts the Agency with the task of verification, was adopted by the African Heads of
States in Addis Ababa last June and is now before the General Assembly.  We look forward
to performing the verification role in an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. 
<P>
     The General Conference of the IAEA continues to call upon all parties directly
concerned in the Middle East to consider taking the practical  and appropriate steps required
to establish a mutually and effectively verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East
region.  This year's resolution once again requested the Director General to continue
consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region and the preparation of model
verification agreements as a step toward to the establishment of such a zone.  I intend to
continue my visits to and consultations with States in the region in order further to explore
the verification questions and the material obligations which may be agreed upon and which
may call for verification.
<P>
<STRONG>Trafficking in Nuclear Materials</STRONG>
<P>
     For the last two years the international community has been expressing alarm at the
number of incidents of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials as well as other radioactive
sources.  Although the reported cases in 1995 show a decreasing trend, this is no cause for
complacency.  It is clear that greater efforts are needed and that States must pay increased
attention to the physical protection of all radioactive material - and especially weapons
useable nuclear material - whether in use, transport or storage.  While the primary
responsibility in the field of illegal trafficking falls upon the State concerned, authorities in
many countries, as well as a number of international organizations, are seeking to strengthen
and co-ordinate their efforts to better protect and control radioactive materials.  The IAEA
has recently hosted a large inter-agency meeting for that purpose.
<P>
     Within the IAEA a plan of action has been put in place.  The Agency is establishing
a data base of trafficking incidents to provide factual information to Member States'
governments and to the public.  Further, as effective national accounting and protection is
the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands,
the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of
accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and
technology.  The Agency has also co-ordinated technical support efforts in the upgrading of
physical protection of nuclear material in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet
Union, with the assistance of many donor countries. 
<P>
<STRONG>Nuclear Safety</STRONG>
<P>
     Since the Chernobyl accident, the Agency's role in the field of nuclear safety has been
gradually expanding.  In addition to the sharing of information and the development of safety
guidelines and standards, the Agency has moved progressively in the field of providing
advisory services to Member States, such as the Operational Safety Advisory Review Teams
(OSARTs) which provide expert services in assessing and advising on operational safety of
power reactors, and the Analysis of Safety Significant Events Teams (ASSETs).  Agency
work on assessment of the safety of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and countries
of the former Soviet Union has continued; an international consensus now exists on the major
safety issues and their significance for each of the various reactor types.  The emphasis is
now shifting to a review of the status of implementation of the proposed safety improvements
and to the collection of up-to-date information on the upgrading situation at each of the
reactors involved.  The results of our work provides input into bilateral and multilateral
assistance projects co-ordinated by the G-24 mechanisms in Brussels. 
<P>
     The decision to operate - or not to operate - a reactor is a national prerogative.  The
IAEA has not been given any supranational competence in this regard.  However, the Agency
continues to provide, upon request, expert advice on the safety of reactors and on safety
improvements needed.  On some occasions the Agency has advised that it would be
imprudent for a particular reactor to operate unless safety improvements were ensured.
<P>
     No nuclear accident has been the subject of more analysis, both as regards its causes
and its consequences, than the one at Chernobyl.  Even so - or perhaps precisely for this
reason - the accounts and explanations vary considerably, especially as to the radiological
impact of the accident on the health of the affected people and the environment.  It is
evidently desirable that this impact be scientifically established as is the radiological impact
of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs.  On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of
the tragic accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986, the Agency and
several other organizations - e.g. the WHO and EU - are organizing, in April next year, an
international conference to seek a common understanding of the nature and magnitude of the
consequences of that accident.  Let me add that while such understanding is highly desirable,
there is no reason for anybody to delay action and assistance to alleviate the situation of the
people concerned.  Many inquiries following the Chernobyl accident have documented the
distressing situation in which they live. 
<P>
     In the field of nuclear power safety, the IAEA has long issued recommendations based
on best experience and practice.  More recently the Agency has also moved to developing
binding international safety standards.  This is a clear manifestation of the increased interest
of the international community that nuclear safety be at a high level everywhere.  There is
a growing realization that an accident anywhere is an accident everywhere.  A major
accomplishment was the adoption in June last year of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  So
far the Convention has been signed by 59 States.  It may be expected to enter into force next
year.  This month representatives of signatories of the Convention  and other interested States
will hold their second meeting to discuss matters relating to the implementation process.
<P>
     Still in the field of nuclear safety and security, let me note that these subjects will be
taken up at a summit meeting to be hosted in Russia next spring.  It is to be hoped that the
summit will give political impetus to work in the field of nuclear safety and security, thereby
reducing risks and making nuclear power more broadly acceptable to the public.
<P>
<STRONG>Nuclear Waste</STRONG>
<P>
     Nuclear waste disposal remains a major concern among the public in many countries. 
This concern might lessen when governments and industry have actually established
repositories for wastes of different levels of radioactivity.  From the scientific and technical
standpoint there are no serious obstacles to the building of repositories which remain safe for
extremely long periods of time.  The selection of disposal sites, however, often meets with
opposition.  We can only place our faith in the effect of rational argument. An open dialogue
with the public is required.  The IAEA continues to be active in the field of radioactive waste
management, including providing assistance to developing States in building up
infrastructures for waste management, and promoting the minimization, safe processing,
storage and disposal of radioactive wastes. I am pleased to report that work has already
started on the preparation of a Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive Waste
providing binding standards.  Significant  progress has been made and it is to be hoped that
a final draft could perhaps be ready sometime next year.
<P>
<STRONG>Energy to Support Sustainable Development</STRONG>
<P>
     One of the greatest challenges facing the international community is to find the proper
means of providing sufficient energy for sustainable development.  That is to say providing
energy without unacceptable damage to the environment.  Experts have concluded that goals
to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels are not attainable by the year 2000 under
present conditions.  In national action reports prepared by parties to the Framework
Convention on Climate Change many countries report that they will not achieve the goal they
have set for themselves, goals that they have already agreed are not adequate for the long
term.  Indeed, looking around in the world we can easily see how the need for development
and the correlated need for greater energy use is leading to the construction of ever more
installations burning coal, oil or gas.  Extensive analysis of energy options is clearly needed
if we are to resolve the dilemma between development and preservation of the environment.
<P>
     It is not very meaningful to analyse the economic and ecological aspects of any given
energy option in isolation.  All sources and uses of energy have their risks - as, indeed, an
absence of energy carries risks.  Only an analysis of different options side by side can tell
us which energy policy is economically and ecologically least burdensome.
<P>
     The IAEA is co-operating with several international organizations in drawing up
methodologies and data bases for comparative assessment of different options for the
production of electric power.  An international symposium addressed this issue in Vienna last
month.  This is an area where difficult policy decisions must be taken.  Governments need
to devise long-term energy policies that are economically and ecologically acceptable.  Solar
power, wind power, biomass and other renewables will bring a valuable but minor
contribution to the global energy supply within the next few decades.  There is scope for
more efficient energy use, and it should be promoted.  In most places it will not offset the
need for additional energy and it is evident that developing countries will need energy in
much greater amounts.  There are no new energy sources on the horizon that can magically
meet these needs.  Fusion is still very distant.
<P>
     Expansion of nuclear power, which now provides about 8% of the world's energy and
17% of its electricity, could provide a part of the solution on the supply side without
increasing emissions of <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>,
<FONT SIZE=4>SO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> or <FONT SIZE=4>NO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>x</SUB></FONT>.  
The main obstacle to increased use of nuclear
energy is public concern with safety, radioactive waste and non-proliferation. Any particular
energy mix chosen has to be based on comparative risk assessment of the various sources of
energy and will need to be thoroughly explained to the public.  The IAEA will continue to
make available the data that are relevant in this regard and factual information relevant to
nuclear safety radioactive waste and non-proliferation.   
<P>
     Few developing countries have a technological level and infrastructure that would
allow them to make use of the present type of nuclear power reactor.  It is to be hoped that
in the future smaller and less costly nuclear reactors will become available for use by
developing countries for the generation of electricity and perhaps in the desalination of water
to compensate for scarce fresh water resources.  Developing countries, members of the IAEA,
are keenly interested in these questions.  It is obvious that the rapidly increasing number of
cities of more than a million, even more than 10 million, inhabitants in developing countries
cannot be provided with electricity generated by, say, solar cells, wind mills or biomass. 
Their real choice for decades to come will be between fossil fuels and nuclear power.
<P>
<STRONG>Technical Co-operation</STRONG>
<P>
     At present only a few developing countries use nuclear power.  However, most of
them are intensely interested in non-power nuclear techniques that may help their
development and the IAEA is engaged in assisting the transfer of such techniques.  Emphasis
is being placed on techniques which will contribute to sustainable development, food
production and preservation, the harnessing of fresh water resources, industrial uses and the
promotion of human health. The Agency has undertaken several initiatives recently to strengthen its technical co-operation programme and to make it more effective and more
relevant to sustainable development. Working together with Member States, the Secretariat
has started preparing country programme frameworks which will help focus the technical co-
operation programmes on key areas of government priority, with fewer but better focused
projects.  Another measure planned is the promotion of technical co-operation among
developing countries or TCDC, with the aim of sub-contracting institutions in developing
countries which are recognized as centers of excellence in a particular field to implement
selected technical co-operation projects.
<P>
     At the NPT Review and Extension Conference all participants acknowledged the
importance of the work of the Agency as the principal agent for the transfer of nuclear
technology to developing countries and welcomed the successful  operation of the Agency's
technical assistance and co-operation programme. It was also recognized that the success of
these programmes depends on the availability of predictable resources.  I sincerely hope that
the Agency's Member States will pay their contributions to the technical co-operation fund
in full and in time for the Agency to be able to continue to perform its development mission
successfully.
<P>
<STRONG>Co-ordination in the UN System</STRONG>
<P>
     During the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations I cannot close my statement to
the General Assembly without some comments on co-ordination within the UN family, of
organizations and on effectiveness and efficiency. In both respects severe criticism has been
voiced.
<P>
     That co-ordination is difficult in a vast system of organizations, authorities and
administrations is no novelty to national governments, many of whom have experience of
similar problems, although they have the advantage of a central government and a legislature. 
Within the UN family action by ECOSOC and the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination (ACC) and under informal contacts and arrangements can help harmonize activities
and prevent some overlap. Between the IAEA and the United Nations, the most important
contacts occur in cases of non-compliance with safeguards agreements.  The cases of Iraq
and the DPRK have given us much experience in co-operation.
<P>
     The ACC, under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General, is increasingly - and, I
think, with some success - trying to ensure effective system-wide responses in matters - such
as sustainable development, African development, the role of women - which are relevant
in all or most organizations. The technique recently employed of indicating lead agencies
for certain questions may prove helpful.
<P>
<STRONG>Effectiveness and Efficiency in the UN System</STRONG>
<P>
     Effective action by organizations in the UN family is in many cases directly dependent
on the degree of co-operation that can be achieved between Member States.  There is also
much action that is undertaken mainly by the Secretariats.  Here effectiveness depends
largely upon the same factors as those which influence efficiency:  availability of adequate
and predictable resources, co-operation of States that may be affected and last, but not least,
the competence and skill of management and staff in the Secretariats.  We stand or fall on
the quality of our management and staff.  This is true of the IAEA and, I am sure, for the
other organizations in the UN family.
<P>
     The IAEA has some unique features which continue to serve us well in staffing, but
which may also deter some qualified experts to join us:  professional staff are not recruited
for a career in the IAEA but for a period of five to seven years.  This policy of rotation has
been followed to ensure a continuous influx of talents fresh from laboratories, nuclear
installations and other institutions, talents abreast of the latest developments in their field. 
To have the respect and co-operation of the experts with whom our staff interact in Member
States, our professional staff must be on par with the national experts.
<P>
<STRONG>Remuneration in the Common System</STRONG>
<P>
     I am not suggesting that there is a direct correlation between remuneration and work
delivery.  However, there is not the slightest doubt that when weighing the pros and cons of
employment in an international organization, remuneration, home leaves, education grants
for children, pension benefits, etc. have a very significant impact on potential candidates and,
hence, on our ability to recruit staff of the highest calibre.
<P>
     In this regard, the IAEA and other organizations are dependent upon the so-called UN
Common System of remuneration, to which we have adhered.  This system, as it now stands,
falls short on several counts.  Let me give you just a few illustrations.  We have general
service staff who turn down offers of posts at the professional level because this would lower
their salary.  Since 1984 professional remuneration in Vienna has lost about 20% of its
purchasing power.  A senior energy economist who goes from the Agency to the World Bank
may expect a 40 percent higher salary; a safeguards inspector who leaves the Agency for
EURATOM may expect his income to increase by at least one third.  We do not know how
many candidates refrain from applying for a job in the Agency because they are offered
better conditions elsewhere, but we know that only 4-6 percent of those who nowadays apply
for jobs with us meet our exacting recruitment standards.
<P>
<STRONG>Salary Increase for Improved Recruitment</STRONG>
<P>
     As Director General of the IAEA I joined other executive heads in a statement
recently adopted by the ACC which inter alia endorses the International Civil Service
Commission (ICSC) recommended salary increase which would bring UN remuneration into
the middle of the margin range approved by the General Assembly.  Such a step, in itself
urgently needed, would have to be subsequently supplemented, however, by a longer term
strategy of restoring competitivity.
<P>
     An improvement in the remuneration system is not a panacea to all the problems that
UN organizations are facing in management.  It might even look to some as an odd response
to a critical financial situation and to sharp criticisms for waste and inefficiency.  I would
submit, however, that the remuneration system is part of the present problem.  Unless
management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest
calibre from anywhere in the world - and this can only be done if remuneration is
internationally competitive and governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection
process  - it will be hard, if not impossible, to achieve the continuous improvement in quality
and efficiency that is rightly called for in the Secretariats of UN organizations.
<P>
     I am sorry to bring these mundane matters before you, but this august body, the
General Assembly, not only lays down political guidance to us in Vienna but also decides on
employment and other conditions which directly affect our and other international
organizations' ability to fulfil the  mandates given to us.
<P>
     Let me end on a nice note telling you that Vienna, although in some respects an
expensive city, is an excellent work station and the Austrian Government and the City of
Vienna the friendliest of hosts.

<H3>IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>                    
  
  Addressing the 50th session of the United Nations General Assembly today in New
  York, Director General Hans Blix of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
  emphasized the importance of international efforts to secure the safe and peaceful
  development of nuclear energy. He specifically reviewed developments in areas of 
  IAEA nuclear safeguards and verification; nuclear safety; nuclear power
  development; and technical co-operation.
<P>  
      Long a key component of the world's nuclear non-proliferation regime, the
  IAEA's safeguards system is being strengthened as part of  international steps against
  the further spread of nuclear weapons, he noted.  "Governments and the public now
  demand that the system should have the capacity to detect any secret, undeclared
  nuclear material and installations," Dr. Blix said, citing lessons from the Agency's
  ongoing nuclear inspections in Iraq under mandate of the UN Security Council.  The
  stronger safeguards system now being developed, he said, focuses on a number of
  essential elements:  increased access to information about a State's nuclear activities;
  broader access to sites and locations within a State; short-notice inspections; and the
  maximum use of new and available technologies to increase detection capacity. 
  <P>
      He further pointed out that IAEA verification of States' compliance with their
  nuclear arms-control pledges is becoming an increasingly important factor in global
  security and nuclear disarmament.   He noted the Agency's verification of nuclear
  material released from the military programmes of nuclear-weapon States. "These
  expanded efforts could require new arrangements to ensure that the released material
  would permanently remain under safeguards and that the financing of such
  verification is assured," he said.  Possible new verification roles for the Agency
  additionally are emerging from other arms-control and disarmament initiatives, Dr.
  Blix said, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which States seek to
  conclude in 1996.  Of relevance to note, he said, is that the IAEA already verifies
  such a ban in more than 170 States which have accepted comprehensive Agency
  safeguards on all their nuclear activities.
  <P>
      The Director General also addressed Agency efforts against illicit trafficking
  in nuclear materials.  "It is clear that greater efforts are needed and that States must
  pay increased attention to the physical protection of all radioactive material, and
  especially weapons useable nuclear material, whether in use, transport, or storage,"
  he said.  While the States concerned carry the primary  responsibility in combatting 
  <P>                                                                                                           
  illegal trafficking, Dr. Blix said that steps are being taken to improve international
  co-ordination of efforts.  The Agency's actions, he noted, include establishing a
  database of trafficking incidents in support of factual analyses and technically
  assisting States in areas of nuclear material accountancy and control, and in physical
  protection methods and technology.
  <P>
      Also commanding greater attention are issues of nuclear and radiation safety,
  Dr. Blix said.  Building on the IAEA's long-standing work in the field, States have
  developed binding international safety standards, he noted, notably in adopting the
  Convention on Nuclear Safety that is nearing entry into force, and in moving to
  finalize preparation of a Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety.  "There is a clear
  manifestation of the increased interest of the international community that nuclear
  safety be at a high level everywhere," Dr. Blix said.
  <P>
      The Director General further called for an expansion of nuclear power for
  electricity generation as part of steps to meet the world's growing needs for
  environmentally clean and economically proven energy sources.  He noted the
  Agency's co-operative work with seven international organizations for comparatively
  assessing the benefits and risks of different options for electricity production.  "All
  sources and uses of energy have their risks," he said, "as indeed an absence of energy
  carries risks.  Only an analysis of different options side by side can tell us which
  energy policy is economically and ecologically least burdensome." 
  <P>
      In underlining the high interest of States, particularly developing countries, in
  peaceful nuclear applications, Dr. Blix reviewed initiatives the Agency is taking to
  strengthen its technical co-operation programme.  Emphasis is being placed on
  nuclear techniques and targeted projects that will contribute to sustainable
  development, food production and preservation, the harnessing of fresh water
  resources, industrial applications, and the promotion of human health, he said.
  <P>
      Dr. Blix concluded by commending efforts to improve the effectiveness of
  global co-operation and the efficiency of intergovernmental organizations.  "Effective
  action by organizations in the UN family is in many cases directly dependent on the
  degree of co-operation that can be achieved between States," he said.  "There is also
  much action, however, that is undertaken mainly by the Secretariats.  Here,
  effectiveness depends largely upon the availability of adequate and predictable
  resources, co-operation of States that may be affected, and last, but not least, the
  competence and skill of management and staff in the Secretariats.  We stand or fall
  on the quality of our management and staff."

The first technical session of the Symposium, chaired by the Director 
of Tata Energy Research Institute (India), Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, set 
the stage by highlighting the key issues to be addressed for 
implementing sustainable electricity policies in developing countries, 
countries in transition and industrialised countries.  The different 
view points that were presented illustrated that there is a wide range 
of issues of concern to decision makers in various regions and that 
there may be greatly different priorities according to the level of 
social, economic and industrial development in a given country.  As 
already pointed out by Dr. Blix in his opening statement on the first 
day of the Symposium, developing countries starving for energy are 
placing emphasis in the first place on adequate electricity supply and 
on mitigating local environmental impacts.  Countries in transition 
are faced with financing difficulties and adaptation of industrial 
structures to market economy.  Industrialised countries that are 
implementing a number of technical options and policy measures for 
alleviating health and environmental impacts of electricity systems, 
need further experience to assess the effectiveness of alternative 
strategies.  Dr. Pachauri highlighted in his concluding remarks the 
need for international co-operation in order to enhance exchange of 
experience and technology transfer, and facilitate the implementation 
of measures that benefit to several countries and address a range of 
local, transboundary and global issues. Dr. Pachauri stressed also 
that the sustainability goals require to keep  open all technological 
options, including nuclear power, in particular in developing 
countries,
<P>
The second session, chaired by Prof. Mohan Munasinghe from Sri Lanka, 
focused on the assessment of health and environmental impacts from 
energy systems.  The presentations pointed out the progress made in 
assessing health and environmental impacts of energy chains for 
electricity generation.  In particular, the increasing awareness of 
potential damages to health and the environment from electricity 
systems has led to extensive in-depth studies aiming towards 
analysing, measuring and valuing these impacts.  Moreover, 
methodologies and computer tools have been implemented to support 
integrated electricity system analysis for decision making.  Progress 
have been made on valuing health and environmental impacts as a means 
for integrating these aspects into economic comparisons of alternative 
electricity strategies.  The examples provided by China and Brazil 
demonstrate that health and environmental concerns are indeed 
addressed in developing countries and that measures are taken to 
assess, alleviate and mitigate the impacts.  However, Prof. Munasinghe 
stressed in his concluding remarks, summarising the presentations and 
discussions, that scientists and analysts have still a long way to go 
for helping decision makers.  More has to be done in: investigating 
comprehensively transboundary and global issues such as greenhouse gas 
emissions and impacts; assessing and valuing very long term effects 
that might arise from chemical and radioactive waste disposal for 
example; and exploring all potential impact pathways.  Uncertainties 
prevailing on data and models make it impossible to give definitive 
answers to all questions and decision makers remain responsible for 
making the final judgements and trade offs.  There is a need for more 
co-operation and exchange between analysts and decision makers aiming 
to transfer adequate information and messages from analytical studies 
to those responsible for policy making.
<P>
The software demonstrations and poster sessions provided the 
participants with concrete illustrations of the capabilities of 
decision aiding computer tools and of their application in decision 
support studies for the power sector.
<P>
The coming technical sessions will shed more light on integrated 
frameworks for comparative assessment and their implementation in the 
decision making process.

<B>Wednesday, 18 October 1995</B> <I>Highlights on the greenhouse gas emission issues</I></A>
<P>
Dr. Yoshji Uchiyama from the Central Research Institute of Electric Power
Industry (Japan) presented figures on greenhouse gas emissions from electricity
generation and supply systems that highlighted the advantages of hydro, nuclear
power and solar photovoltaic as compared to fossil fuel systems. Dr. Uchiyama
showed that, taking into account the entire energy chains and carrying out life cycle
analysis: coal, oil and gas systems emit respectively some 270, 190 and 180 grams of
carbon per kWh generated. On the other side, hydropower, nuclear power and solar
photovoltaic emit respectively some 5, 6 and 35 grams of carbon per kWh.
Dr. Uchiyama pointed out that technological improvements are expected to reduce
significantly the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity systems. LNG combined
cycle will emit 140 grams of carbon per kWh as compared to 180 g/kWh with currently
used gas fired chains. The progress are even more significant for nuclear power and
photovoltaic. Advanced nuclear reactors with closed fuel cycle will emit some 2 to 3
grams of carbon per kWh (versus 6 g/kWh with current nuclear technology) and
photovoltaic systems, using amorphous silicon, will emit 8 grams of carbon per kWh
(versus 35 g/kWh with photovoltaic power plants in operation at present).
<P>
Similar figures and conclusions were presented by Dr. Stefan Hirschberg from
the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) drawing from a life cycle analysis of
electricity generation chains existing in Switzerland. Dr. Hirschberg showed that
nuclear power emits some one hundred time less greenhouse gases than hard coal
chains and ten time less than presently used solar systems. Dr. Hirschberg pointed
out the importance of life cycle analysis, showing that for fuel cycles other than fossil
the power plant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is insignificant while the
other steps of the chain are responsible for all or the major share of these emissions
owing to energy and material consumption. In the Swiss context, expected
technological improvements will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by some 30% for
the coal fired and nuclear systems; for solar systems, a reduction by a factor of five of
greenhouse gas emissions is expected with the introduction of amorphous silicon panels.

<H3>Objectives & Scope</H3></A>
<P>

It is now recognised that market forces alone do not allow to fully reflect economic, social, health and environmental
aspects in technology choices. The need for comparative assessment of different energy chains in the process of decsion making for the power sector has been highlighted by a number of international fora. The implementation of
comparative assessment in support of decision making calls for enhancing co-operation between analysts and policy makers. Recognising the importance of these issues, many international,
regional and national organisations have established programmes of work on data bases, analytical models and improved methodological framework for comparative assessment.
<P>
The inter-agency joint project (DECADES) on data bases and methodologies for comparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity generation was established in this context by nine international
organisations: the European Commission (EC), the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD (OECD/NEA), the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The overall objective of the DECADES project is to build capabilities for incorporating economic,
health and environmental aspects in the process of decision making for the power sector.
<P>
This Symposium is convened by the sponsoring organisations, in the framework of the DECADES project, in order to enhance and strengthen information sharing and co-operation between interested and affected parties in the field
of electricity demand analysis and supply planning, aiming at implementing sustainable policies in the power sector, taking into account economic, social, health and environmental aspects.
<P>
The main objective of the Symposium is to bring together senior experts in the field of electricity system analysis and planning, for exchanging information and views on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key issues to be addressed in electricity system analysis for policy making;
<LI>The need for comparative assessment and integrated approaches;
<LI>The feedback from experience in developing comparative assessment methodologies and using them in support of policy making.
</UL>
<P>
The Symposium will offer a forum to present and discuss the findings and conclusions from international, regional and national programmes and projects on comparative assessment of different energy systems. The presentations will
address key issues related to comparative assessment in the power sector, methodologies and data required, and the implementation of sustainable
policies.
<P>
The round table will draw some conclusions and indicate areas in which further work needs to be undertaken, in particular by international organisations, in the field of comparative assessment aiming towards the implementation of enhanced decsision making processes for the power sector.
<P>
Poster sessions will illustrate specific issues and concrete applications of comparative assessment and software demonstrations will provide information on state-of-the-art computer tools, data bases and analytical models, which are available for
assisting planners and decision makers.
<P>
The proceedings, containing keynote addresses, invited papers, poster presentations and a summary of the round table discussions, will be published as soon as possible after the Symposium.

<P><HR>



     I welcome you all to this International Symposium, which addresses some topics of
great concern to decision makers who have to devise policies for sustainable energy
production and electricity generation.  The Symposium will examine the economic, health
and environmental aspects of different energy sources, and it will consider how the presently
available methodologies and tools for comparative assessment could be adapted better to
provide the types of information needed by decision makers.
<P>
     I am pleased that the IAEA is hosting this Symposium, but I want to stress that it is
co-operative effort by the 10 sponsoring organizations. The broad sponsorship of and wide
participation in the Symposium show that the subject matter is high on the agenda of analysts
and policy makers.
<P>
     As an introduction, I would like to share with you some  thoughts on the opportunities
and challenges for the power sector, from my perspective, and also briefly describe the
IAEA s activities in the field of comparative assessment.
<P>
     I start from several basic premises, which may not be shared by all:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI>    Energy use will grow significantly, especially in developing countries.
          Continued improvements in efficiency of energy production and use will be
          very important, but will by no means offset the strong growth in demand.  For
          example, a study by China s State Science and Technology Commission
          estimates that by the middle of the next century the country s total energy
          demand will be some 4 to 5 billion tons of coal equivalent, or about four
          times today s demand. This means that in 50 years time China s energy
          demand will be nearly as great as the total energy demand of all OECD
          countries (including the U.S.) today, which is some 6.5 billion tons of coal
          equivalent.
<P>
     <LI>    Fossil fuels now dominate the global energy supply, and this domination can
          be expected to continue.  For example, over the next two decades India plans
          to treble, and China  to double, the consumption of coal for electricity
          generation. A growing global consumption of fossil fuels is viewed as
          increasingly problematic for environmental reasons, notably the risk of global
          warming that is linked to the increasing emissions of greenhouse gases,
          especially <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> from the burning of fossil fuels.
<P>
     <LI>    Solar power, wind power, biomass and other renewables (other than
          conventional, large-scale hydro power) will bring a valuable, but minor,
          contribution to the global energy supply in the coming decades. The views
          expressed in one of the response strategies devised by the Intergovernmental
          Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for reducing the risk of global warming,
          arguing that renewable energy could cover some 80% - and biomass some
          50% - of the world s energy needs a hundred years from now, is viewed as
          completely unrealistic by many - and I think most - experts.
<P>
     <LI>    Nuclear fusion, as a practical source of energy, is viewed as very distant. If
          the world were looking for an existing nearly economically viable technology
          for an almost inexhaustible electricity supply, it could have it in breeder
          reactors - of which several are in operation. However, while the world has
          been living for decades with vast quantities of plutonium ready to be exploded
          in bombs, it seems reluctant to accept plutonium as a fuel for electricity
          generation.
<P>
     <LI>    Expansion of nuclear power, which now provides about 7% of the world s
          commercial energy and 17% of its electricity, could provide at least an
          important part of the solution to the problem of increasing energy supply
          without increasing emissions. Nuclear energy contributes practically no <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>,
          <FONT SIZE=4>SO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> or <FONT SIZE=4>NO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>x </FONT></SUB>emissions. 
          It is already today of significance in helping us to
          limit emissions into the atmosphere. If the some 430 nuclear power reactors
          operating today were replaced by coal fuelled plants, there would be an
          increase of more than 8% in the global <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> emissions from energy use.
<P>
     <LI>    However, a broad sector of public opinion in many countries - especially
          industrialized ones - is hesitant or opposed to an increased use of nuclear
          power, or even a continuation at present levels. Mainly three factors prompt
          these attitudes: fear of accidents, fear of long-lived radioactive wastes, and
          fear that use of nuclear power might contribute to proliferation of nuclear
          weapons. The last point is probably the least important. The expansion of
          nuclear power has not led to proliferation of nuclear weapons. Rather, we
          have seen a continuous increase in the number of countries committing
          themselves to non-proliferation. This factor and accelerating nuclear
          disarmament will probably reduce the link between nuclear weapons and
          nuclear power in the public s mind.
<P>
     <LI>    In general, environmentalist groups are adamantly opposed to nuclear power
          and urge more vigorous efforts for energy conservation, the development and
          greater use of renewables, and new lifestyles as means to respond to the threat
          of global warming. However, there are examples of different opinions among
          responsible and uncommitted organizations, such as the Club of Rome which
          a few years ago came to the conclusion that the use of fossil fuels is probably
          more dangerous to society - because of the <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> 
          they produce - than nuclear energy.
<P>
</UL>
     In the face of these contradictory premises, it will be a major challenge for the energy
sector and especially for the electric power sector - in both industrialized and developing
countries - to get public acceptance for any policy ensuring sustainable and adequate energy
supplies. For a time, and in some countries, one can try to postpone decisions in the hope
that they will be less difficult later. If there is a need for more electricity, however, this
option may not be available. When this need is pressing today, the decision in industrialized
countries often is a greater reliance on natural gas on the grounds that it is economically
viable, and that it appears to be environmentally attractive since the <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> emissions from gas
are about half those from coal, per unit of energy produced. However, the leakages of
methane from gas extraction sites and gas pipe lines are of the order of 5 to 10 percent,
which more than offsets the gains from the lower <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> emissions.
<P>
     The threat of global climate change is high on the agenda of governments, but we
have to note that - three years after the Rio  Earth Summit  which set ambitious targets for
sustainable development - the progress made worldwide, for example in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, is extremely small, not to say negligible.  Carbon dioxide emissions have
slowed only marginally in industrialized countries - mainly due to the recent economic
recession - and have continued to increase significantly in most developing countries, owing
to energy demand growth and reliance on fossil fuels as the most readily available energy
source.
<P>
     Indeed,  sustainable development  in the field of energy seems to have quite different
meanings in different regions and fora, and to be difficult to put into practice. The first
Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in
Berlin at the end of March 1995, showed that reaching an international consensus on
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will take some time.
<P>
     The medium-term outlook is not better. In particular, the expected continued dramatic
growth in energy and electricity consumption in Asia will lead to drastic increase of
greenhouse gas emissions, if measures are not taken soon to reduce the share of fossil fuels,
especially coal, in electricity generation. In Eastern Europe, energy consumption has
flattened due to the economic stagnation that has occurred; however, as the economies of the
region begin to recover and grow, these countries will also be faced with increases in
emissions, unless effective control and mitigation measures are implemented. In Western
Europe too, according to the findings of a number of recent studies, carbon dioxide emissions
will continue to grow after the turn of the century. The mothballing of nuclear programmes
in some countries and the commissioning of new gas fired or coal fired power plants are the
main causes of this trend. I cannot fail to add that the case of France, where more than 75%
of electricity is produced by nuclear power, clearly demonstrates that nuclear power could
play a major role in reducing <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>, 
<FONT SIZE=4>SO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=4>NO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>x</SUB></FONT> emissions, while enhancing the economic
competitiveness of industry.
<P>
     Also, a study commissioned by the Institute of Energy Economics in Japan has
concluded that if carbon dioxide emissions are to be curbed to the 1990 levels, Japan will
need anywhere from 160 to 300 GW(e) of nuclear power by the end of 2100. At present,
Japan has 38 GW(e) of nuclear capacity.
<P>
     I do not suggest that nuclear power alone could solve all of the problems involved in
achieving a secure and sustainable energy supply worldwide. However,  together with
renewable sources and energy conservation, nuclear power could play a very significant role
in strategies aiming towards this goal. The two cases I have just mentioned are good
illustrations.
<P>
     I am fully aware that the issues are fraught with emotional reactions and that
governments must pay attention to public opinion. However, it seems to me that if we have
sincerely and scientifically identified some severe threats being caused by our present energy
policies, we must assess and compare on a  level playing field  - that is, rationally -  all the
available energy supply options - renewable, fossil and nuclear - taking into account their
complete fuel cycles, their technical and economic performance, and their impact on health
and the environment. This is the focus of the Agency's programme on the comparative
assessment of energy sources, and also of the DECADES project within which this
Symposium is organized.
<P>
<CENTER>
                                 * * * * *
</CENTER>
     Let me now give you some glimpses of the Agency s activities in the field of
comparative assessment of energy sources, in particular for electricity generation.
<P>
     There is no single United Nations organization - or other world-wide
intergovernmental organization - that covers comprehensively all the issues - including the
social, health and environmental impacts - related to energy and electricity production and
use.  However, there are an increasing number of joint programmes of work which bring
together the expertise and know-how of different international organizations.
<P>
     The IAEA has a long tradition in the analysis and planning of energy and electricity
systems.  In response to requests from its Member States, the Agency has implemented and
disseminated energy and electricity system analysis models that are widely used by national
institutes and other international organizations. Within the Technical Co-operation
Programme of the IAEA, a large number of projects are devoted to supporting Member
States in the field of energy and electricity system analysis and planning. These projects
examine not only the nuclear power option, but also fossil and renewable energy systems.
The IAEA does by no means blindly counsel the use of nuclear power. Indeed, in many cases
the nuclear option would be inappropriate.
<P>
     While earlier it was considered that the  cheapest energy was the best energy , and
accordingly the analysis of energy options did not have many dimensions, the increasing
concerns about the social, health and environmental impacts of energy production and use
has led to a broadening of the analysis that is necessary. In order to assist in more
comprehensive comparative assessments in the power sector, the Agency has since the 1980's
broadened the scope of its analytical activities to incorporate those concerns together with the
traditional economic and technical comparisons.  Moreover, a close co-operation on these
matters has been established and maintained by the IAEA with other international
organizations.  The co-operation includes exchange of information, task sharing and joint
activities in order to avoid duplication and to enhance the overall efficiency of the
programmes carried out in the respective organizations as well as the quality and credibility
of their results.
<P>
     More recently, the Agency programme has put increased emphasis on global climate
change issues, especially on the potential role of nuclear power and other energy options in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Contributions were provided to the Second Assessment
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our work in this field
will continue in connection with the Framework Convention on Climate Change and with the
ongoing work of IPCC. In 1997-1998, the Agency s programme on comparative assessment
of energy sources will be strengthened and redefined, building upon the results and outcomes
of the current work.  I trust that the presentations and discussions during this Symposium will
provide concrete guidance on the priority issues that are to be addressed by the Agency's
programme.
<P>
     The present Symposium is one milestone in a continuing process of dialogue and
exchange of views among experts from Member States and representatives from international
organizations.  It is a direct follow-up of the Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and
the Environment, which was jointly organized by the IAEA and ten other international
organizations and held in Helsinki in May 1991.  The Helsinki Symposium recommended
inter alia that programmes of research on comparative assessment of electricity generation
options and strategies be undertaken, and stressed that international organizations having a
mandate in this field should play a leading role and should co-operate to provide improved
databases and methodologies for comparative assessment.
<P>
     The DECADES project, which is carried out jointly by nine international
organizations, was initiated by the IAEA in 1992 in response to the recommendations of the
Helsinki Symposium and has led to the present meeting.  The objectives of the DECADES
project and its main results and outcomes will be presented to you later on, in particular by
the chairman of the Steering Committee for the project, Mr. Semenov.  At this stage, I
would like only to highlight that the co-operative framework that was adopted to carry out
this project has helped to ensure that there is an objective and comprehensive assessment of
all energy options for electricity generation.
<P>
     Coming to key issues for decision makers in the power sector, I would like, first of
all, to point out that an adequate electricity supply is a prerequisite for economic development
and for enhancing social welfare.  The positive aspects of electricity <B><I>use</B></I> should not be
overlooked in the process of assessing the potential negative impacts of its <B><I>production</B></I>.  For
a number of developing countries that are experiencing under-supply of electricity and power
cuts - which do have significant adverse economic impacts and also social, health and
environmental effects - the priority will continue to be on adding electricity generation
capacity at affordable costs.  For those countries, comparative assessment includes assessing
not only the potential negative impacts of different supply options, but also the impacts of
<B><I>non-supply</B></I>. You may recall that the famous Indian scientist Homi Bhabha coined the
expression,  "No energy is more expensive than no energy".
<P>
     According to estimates published by the International Energy Agency
<A NAME=1 HREF="#1"><I><U><TT><FONT SIZE=2><B>1</B></FONT></tt></U></I></A>, electricity
demand in developing regions of the world is projected to grow up to 2010 at a rate of about
5% per year, that is, about twice as high as the rate in OECD countries. If this demand is
met, it would mean that the electricity consumption per capita would almost double, from
just under 700 kW<STRONG>.</STRONG>h per capita to around 1200 kW<STRONG>.</STRONG>h per capita. Even so, this would still
be less than one sixth the electricity consumption per capita in the OECD, and in some
individual countries the levels would be far lower. This clearly indicates that further increase
in generating capacity is inevitable.
<P>
     A particular question is the impact of today s energy choices on tomorrow s world. 
Classic thermal power plants have typical life times of some 30 years, nuclear power plants
of the newest generation are expected to be in operation for around half a century, and hydro
power plants have even longer lifetimes.  Heavy metals in the wastes arising from fossil fuel
burning will remain toxic forever and some radioactive wastes have to be disposed of in
repositories ensuring their isolation from the biosphere over many thousands of years.
Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere might entail irreversible global
climate change.  In view of these long term effects of energy choices, care must be taken to
avoid energy policies and waste handling practices today that will lead to unacceptable effects
for future generations.
<P>
     In spite of the global attention that has been given to all aspects of energy supply
systems, we still face major areas of uncertainty. The uncertainties surrounding global
climate change issues illustrate this point. First, there is the uncertainty about the <B><I>amount</B></I>
of climate change that might result from rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the
earth's atmosphere. Secondly, there are difficulties in assessing and evaluating the overall
social, health and environmental <B><I>impacts</B></I> of global climate change, if it were to occur, in a
given country or region.
<P>
      Let me emphasize that nuclear power is one of the few energy sources for which the
risks and potential impacts have been recognized and dealt with from its very beginning. The
effects of radiation exposures due to nuclear power production are much better known - and
more strictly limited - than the effects of pollutants from other energy cycles. Furthermore,
the costs of minimizing these impacts are largely internalized in nuclear power generation
costs. For fossil fired power plants, the emissions of <FONT SIZE=4>SO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> 
and <FONT SIZE=4>NO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>x</SUB></FONT> can be reduced - at a
considerable cost - through the installation of scrubbing devices. In this area, I may mention
that the demonstration of electron beam accelerators as an advanced technique for flue gas
cleaning is being assisted by the Agency through its technical co-operation programme.
<P>
     Carbon dioxide emissions, however, cannot be controlled through economically viable
methods, and the assessment of the potential cost of <FONT SIZE=4>CO</FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> emissions, as well the finding of
ways to include this cost in the prices paid by consumers, is particularly difficult. Other
potential impacts from fossil fuel burning, for example those due to the toxic heavy metals
in the particulate emissions and solid wastes from coal burning, also are much less well
known than the effects of radiation.
<P>
     This points to the urgent need for further research in the field of impact assessment,
for evaluation of external costs, and for ways to include these externalities in the prices paid
for energy and electricity.
<P>
     Finally, I would like to stress the transboundary aspects of national power sector
policies.  While decisions about using or not using any given technology are and will remain
the prerogative of each country, it should be recognised that these decisions can have
significant impacts beyond the country s borders. Comparative assessment frameworks should
allow  analysis of transboundary impacts and reflect them in the choice of optimised
strategies for electricity system expansion. In this connection, international organisations can
play a key role in helping to build consensus on global priorities, which in turn will facilitate
the implementation of sustainable strategies in different countries - reflecting both regional
priorities and world-wide objectives.
<P>
     The issues that I have pointed to in these introductory remarks certainly are not
exhaustive, and I am sure that the experts participating in this Symposium will identify and
elaborate on a number of other important issues and initiate a more comprehensive discussion
on the challenges that decision makers will face in the coming years. This Symposium will
not address or solve all the problems. However, I do hope that it will offer opportunities for
a fruitful exchange of views between experts having a wide range of scientific backgrounds
and representing different regions of the world. Moreover, I am convinced that the
presentations and discussions will help to better understand the issues, and to highlight  ways
and means for addressing them. The findings and recommendations from the Symposium
should also identify areas where further work should be undertaken by international
organisations and national research institutes, with a view to a broader use of comparative
assessment as a part of the decision making process for the electric power sector.
<P>
     The challenges remain to design approaches that incorporate all relevant elements into
a comprehensive comparative assessment of different options and strategies, and to develop
enhanced databases, analytical methodologies and other decision-aiding tools upon which
policy makers can rely to support their decisions.  International organisations have an
important role to play in helping to meet these challenges. In particular, internationally
harmonised approaches - designed and agreed upon in a co-operative framework - may help
to address transboundary issues, such as acid rains, and global issues, such as greenhouse
gas emissions.
<P>
     I trust that these points and other issues will be discussed thoroughly during this
Symposium, and I look forward to the concrete outcomes, conclusions and findings that will
result from the presentations and discussions that will take place.
<P>
     I would now like to declare the Symposium to be officially opened.

<P>

<HR>
<P>
Before 1992, not much was known internationally about radioactivity levels from dumping operations in the Arctic Seas. That picture has changed over the past three years, largely due to the joint efforts of scientists from Russia, Norway, and the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco.
<P>
In 1992, the Agency's Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) responded to an invitation by the Russian and Norwegian governments to participate in investigatory cruises to the Kara Sea and to assist in the assessment programme related to the disposal of radioactive wastes in the Kara and Barents Seas. The IAEA-MEL programme, organized later in the framework of the Agency's IASAP project, included:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>participation on four expeditions to the Kara Sea organized by the joint Russian-Norwegian expert group and by the Russian Academy of Sciences during the period 1992-94;
<LI>assistance with in-situ and laboratory-based radiometric measurements of radionuclide concentrations in the Kara Sea;
<LI>organization of analytical quality assurance intercalibration exercises among the participating laboratories; 
<LI>provision of a central database facility for the IASAP project, including all available data on past and present radioactivity concentrations in the Arctic Seas; and
<LI>contributing to the international programme of local, regional, and global scale computer modelling of the potential dispersal of radionuclides released from the dumped waste and the assessment of the associated radiological consequences. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Expeditions to the Kara Sea</H3>
<P>
Few data exist in the open literature published before 1992 to document radioactivity levels in the Kara Sea. Those that exist are notably results of US and Russian surveys in the 1960s and 1980s. In 1992, following announcements about past dumping of radioactive wastes in the shallow waters off Novaya Zemlya, the Russian and Norwegian governments organized the first in a series of three joint expeditions to the Barents and Kara Seas and the IAEA was invited to participate in these. (See map.) 
<P>
The scope of the first cruise was to investigate radioactive contamination of the marine environment in the open Kara Sea, with the aim of identifying and quantifying any contributions from local sources. In 1993, official information on the dumping was published, on the basis of which the 1993 and 1994 joint Russian-Norwegian expeditions were then planned. The objectives were to investigate the dump sites in the Tsivolki, Stepovovo, and Abrosimov bays and in the Novaya Zemlya trough in order to locate and identify the dumped objects, to document their state, and to measure the radioactivity levels in their environment. The sites were inspected using towed sonar systems, underwater spectrometers, and remotely operated vehicles. 
<P>
The searches in the bays were successful. They yielded detailed information on dumped reactor compartments, cargo ships, and tankers with solid waste; the liquid metal-cooled submarine in Stepovovo Bay; and large numbers of containers with solid waste. All cruises performed in situ and on-board radiometric analyses and returned sets of environmental samples and data needed to allow an assessment of the environmental and health impacts of dumping.  
<P> 
The sampling strategy was aimed at (1) providing evidence of leakage, if any, from the dumped waste; (2) evaluating dispersal from the sources and mapping radionuclide distribution patterns in bottom sediments; (3) evaluating different contributions to the radionuclide inventories; (4) assessing contamination of biota, radionuclide transfer, and site-specific concentration factors; and (5) investigating the time evolution of radioactivity levels. 
<P>
Water and bottom sediment profiles, marine biota and, from the 1994 cruise, samples of soil, fresh water, and vegetation from the shores of the bays were collected for further detailed radionuclide analyses. This was done mainly in Russian and Norwegian laboratories and at IAEA-MEL. To assure the quality of radioactivity data, IAEA-MEL organized intercomparison exercises for radionuclides in sediment, water, and seaweed for the laboratories involved in analytical work on cruise samples. 
<P>
An important contribution to inventories of artificial radionuclides in the Kara Sea can be attributed to inputs from land-based sources in the catchment areas of the Ob and Yenisey rivers. Therefore, in 1993, the IAEA-MEL also joined an international expedition organized by the Russian Academy of Sciences to investigate radioactivity in the southern part of the Kara Sea.
<P>
At IAEA-MEL, the analytical work on approximately 300 samples brought back from these four expeditions is in progress. Laboratory experiments have also been initiated with materials returned from the Kara Sea on the biokinetics of radionuclides and their interaction with sediments in specific Arctic conditions.
<P>
<H3>Radiometric investigations</H3> 
<P>
The results of radionuclide analyses of samples collected during expeditions to the Kara Sea show unambiguously that, as yet, there has been no major leakage from the disposed radioactive wastes. Perhaps the most persuasive piece of confirmatory evidence is IAEA-MEL's investigation of gamma-radiation at the sediment surface in the Stepovovo Bay dump site. The gamma-spectrum - obtained using IAEA-MEL's new underwater survey system which includes a cooled HPGe detector - is one of the first sets of high resolution marine gamma-spectra ever recorded in-situ.  The system had first been tested successfully in the Irish Sea, near the Sellafield nuclear site, in summer 1993. 
<P>
The spectrum shows at a glance the predominance of the gamma-ray lines from naturally occurring (background) radionuclides, namely from potassium-40 and the uranium and thorium decay series. The only identifiable anthropogenic radionuclide is caesium-137 at a concentration which is well below those of the natural radionuclides. Despite the vicinity to the dumped reactors and the sites of many past nuclear weapons tests, the concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides are low, less than in many other areas of the world's oceans. (See graph.)
<P>
Radiometric analyses of Kara Sea sediments in the laboratory have also shown clearly that the present anthropogenic radioactivity of Kara Sea sediments is low. It is predominantly due to direct deposition and catchment run-off of global fallout from nuclear weapons tests, discharges from the reprocessing plants in Western Europe and the former Soviet Union, Chernobyl fallout, and local fallout from nuclear tests performed at Novaya Zemlya. However, at the major dumping sites in Abrosimov, Stepovovo, and Tsivolki bays off Novaya Zemlya island, areas with elevated concentrations of caesium-137 and cobalt-60 have been found. (See graph.) These results indicate that local contamination due to leakage from dumped low-level wastes has occurred but that this is not detectable beyond the dump sites.
<P>
Our study, along with the work of Russian and Norwegian colleagues, shows that there is no evidence of major leakage from the reactor components and other wastes disposed of into the Kara Sea. Past and present radionuclide concentrations in seawater and sediments of the Kara Sea have generally been and still remain very low. The major residual issue regarding these disposals is therefore not what has happened so far but what could happen in future. The main scientific challenge is to predict the possible magnitude, nuclide composition, dispersal, transfer, and radiological consequences of any future leakage from the dumped reactors and other nuclear wastes.
<P>
<H3>Radioactivity database</H3>
<P>
A further contribution by IAEA-MEL within the framework of  IASAP is via its Global Marine Radioactivity Database (GLOMARD) programme. The laboratory is acting as a central facility for the collection and synthesis of all data on marine radioactivity, i.e. in seawater, sediments, and biota. The database provides a scientific resource designed to serve several important functions, such as the provision of immediate and up-to-date information on radioactivity levels, the generation of snapshots of activities at given times and locations, the investigation of temporal changes, and the identification of gaps in available information. 
<P>
The database has links to IAEA-MEL's in-house analytical quality control database. This allows immediate checks on laboratory practice. In the specific context of the Arctic Seas, the database will provide input to the evaluation of the environmental radioactivity levels of the region and to the assessment of the radiation doses to marine biota and local, regional, and global human populations. Some of the uses of the database within the Arctic assessment programme are immediate. They include the evaluation of nuclide ratios, investigation of time trends, inventory calculations, dose estimation, and model validation.  
<P> 
<H3>Computer modelling and radiological assessment</H3> 
<P>
Dispersion and radiological modelling has begun on three geographical scales, namely global, regional and local. This is being done in order to predict the possible consequences for the world at large and for those populations living near to the disposal sites. For modelling dispersal of radioactive pollutants on a global scale, IAEA-MEL has developed and implemented a number of compartmental models. 
<P>
This class of models is particularly suited to long-range (greater than 100 years) assessments and has been previously used in other programmes (e.g. the Nuclear Energy Agency's CRESP and the European Commission's MARINA). The accuracy of results from such models is also well suited to the detail required for radiological assessments. 
<P>
The work reported here is based on the 16- box ARCTIC-2 model, with enhanced structure in the Arctic region. The model provides a satisfactorily accurate prediction of Sellafield caesium-137 dispersion through the northern seas. 
<P>
Doses to the world population (committed effective collective doses integrated over 300 years following release) and maximum individual dose rates for hypothetical critical groups were calculated based on the marine fish ingestion pathway. The oceanographic part of the model produces radionuclide concentration data as output. The radiological component translates radionuclide concentrations in water into corresponding concentrations in fish, using IAEA-recommended concentration factors. Catch values are derived from fishery statistics data of the Food and Agriculture Organization and ICES.  Radionuclide intake by humans is quantified assuming that 50% of total fish catch is normally consumed, with the exception of the Arctic Seas where a consumption of 80% is assumed. Fish catch is taken as constant over the period of interest, and no delay between catch and consumption is considered. The final conversion to dose is achieved using dose conversion factors for adults based on those contained in ICRP-60 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.
<P>
A range of source-term scenarios has been developed on the basis of available information on the nuclear wastes, including reactors, dumped in the Arctic. The calculations have been performed for 20 long-lived radionuclides both at time of dumping and 500 years thereafter.
<P>
For a gradual release of caesium-137 over 20 years following dumping from the naval reactors containing spent nuclear fuel disposed in the Kara Sea, the model predicts maximum concentrations of about 10 Bq per cubic meter averaged throughout the western Kara Sea bottom water compartment. This corresponds to less than 1% of the natural radioactivity of sea water. Local and regional models, with enhanced spatial resolution, will be used to localize and quantify smaller scale maxima. 
<P>
A simple evaluation was made, on the basis of available information, of the radiological effects for a worst case scenario. Dose calculations based on estimated maximum inventories in reactors dumped in the Kara Sea indicate a committed collective effective dose in the order of 10 man Sv, if instantaneous release occurs at the time of dumping. More than 70% of this dose is delivered by caesium-137, and most of the remaining part is contributed by activation products (cobalt-60 and carbon-14). These computations are based on the assumption that the fish catch in the Kara Sea is about 20 kilotons per year. 
<P>
The assumption of instantaneous nuclide release is, however, an extremely unrealistic one. The mechanism of release for the bulk part of the inventory would normally be via corrosion, occurring over periods of up to hundreds or even thousands of years. In particular, the dissolution of cobalt-60 from steel and other structural components is unlikely to be quantitative within the short mean lifetime (about 7.6 years) of this nuclide. Thus, from a rapid release of reactor-derived radionuclides, caesium-137 is indeed the main deliverer of dose beyond the immediate disposal region. For a delayed release of radionuclides, e.g. after 500 years of containment, 99% of the fish ingestion dose commitment will arise from carbon-14.
<P>
To assess the impact on a regional scale, three-dimensional circulation and dispersion models developed at the University of Hamburg are now being employed. Preliminary calculations performed to test model predictions show that, for a continuous release of 1 TBq per year of caesium-137 in Abrosimov Bay, the average caesium-137 concentrations in the entrance of the bay could reach 2 kBq per cubic meter.
<P>
<H3>Documenting the radiological situation</H3>
<P>
The IAEA-MEL's radiometric and preliminary modelling contributions to IASAP have yielded important results so far. They suggest that only radiological effects on regional and local scales may be of importance. The global radiological impact of past waste dumping in the Arctic Seas will be comparable to or less than those resulting from other anthropogenic and natural sources of radioactivity.  
<P> 
Scientists from IAEA-MEL will continue to be actively engaged in many facets of this important international project to investigate and document the health and environmental implications of past radioactive waste dumping practices in the Arctic Seas.

headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, 16-19 
October 1995. The main focus will be a comparative assessment of the impact on the 
environment of different energy sources for electricity production. Co-organizers with 
the IAEA are the European Commission (EC), the Economic and Social Comission of 
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), 
the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD (NEA), the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 
the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO).
<P>
In his opening speech the Director General of the IAEA, Dr. Hans Blix, pointed to the 
fact that three years after the "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro "the progress made 
worldwide, for example in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is extremely small, not to 
say negligible. Carbon dioxide emissions have slowed only marginally in industrialized 
countries - and that mainly due to the recent economic recession - and in most 
developing countries, have continued to increase significantly owing to energy demand 
growth and reliance on fossil fuels as the most readily available energy source".
<P>
The medium term outlook, according to Dr. Blix, is no better. "The expected continued 
dramatic growth in energy and electricity consumption in Asia will lead to drastic 
increase of greenhouse gas emissions, if measures are not taken soon to reduce the share 
of fossil fuels, especially coal, in electricity generation. In Eastern Europe, energy 
consumption has flattened due to the economic stagnation that  has occurred; however, 
as the economies of the region begin to recover and grow, these countries will also be 
faced with increases in emissions, unless effective control and mitigation measures are 
implemented. In Western Europe too, according to the findings of a number of recent 
studies, carbon dioxide emissions will continue to grow after the turn of the century."
<P>
The Director General called for a rational assessment and comparison of all available 
energy supply options - renewable, fossil and nuclear - taking into account their 
complete fuel cycles, their technical and economic performance, and their impact on 
health and the environment. "I do not suggest that nuclear power alone could solve all 
of the problems involved in achieving a secure and sustainable energy supply 
worldwide. However, together with renewable sources and energy conservation, nuclear 
power could play a very significant role in strategies aiming towards this goal."
<P>
Dr. Blix added: "within the Technical Co-operation Programme of the IAEA, a large 
number of projects are devoted to supporting Member States in the field of energy and 
electricity system analysis and planning. These projects examine not only the nuclear 
power option, but also fossil and renewable energy systems."  The Director General 
pointed to the IAEA's DECADES project which encompasses a data base and 
methodology for comparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity 
generation and is co-sponsored by all organizations at the symposium.
<P>
The main agenda topics of the International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the 
Environment are: Key issues for implementing sustainable electricity policies, the role 
of international co-operation; assessment of health and environmental impacts; 
implementation of comparative assessment; and national case studies.

<H2>The International Arctic Seas Assessment Project:<BR>
Progress report</H2>
<P>
<I>Under an IAEA-supported study, experts are taking a close look at past radioactive waste dumping in the Kara and Barents seas</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF=#reference>by Kirsti-Liisa Sjoeblom and Gordon S. Linsley</A></B>
<HR>
<P>
In 1992 the news that the former Soviet Union for over three decades had dumped large amounts of high-level radioactive wastes in the shallow waters of the Arctic Seas caused widespread concern, especially in countries with Arctic coastlines.
<P>
The IAEA responded by making a proposal for an international study to assess the health and environmental implications of the dumping. The proposal received support from the Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention 1972). The study became known as the International Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP) and was launched at a meeting jointly organized with the Norwegian and Russian Governments in Oslo in February 1993.
<P>
This article provides some background information on wastes dumped into the Arctic Seas and describes the progress made within the framework of IASAP.
<P>
<H3>International control of dumping</H3>
<P>
The first recorded sea disposal of radioactive wastes took place in 1946 at a site in the North-East Pacific Ocean, about 80 km off the coast of California. In subsequent years, as sea disposal became more widely used as a radioactive waste disposal option, the pressure for it to be controlled also increased. In response, the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was established in 1972 and entered into force in 1975. (This convention became well-known as the London Dumping Convention but has recently been renamed the London Convention 1972.) The Convention is recognized as the main international mechanism for the control of waste dumping at sea.
<P>
The Convention in its original form prohibited, inter alia, the dumping of high-level radioactive wastes and required that low-level radioactive wastes were dumped only after a special permit was issued. The IAEA was requested to provide a definition of high-level wastes unsuitable for sea disposal and provide recommendations concerning disposal sites, packages etc. for low-level waste disposal. Three documents were prepared to address the request. (<A HREF=#footnote>*</A>)
<P>
In 1983, following the concerns of some of the Contracting Parties to the Convention over the possible health and environmental risks which could be produced by the radioactive waste disposal operations, a voluntary moratorium on radioactive waste dumping at sea was imposed pending a wide-ranging review of the issue. The IAEA provided technical input to aid this discussion. In 1993 Contracting Parties to the Convention reached the decision to prohibit the sea dumping of all types of radioactive waste. It was noted that the decision on total prohibition was not reached on the basis of scientific and technical considerations but rather on social, moral, and political grounds.
<P>
<H3>Sea dumping by the former Soviet Union</H3>
<P>
Information on the sea dumping practices of the former Soviet Union was first made public by a Russian non-governmental environmental group, Towards a New Earth. Greenpeace International, as observer to the London Convention, brought the issue to the attention of the Convention in 1991 and again in 1992. As a result, the Russian Federation was urged by Contracting Parties to the Convention to present complete information on the subject. The IAEA, in this period, developed plans to initiate a project for assessing the consequences of the dumping on human health and the environment and these were subsequently endorsed by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The IAEA was requested to report the results of the assessment to the Convention. 
<P>
In May 1993 the Russian Federation provided information to the IAEA about the high- and low-level radioactive waste dumped in the Arctic Seas and in the North-East Pacific during the years 1959-92. According to this report, the total amount of radioactivity dumped in the Arctic Seas was more than 90 PBq (90 x 1015 Bq or 2.4 x 106 Ci). The items dumped included six nuclear submarine reactors and a shielding assembly from an icebreaker reactor containing spent fuel comprising a total of 85 PBq; ten reactors (without fuel) containing 3.7 PBq; liquid low-level waste containing 0.9 PBq; and solid intermediate- and low-level waste containing 0.6 PBq. The packaged and unpackaged solid waste and the nuclear reactors were dumped in the Kara Sea, in the shallow bays of Novaya Zemlya. The depths of the dumping sites there range from 12 to 135 meters, and in the trough of Novaya Zemlya, 300 meters. The liquid low-level waste was discharged in the open Barents and Kara Seas. <I>(See <A HREF=dumptable.html>table</A> and <A HREF=dumptable.html#map>map</A>.)</I>
<P>
<H3>Arctic Sea dumping in perspective</H3>
<P>
Until its amendment in 1993, the London Convention prohibited the disposal at sea of high-level radioactive waste but allowed, under special permit, the dumping of other types of radioactive waste. Much of the material dumped in the Kara Sea falls into the category of high-level waste. However, most of the spent fuel was dumped in the years before the London Convention came into being (1972) and before the USSR became a Contracting Party to the Convention (1976). The radioactive waste disposal continued in the Arctic Seas until 1991.
<P>
The IAEA's Safety Series No. 78 (issued in 1986) specifies locations and depths below which the dumping of low-level wastes can be permitted, when appropriate environmental assessment and notification to the Secretariat of the Convention have been made. The Arctic dumping sites do not fit within these specifications and, in particular, many of the dumping sites are in very shallow waters. It may be noted here that, prior to the entry into force of the London Convention, the dumping of radioactive wastes had also been carried out in shallow coastal waters in other parts of the world and by other countries.
<P>
In 1992, the Joint Norwegian-Russian Expert Group was established to investigate radioactive contamination due to dumped nuclear waste in the Barents and Kara Seas. It arranged exploratory cruises to the dumping areas, with the participation of a scientist from the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) in 1992, 1993, and 1994. All four sites where reactors containing nuclear fuel were dumped have been visited by the cruises of the expert group, but only some of the objects have been successfully located. The group has taken samples, made measurements and used a side scanning sonar and video camera in an attempt to identify and examine the wastes. The results obtained during the cruises have not indicated any significant radioactive contamination at the dumping sites, although the levels near some dumped objects are slightly elevated compared with elsewhere. 
<P>
While it appears that there are no significant regional and global effects at present from the dumped wastes, the gradual deterioration of the waste containments could lead to future impacts. These could occur through contamination of the marine food chain, possibly resulting in the radiation exposure of humans through the consumption of fish and other marine foodstuffs.  Since the wastes are lying in shallow waters, the possibility of radiation exposure by other routes   such as the movement and transport of the waste packages by natural events (ice or storm action), or deliberate human action   cannot be ruled out. The time scales for consideration are very long (tens of thousands of years) and, therefore, the possible impact of climatic change has also to be taken into account. In order to provide answers to these questions, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the present and future physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the environment surrounding the wastes and of the wastes themselves.
<P>
Preliminary assessments have indicated that even under the most pessimistic release conditions, the wastes would not cause a significant global radiological impact . However, it was evident then that to evaluate the possible risks at the local and regional scales considerably more information would be needed than was generally available in 1992. The International Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP) was established to answer these and other related questions.
<P>
<H3>Aims and implementation of IASAP</H3>
<P>
The objectives of IASAP take into account the requests of the Contracting Parties to the London Convention. They are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>assess the risks to human health and to the environment associated with the radioactive waste dumped in the Kara and Barents Seas; and
<LI>examine possible remedial actions related to the dumped wastes and to advise on whether they are necessary and justified.
</UL>
<P>
The results and conclusions of the project will be reported to the London Convention in 1996. The project is organized in five working areas: source terms; existing environmental concentrations; transfer mechanisms and models;  impact assessment; and remedial measures.
<P>
The work is being carried out using normal IAEA mechanisms: consultants and advisory group meetings, a coordinated research programme, and research and technical contracts.
<P>
<H3> Progress of IASAP activities</H3>
<P>
Progress in all IASAP working areas is reviewed each year by a group of senior scientists.
<P>
<B>Source term.</B> The aim of the Source Term Working Group is to determine the information needed about the waste for use in impact assessment calculations. This involves having knowledge of the waste form and of its likely behaviour with time in the marine environment. The efforts of the Group have been focused on the dumped reactors containing spent fuel which obviously pose the highest potential risk. At a later stage, consideration will be given to the packaged and unpackaged low- and intermediate-level waste.
<P>
The official information on the dumped waste provided by the Russian Federation in May 1993 did not include information on the radionuclide composition of the waste nor on the characteristics of the fuel in the different types of dumped reactors. To obtain more detailed information, it has been necessary to investigate the archives of the former Soviet Union and to reconstruct the history of the reactor fuel prior to dumping. 
<P>
As the first step, in January 1994, a detailed inventory of radionuclide composition and information on the structure of the dumped reactor containment of the commercial nuclear icebreaker Lenin was obtained (OK-150). Later, in July 1994, the Russian authorities declassified essential details of the structure, operational history, and characteristics of the fuel of the dumped submarine reactors. As a consequence, the corresponding radionuclide inventories of the lead bismuth cooled submarine reactors (No. 601) and the water cooled submarine reactors (numbers 254, 260, 285, 421, 538 and 901) were made available to IASAP. <A HREF=dumptable.html><I>(See table.)</I></A>
<P>
The total activity of the dumped reactors (with and without nuclear fuel) at the time of dumping is now estimated to be about 37 PBq. This may be compared with the first estimate of 89 PBq provided in May 1993 by the Russian Federation. The reason for lower actual figures is that most of the reactors met with an accident after a very short period of operation. This was not taken into account in making the original estimates. Due to the radioactive decay, the total activity of the dumped reactors at the present time is about 4.7 PBq.
<P>
For impact assessment purposes, it is also necessary to have information on the protective barriers provided for the dumped reactors either by the initial construction or through preparations prior to dumping. This information has also been obtained through contracts placed in the Russian institutes. 
<P>
Fuel was removed from ten of the reactors prior to dumping. Those dumped with spent fuel (six reactors) had usually met with an accident prior to the dumping in which the fuel was damaged. The dumping of the reactors took place by four principal means: 1) Most of the submarine reactors were dumped contained in their reactor compartments. The reactors were filled with a special polymer, furfural; 2) In some cases the reactors were taken out of the compartment and filled with furfural prior to dumping; 3) In the case of the lead-bismuth cooled reactors, the submarine compartment was filled with furfural and bitumen and the whole submarine was dumped (No. 601 in table). In this case the solidified liquid metal coolant forms an additional protective barrier; 4) The dumped component of the nuclear icebreaker Lenin includes a reactor compartment with three reactor vessels from which the fuel was removed and which were filled with furfural. 57% of the fuel from one of the reactors was dumped in a separate metal-lined concrete box also filled with the sealant furfural.
<P>
On the basis of an analysis of the weak points of the protective barriers, the Source Term Working Group has prepared sets of possible time patterns of radionuclide release and release rates.
<P>
Further studies are expected to produce more accurate predictions of release. In this context, information on the physical and chemical characteristics of furfural and of its stability against radiation, heat, saline water, etc. would be valuable. In co-operation with IASAP, a study on the resistant properties of furfural was started early in 1995 as a Russian-US bilateral project.
<P>
The findings of the Norwegian-Russian exploratory cruises   for example, the results of visual investigation of reactors by means of underwater cameras; in situ radiometric measurements; and water and sediment sampling and analyses   are very important in the evaluation of the potential release rates. It is planned that the videotapes obtained during the exploratory cruises from the sunken objects will be carefully analyzed as a Norwegian-Russian co-operative project by experts on naval reactor and submarine design and on corrosion questions.
<P>
<B>Existing environmental concentrations.</B> Information on the levels of radioactive contamination in the target area and other areas of the Arctic seas is being collected as input to the Global Marine Radioactivity Data Base (GLOMARD) of IAEA-MEL. The database is designed to provide up-to-date information on radionuclide levels in seawater, sediment, and biota. It will enable the evaluation of nuclide ratios, identification of the different contributions to radioactivity in the region, the investigation of time trends, and the calculation of inventories. All available radionuclide data for the Arctic Seas have been entered into the database. The first report with a preliminary evaluation of existing radionuclide data will be available this year.
<P>
<B>Transfer mechanisms and models.</B> Laboratories in Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and IAEA-MEL are participating  in the Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) entitled  Modelling of the Radiological Impact of Waste Dumping in the Arctic Seas . Its objective is to develop realistic and reliable assessment models for the Arctic Sea areas and to coordinate the efforts of different laboratories in the field. The final results of the modelling exercise will form the basis of the assessment for the London Convention.
<P>
A staged approach to the final modelling assessment is being taken. The participating modelling groups first analyzed scenarios based on assumed unit releases into a simplified environment. At the first meeting of the CRP, the initial benchmark scenarios were supplemented with improved information on the oceanography and sedimentology of the Kara and Barents Seas, which was made available to the IASAP by Russian institutes. At the second meeting, fish and mammal catches from the target area and information on fish migration were included in the scenario.
<P>
At the same time, each modelling group participating in the CRP is in the process of developing and improving its models using the environmental information which is gradually becoming available from the target area. As the next step, release rates based on the results of the Source Term Working Group will be included in the scenario.
<P>
At the meetings of the CRP, the predictions of the different modelling groups for each benchmark scenario (i.e. concentrations of selected radionuclides in water and sediment in selected local and regional areas) are compared. This is done with a view to evaluating the sensitivity of the model results to the different modelling and transfer data assumptions. 
<P>
<B>Impact assessment.</B> In 1995 and 1996, impact assessment calculations will be carried out on the basis of the concentration fields predicted by the Modelling Group and using appropriate environmental transfer factors and demographic data.
<P>
Radiation doses will be predicted at various times in the future for local, regional, and global populations. The predictions will take into account both the average consumers and those individuals whose diet consists of considerable amounts of seafood. The assessments will also include estimates of radiation dose to local fauna such as marine mammals. 
<P>
Information on radionuclide concentration factors for biota and distribution factors between sediment and water relevant to the Arctic conditions is being acquired through projects of IAEA-MEL and other laboratories. The radiological, physical, and chemical measurements made on samples taken from the Arctic area are being analyzed and compiled and a literature review is being conducted. For nuclides and biological species on which appropriate local data is not available, the applicability of concentration and distribution factors derived at moderate latitudes will have to be considered. It is planned that the various sources of information will be evaluated by a small group of experts by the end of 1995.
<P>
<B>Remedial measures.</B> The Contracting Parties to the London Convention requested the IAEA to consider possible remedial actions in relation to the dumped wastes and to consider their feasibility. A group of technical experts was convened early in 1995 to consider possible remedial measures mainly from the standpoint of technical feasibility. While the findings of the group must be considered preliminary at this stage, certain general conclusions can be drawn:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The objects which contain spent nuclear fuel should be considered as the prime potential subjects for remediation.
<LI>Well-developed techniques are available for in situ remedial measures such as capping or underwater burial.
<LI>If a remedial measure involving transport were to be chosen, underwater transport is a noteworthy option.
</UL>
<P>
This subject will be discussed again at meetings in 1995 and the radiological impact of the various possible remedial options will be given special attention. One of the waste management options which has to be considered is leaving the wastes as they are without remediation. A decision to carry out remediation must be based, at least partly, on the judgment that potential future radiological risks from the dumped wastes are unacceptable.
<P>
<H3>Coordinating global efforts</H3>
<P>
One of the basic ideas in establishing IASAP was to provide a mechanism for coordinating international efforts in the field. The cooperation with the Norwegian-Russian expert group on investigation of dumping of radioactive waste in the Barents and Kara Seas is recognized as being essential to the IASAP project. A small coordination body comprising one member from Norway, Russia, and the IAEA has met three times.
<P>
Exchange of information is maintained between IASAP and other groups working in the area of radioactive contamination of the Arctic, notably with the Arctic Nuclear Waste Assessment Programme of the United States.
<P>
It has also been agreed that the results of the IASAP project will be made available to the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). AMAP is a component of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) as adopted in 1991by Ministers of eight Arctic Nations in their Declaration on the Protection of the Arctic Environment. AMAP is conducting an overall review of the impact of all types of pollution on the Arctic Seas.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
Member States meeting at the IAEA General Conference have adopted resolutions in key areas of global nuclear development.  Resolutions addressed topics including the implementation of safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); IAEA nuclear inspections in Iraq; nuclear testing; application of safeguards in the Middle East; illicit trafficking in nuclear materials; and measures for strengthening  areas of safeguards, nuclear safety, and technical cooperation.  The Conference -- attended by delegations from 103 countries -- concluded today in Vienna, Austria.
<P>
The adopted resolutions include those related to:
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>.  The resolution commends the IAEA for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as requested by the UN Security Council, and to implement the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement.  In calling upon the DPRK to comply fully with the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement, the resolution urges the DPRK to take all steps the Agency may deem necessary to preserve, intact, all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with its safeguards agreement.
<P>
<B>Nuclear inspections in Iraq</B>.  The resolution condemns Iraq for having, since 1991, withheld from the Agency information about its nuclear weapon programme in violation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions, and it demands that Iraq hand over to the Agency without further delay any currently undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material or information, as called for in Security Council resolutions.   The resolution stresses that the Agency will continue to exercise its right to investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards the new information obtained by the Agency in August 1995 and any further relevant information that Iraq may still be withholding from the Agency.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Testing</B>. The resolution expresses grave concern at the resumption and the continuation of nuclear testing and calls upon those States which have active nuclear testing programmes in place to desist from testing until a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) enters into force.  In the resolution, the Conference states its expectation that the negotiations for a CTBT will be completed and the Treaty signed in 1996 as may be further specified by the Fiftieth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and it urges all participants in the negotiations to further intensify their efforts to this end. 
<P>
<B>Strengthening the Safeguards System</B>. Expressing the conviction that the Agency's safeguards can promote greater confidence among States and thus contribute to strengthening collective security, the resolution addresses measures proposed under the IAEA Programme 93+2 for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. The resolution requests the IAEA to continue to develop the measures proposed under Programme 93+2 in order to bring about a more effective and efficient system covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of a State which has concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement, and to make the necessary arrangements to implement at an early date the first part of the proposed measures after consulting individual States. It further requests the IAEA, taking account of views expressed in the Board of Governors and the General Conference and the outcome of consultations with Member States individually or collectively, to put before its Board of Governors as soon as possible clear proposals for the second part of the proposed measures.
<P>
<B>IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East</B>.   The resolution requests the IAEA's Director General to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking</B>.  The resolution welcomes the measures taken by the IAEA in support of efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, and invites the Agency to continue working in accordance with the conclusions of the its Board of Governors.  
<P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ)</B>.  Noting the adoption in June 1995 of the text of the Treaty on an African NWFZ, the resolution commends the African States for their united efforts toward the establishment of an NWFZ and requests the IAEA to continue to assist them in this regard. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>.  Noting that 61 States have signed and 12 have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the resolution expresses the hope for the widest possible adherence to the Convention.   It appeals to all Member States which have not yet done so to sign the Convention, and it appeals to signatory States which have not yet done so to ratify, accept or approve the Convention so that it may enter into force as soon as possible.  
<P>
<B>Technical Cooperation</B>.  The resolution requests the IAEA to pursue, in consultation with Member States, efforts to strengthen the Agency's technical cooperation activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries in fields of peaceful nuclear applications, and achieving sustainable development.  The resolution defined these fields as including both applications of nuclear methods and techniques and the production of electricity, and it noted that account should be taken of the infrastructure and the level of technology of the countries concerned. It further requests the IAEA to take account of the view of the General Conference on this question when requesting Member States to pledge their respective shares of the Technical Cooperation Fund targets and to make timely payments to the Fund. 
<P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically</B>.  In emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in Member States, the resolution stresses the vital importance of producing potable water and urges the IAEA to secure sufficient funding, through appeals to international organizations and prospective donor countries, to ensure completion in 1996 of the second phase of a programme in this area.  It further requests the IAEA to include the nuclear desalination of sea water in future programmes of the Agency, with appropriate priority.
<P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management</B>.  Citing the importance of clean drinking water to human health and the optimum use of economic resources, the resolution requests the IAEA to continue to integrate the available resources of the Agency and its Member States and to direct them towards concrete programmes for producing a visible impact by improving the quality and availability of water.
<P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1996 and Target for Technical Cooperation Fund</B>.  The adopted budget resolution allocates expenditures of US $219 million in 1996 (at an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the US dollar).  The Conference further approved the target amount of US $64.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Cooperation Fund in 1996.
<P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat</B>.  Two resolutions were adopted.  One resolution requests the IAEA to intensify efforts to increase, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, the number of staff members from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented.  The second resolution requests the IAEA to continue efforts to increase substantially, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, as well as for scientific and technical posts, the number of female staff members, particularly from developing countries and from those other Member States which are under-represented.  It further calls upon the IAEA to examine the Platform for Action developed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and to integrate, where applicable, the elements of this platform into the Agency's relevant policies and programmes.

<H3>Meeting in Sofia Concerning the Restart of Kozloduy Unit 1 </H3>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
A meeting of technical experts to discuss technical information relevant to the proposed 
restart of Unit 1 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant took place in Sofia on 3 and 4 October.  
It was called on the suggestion of the Director General of the IAEA and co-organized by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Government of Bulgaria.  Participants 
from the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, Committee of Energy and the operating 
organization along with specialists from Bulgarian research institutes and Gidropress 
(Russian design organization) took part.  Also participating were experts from the 
Gesellschaft fuer Reaktor- und Anlagensicherheit (GRS) in Germany and the Institut de 
Protection et Surete Nucleaire (IPSN) of France, two institutes of a consortium of European 
safety institutes advising the Regulatory body.  
<P> 
The technical discussions centered on the condition of the reactor pressure vessel, particularly 
its ability to withstand a pressurized thermal shock during operation.  Recent information 
from Bulgarian and Russian institutes were reviewed.  The European institutes recognized the 
value of this information, but maintained that further analysis and examination of samples 
taken prior to start-up were necessary to provide confidence that sufficient safety margins 
exist during operation.   They stated that the proposed restart at this time would require high 
confidence in the reliability of previous non-destructive testing and correct operator actions 
during operation.  Gidropress, the Russian design organization, presented technical information, 
based on analysis supported by examination of other WWER reactor pressure vessels, 
to demonstrate their argument that sufficient safety margins  exist to permit operation for the 
planned cycle of about 12 months before taking samples.  
<P> 
The Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority described requirements which are contained in the 
licensing approval for the restart of Kozloduy Unit l.  In essence it  consists of a 3 step 
programme of operation proposed by the utility as follows: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>reduced operating cycle of about 6 months duration; 
<P>
<LI>special operating regime to include, 
<UL>
<LI>constant power operation to avoid system transients, 
<LI>revised operating procedures, 
<LI>special operator training, 
<LI>increased supervisory control; and
</UL>
<P> 
<LI>comprehensive programme to prepare for sample taking and/or annealing of the reactor pressure vessel at the conclusion of the shortened operating cycle. 
</OL>
<P>
The meeting recognized that the proposed programme of operation includes technical 
steps to improve the current situation and that the regulatory authority is requiring the utility to carry 
out a programme of investigation during the proposed operation, to provide important additional information for subsequent actions including sample taking and/or annealing. 
<P>
The Assistant Director General for Nuclear Safety of the IAEA, Morris Rosen, who co-chaired the meeting with Yanko Yanev, Chairman of the Bulgarian Committee on the Use of Atomic 
Energy for Peaceful Purposes (CUAEPP), stated that the final decision to permit restart of Unit 1 is the responsibility of the Bulgarian Authorities.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Among the public at large, few people are aware that the work of IAEA extends beyond the realms of nuclear power and safeguarding against the misuse of radioactive materials. Indeed, for many years now, IAEA has been applying isotopic and other techniques in a vast array of global scientific challenges-from controlling marine pollution and understanding climate change to boosting livestock production. One of the potentially most fruitful areas for new health-related applications of isotope techniques is in the field of human nutrition. IAEA activities in Human Health, as well as in Technical Co-operation, include a new emphasis on isotope techniques as tools to evaluate human nutritional status and the nutritional quality of foods within the context of national development programmes. These techniques are now considered the best methods for measuring the uptake and bioavailability of many important vitamins and minerals. They are thus well suited for determining the success of food supplementation programmes and other interventions aimed at combatting the many forms of malnutrition.
<P>
This booklet provides a brief description of pioneering IAEA-supported work to evaluate vitamin A and iron deficiencies, bone disease, undernutrition and obesity and the special nutritional requirements of pregnant and lactating women and their children. And while it shows that the role of the Agency remains highly specialized - to develop and transfer nuclear-based evaluation tools - each of these areas of applied research aims at improving the scientific foundations for broader national food and nutrition-related development policies and programmes.
<P>
Considerable progress toward this objective has been achieved in several Member States. But many targets of opportunity remain to be explored. Member States with an interest in collaborating with the IAEA in this area need to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>identify potential centres of excellence within their countries for application of isotope techniques in human nutrition evaluations;
<P>
<LI>investigate uses of isotope techniques that would improve the cost-effectiveness of national food and nutrition programmes; 
<P>
<LI>request assistance of the IAEA's Departments of Research and Isotopes and Technical Co-operation in applying isotope techniques that can improve diets, prevent disease and promote better health through isotope-based nutritional evaluation.
</UL>
<P>
In addition to promoting further collaboration at the governmental level, this booklet is also intended to bring these exciting scientific developments to the attention of nutrition and health communities, aid donors, the news media, and the publics that support the IAEA. For while it is true that we live in an increasingly technologically advanced world, it is useful for all of us to be reminded that for hundreds of millions of people around the world, the bare necessities of life - sufficient food, safe water and decent shelter - remain beyond reach. Applying specialized techniques and the limited resources at its disposal, and working in partnership with many other development support organizations, the IAEA is intensifying efforts to identify sustainable solutions to these most pressing of human needs.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>The Global Nutrition Challenge</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Good nutrition is essential if people are to achieve their full potential for growth and performance. Yet over 800 million people around the world are chronically malnourished, and more than a billion are sick or disabled because of nutrient deficiencies.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Iron deficiency anaemia affects over 2 billion people, particularly women of reproductive age and 
pre-school children. 
<P>
<LI>Nearly 200 million children are moderately to severely underweight, while almost 70 million are severely malnourished.
<P>
<LI>Over 1 billion people are at risk of iodine deficiency, and at least 50 million iron deficient children suffer from impaired development, including mental retardation and stunted growth. 
<P>
<LI>More than 40 million children worldwide are afflicted with Vitamin A deficiency-at least one million die as a result and an additional half-million go blind.
</UL>
<P>
The global economic and social costs of malnutrition are enormous.  Each year, chronic malnutrition is a key factor in the deaths of at least 13 million children under five years of age in the developing world. Each year, developing countries lose millions of days in labour due to nutrionally related illnesses. And while the economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America are the most adversely affected, those who pay the greatest individual price are women and children living in poverty.
<P>
<B><I>Malnutrition most seriously affects:</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the survival and growth of children; 
<P>
<LI>the health of pregnant and lactating women;
<P>
<LI>people's overall resistance to diseases; and
<P>
<LI>performance in school and at work.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Malnutrition: a moving target</I></B>
<P>
Addressing the nutrition challenge requires more than boosting economic growth or producing greater harvests in developing countries.  Nor is it simply a matter of increasing shipments of food aid. Because many people in developing countries do not have access to a diverse food supply, an increase in calorie consumption alone cannot solve the problem of <B><I>micronutrient deficiencies</I></B>. These nutrients are not present in many foods, and people do not have a natural hunger for them.
<P>
Many developing countries, moreover, are industrializing rapidly. Vast numbers of people are migrating to cities, and the face of rural areas is being transformed as agriculture is modernized. Affluence is expanding alongside burgeoning slums and shantytowns.  Such dramatic changes in the social and economic landscape have profound nutritional and public health consequences across the developing world.
<P>
<B><I>Shaping nutrition interventions</I></B>
<P>
Sustainable solutions to nutrition problems can evolve out of targeted assistance programmes aimed at enhancing food security and dietary quality at the community and household levels. Diversifying, supplementing and fortifying diets are among the key interventions for improving nutrition. But many other economical and social development initiatives have measureable nutritional impacts. 
<P>
To provide effective support to such efforts, multilateral, bilateral and private assistance must be carefully formulated to address local needs and circumstances, and to complement local resources, and cultural and behavioural patterns. Moreover, to maximize the benefits from investments by national governments and aid donors, the most advanced tools must be applied to designing and monitoring such programmes and evaluating their nutritional impacts. 
<P>
Isotopic-based techniques are uniquely well suited to targeting and tracking progress in food and nutrition and many other development programmes. They are tools for evaluating people's nutritional status and food quality irrespective of the intervention. The information they produce can:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>verify the nature of the nutrition problem and the efficacy of specific interventions;
<P>
<LI>help implement nutrition intervention programmes by monitoring effectiveness and reducing programme  costs;
<P>
<LI>guide in the processing of local foods for optimal nutritional value; and
<P>
<LI>serve as early indicators of important long-term health improvements.
</UL>
<P>
Isotope techniques have been used extensively in industrialized countries to analyze human energy requirements, body composition, and the metabolism of important nutrients such as protein, fat, vitamins and minerals. The information acquired has led directly to many improvements in nutrition and health. These techniques have only begun to be applied in developing countries, where they can not only benefit millions through improved nutrition, but serve as specific indicators of broader social and economic advances. 
<P>
<B><I>IAEA's role in promoting better nutrition</I></B>
<P>
Founded in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an  intergovernmental organization that promotes the peaceful applications of atomic energy for humanity's benefit while simultaneously guarding against their destructive use.
<P>
Over the decades, Agency programmes and activities have broadened as nuclear techniques gained wider applicability in addressing economic, social and environmental problems. The IAEA is currently involved in such diverse areas as nuclear power, non-proliferation, nuclear medicine, marine sciences, food and agriculture, industry, water resources management, human health and environmental protection.
<P>
Together with governments and aid donor partners, the Agency is developing and transferring tools, based on nuclear science and technology, that can be used to evaluate nutritional status and nutrients in foods around the world. This expanding Agency involvement comes in response to a growing commitment by many Member States to improve the nutritional well-being of their populations. To date, the IAEA has been a partner in addressing food and nutrition problems in more than 50 countries.
<P>
The IAEA's activities in nutritional evaluations were initiated to apply isotope techniques for assessments of human body composition, nutrient intake, and vitamin and mineral  bioavailability (the proportion of a nutrient that is absorbed and utilized) in developing countries. The majority of the work was done through the Department of Research and Isotopes through Co-ordinated Research Programmes. 
<P>
Recently, the scope of the Agency's activities has expanded. There is a new emphasis in the Department of Technical Co-operation on isotopic techniques in human nutritional evaluations within the context of national development programmes (see <A HREF="p10table.html">Table</A>). Some of these are being carried out in collaboration with other UN and donor organizations.  Working in partnership with the IAEA, several Member States have already increased the awareness and utilization of isotope techniques to design and monitor programmes and evaluate their nutritional impact.
<P>
<B><I>Goals of IAEA's nutrition activities:</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>to work with Member States and development support organizations in utilizing science and technology as the foundation for development policies and strategies;
<P>
<LI>to help developing countries recognize the value of isotope techniques and to define priority areas of nutrition research;
<P>
<LI>to apply isotope techniques as key tools in planning and evaluating national food and nutrition programmes; and
<P>
<LI>to improve the cost-effectiveness of nutrition intervention programmes together with Member States and aid donor partners. 
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Current IAEA scientific initiatives:</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>develop vitamin A status measurements essential to improved nutrition; 
<P>
<LI>evaluate bioavailability (the proportion of a nutrient that is absorbed and utilized) of iron and zinc in human diets; 
<P>
<LI>investigate possible causal linkages between osteoporosis and diet;
<P>
<LI>formulate strategies to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children, particularly during pregnancy and lactation;
<P>
<LI>develop methods to analyze the effects of infection on growth of children;
<P>
<LI>evaluate ongoing national food and nutrition programmes in selected Member States; and
<P>
<LI>develop standardized field procedures for using isotopic tools in nutritional evaluations.
</UL>
<P>
Alongside its targeted research projects, the IAEA:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>Provides training and fellowships to personnel from developing Member States in the application of isotope techniques.
<P>
<DD>Publishes and disseminates technical papers and other documentation from scientific meetings and programmes (many of which are free of charge).

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Vitamin A Deficiency:  Identifying Sustainable Solutions</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is the IAEA concerned with vitamin A related  measurements?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in more than 90 countries. About 3 million children worldwide are afflicted with severe vitamin A deficiency; an additional 230 million suffer less severe deficiency.
<P>
<LI>Vitamin A deficiency can cause irreversible blindness, impaired immune function, increased risk of infectious diseases, night blindness and transmission of the AIDS virus from HIV infected mothers to newborn infants. 
<P>
<LI>International organizations, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Health Organization (WHO), are urging increased research and development on isotope techniques to evaluate vitamin A nutrition.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Dietary causes of vitamin A deficiency</I></B>
<P>
Consuming sufficient amounts of vitamin A from animal sources such as butter, liver, or egg yolks can prevent or reverse deficiency. Other sources such as leafy green and yellow vegetables and dark yellow fruits should, in principle, also be able to provide the provitamin A carotenoids from which vitamin A is synthesized.
<P>
But many factors affect the  bioavailability (the proportion of a nutrient that is absorbed and utilized) of food-based provitamin A carotenoids including plant structure, diet composition, nutritional status and other physiological factors. Effective interventions for populations that rely on plant-based sources depend on better information about the efficacy of provitamin A-rich foods.
<P>
<B><I>Assessing vitamin A status:  conventional indicators and isotope techniques</I></B>
<P>
Approximately 90% of the body's vitamin A is stored in the liver. Because direct measurements of liver vitamin A content would require liver biopsies, more practical indicators including dietary, physiological, biochemical, histological and clinical procedures have been adopted.
<P>
While such conventional indicators can help to identify individuals with critical vitamin A deficiency, they are not reliable measures of the size of the total vitamin A in the body-measures that are critically needed in global efforts to enhance nutrition. 
<P>
Pioneering work begun nearly 20 years ago using radiotracers in animals demonstrated the scientific validity of isotopic tracers to measure vitamin A stores. Several new, more accurate isotopic tracer methods are now being developed for assessing human vitamin A status and assessing the bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids. IAEA is also helping to pioneer these methods.

<P>
Vitamin A deficiency has many causes; preventing or reversing it requires the integration of a variety of nutritional and public health interventions. The flow chart illustrates which interventions have comparative advantages and the roles to which isotopic techniques are uniquely well-suited. 
<P>
An IAEA programme was launched in 1995 to develop and modify isotopic techniques for measuring whole body vitamin A under conditions of supplementation (Ghana, Peru), food fortification (Peru, Israel) and dietary improvement (China, Thailand, Philippines, India). The projects all address problems of vitamin A nutrition in children and pregnant or lactating women.
<P>
In Peru and Ghana, the IAEA is collaborating with WHO in evaluating the efficacy of WHO vitamin A supplementation trials. In South Africa, the maternal to infant transmission of HIV is being evaluated with regard to maternal vitamin A status.
<P>
In addition, the IAEA is helping with the production of isotopically labelled foods. Once consumed, the isotopically labeled foods provide information about the bioavailability of carotenoids, which can lead to better strategies for improving vitamin A nutrition.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="75%" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#6495ed"><FONT SIZE="-1">
<B><I>Vitamin A investigations in Ghana and Peru</I></B>
<P>
WHO and other expert groups have long been concerned that methods are not adequate to measure biologically relevant changes in vitamin A status.  But now the IAEA is collaborating in a major WHO project to evaluate a vitamin A supplementation trial in some 5,500 mother-infant pairs in two Member States, Ghana and Peru.
<P>
WHO is seeking to determine whether a particular supplementation scheme is more efficient in protecting the vitamin A status of infants who are otherwise at risk of deficiency and the associated risks of increased morbidity and mortality.  The IAEA is providing isotopes, experts in isotopic techniques, and isotopic analysis for measurement vitamin A status in infants.  The inter-agency collaboration is leading to improved isotopic methods for evaluating vitamin A nutrition in Member States that desperately need better tools for monitoring and controlling programme impact.</TD>

</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is IAEA evaluating iron absorption from local foods in  developing countries?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Iron deficiency is the world's most common nutrient deficiency. Two billion people suffer from iron deficiency anaemia of which about 50% is dietary in origin. Women of childbearing age, infants, children and teenagers are especially affected.
<P>
<LI>Iron deficiency diminishes the ability to fight infections; increases risks of premature delivery, maternal and foetal illness or death; and impairs learning and growth potential in children.
<P>
<LI>In countries where output is based on physical labour, reduced work capacity due to poor iron status undermines economic growth. 
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Causes of iron deficiency</I></B>
<P>
Iron deficiency results from blood loss (eg. parasitism, menstruation) or from insufficient dietary intake or absorption. Some of the best sources of iron are not affordable to the poor. However, iron from the more affordable plant based diets tends to be poorly utilized by the body. 
<P>
<B><I>Improving iron status</I></B>
<P>
Strategies for eliminating iron deficiency (depending on its source and severity) include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>iron fortification (adding iron to foods during the production process);
<P>
<LI>diversification of the diet to increase iron absorption; 
<P>
<LI>iron supplementation (providing medicinal iron); and
<P>
<LI>control of intestinal parasites (especially worms).
</UL>
<P>
The flow chart depicts isotopic evaluations of iron bioavailability (absorption of iron from typical diets and fortified foods, and the influence of absorption enhancers/inhibitors) and iron status. It illustrates the important factors in deciding which intervention is most likely to alleviate iron deficiency.
<P>
<B><I>Measuring iron absorption: conventional indicators and isotope techniques</I></B>
<P>
The conventional indicator of mineral absorption is the chemical balance technique which measures the difference between the amount of a mineral eaten and the amount in the faeces. This method is insensitive, imprecise and time and labour consuming. 
<P>
<UL>
By contrast, isotope techniques:
<P>
<LI>directly and accurately measure iron and other mineral bioavailability from single foods and total  diets;
<P>
<LI>facilitate reliable evaluations of the numerous factors that influence mineral absorption;
<P>
<LI>make it more cost-effective to systematically study the numerous factors influencing mineral absorption; and
<P>
<LI>help identify those food- or fortificant- based interventions most likely to succeed in target populations.
</UL>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>An alternative is to subject the food-stuff to laboratory conditions that mimic the human stomach.  This measures the percentage of iron that is potentially available. 
<P>
<LI>This method is the only rapid screening tool available for comparing iron bioavalability from different foods and diets.

<B><I>IAEA collaborates to reduce iron deficiency</I></B>
<P>
Isotopic techniques have opened the door to understanding iron absorption. The next challenge is to improve intervention programmes in relation to local foods, eating habits and hygienic conditions in developing countries.
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the IAEA has worked with donor partners, government laboratories and participating communities in improving knowledge about iron bioavailability in local meals and foodstuffs consumed in 10 Member States: Chile, Ecuador, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Sri Lanka, Venezuela. This information is of vital importance for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>improving the selection and preparation of food products with high nutritional value;
 <P>
<LI>developing national nutrition strategies promoting dietary diversification and modification, food fortification and micronutrient supplementation; and
 <P>
<LI>evaluating the effectiveness of nutrition improvement programmes. 
</UL>
<P>
Already as a result, the Government of Venezuela began a national iron fortification programme by enriching precooked maize flour and wheat flour.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Contributing to Safe Motherhood</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is IAEA working in support of safe motherhood?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Maternal malnutrition impairs pregnancy outcome, increases maternal mortality and retards early childhood development. 
<P>
<LI>18 million low-birth weight babies  are born to undernourished mothers each year. This is a prime cause of infant mortality in developing countries.
 <P>
<LI>Lactation increases maternal nutrient needs. Chronic nutrient deficiencies place mothers at increased risk for cancer and degenerative diseases later in life.
 <P>
<LI>Improving women's health and nutrition significantly benefits families, communities and the national economy.
 </UL>
<P>
<B><I>Nutritional challenges during pregnancy and lactation</I></B>
<P>
Dietary energy requirements increase markedly during pregnancy and lactation. Normally, a pregnant woman or nursing mother either increases food energy intake or reduces physical activity, or both. But when resources are limited and the demands on women's labour are great, unmet energy needs result in low birth weight infants and reduced maternal work capacity and fat stores, which limits the success of breastfeeding. 
<P>
Providing pregnant women with sufficient dietary energy can prevent these socially costly outcomes. But what is "sufficient" in a developing country setting has yet to be carefully defined. The International Dietary Energy Consultancy Group (IDECG) -a prestigious panel of experts from international organizations and universities -has advised that recommendations for energy intake during pregnancy be based on measurements of actual energy expenditure.
<P>
Pregnancy and lactation also increase maternal needs for vitamins, minerals and proteins. Some nutrients which are crucial to the health of a newborn are maintained at the expense of the mother's health. For others, the infant suffers more severe dietary deficiency than the mother. 
<P>
For malnourished breast-feeding mothers, chronic reductions in dietary intake of some nutrients may lead to below normal concentrations of nutrients in the milk and/or depletion of maternal stores of key nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, folic acid,  vitamin A and possibly proteins. Such reductions can have adverse physical effects and increase the mother's risk of degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis.
<P>
In recognition of the importance of adequate maternal nutritional stores to guarantee a healthy pregnancy outcome and safe motherhood, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) recommended (1995) a variety of actions including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>interventions to reduce the incidence of <B>low birth weight</B> and other nutritional deficiencies, such as <B>anaemia</B>, should include the promotion of <B>maternal nutrition</B> through information, education and counselling and the promotion of longer intervals between births; 
<P>
<LI>all countries should give priority to efforts to reduce the major childhood diseases.... and to prevent <B>malnutrition</B> among children, especially <B>the girl child</B>; and
<P>
<LI>all countries should design and implement special programmes to address the <B>nutritional needs of women of childbearing age</B>, especially those who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and should give particular attention to the prevention and management of <B>nutritional anaemia</B> and <B>iodine-deficiency disorders</B>. Priority should be accorded to improving the nutritional and health status of young women through education and training as part of <B>maternal health and safe motherhood</B> programmes.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Maternal diets and nutritional status: conventional indicators and isotope techniques</I></B>
<P>
Until the advent of isotopic methods, it was impossible to accurately assess energy needs and nutrient stores in pregnant or lactating women. The <SUP>2</SUP>H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>18</SUP>O doubly-labeled water method is the only technique that can accurately determine energy needs of people in their own environments. The method is non-intrusive and non-invasive and employs stable isotopes that pose no risk to the woman or the unborn baby. 
<P>
<UL>
As shown in the flow chart isotopic tools are used to:
<P>
<LI>measure maternal nutrient stores before/during pregnancy and lactation;
<P>
<LI>characterize bioavailability of nutrients (the proportion of a nutrient that is absorbed and utilized) in foods consumed by the mother;  and
<P>
<LI>determine the relationship between breastmilk nutrient concentrations and maternal nutritional status.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>IAEA's support of safe motherhood</I></B>
<P>
The IAEA has already helped in two important ways to improve the global information-base on maternal energy requirements. First, a report on the theoretical and practical aspects of the  <SUP>2</SUP>H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>18</SUP>O method for measuring energy expenditure was published in collaboration with the IDECG. This report has been distributed to researchers in more than 40 countries and has served widely as a central reference for studies utilizing the <SUP>2</SUP>H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>18</SUP>O method. 
<P>
Second, the IAEA has supported several multi-centre analyses of energy expenditure during pregnancy and lactation. Results have been used in a new evaluation of dietary energy requirements which is being conducted by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations University (UNU) and IDECG.
<P>
Future applications of isotopic techniques which would be appropriate for and beneficial to Member States include measurements of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>maternal energy intakes and energy requirements;
<P>
<LI>maternal micronutrient stores;
<P>
<LI>the effect of breastfeeding on the cumulative depletion of maternal nutrient stores;
<P>
<LI>protein needs in lactating mothers; and
<P>
<LI>nutrient content of breast milk as a step toward improving rapid and non-invasive assessment tools of maternal nutritional status.
</UL>
<P>
The information obtained will improve the basis for protecting nutritionally vulnerable women through appropriate nutrition intervention programmes including supplementation, fortification, dietary diversity and education.

</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is IAEA measuring breast milk intake?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Breast-feeding is always important but particularly so in developing countries where food supplies are limited, infections are common, and commercially prepared infant formulas are unaffordable. 
<P>
<LI>In addition to breast milk, nutritionally adequate complementary foods are needed in the weaning period.
<P>
<LI>Nutritionally inadequate complementary foods are a cause of childhood malnutrition. Improvement of these foods requires harmonizing of many factors including cultural practices, seasonality of foods, economic constraints, preparation time, food hygiene and nutritional quality.
 </UL>
<P>
<B><I>Poor complementary foods  contribute to childhood malnutrition</I></B>
<P>
The causes of childhood malnutrition are multiple. An important cause is the nutritional inadequacy of some complementary (weaning) foods. These foods are often prepared in unhygienic conditions, given to the child in dirty bottles, and may be  nutritionally inadequate. To prevent or solve this problem, communities around the world are endeavouring to prepare nutritionally adequate complementary foods from locally available ingredients.
<P>
The conventional method for evaluating the nutritional quality of complementary foods is weight gain. Weight gain occurs when total nutrient intake from breastmilk plus complementary foods meets all needs, including those for growth. Inadequate growth results when the complementary food is nutritionally inferior, when complementary food displaces breastmilk intake, or both. To accurately judge the quality of  the complementary food it is important to measure the amount of breastmilk intake. 
<P>
<B><I>Measuring breastmilk intake: conventional indicators and
isotope techniques</I></B>
<P>
The conventional method for measuring breast milk intake entails weighing the baby before and after each feeding. This is time-consuming, inaccurate and it interferes with the mother's normal activities. It can also not be used when the baby sleeps with the mother and is fed on demand many times during the night. A more practical and accurate method is to measure milk intake by isotope dilution using deuterium labelled water (<SUP>2</SUP>H<SUB>2</SUB>O).
<P>
<B><I>IAEA initiatives to improve infant nutrition</I></B>
<P>
Until recently, <SUP>2</SUP>H sample analysis was limited to technically advanced laboratories. In a project just finished at the Gadhjah Mada University, Indonesia, done in collaboration between the IAEA, the USAID, US Department of Agriculture and Johns Hopkins University, a method for sample analysis was validated which is practical in developing countries as well as accurate (infrared spectroscopy). This method is much more cost-effective; equipment and analysis amount to only 10% of the former costs.
<P>
The infrared spectroscopy equipment is currently in use in a field project in Peru to measure breastmilk intake in the context of designing and evaluating nutritionally adequate complementary foods.

</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is the IAEA collecting global data on osteoporosis?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Osteoporosis is a disorder that reduces both the amount and strength of bone tissue  making bones more susceptible to fracture. It is one of the most common age afflictions and presents a major public health problem. As many as 200 million people may be affected. 
<P>
<LI>It severely limits quality of life and, as in the case of hip fractures, produces substantial disability. 
<P>
<LI>It is imposing a growing financial burden on the health-care systems in both developed and developing countries. 
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Causes of osteoporosis</I></B>
<P>
Bone mineral mass in an individual is the result of a variety of factors including genetic factors, physical exercise, hormonal factors, but there is little doubt that nutrition plays a key role. Important dietary components include essential nutrients (calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, copper, manganese, fluorine and zinc). The most obvious deficiency in an osteoporotic patient is the calcium - the most important mineral constituent of the bone and the principal component of bone strength.
<P>
Sufficient dietary intake and absorption of calcium is important in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. But, calcium is not the only essential element. Recent evidence suggests that dietary supplementation with magnesium, copper, manganese, and zinc may also have a favourable impact on bone density.
<P>
There is a great need to understand more about:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>risk factors and prevention;
<P>
<LI>global variations in incidence and severity between population groups; and
<P>
<LI>diagnosis and prevention.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Risk factors of osteoporosis: conventional indicators and 
isotope techniques</I></B>
<P>
Isotopic techniques are gaining prominence in studies of osteoporosis and related issues of bone metabolism. 
<P>
<B>Bone mass measurements</B>
<P>
Measuring bone mass is essential to diagnosing and managing osteoporosis and potential bone fractures. In recent years, a number of non-invasive techniques have been introduced to quantify bone mass with high accuracy and precision, although  standardization remains difficult. To obtain internationally comparative data the preferred technique for bone density measurements in the IAEA programme is DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), a technique developed using a radioisotope source but now usually applied with an X-ray generator.
<P>
<B>Study of elements in bone and diets</B>
<P>
In addition, neutron activation analysis (in the laboratory) are suitable techniques for determining minerals and trace elements in foods, diets and human tissues including bone. This has already been demonstrated successfully in a number of IAEA research programmes. Other possibilities for applying isotopic and nuclear-related techniques in studies of osteoporosis and related issues of bone metabolism are shown in table below.

<B><I>IAEA's role in preventing osteoporosis</I></B>
<P>
Internationally comparative studies are shedding new light on the causes of this disease and will contribute to developing effective preventive strategies. IAEA is undertaking such studies of the incidence and severity of osteoporosis in predominately urban population groups in Canada, Brazil, Chile, Russia, China, the Philippines, Singapore, Hungary, Croatia, and Turkey. Using DEXA, the goal is to measure bone density for the purpose of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>determining age of peak bone mass in each study group; 
<P>
<LI>investigating how bone mineral density varies with age, sex, ethnicity and geographical origin of the subjects; and
<P>
<LI>assessing the role of trace elements in relation to bone metabolism, composition structure and development of bone disease.
</UL>
<P>
Factors such as hormones, physical exercise, and protein metabolism which are related to development of osteoporosis and measurable by isotopic techniques are also being incorporated. In addition, dietary supplementation studies with minerals, trace elements and vitamins will be conducted over a 2-year period in each of the participating countries. The bone mineral density will be measured to detect any sequential changes.
<P>
The acquired data will be valuable in planning and developing preventive strategies for osteoporosis and reducing current health care cost. This is of importance as the disease is more readily prevented than treated, and early intervention with effective therapy would be expected to significantly reduce the impact of fracture among the aging population.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Body Composition: Predictor of Morbidity and Mortality</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is IAEA helping to evaluate body composition?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Body composition ( the amount of bone, muscle, water, organs, and fat) maintains characteristic proportions among population groups and is thus a reliable tool for measuring nutritional status. 
<P>
<LI>Many diseases (eg., cardiovascular, AIDS, protein-energy malnutrition, various genetic diseases, diabetes, and obesity) are accompanied by abnormalities in body composition. Assessments of body composition help target interventions and reduce financial burdens to the health care system. 
<P>
<LI>Body composition is potentially useful for evaluating household food security, monitoring the effects of rural to urban migration, and in improving public health policy. 
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Body composition as a health indicator</I></B>
<P>
<B>Meaning of `body composition'</B>
<P>
For most public health purposes, as well as for many clinical applications, total body weight is divided conceptually into two compartments, the fat-free mass and the fat mass. The fat-free mass as a percent of body weight in healthy people ranges from 65 to 85%. Some of the variation in healthy people is due to gender, age and ethnicity. The fat-free mass is made of protein, water (about 73%) and minerals. These data form the basis of most methods for assessing body composition.
<P>
<B>Body composition and aging</B>
<P>
Aging is associated with changes in body composition which increase the risks of disease and accidents and limit participation in activities they once considered normal. Some changes in body composition can be prevented or reversed by exercise and diet, but planning and evaluating interventions to prevent or reverse body compositional change during aging relies on good assessment tools. Body composition measurements are ideal for this.
<P>
The health status of elderly people will be a rapidly growing concern, especially for developing countries. In 1950 there were approximately 200 million people in the world aged 60 years and over. By 2025, there will be 1.2 billion elderly people in the world, 60% of whom will reside in developing countries.
<P>
<B>Undernutrition and body composition</B>
<P>
Primary undernutrition alters body composition, as does secondary malnutrition (ie., malnutrition which occurs because of an underlying disease). Severely malnourished underweight children are not just scaled-down versions of  normal children but differ markedly in body composition. Body composition is useful in estimating children's nutritional needs and in evaluating the success of child feeding programmes.
<P>
<B>Overnutrition and body composition</B>
<P>
Obesity is spiralling as a global public health problem. Obesity is not limited to technologically advanced countries but in fact is now prevalent in <B><I>formerly malnourished populations</I></B> in developing countries. 
<P>
Obesity in children, adolescents, and adults has major impacts on health.  It is a risk-factor in the development of diabetes, vision and kidney disorders, circulatory problems, and early death.  Obesity can limit activity, productivity, and increase absenteeism from the workplace. 
<P>
Experts are vigilantly looking for ways to prevent obesity and its untoward consequences. Body composition and energy expenditure data are major tools in this endeavour.
<P>
<B>Energy used + energy stored = energy eaten</B>
<P>
According to basic principles of thermodynamics, all dietary energy (calories eaten) is either utilized (expended) or is stored. The more fat one stores, the more energy one has stored.  In people who are gaining or losing weight, energy stores are either increased (weight gain) or used as an energy source (weight loss). The difference between dietary energy and energy expended is equal to the total amount of energy stored. Thus, measurements of energy expenditure are very useful for determining how much energy has been stored and are indispensable to strategies for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with undesirable changes in body composition. Additionally energy expenditure measurements are useful for measuring food intake and energy needs under conditions of pregnancy, lactation, growth and aging.
<P>
Energy expenditure data can be used to: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>monitor the effectiveness of nutrition education and behavioural modification programmes;
<P>
<LI>improve interpretation of body composition data; and
<P>
<LI>strengthen the base for public health policy.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Measuring body composition and energy expenditure (EE): conventional indicators and 
isotopic techniques</I></B>
<P>
<B>Body composition</B>
<P>
There are many techniques for measuring body composition (skinfold thicknesses, neutron activation, densitometry, infrared interactance, electrical conductance, <SUP>2</SUP>H or <SUP>18</SUP>O dilution, computer tomography). Selection of a method depends on one's objectives, cost limitations, precision and accuracy required and on the convenience and health of the subject.
<P>
The method which is often preferred is isotope dilution (<SUP>2</SUP>H or <SUP>18</SUP>O) because it is inexpensive to perform, accurate, practical, can be applied under field conditions and poses no risk or discomfort to the person measured.
<P>
To measure body composition, body water is measured by giving a dose of water labelled with either deuterium (<SUP>2</SUP>H) or <SUP>18</SUP>O. Isotope enrichment, measured in urine samples, is a function of the amount of body water. Body composition is calculated from measured body water and the hydration coefficient of the fat-free mass. Fat is calculated as the difference between total body weight and fat-free mass.
<P>
<B>Energy Expenditure </B>
<P>
There are no alternatives to the isotopic methods for measuring EE in everyday living conditions. The doubly-labelled water (DLW) method (<SUP>2</SUP>H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>18</SUP>O) is the only technique that can accurately determine the energy needs of people in their own environments and is one of the most reliable methods for determining food energy intake.
<P>
<UL>
The DLW method:
<P>
<LI>is non-intrusive and non-invasive;
<P>
<LI>can be used to measure energy expenditure over 7-20 days;
<P>
<LI>is safe in pregnant, ill, young, elderly or very active people; and
<P>
<LI>is practical for field use.
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>IAEA'S role in investigating body composition</I></B>
<P>
The IAEA has helped develop and apply methods for measuring body composition. For example, measurements of body composition helped define nutritional treatments which sped recovery of undernourished children, and helped  identify local foods and diets which can provide the specific nutrients children need for growth.
<P>
There is a growing consensus among global nutrition experts that evaluating body composition in children and adults will improve national health profiles -an important step in targeting health and nutrition interventions. Moreover, isotopic tools increase the reliability of reference growth charts used in monitoring children in developing countries. This is important because current standards are based on observations of healthy children in industrialized countries, and can be misleading for children in developing countries.  Several Member States have already indicated their interest in such activities.
<P>
<B>Recovering from malnutrition: lessons from Peru</B>
<P>
Almost half of all schoolchildren in Peru are stunted as a result of chronic nutrient deficiencies and frequent bouts of diarrhoeal diseases. As youngsters, they were likely to suffer in many ways: from underweight, lower disease resistance, lethargy, and learning handicaps. Only by addressing this early and thoroughly through specially formulated diets could such a costly outcome be avoided.
<P>
Healthy infants gain 1 to 2 grams per kg per day. Rapid weight gain of as much as 160 grams per day in an 8 kg child is biologically possible and can substantially reduce the time needed for recovery. During the rapid catch-up weight gain period, children have enormous appetites; once their weight is restored to that which is typical for their age, appetite declines. 
<P>
The challenges are to know how much of each essential nutrient to provide to enable children to achieve their potentials for growth, cognitive development, and physical activity.  Body composition is an indicator of the kind of nutritional deficiencies which need restitution, and can be used to assess the progress of recovery.  Body composition assessment is therefore a tool which helps define nutrient needs under these special conditions.  
<P>
Conventional methods cannot be relied upon to quantify actual changes in body composition. But using isotopic methods to evaluate dietary energy utilization and body composition changes, the Agency, in collaboration with the Instituto de Investigaci&oacute;n Nutricion&aacute;l (IIN) in Lima, Peru, were able to demonstrate that diets amply fortified with micronutrients during the catch-up phase result in the use of dietary energy to adequately meet all needs, including those for rapid weight gain with a typical ratio of muscle to fat. The results of the work meant that children following the prescribed dietary treatment could be fully recovered to normal weight in about 50% of the time which was needed previously.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>Investigating Trace Elements </B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Why is IAEA measuring dietary intakes of trace elements?</I></B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Essential trace elements such as iron, iodine, selenium and zinc are involved in numerous biochemical functions, and deficiencies of these elements are associated with serious diseases, particularly in developing countries; intakes of these elements are entirely through the diet..
<P>
<LI>Human exposure to toxic elements such as mercury, cadmium, lead and arsenic is mainly through the diet; developing countries are especially at risk.
<P>
<LI>Desirable levels of dietary intake have been defined by WHO, FAO and IAEA expert groups; comparison of actual intake with these guidelines reveals whether  populations are at risk of deficiency or toxicity.
</UL>
<P>
<B>The IAEA's role in dietary intake studies</B>
<P>
The IAEA has been encouraging some nuclear laboratories in developing countries to establish collaborative research programmes with their national institutes of nutrition on projects that can take advantage of the high specificity and  sensitivity of nuclear analytical techniques. Studies of trace elements in foods and diets have turned out to be among the most useful of these applications.
<P>
Nuclear and related analytical techniques (such as neutron activation analysis ICP-MS and XRF) provide high sensitivity and specificity for the determination of many of these elements infoodstuffs and diets. Examples of the IAEA's support for research on dietary intakes of trace elements include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>studies of dietary intakes of 23 minor and trace elements recently completed in 16 countries (Australia, Belarus, Canada, China, Finland, Iran, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, USA);
<P>
<LI>additional on-going studies in 10 Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam);
<P>
<LI>studies of toxic elements in foods and diets in 12 countries (Argentina) Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand);
<P>
<LI>studies of dietary exposure to mercury and methyl mercury in 9 countries (Brazil, Chile, China, Czech Republic, India, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Vietnam) using human hair as a biomonitor;  
<P>
<LI>evaluation of dietary intake data for a WHO/FAD/IAEA Expert Committee which has developed new guidelines on desirable levels of dieter  intake of essential trace elements;   
<P>
<LI>development of several new analytical reference materials or use in the determination of trace elements in foods and diets; and
<P>
<LI>creation of the world's most extensive database on certified analytical reference materials for trace elements, radionuclides and microcontaminants
(used in food analysis laboratories for checking accuracy).

<BODY>

<H2>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime</H2>  

Efforts over the past forty years or so to prevent more countries from acquiring nuclear weapons have been based on several independent, but mutually reinforcing elements. The most crucial element is the political disincentive for a State to acquire nuclear weapons or to assist other States in doing so. The individual and collective effort to allay national security concerns which might encourage the acquisition of nuclear weapons is the most important means of preventing nuclear proliferation, because it seeks to eliminate the motivation to acquire these weapons. Similarly, States may be provided with incentives expressly to renounce the nuclear weapons option. Such incentives may include guarantees by nuclear weapons States not to use nuclear force and positive offers of assistance in the event of the threat or the use of force against the State concerned. Historically, such incentives have played a major role in limiting the number of States acquiring nuclear weapons. Another important incentive has been the prospect that a State may obtain improved access to nuclear technology if it makes a commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons. This has been important to countries which have wished to make use of nuclear power, and to developing countries which have sought improved access to the medical, agricultural, industrial and environmental applications of nuclear technology.

<B>THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (NPT)</B>--Opened for signature on 1 July 1968 and entered into force on 5 March 1970 after it had been ratified by the depositaries (the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) and forty other States signatory to the Treaty.
<BR><BR>
As of 1 October 1993, 160 States have signed the NPT.
</table>
</center>
<BR>
Central to the non-proliferation regime is the body of legally binding agreements (multilateral, regional and/or bilateral)--with the NPT being the pre-eminent multilateral agreement--in which non-proliferation commitments by States are enshrined. Coupled with such non-proliferation commitments is the verification carried out, on behalf of the international community, by independent inspectors from the IAEA. There are also regional and bilateral inspection arrangements such as those instituted by Euratom, the Brazilian/Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC) and various bilateral agreements concerning safeguards and co-operation between States. A further element is the system of controls which the majority of States apply to exports of materials and equipment which could be used not only in the civil nuclear industry but also in the production of nuclear weapons. Most exporting States require that governmental approval be obtained before such items are exported, in other words that the appropriate export licence has been applied for and obtained, and that IAEA safeguards will be applied either to the specific exported item or to the entire nuclear industry in the receiving State.
<BR><BR>
In addition, some States have national technical means, such as satellites, which collect information that can be used to alert the international community about possible breaches of non-proliferation obligations.

<BODY><H2>Origin of IAEA Safeguards </H2>

The IAEA was established in 1957 as an independent intergovernmental organization in the United Nations family. By October 1993 
it had 117 Member States. Their interests are represented through the lAEA's two principal policy-making organs--the General 
Conference, which consists of all Member States, and the Board of Governors (see 
     <!--   establish link to the IAEA organizational structure page    -->
<A HREF="/worldatom/glance/">IAEA at a glance</A>) in WorldAtom. 

Their decisions shape the lAEA's resources, programmes, and priorities. The aim of the IAEA as set out in Article ll of the Statute is to "accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world". Article III.A.5 of its Statute authorized the IAEA "to establish and administer safeguards designed to ensure that special fissionable and other materials, services, equipment, facilities, and information made available by the Agency or at its request or under its supervision or control are not used in such a way as to further any military purpose; and to apply safeguards, at the request of the parties, to any bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or at the request of a State, to any of that State's activities in the field of atomic energy".
<BR><BR>
The first section of Article III.A.5 refers to the original concept of the IAEA as a major supplier of nuclear material and equipment. However, IAEA safeguards are based largely on the second part of Article III.A.5. They are, broadly speaking, a set of activities by which the IAEA seeks to verify that a State is not using nuclear material or equipment to develop or produce nuclear weapons. Safeguards are not linked with either nuclear safety or the physical security of nuclear material. In both of these areas the States themselves have the primary responsibility even though the IAEA is given a growing role in these matters, e.g. in issuing standards, providing assistance and services and arranging for the exchange of experience.
<BR><BR>
The legal basis for safeguards which are applied to specific material and equipment only and not to the entirety of the State's nuclear activity is described in an Information Circular identified as INFClRC/66/Rev.2. Many of the States which have concluded INFClRC/66/Rev.2-type safeguards agreements with the IAEA did so because States supplying nuclear material or equipment to them would only do so if IAEA safeguards were applied to the material or equipment in the recipient State. In the case of some countries, INFClRC/66/Rev.2-type agreements have come to cover all known nuclear material and plants in the State concerned. However, such States have no legal obligation to make known all their nuclear activities.

<BODY><H2>Origin of comprehensive safeguards agreements</H2>

The successful conclusion in 1968 of the negotiations on a treaty designed to prevent the further spread of nuclear 
weapons--the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)--was a landmark in the history of non-proliferation. 
The <A HREF="/worldatom/glance/legal/npt.html">Treaty</a> entered into force in March 1970 and now over 150
 
<!-- e  establish link to the list of NPT PARTIES page in world atom-->
States are party to it. These include all the five declared nuclear weapon states (China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America).
<BR><BR>
Each non-nuclear-weapon State that becomes party to the NPT agrees not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (Article ll). It also agrees to conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA for the application of safeguards to all its peaceful nuclear activities, present or future, with a view to verifying the fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty (Article lll). In return, the Treaty recognizes (in Article IV) the right of all parties to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials, and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The parties also undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith towards nuclear disarmament (Article Vl) and re-affirm their determination to achieve the discontinuance of all tests of nuclear weapons (Preamble).
<BR><BR>

<table border width=80% cellpadding=5>
<tr align=justify>
<td>
<B>COMPREHENSIVE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT</B> - Agreement based on the guidelines for Safeguards Agreements in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as other agreements which provide for the application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within a State.
</table>
</center>
<BR>


Although not obliged to conclude safeguards agreements, the nuclear weapon States have agreed that IAEA safeguards may be applied to all or part of their civil nuclear activities. The nuclear weapon states have done this, inter alia, to demonstrate that they will not derive any commercial advantage by not making their civil facilities subject to international inspection.
<BR><BR>
In addition to the NPT, two regional treaties which have the objective of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons have been concluded. The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in South America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco, actually concluded before the NPT) is now in force for many countries in the region. This Treaty requires its members to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) also requires each State party to conclude with the IAEA a comprehensive safeguards agreement that will be equivalent in its scope and effect to an agreement required in connection with the NPT.
<BR><BR>
To implement the safeguards requirements of the NPT, the IAEA needed to devise a safeguards system suitable for application to the complex nuclear fuel cycles of the advanced industrial countries that were expected to join the Treaty, i.e. a safeguards system applicable to reactors and to the conversion, enrichment, fabrication and reprocessing plants which supply and process the reactor fuel (see picture: <A HREF="pia38e10.htm">Measurements of stored uranium</A>). This comprehensive safeguards system, devised in 1970, is set out in IAEA document INFCIRC/153 (corrected). The NPT, the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Rarotonga Treaty require that all of the nuclear material in a signatory State be declared and submitted to safeguards. The Treaties also require that any nuclear material which the State subsequently acquires be also declared and safeguarded.

<BODY><H2>Assurance Given by IAEA Safeguards</H2>


The main aim of safeguards applied by the IAEA is the provision of assurance to the international community that a State is complying with non-proliferation and 'peaceful use' undertakings to which the State has committed itself in its safeguards agreement with the IAEA.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>BASIC UNDERTAKING BY THE STATE</B>--A comprehensive safeguards agreement between the State and the IAEA contains "an undertaking by the State to accept safeguards, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities...
</table>
</center>

<BR>
In the case of comprehensive safeguards agreements, safeguards apply to all of the nuclear material in peaceful uses in the State for the purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. In the case of INFClRC/66/Rev.2-type agreements safeguards apply to the specific nuclear material, equipment, non-nuclear material and facilities specified in the agreement for the purpose of verifying that such items are not used for military purposes. In both cases the State has an obligation to declare to the IAEA, at the time the agreement enters into force, all of the items which are subject to the agreement. The State also has an obligation to update this information and to declare all items which subsequently become subject to the terms of the safeguards agreement.

<B>APPLICATION OF SAFEGUARDS BY THE IAEA</B>--A comprehensive safeguards agreement between the State and the IAEA provides "for the Agency's right and obligation to ensure that safeguards will be applied, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities..."
</table>
</center>

<BR>
A principal result of the independent verification by the IAEA safeguards inspectorate is the provision of assurance that no diversion of the items declared by the State has taken place. IAEA verification is also intended to have the effect of deterring diversions by the risk of early detection. The assurance obtained from the IAEA as an effective and objective auditor increases confidence among States and helps to allay concerns which could provide the political motivation for the acquisition of nuclear weapons.
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, INFClRC/66/Rev.2-type agreements apply only to specified facilities, equipment, and/or material, and the State is not obliged to declare all its nuclear activities to the IAEA, but only those which arise from the terms of the particular safeguards agreement. For example, nuclear material which is generated as a result of the use of safeguarded nuclear material becomes subject to IAEA safeguards, but uranium mined and produced within such a State need not be declared to the IAEA or subjected to safeguards unless the State unilaterally decides to do so.
<BR><BR>
In the case of comprehensive safeguards agreements the State undertakes to inform the IAEA of nuclear material which it imports or produces domestically, and to provide advice on all locations at which such nuclear material exists. Another major element of the independent verification work of IAEA safeguards inspectors is an assessment of the completeness of the State's declarations concerning such material and locations.

<BODY><H2>Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements - Recent Experience</H2>

Comprehensive IAEA safeguards have been applied since the 1970s and no diversion of any significant quantity of material which has been placed under safeguards has been detected. The discovery in Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War of a clandestine nuclear weapons development programme involving the separation of a few grams of plutonium from irradiated fuel, together with an extensive programme of uranium enrichment involving large quantities of undeclared uranium, was a watershed in the history of IAEA safeguards. It should, however, be noted that in Iraq the safeguards applied to the declared material effectively ensured that the highly enriched uranium in the fuel of the safeguarded reactor at Tuwaitha was not used in the weapons development programme (see picture:<A HREF="pia38e13.htm"> Measuring fuel at a Tuwaitha reactor damaged during the Gulf War</A>). The discovery of the Iraqi nuclear weapons development programme has led to the recognition that the IAEA safeguards system must be strengthened to provide assurance, not only of the non-diversion of declared material but also, as far as possible, of the absence of any undeclared nuclear activities in States which have signed comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA.
<BR><BR>
Following South Africa's signature of the NPT in 1991, the IAEA General Conference requested the Director General to verify the completeness of the inventory of nuclear installations and material included in South Africa's initial report to the IAEA. As a result of the request by the General Conference, an IAEA team made a number of visits to South Africa to consult with officials and to examine historical accounting and operating records of both operating and closed down facilities. In addition, a large number of measurements were made of various types of nuclear material. The team's general conclusion was that there was no evidence to suggest that the declared inventory of nuclear installations and material was incomplete. Following South Africa's announcement of their abandoned nuclear weapons programme, the IAEA examined the facilities which had been involved in the programme and their associated historical data in order to observe that the programme had been terminated and to gain assurance that all the nuclear material used in the programme had been accounted for and was under IAEA safeguards (see pictures: <A HREF="pia38e14.htm">Rendering harmless the Kalahari test shafts in South Africa</A>).
<BR><BR>
In the case of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), inspections conducted in 1992 found inconsistencies between the information provided by the DPRK and the information obtained by the analysis of samples of material taken by IAEA inspectors. These inconsistencies suggested that the DPRK had not declared all of its nuclear material (see picture:<A HREF="pia38e15.htm"> IAEA visit at a reactor in the Dempcratic People's Republic of Korea</A>). The IAEA also obtained information on sites in the DPRK which appeared to be nuclear related and which had not been declared in the initial report covering nuclear facilities. Because the DPRK would not allow the IAEA to carry out activities necessary to resolve the inconsistencies, the matter was reported to the IAEA Board of Governors, which decided to refer the matter to the United Nations Security Council.

<BODY><H2>Assurance that IAEA Safeguards are Applied to all Nuclear Activities under Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements</H2>

The capability of the IAEA to detect undeclared nuclear activities is in large measure dependent upon the information being made available to it. IAEA inspectors cannot roam about a State in a 'blind search' for hidden nuclear material or clandestine nuclear activities. They must be directed to specific sites on the basis of information obtained by, or provided to, the IAEA. More information on a State's nuclear programme, and the proposed design of new plants, together with increased access for IAEA inspectors to operating records and to all locations within declared facilities, will contribute to greater confidence that nuclear materials and facilities are not being used for undeclared purposes (see picture: <A HREF="pia38e16.htm">Mass spectrometers used for uranium and plutonium analysis</A>). 
<BR><BR>
Access to locations in addition to declared facilities would allow environmental monitoring to be carried out to further contribute to assurance of the absence of undeclared activities. Also, access to sites apart from those declared would enable the IAEA to confirm either the presence or absence of undeclared activities at specific locations (see picture:<A HREF="pia38e17.htm"> Environmental measurements -- an additional tool to strengthen safeguards inspections</A>).
<BR><BR>
The IAEA has instituted measures to obtain and analyse the information required for these purposes. Measures now in place include:

<OL>
<LI>The early provision of information on the design of new and modified plants. Provision of this information by the State should prevent surprises, create confidence in the peaceful purpose of the facility and make it easier to prepare for its safeguarding.
<BR><BR>
<LI>Systematic collection and analysis of the information which appears in the media and elsewhere about nuclear activities in the State and imports and exports of nuclear related equipment and materials. This information will complement that voluntarily provided by Member States.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The voluntary reporting by Member States of exports and imports of certain equipment and non-nuclear materials used in the nuclear industry. Most exports of such items can be reported to the IAEA by the exporting State as a result of its export control system. The IAEA will correlate such information with the information which it obtains from the importing State about its declared nuclear programme.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The voluntary reporting by Member States, over and above the requirements in their safeguards agreements, of their imports, exports and production of nuclear material. This information, together with that provided under the terms of the safeguards agreement, will give the IAEA up-to-date knowledge of the total quantity of nuclear material in the State which is subject to the agreement. Correlation of this information with the State's declared nuclear activities and its accounting reports might give an indication of the possible existence of undeclared activities.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The provision by Member States to the IAEA of information obtained from satellites and other means. The dominant view is that the IAEA should not ignore any safeguards relevant information from any source, but must critically examine and check such information before it makes any use of it.
</OL>
If any of the measures outlined above suggest that undeclared activities are taking place, the IAEA must make further investigations. The first step will be to ask the State for an explanation. If this is unsatisfactory, additional inspection may become necessary. This could be in the form of a special inspection initiated by the IAEA, as foreseen under the safeguards agreement, or a visit at the invitation of the State.

<BODY><H2>Assurance of Non-Diversion of Declared Material</H2>

The IAEA uses nuclear material accountancy as its basic measure for the safeguarding of declared material. Measures to monitor access to the nuclear material, e.g. the use of seals on containers or doors, and surveillance by cameras and other devices of the material and/or of routes through which material must pass, are used to complement the information obtained from material accountancy (see picture: <A HREF="pia38e19.htm">Seal verification system with laser disk recording</A>). The purpose of nuclear material accountancy is to establish the quantities of nuclear material present in a nuclear facility and the changes in these quantities that take place. The essential elements of such an accounting system are that:
<UL>
<LI>The operator identifies, counts or measures the nuclear material in the facility and maintains an inventory;
<LI>The operator keeps records of all use and production of nuclear material, and of transfers into and out of the facility, i.e. all the inventory changes;
<LI>The operator prepares reports on the inventory and inventory changes and submits these reports to the IAEA through a central national authority;
<LI>IAEA inspectors visit the facility to verify the inventories and inventory changes and to determine the correctness of the reports. Verification of the inventories and inventory changes includes on-the-spot measurement of the material and the taking of samples for subsequent analysis by the IAEA. Verification is concentrated on, but not confined to, nuclear material which is directly usable in nuclear weapons.
</UL>
Accountancy in IAEA terms thus begins with the determination by the operator of the stock of nuclear material in a facility and the recording of that stock in a book, or computer system, in which subsequent changes are also recorded. The results of periodic stock-taking by the operator and their relation to the corresponding book stocks are fundamental to nuclear material accountancy and to subsequent verifications by the IAEA. Any difference between the book stock and the physical stock is called 'material unaccounted for' (MUF) and may be positive or negative, i.e. either an apparent loss or an apparent gain of nuclear material. MUF may arise from measurement uncertainties or other acceptable technical reasons. If the MUF cannot reasonably be attributed to such causes, the safeguards inspector must consider the possibility that a diversion has taken place.

The result is evaluated inter alia by comparison with the limits of accuracy of the measurements involved, thus incorporating a fair and objective standard for IAEA conclusions.

<BR>
The results and conclusions drawn from the nuclear material accountancy and the other measures used by the IAEA safeguards inspectors are sent by the IAEA to the State concerned. If there were evidence that a diversion of nuclear material might have occurred a report would be made by the Director General to the Board of Governors. If the Board finds that the IAEA is not able to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material required to be safeguarded under the agreement, the Board may take the actions provided for in the safeguards agreement, such as reporting to the Security Council and to the General Assembly of the United Nations.

<BODY><H2>Limits to the Safeguards System</H2>

It is clear that no international safeguards system can physically prevent diversion or the setting up of an undeclared or clandestine nuclear programme. The IAEA acts not as an executive force but as an inspection mechanism. Furthermore, the IAEA can neither force States to sign the NPT or similar treaties, nor can it prevent a State from withdrawing from such treaties. Moreover, the IAEA cannot prevent States which have signed INFClRC/66/Rev.2 agreements, i.e. agreements applying to individual facilities only, from building unsafeguarded facilities.
<BR><BR>
The ability of the safeguards system to detect diversion of declared material or the existence of clandestine nuclear activities is limited by technical considerations, by the resources made available by the IAEA Member States, and by the extent of the verification which States are prepared to accept. Currently the IAEA aims to have a high level of assurance that the safeguards system would detect the diversion of a significant quantity of nuclear material (8 kg of plutonium, 25 kg of uranium-235 in highly enriched uranium, 75 kg of uranium-235 in natural or low enriched uranium).

A system which would detect the diversion of very small quantities, e.g. grams, would be unacceptably costly and intrusive and could give rise to a disturbingly high number of false alarms.

<BODY><H2>Resource Requirements</H2>

Despite a regular increase in the amount of material and the number of facilities to be safeguarded, IAEA Member States have applied a policy of zero real growth to the lAEA's budget, which has not increased in real terms since 1985. The 1993 budget for safeguards is US $65 million (see chart:<A HREF="pia38e22.htm"> Growth in the Amount of Nuclear Material under IAEA Safeguards and the Number of Safeguards Staf</A>f). At the same time, a number of Member States continue to offer valuable voluntary support to safeguards in the form of expertise, equipment and analytical services.
<BR><BR>
In 1993 the lAEA's Department of Safeguards consisted of approximately 280 professional staff and 200 general staff. Of these 480, approximately 200 were inspectors; the rest carried out a variety of supporting activities. Approximately 2000 individual inspections were carried out at 490 facilities and other locations. The material safeguarded was enough to make approximately 65,000 nuclear explosive devices, although it must be noted that most of the material was not in a form which could be used for this purpose without considerable further processing.
<BR><BR>
Looking to the future, the increase in the amount of material under safeguards, the expected requirement to apply safeguards under additional expected comprehensive safeguards agreements (e.g. in the newly independent States of the former USSR), and enhanced measures to detect undeclared nuclear activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements will all require additional resources. These will be sought from savings or elsewhere to ensure that there is no diminution in either the effectiveness of the safeguards system or the confidence that States are complying with their non-proliferation commitments.

<BODY><H2>Further Steps in the Development of the Safeguards System</H2>

One way forward for IAEA safeguards would be for States with comprehensive safeguards agreements to accept arrangements which would give IAEA inspectors access to locations and data over and above that already included in the agreements. This additional access would give greater confidence in the use of declared facilities, would facilitate carrying out environmental monitoring in the States for safeguards purposes, and would permit inspections of possibly safeguards relevant sites without the need for the procedures required to implement a special inspection. The acceptance of such 'transparency' arrangements would in itself build confidence in the non-proliferation credentials of the States.
<BR><BR>
The IAEA is exploring the use of sensitive environmental monitoring techniques to detect the presence of certain types of undeclared facilities (see picture: <A HREF="pia38e24.htm">Taking samples for safeguards environmental measurement tests in Sweden</A>). The technical capability of such techniques to detect undeclared activities near a suspect site is generally accepted. Their applicability to the long range detection of undeclared facilities, especially those relating to uranium conversion, fabrication and enrichment, requires further development. For such techniques to be used as part of IAEA inspections under safeguards agreements in connection with the NPT, among other things these techniques have to be demonstrated to be technically feasible, as required by the provisions of such agreements.

<B>ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR SAFEGUARDS</b> --A means to assist in the detection of undeclared nuclear activities. Such activities may give rise to the release of radionuclides or other specific indicators into the environment which can then be detected by IAEA sampling and analysis. Samples taken might include air, water, sediments, biota and wipes from surfaces

<BR>
The IAEA is constantly looking for ways to minimize costs while maintaining or increasing effectiveness. The Director General's safeguards advisory group, the members of which are drawn from all over the world, has recently considered this problem. The group was unable to identify any area where immediate cost savings could be made but did identify ways that might lead to cost savings in the future. These include increased co-operation by the State's System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (SSAC) with the IAEA and the application of safeguards approaches different from those in current use.
<BR><BR>
The most basic way that an SSAC can co-operate with the IAEA requires the SSAC to take practical steps to enable the IAEA to reduce the number of inspections or to carry them out with less effort, e.g. by the SSAC providing field support to inspectors and providing the IAEA with data that can be confirmed to be correct. A number of conditions have been identified which would have to apply if greater reliance were to be put on an SSAC. The IAEA is continuing to investigate practical arrangements for making greater use of SSACs while preserving the vital requirement that it must reach independent conclusions.
<BR><BR>
The IAEA is developing, assessing and determining the potential of a number of alternative safeguards approaches. For example, the successful introduction of measures aimed at detecting undeclared facilities could contribute to increased cost-effectiveness. If there were measures to provide significant confidence that no undeclared activities were in existence in a particular State, then some of the routine inspection activities at declared facilities might no longer be necessary. For example, if the IAEA had confidence that a State has no undeclared reprocessing plant, then the routine inspection activities applied to reactors and irradiated fuel could be relaxed. Safesuards in that State could be both more effective and less costly.

<H2>Possible Future Roles for IAEA Verification</H2>

It is useful to look to the future to identify areas in which the IAEA experience and expertise in the application of safeguards might be utilized in the remaining part of the 1990s and in the twenty-first century. A number of possible areas have been suggested.
<BR><BR>
One area is the development of verification arrangements for regional nuclear weapon free zones. Two such arrangements are already in place-- in Latin America and in the South Pacific. Negotiations might lead to regional agreements in Africa, South East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula. The requirements of such regional arrangements will vary according to the particular needs of the region, and a range of models and options exist. The use of joint inspection teams involving IAEA inspectors in conjunction with inspectors from seates in the zone might give additional confidence to those States that no undeclared activities relating to the development of nuclear weapons were being undertaken by other States in the zone. The extension of verification activities to non-nuclear material such as heavy water, lithium and tritium and to items of nuclear and nonnuclear equipment relevant to nuclear weapons production may also be desirable.
<BR><BR>
At the global level, the IAEA experience and expertise could be used in verifying an internationally agreed 'cut-off' in the production of nuclear material for weapons use, or in the verification that nuclear material from dismantled nuclear weapons does not find its way into new nuclear weapons but is either stored or transferred to civil use.
<BR><BR>
The peaceful uses of the increasingly large stockpiles of separated plutonium need to be monitored (see picture <A HREF="pia38e26.htm">IAEA safeguards inspectors verifying irradiated fuel</A>). In States with comprehensive safeguards agreements such stockpiles are subject to IAEA safeguards. However, additional measures may be proposed by the producers and users of such material, and the lAEA's experience could be put at the service of an international management system. Such a system could be based on voluntary undertakings by participating States. The form of the legal arrangements for such a system will depend upon what the participating States propose.

<H3>Introduction</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
In science and technology, nuclear techniques have frequently proved to be the most suitable or sensitive and their application has been invaluable in a wide variety of disciplines - medicine, agriculture, resource assessment and development and numerous branches of industry. Moreover, in a world increasingly concerned about environmental protection and development that is sustainable, these techniques have helped in the search to find ways to reduce pollution and make better use of scarce resources.
<P>
The desire to extend the many benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology to all countries led as long ago as 1957 to the establishment of the IAEA and to the immediate introduction of a technical co-operation programme. In the more than thirty years that have passed since that time, the potential applications of nuclear techniques have greatly expanded, as have the associated benefits for social and economic development. Over this period, many of the applications have moved from research laboratories into hospitals, farms and industrial enterprises. The IAEA has meanwhile remained as a unique international source of expertise on nuclear technologies.

The IAEA naturally maintains substantial programmes in nuclear power, nuclear and radiological safety and radioactive waste management, and in these areas also it provides support for developing countries within the context of technology transfer. The IAEA operates an international system of inspections, known as 'safeguards', to provide assurance that nuclear energy is utilized exclusively for peaceful purposes. Safeguards have been seen by most States as a prerequisite to the continued expansion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
<P>
The direct resources made available to the IAEA by its Member States to support technology transfer processes have grown rapidly since the late 1950s. Over the last decade there has been an average annual rise of some 5% in total nominal resources and the total pledged under the Technical Assistance and 
Co-operation Fund (TACF) is about US $50 million per year. These figures indicate the importance that is attached to this aspect of the IAEA's work.

</CENTER>
<P>
Providing assistance to developing Member States in building up their capacity to investigate and utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes represents one of the key statutory functions of the IAEA. Under Article III of its Statute, the IAEA is authorized to make provisions for materials, services, equipment and facilities to meet the needs of research on, and development and practical application of, atomic energy for peaceful purposes, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.
<P>
Another impetus for the IAEA's role as a catalyst in technology transfer came indirectly from the efforts over the past forty to fifty years to prevent more countries from acquiring nuclear weapons. These efforts have been based on several independent, but mutually reinforcing elements, central to which is a body of legally binding agreements, with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) being the pre-eminent multilateral agreement. The Treaty was opened for signature on 1 July 1968 and entered into force on 5 March 1970.
<P>
Article IV of the NPT calls upon Parties to the Treaty to co-operate with each other and with international organizations in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and mentions in particular the needs of the developing countries. This clearly marks out a role for the IAEA as a catalyst in the transfer of nuclear technology. This activity is co-ordinated with the assistance given by other United Nations system organizations - especially the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In partnership with the IAEA, UNDP and its precursor, the United Nations Special Fund, have been financing the transfer of nuclear science and technology for development for the benefit of their Member States since 1961.
<P>
Today, international co-operation in nuclear science and technology takes place in a complex framework of bilateral, regional and multilateral arrangements. Many of these arrangements are purely commercial, others bring together two or more governments in co-operative agreements. The IAEA is the one global organization offering an international framework amongst all Member States with particular attention to the needs of developing countries. It has also fostered regional co-operation arrangements, and provides for bilateral assistance to be conducted under its auspices.

</CENTER>
<P>
The transfer of technology is central to efforts to increase the quality of life in developing countries. But technical co-operation that leads to social and economic benefits on a national scale does not result automatically from the training of personnel in a specific technique or the donation of equipment or even the input of capital. Over the years there has been growing understanding of the conditions that must be met to ensure effective technology transfer and of the way in which international action can support this process.
<P>
The IAEA's technical co-operation programme has an excellent record of achievements over the last three and a half decades. During this period efforts have focused on strengthening the infrastructure and capacity in nuclear technology in the recipient countries. This objective has, in general, been met. In many countries the infrastructure is in place, technologies are now available, and research programmes are being planned and conducted by local experts.

<P>
The successful accomplishment of an enhanced capacity has built the
foundations for the next step  - "partnership in development" -  under which the recipient countries spread the knowledge they have gained, apply the technologies they are now mastering and demonstrate to their potential end users the power and benefits of nuclear technology. The value of the technical co-operation programme should be seen not only in the successful transfer of technology, but also in the way that nuclear technologies satisfy demands for sustainable development by having a lasting impact, and being
cost effective and environmentally sound.
<P>
To this end, the IAEA has over the past two years selected a number of projects which promise significant economic or social benefits and which will, once their success becomes visible, demonstrate the value of such projects to others. Since they show the direction in which the Agency's technical co-operation programme is moving, they are called 'model projects'. Criteria for model projects relate to the impact that should be achieved, the advantages of the nuclear techniques employed and the suitability of the activity in an environmental context:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The project should address a high priority developmental objective.
<DD>- There should be a significant economic or social impact for identified end users.
<DD>- Nuclear technology should play an indispensable role in the project and should be competitive, or have distinct advantages over other available technologies.
<DD>- The environmental situation should be conducive to sustainable success.
</DL>
<P>
The IAEA is currently re-examining its technical co-operation activities in a continuing attempt to increase the lasting effect of its programme in this area. The objective is to redirect a substantial portion of the programme towards projects which will have a major impact. Model projects serve as the guiding beacon for this new direction. Special emphasis will be given to discussions at individual country level held to reach mutual agreement on model or key projects which will form the core of future IAEA technology transfer work. The selection of these key projects will be guided not only by national considerations but also by an analysis of sectoral requirements, including the basic need in all countries to ensure the establishment of adequate radiation protection infrastructures. Further guidance on the choice of core projects will come from a study of regional requirements such as, for example, the overriding need in Africa to ensure food security.
<P>
One of the characteristics of model projects is their significant social
and economic impact on end users. Because the IAEA does not have permanent field staff, it has less direct access to end users than other United Nations system organizations such as the FAO, WHO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and UNDP.  It is therefore
seeking to strengthen its specific contacts with these organizations to ensure that it can, through these bodies, obtain feedback from end users and provide guidance to them. Thus, the IAEA has undertaken special co-operation with FAO in programmes related to food security in Africa, with WHO in programmes related to human health and with UNIDO in the industrialization of facilities for the rearing of sterile tsetse flies required in eradication campaigns. In terms of the size of the funds available to it in its role as a catalyst for technology transfer, the IAEA occupies a place far behind the large bilateral aid donors, and multilateral agencies such as UNDP and the World Bank. On the other hand, it possesses the very high level of technical expertise necessary to identify and test key projects which can then properly attract available funds for applications on a large scale. This is another reason for the IAEA to seek to strengthen its working ties with donor organizations so that, together with them, it can become a strong partner in development for the developing Member States.

<H3>Examples of Projects Supported by the IAEA</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst for technology transfer, the IAEA uses a variety of mechanisms, tailored to the subject area, the needs of the Member States concerned and the financial resources available. These mechanisms include the provision of equipment, laboratory support activities, expert services and training, the organization of co-ordinated research programmes, the preparation and issue of technical publications and the dissemination of information worldwide. It also supports national planning by organizing sectoral assistance programmes and arranging project formulation and evaluation. The use of these different but complementary approaches is illustrated by the descriptions of nuclear techniques as applied in specific projects given below.
<P>
It should be emphasized that the IAEA is carrying out over twelve hundred technical co-operation projects in nearly ninety countries. These projects cover the areas of nuclear power; nuclear fuel cycle; radioactive waste management; food and agriculture; human health; industry and earth sciences; radiation protection; the safety of nuclear installations; and safeguards. The examples given below serve only as illustrations of a wide range of activities.
<P>
<B>Ensuring Adequate Radiation Protection and Waste Management Infrastructures</B>
<P>
The IAEA has over the years encouraged and promoted the use of radioactive sources and radiation devices in medicine, industry and research. However, it is fully aware that effective national radiation safety and waste management infrastructures are prerequisites for efficient and safe technology transfer. Mindful of its responsibilities in this regard, the IAEA has developed a number of ongoing activities - co-ordinated at the national, regional and interregional levels - that are aimed at upgrading national infrastructures to adequate levels. These activities have already helped countries to set up appropriate governmental bodies, have provided extensive training opportunities and have contributed the supply of up-to-date equipment.
<P>
Through its support programmes, the IAEA is aware of current safety issues and the current safety infrastructures in its Member States. With this information, an integrated strategy of assistance has been developed. This strategy involves an ongoing assessment of existing infrastructures, the establishment of country specific action plans drawn up in direct co-operation with its Member States, and a continuous monitoring and reassessment of progress.
<P>
In order to ensure that the use of radionuclides will always produce overall benefits, care must be taken with the management of the wastes generated in their applications. Increasingly, the IAEA is stressing the need to consider how wastes will be managed before an application begins. Purchasers of radionuclide sources are encouraged to make sure, whenever possible, that suppliers will take back the sources for disposal at the end of the period of use.
<P>
For several years the IAEA has provided advice and information on waste management to its Member States through expert missions, training courses and the production and dissemination of guidance documents. Particular attention has been given to the problem of keeping track of radiation sources in Member States, and of providing inexpensive waste treatment methods and storage solutions. The problem of intermediate level storage is being increasingly related to the scope of the activities in individual Member States.
<P>
<B>Water Resources Assessment</B>
<P>
The IAEA has been actively involved in the development and application of isotope techniques in hydrology for more than three decades and is internationally recognized as one of the leading institutions in this field. Of particular importance has been its support for work on water resources assessment and development. Two projects are described below.
<P>
In Venezuela, a rapid increase in the population of the city of Caracas has led to a deficit in the domestic water supply of nearly 20%. Local authorities are investigating the potential of the Valle de Caracas aquifer to provide additional water for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. A second objective of the investigation is to lower the present groundwater level in the region. The assessment of groundwater dynamics and quality by means of geochemical and isotopic methods (including tracer experiments) will
provide key information for the identification of the best areas for drilling additional wells. Basic data will be obtained on the sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge, the time span for renewal of  groundwater and the vulnerability of the aquifer to pollution. This information will be used by local authorities to make decisions on the exploitation of the aquifer and how it can best be protected from future pollution. 
<P>
In Africa, water scarcity in many countries in arid and semi-arid zones is of great national, regional and international concern. Water resources development, therefore, is a high priority. A project commencing in 1995 seeks to apply indispensable isotope hydrology techniques in combination with other investigations to practical problems for the development and optimum management of groundwater resources in nine African countries.  Areas in each country have been identified where adequate assessment of scarce water resources is crucially needed for the water supply for large population centres or development activities. The project is expected to yield important hydrological data which are essential for water and development authorities in planning medium and long term sustainable development based on rational management of water resources. The project also aims to strengthen regional and local capabilities in the integration of isotope hydrology projects within water resources assessment and development programmes. The project will last for four years.
<P>
<B>Eradication of Insect Pests</B>
<P>
The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a non-polluting method of insect control and eradication. It is based on the procedure of releasing radiation sterilized male insects into an infested environment. When these insects mate with females in nature, no offspring are produced and in this way the infestation can be reduced or eliminated. The technique is highly effective and has been used on a large scale against the New World Screwworm in Mexico and the USA, the Mediterranean fruit fly in Mexico, the pink bollworm in central California, USA, and the melon fly in Japan. A recent success has been the elimination of the screwworm from North Africa. The IAEA has had
a long history of involvement in this technique through its technical co-operation activities and scientific developments at its laboratories.
<P>
Trypanosomiasis is a disease which has debilitating effects on animals and causes sleeping sickness in humans. The disease, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly, is a major limiting factor in agriculture and economic development for many African countries. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the larger of the two major islands of Zanzibar is infested with a single species of tsetse fly. As a result, Zanzibar has to import annually up to 10 000 live cattle and large quantities of dairy products. 
<P>
The fact that only a single species of tsetse fly is present makes the circumstances ideal for application of SIT to combat the pest. A model project which was started in 1994 aims at complete eradication of the tsetse fly from Zanzibar over a period of about three years and the establishment of quarantine procedures to protect against reinfestation. The direct economic benefits to Zanzibar will be some US $2 million per year. 
<P>
Conventional methods are being used to reduce the tsetse population. Weekly releases of sterile male flies are being made to cover the entire southern portion of the island; in the second year, releases will be initiated in the northern part. Once eradication is achieved, surveillance and quarantine procedures will be implemented to ensure that tsetse and trypanosomiasis transmission are not re-established. 
<P>
The IAEA makes available experts for tsetse mass rearing technology, SIT releases and entomological monitoring of the tsetse target population, trypanosome surveys and economic assessments and ecological studies. It also provides technical support and direction and overall programme management. Sterile flies are supplied from the Agency Laboratory at Seibersdorf to supplement those reared at Tanga. Major equipment items to be provided under this project include a gamma cell, as well as communicaion, insectary and field equipment. Fellowship training will also be provided.
<P>
<B>Animal Health</B>
<P>
Livestock and their products are vital to the economies of most countries in West Asia. However, several major livestock diseases still occur in this region, the most important of which is rinderpest. Despite an intensive vaccination programme during the past six years, substantial losses continue to occur. To ensure the eradication of rinderpest in West Asia, it is essential that the current national vaccination programmes achieve high  enough levels of immunity in cattle to eliminate the causative virus. A single vaccination will give lifelong immunity and therefore eradication through mass vaccination is a fully achievable goal. The work of the IAEA, especially in projects in Africa, has shown that implementation of what is known as the ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) technique in a surveillance programme at the national level to ensure that high levels of immunity through vaccination are achieved and that when annual vaccination stops, any remaining pockets of infection can be identified. A model project is aimed at producing a regional capability, through support at the national level, for application of the FAD/IAEA ELISA based system for rinderpest seromonitoring and surveillance. This proven, highly
cost effective and sustainable approach should enable most countries in the region to make international declarations of freedom from this devastating disease within the next four to five years. Vaccination costs (approximately US $1 million per annum) and losses due to animal deaths (an estimated US $360 million per outbreak) would then be eliminated and livestock movement and trade, both within and outside the region, would increase. This would result in sustainable development of the livestock sector in the region.
<P>
The IAEA will provide: expert services, including a full time regional expert to ensure the successful transfer of the ELISA technique and the routine use of the ELISA based system; equipment where necessary, together with internationally standardized and validated ELISA kits; and annual workshops for dissemination of national seromonitoring results on a regional basis.
<P>
<B>Nutrition</B>
<P>
According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), malnutrition stunts mental and physical growth in one child out of three in developing countries and is a factor in one third of the 13 million child deaths which occur annually. Malnutrition during child-bearing years increases maternal
risk at childbirth, and leads to low birth weight and to increased prenatal
morbidity and mortality. According to the FAO, approximately 2000 million people in developing countries, mostly children, are iron deficient - a condition which adversely affects pregnant women and newborns, impairs children's mental and motor development, and reduces work productivity. The FAO also estimates that 190 million individuals in developing countries suffer from vitamin A deficiency, which lowers the body's ability to fight infection and leads to eye damage in children.
<P>
In Peru, some 38% of children under 6 years of age are chronically undernourished and an additional 27% are at risk of becoming malnourished. The Government is intending to conduct two major food supplement intervention programmes to combat this malnutrition problem. In one of these, the National Compensation and Social Development Fund (FONCODES) will provide a food supplement to 150 000 undernourished
children under 3 years of age in three separate regions. The IAEA is establishing a model project to provide nuclear techniques to improve the evaluation of the impact of this programme. The United States Agency for International Development will also be making use of this project to monitor
the efficiency of its own programme in this area. 
<P>
A further objective of this model project is to transfer nuclear techniques to Peru for evaluating nutritional status and nutrient bioavailability, and to apply these techniques to: evaluate the food supplement programme; improve the selection and preparation of food products with high nutritional value in which absorption and utilization of macronutrients and micronutrients are optimal; evaluate the impact of the new WHO vitamin A interventions; work with local food industries and village feeding programmes to assure sustainability; and develop a package of nuclear techniques in nutrition which can be transferred to other developing countries where undernutrition is a chronic public health concern. (Also see <A HREF="/worldatom/inforesource/other/malnutrition/index.html">Targeting Malnutrition</A>.)
<P>
<B>Mutation Breeding</B>
<P>
For environmentally sustainable food production there is a need to produce cultivars with increased resistance to plant diseases, insect pests and soil stresses, thereby reducing the need for chemicals. However, the gene pool of particular species is, in most cases, too narrow to meet these breeding objectives, especially in relation to local crops grown in developing countries. In this connection, mutation techniques have proved to be the most effective method of increasing crop diversity and the IAEA has long promoted development in this area through its technical co-operation activities.
<P>
Under an IAEA project starting in China in 1995, the aim is to develop, by means of induced mutations and related biotechnologies, new hybrid rice combinations and high yielding rice cultivars which are early maturing, have good grain quality and multiple disease resistance.
<P>
Rice is the staple food for more than half the population of China. An area of 33 million hectares is under cultivation with rice - 50% of it hybrid rice. Problems such as genetic vulnerability and poor grain quality can be solved by developing, through induced mutation, new improved hybrid rice combinations. Some new promising cytoplasmic male sterile lines have already been developed which increase significantly the seed set and in this way make hybrid seed production more economical. Meanwhile, some new early season lines with better grain quality and disease resistance have also been developed through mutation techniques. Assistance is now being requested to speed up the introduction of new mutants by accelerating the necessary genetic and agronomic tests leading to the development of new hybrid combinations and early maturing conventional varieties.
<P>
Qualified staff are available locally, as are laboratory facilities and basic equipment. The IAEA will provide expert services and training in mutation techniques and related biotechnologies; and equipment for <I>in vitro</I> cultures and molecular genetics.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Medicine</B>
<P>
There are more than two hundred old analog gamma cameras used in nuclear medicine in Latin America. Most of them are suboptimal in performance owing to ageing and lack of appropriate data processing facilities, which lead to poor quality gamma camera output and uncertainty in the accuracy of results, adversely affecting patient management.
<P>
A model project has been designed to upgrade the performance of
these old gamma cameras. This upgrade is based on a system developed by the IAEA which will ensure the quality of the gamma camera output, i.e. static images and dynamic study results. It will also prolong the service life of the gamma cameras. Under the project, the technology required to create national and regional capabilities to implement the programme will be transferred. The system developed by the IAEA is cost effective in comparison with commercially available upgrades. Given the widespread use of gamma cameras in medical practice, the project will have a significant social and economic impact.
<P>
The use of ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells is the most important application of radiotherapy. This type of cancer therapy was developed after the discovery of X rays at the end of the last century. Teletherapy is treatment by an external beam which enters the body from the outside. In brachytherapy, sources of radiation are placed on or inside the body, mostly for superficial tumours, as of the head and neck, uterine cervix, breast and soft tissue sarcoma. The amount of radiation absorbed in the turnout must be planned, calculated and measured for each individual case.
<P>
The IAEA supports about 40 technical co-operation projects associated with radiotherapy in 29 countries. Twelve of these are in Africa. Two of the African projects, in Namibia and Zambia, are for new radiotherapy centres in countries where there are currently no radiotherapy facilities. Model projects in Ghana and Mongolia are in the implementation phase. Complete training for radiation oncologists, medical physicists, radiographers and nurses has been initiated and new equipment will be supplied in order that these facilities can in turn be used for training in other countries of Africa and Asia. Similar projects to upgrade radiotherapy and brachytherapy are currently being supported in some East European and Latin American countries.
<P>
<B>Tissue Bank</B>
<P>
Disabilities from degenerative diseases such as cancer, congenital defects such as malformed heart valves, and severe burns, fractures and nerve damage due to traumatic accidents and violence are common throughout the world. If proper treatment can be obtained, these disabilities are curable and the afflicted individuals can resume productive lives. The remedial intervention of choice in such cases is the use of sterile human tissue grafts. Tissue bank facilities, while relatively common in developed countries, are not generally available in the developing parts of the world. The Sri Lanka Eye Bank, established over ten years ago, has been extremely successful in providing clinical quality sterile corneal tissue for use in transplants to restore eyesight. Thus far, it has distributed over 31 000 corneas to 139 cities in 61 countries worldwide. An additional 10 000 corneas have been utilized in Sri Lanka itself. This experience has established the Eye Bank in a strong position technically for further development into a multi-tissue bank facility.
<P>
On the basis of the experience gained, an IAEA technical co-operation project is planned to establish a general human tissue bank and to use the established international distribution network to make tissue grafts more widely available throughout the world at nominal cost. The immediate objective is to bring technical and economic self-sufficiency in the supply of radiation sterilized, clinical quality multi-tissue grafts to Sri Lanka within five years. The primary social benefit of the project will be the increased availability of tissue grafts to victims of traumatic accidents, disease and congenital defects. The very low income portion of the population in Sri Lanka, which currently has almost no access to effective treatment, will benefit most. Sri Lanka spends an average of approximately US $200 000 per year on imported tissue grafts. Savings of this amount will be a direct economic benefit of the project.
<P>
The project will begin with the production of amnion, skin and bone tissues. Later, production of dura and fascia, heart valves, aortic and other cardiovascular graft material will be undertaken. A total quality system for good manufacturing practice will be established in accordance with international standards. As self-sufficiency is reached, Sri Lanka will become a major supplier of a variety of tissue graft material for Southeast Asia and indeed for other parts of the world.
<P>
<B>Non-Destructive Testing</B>
<P>
Over the past forty years, non-destructive testing (NDT) has become an integral task of any manufacturing quality assurance programme and a mandatory requirement to ensure the standard of industrial goods. NDT techniques make it possible to examine components for particular properties or the presence of flaws without diminishing their usefulness or marketability. 
<P>
A large scale regional project on NDT in Latin America and the Caribbean was approved in 1982 and project activities were initiated in 1983. Eighteen Latin American countries participated in the project, which was completed in 1992. Two parallel projects were subsequently approved: on an NDT testing network, and non-destructive testing techniques. Financial and technical support for these projects was provided by the IAEA, UNIDO and the United Nations Fund for Science and Technology Development (UNFSTD), as well as by the Governments of Canada, Germany and Italy. The overall objective was to assist Latin American and Caribbean countries to develop an autonomous capability in NDT for the region's industrial development.
<P>
By the time the first project was completed, the achievements included
the following:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- An autonomous NDT capacity had been created in the region;
<DD>- There were sufficient personnel in all participating countries trained to
meet everyday NDT needs and provide training to others;
<DD>- Fourteen countries had established national standards for the qualification and certification of NDT personnel;
<DD>- Training programmes for the main NDT techniques had been developed and published by the IAEA;
<DD>- A computer based management system and a regional communication network had been built up;
<DD>- The Regional Federation of National Non-destructive Testing Organizations of Latin America and the Caribbean had been established to ensure continuity in NDT activities in the future.
</DL>
<P>
A follow-up project, started in 1992 and co-funded by UNDP, expands on the use of NDT techniques in industrial quality control programmes. In close collaboration with UNIDO, the IAEA's network of counterpart institutes is currently conducting a survey to establish priorities for a future joint industrial quality programme for Latin America and the Caribbean which would be executed by UNIDO with the IAEA covering all nuclear techniques.
<P>
<B>Energy Programme Planning</B>
<P>
Electricity demand is expected to increase at a higher rate than total energy demand as has been the case in both industrialized and developing countries over the last decades. In order to meet this demand there is a need for comprehensive planning and implementation of electricity system expansion strategies. The IAEA has for many years provided, and will continue to provide, support to countries for comparing alternative electricity generation strategies, and assessing the viability of the nuclear option, taking into account technical, economic, and environmental factors in the specific conditions of the given country.
<P>
In the Asia and Pacific region, for example, nuclear power is already
an important component of the existing electricity systems in some countries
and its role may be increased in order to support the overall economic
development of the region. However, the implementation of the nuclear programmes which are needed should follow a comprehensive process, initiated by a preliminary comparative assessment of the various options available. Whenever the nuclear option is found viable and chosen, the development of a nuclear power programme will include careful planning at each level of implementation, including the establishment of adequate industrial and organizational infrastructures and manpower training, in order to ensure an efficient and safe operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. The IAEA is providing assistance upon request in this regard, including training courses and fellowships.
<P>
<B>Geothermal Energy</B>
<P>
Geothermal energy provides 22% of the electrical power of the Philippines and its share is projected to rise to 40% by 1998. Its development has received strong support from the Government and this has led to several projects in the field funded by Italy, Japan, the World Bank and UNDP.  One mission is to establish co-operative links with a UNDP funded project which aims to demonstrate the viable use of low temperature geothermal resources for agro-industrial processes. If proven to
be feasible, the use of such resources would need further exploitation and development, facilitated by the continuing use of isotope techniques.
<P>
<B>Support to Small Island States</B>
<P>
Small island developing States have received substantial attention within the Agenda 21 document adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), where they are identified as a special case in terms of both environmental protection and development. They are ecologically fragile and their geographical isolation has resulted in their becoming habitats of a comparatively large number of unique species of flora and fauna. In many cases, all the environmental problems and
challenges of the coastal zone are concentrated within their limited land
areas. They are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and rises in sea level. As a consequence, the IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) is intensifying its activities in relation to small island developing States. It is involved in pilot monitoring programmes as well as in capacity building and quality assurance activities in such States in the Caribbean and East African regions. Support is being given to work on the use of isotope and nuclear techniques in the study of retrospective conditions (climate, sea level, pollution) so as to provide time-scales for small island evolution. Sensitive analytical techniques have been developed to quantify pollutants within the seasonal bands deposited in coral colonies. This not only provides a historical record of pollution, but also affords the potential to investigate historical charges in biogeochemical processes that can be linked to climate change.
<P>
<B>Flue Gas Scrubbing</B>
<P>
The release of environmental pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<SUB>x</SUB>) into the atmosphere as a result of the widespread use of fossil fuels is a matter of worldwide concern and a number of countries have begun to impose limits on such releases. Scientific and engineering work over the past twenty years in the field of radiation technology have led to the development of the electron beam dry scrubbing (EBS)
- process as an effective means of simultaneously eliminating SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB>
from flue gases. Pilot plant studies in Germany, Japan, Poland and the United States of America have established that the process can have significant economic and technical advantages: no waste water requiring treatment and disposal is produced and the by-products can be utilized in the manufacture of fertilizer. These advantages make the process of particular interest to developing countries.
<P>
Under a project first established in 1988, the IAEA is assisting Poland
in the construction and evaluation of an industrial scale demonstration plant for EBS purification of flue gases at the Pomorzany power station. Support covers all basic civil engineering work  and installation of the beam apparatus and supporting systems. Operating tests will be initiated in 1997, and major evaluation of test data completed by the end of that year. During the second stage of the project, the IAEA, making use of Polish expertise, will support the transfer of the technology to other developing countries.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he safety and benefits of foods processed
by ionizing radiation are well documented. In an effort to
provide governments, especially those of developing countries,
with scientifically accurate information on issues of general
interest to the public, the International Consultative Group on
Food Irradiation (ICGFI), which was established under the aegis
of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health
Organization (WHO), and the IAEA, decided at its 7th Annual
Meeting in Rome, Italy, on October 1990, to issue a series
of "Fact Sheets" on the subject. 
<P>
ICGFI, an inter-governmental body with a membership of more than
40
governments, has as one of its mandates the function to provide
information to Member States of the FAO, WHO, and IAEA and to the
three organizations themselves on the safe and proper use of food
irradiation technology. The Fact Sheets included here cover
issues relating to: status and trends; scientific and technical
terms; food irradiation and radioactivity; chemical changes in
irradiated food; nutritional quality of irradiated foods; genetic
studies; microbiological safety of irradiated food; irradiation
and food safety; irradiation and food additives and residues;
packaging of irradiated foods; safety of irradiation facilities;
controlling the process; food irradiation costs; irradiated
foods and the consumer; and trade in irradiated foods. 
<P>
The Fact Sheets were first issued by the ICGFI Secretariat (Joint
FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture,
Vienna, Austria) in May 1991.

<P>
Food irradiation is the treatment of food by a certain type of
energy. The process involves exposing the food, either packaged
or in bulk, to carefully controlled amounts of ionizing radiation
for a specific time to achieve certain desirable objectives. The
process cannot increase the normal radioactivity level of the
food, regardless of how long the food is exposed to the
radiation, or how much of an energy "dose" is absorbed.  It can
prevent the division of living cells, such as bacteria and cells
of higher organisms, by changing their molecular structure. It
can also slow down ripening or maturation of certain fruits and
vegetables by causing biochemical reactions in physiological
processes of plant tissues. 
<P>
<B>Who is interested in the process?</B>
<P>
Alongside traditional methods of processing and preserving food,
the technology of food irradiation is gaining more and more
attention around the world. In 39 countries, health and safety
authorities have approved irradiation of altogether some 40
different foods, ranging from spices to grains to deboned chicken
meat to fruits and vegetables. Twenty-nine of these countries are
actually applying the process for commercial purposes in 1995. 
<P>
Decisions in these and other countries have been influenced by
the adoption, in 1983, of a worldwide standard covering
irradiated foods. The standard was adopted by the Codex
Alimentarius Commission, a joint body of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Health
Organization (WHO) representing more than 130 countries. It is
based on the findings of a Joint Expert Committee on Food
Irradiation (JECFI) convened by the FAO, WHO, and International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). JECFI has evaluated available data
in 1969, 1976, and 1980. In 1980, it concluded that "the
irradiation of any food commodity" up to an overall average dose
of 10 kilogray "presents no toxicological hazard" and requires no
further testing. It stated that irradiation up to 10 kilogray
"introduced no special nutritional or microbiological problems"
in foods. 
<P>
<B>Why are countries interested?</B>
<P>
Governmental interest in the process is emerging for many
reasons. They are largely related to persistently high food
losses from infestation, contamination, and spoilage; mounting
concerns over food-borne diseases; and growing international
trade in food products that must meet stiff import standards of
quality and quarantine - all areas in which food irradiation has
demonstrated practical benefits when integrated within an
established system for the safe handling and distribution of
food.  
<P>
The FAO has estimated that worldwide about 25% of all food
production is lost after harvesting to insects, bacteria and
rodents. The use of irradiation alone as a preservation technique
will not solve all the problems of post-harvest food losses. But
it can play an important role in cutting losses and reducing the
dependence on chemical pesticides. Many countries lose huge
amounts of grain because of insect infestation, moulds, and
premature germination. For roots and tuber, sprouting is the
major cause of losses. Several countries, including Belgium,
France, Hungary, Japan, Netherlands, and USSR are irradiating
grains, potatoes, onions, and other products on an industrial
scale. Pilot quantities of potatoes, onions, and garlic have been
irradiated in Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, China, Israel,
Philippines, and Thailand.
<P>
Foodborne diseases pose a widespread threat to human health and
they are an important cause of reduced economic productivity.
Studies by the US Center for Disease Control in early 1990's
showed that even in
the United States, foodborne
diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as <I>Salmonella</I>
and
<I>Campylobacter</I> and by <I>Trichinae</I> and other parasites,
claim an estimated 9000 lives annually and cause 24-81 million
cases of diarrhoeal disease. Economic losses associated with such
foodborne diseases are high--estimated between US $6.5 billion and
$33 billion. 
<P>
The relatively low doses of radiation needed to destroy certain
bacteria in food can be useful in controlling foodborne disease.
Considerable amounts of frozen seafoods, as well as dry food
ingredients, are irradiated for this purpose in Belgium, France
and the
Netherlands. Electron beam irradiation of blocks of mechanically
deboned, frozen poultry products is carried out industrially in
France. Spices are being irradiated in many countries including
Argentina, Brazil,
Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel,
Norway, United States,
and Yugoslavia. 
<P>
Trade in food products is a major factor in regional
or international commerce, and markets are growing. The inability
of countries to satisfy each other's quarantine and public health
regulations is a major barrier to trade. For example, not all
countries allow importation of chemically treated fruit.
Moreover, major importing countries, including the USA and Japan,
have banned the use of certain fumigants identified as
health hazards. 
<P>
The problem is most acute for developing
countries whose economies are still largely based on food and
agricultural production. Radiation processing offers these
countries an alternative to fumigation and some other treatments.
<P>
<B>How much food is being commercially irradiated?</B>
<P>
Each year about
half a million tonnes of food products and ingredients are
irradiated worldwide. This amount is small in comparison to the
total volumes of processed foods and not many of these irradiated
food products enter international commerce. 
<P>
One factor
influencing the pace of the development of food irradiation is
public understanding and acceptance of the process. So far, this
has been difficult to achieve, in view of the misconceptions and
fears often surrounding nuclear-related technologies and the use
of radiation. 
<P>
To help address concerns and correct myths about
food irradiation, a series of fact sheets has been prepared by
the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI).
More than 40 countries participate in the work
of ICGFI. The Group was established under the auspices of the
FAO, IAEA, and WHO to advise the organizations and their Member
States on the use of irradiation to solve food problems related
to international trade, public health, economics, regulations,
and public information. Information about ICGFI and the
technology of food irradiation may be obtained by writing:

<P>
The type of <B>radiation</B> used in processing materials is
limited to
radiations from high energy gamma rays, X-rays and accelerated
electrons. These radiations are also referred to as <B>ionizing
radiations</B> because their energy is high enough to dislodge
electrons from atoms and molecules and to convert them to
electrically charged particles called ions.
<P>
<B>Gamma rays</B> and <B>X-rays</B>, like radiowaves, microwaves,
ultraviolet
and visible light rays, form part of the electromagnetic
spectrum, occurring in the short wave length, high energy region
of the spectrum.  They have the same properties and effects on
materials, their origin being the main difference between them. 
X-rays with varying energies are generated by machines. Gamma
rays with specific energies come from the spontaneous
disintegration of radionuclides. 
<P> 
Naturally occurring and man-made <B>radionuclides</B>, also
called
<B>radioactive isotopes</B> or <B>radioisotopes</B>, are
unstable, and emit
radiation as they spontaneously disintegrate, or decay, to a
stable state.  The time taken by a radionuclide to decay to half
the level of <B>radioactivity</B> originally present is known as
its
<B>half-life</B>, and is specific for each radionuclide of a
particular
element.  The <B>becquerel</B> (Bq) is the unit of radioactivity
and
equals one disintegration per second.
<P>
Only certain radiation sources can be used in food irradiation.
These are the radionuclides <B>cobalt-60</B> or
<B>caesium-137</B>; <B>X-ray</B>
machines having a maximum energy of five million electron volts
(MeV); or <B>electron</B> machines having a maximum energy of 10
MeV. 
Energies from these radiation sources are too low to induce
radioactivity in any material, including food.
<P>

The radionuclide used almost exclusively for the irradiation of
food by gamma rays is cobalt-60.  It is produced by neutron
bombardment in a nuclear reactor of the metal cobalt-59, then
doubly encapsulated in stainless steel "pencils" to prevent any
leakage during its use in a radiation plant. Cobalt-60 has a
half-life of 5.3 years. Caesium-137 is the only other
gamma-emitting radionuclide suitable for industrial processing of
materials. It can be obtained by reprocessing spent, or         
used, nuclear fuel elements and has a half-life of 30 years.
However, because there are few reprocessing facilities         
worldwide, the uncertainty of market supply of commercial
quantities of caesium-137 has meant that there is almost no
demand for its use in radiation plants. In a report on irradiated
foods, the American Council on Science and Health noted that "as
of November 1988 all interested parties including the (US)
Department of Energy now appear to agree that caesium-137 has no
future in gamma processing".                    
<P>
Some <B>machine sources of radiation</B> are suitable for
irradiating
certain materials. High energy <B>electron beams</B> can be
produced
from machines capable of accelerating electrons. Electrons cannot
penetrate very far into food, compared with gamma radiation or
X-rays. X-rays of various energies are produced when a beam of
accelerated electrons bombards a metallic target. Although X-rays
have good penetrability into food, the efficiency of conversion
from electrons to X-rays is generally less than 10%. 
<P>
<B>Radiation
dose</B> is the quantity of radiation energy absorbed by the food
as  
it passes through the radiation field during processing. It is
now generally measured by a unit called the <B>Gray</B> (Gy). In
early
work the unit was the <B>rad</B> (1 Gy = 100 rads). International
health
and safety authorities have endorsed the safety of irradiation
for all foods up to a dose level of 10,000 Gy (10 kGy). In terms
of energy relationships, one gray equals one joule of energy
absorbed per kilogram of food being irradiated.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Does the irradiation process make food
radioactive?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<B>No. Irradiation under controlled conditions does not make food
radioactive.</B>
<P>                     
Everything in our environment, including food, contains trace
amounts of radioactivity. This means that this trace amount
(about 150 to 200 becquerels) of natural radioactivity (from     
elements such as potassium) is unavoidably in our daily diets.   
<P>
In countries where food irradiation is permitted, both the
sources of radiation and their energy levels are regulated and
controlled. The irradiation process involves passing the food
through a radiation field at a set speed to control the amount of
energy or dose absorbed by the food. The food itself never comes
into direct contact with the radiation source. The maximum
allowable energies for electrons and X-rays--two machine-        

generated sources of radiation that can be used--are 10 million
electron volts (MeV) and 5 MeV, respectively. Even when foods are
exposed to very high doses of radiation from these sources, the
maximum level of induced radioactivity would be just
one-thousandth of a becquerel per kilogram of food. <B>This is
200
000 times smaller than the level of radioactivity naturally
present in food.</B>

</TD>
<TD>
Irradiated foods are those that have been deliberately
processed with certain types of radiation energy to bring about 
some desirable properties (for example, to inhibit sprouting or
to destroy food-poisoning bacteria). Apart from foodstuffs, many
other materials are commercially irradiated during manufacturing.
These include cosmetics, wine bottle corks, hospital supplies and
medical products, and some types of food packaging.
<P>
Radioactive foods, on the other hand, are those that have become
accidentally
contaminated by radioactive substances from weapons testing or
nuclear reactor accidents. This type of contamination is totally
unrelated to irradiated food which has been processed for
preservation and other purposes.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q:  Are chemical changes in irradiated
foods, such as the
formation of radiolytic products, harmful?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No. In general, the irradiation process produces very little
chemical change in food.  None of the changes known to occur have
been found to be harmful or dangerous.
<P>
Some of the chemical changes produce so-called "radiolytic"
products.  These products have proven to be familiar ones, such
as glucose, formic acid, acetaldehyde, and carbon dioxide, that
are naturally present in foods or are formed by heat processing. 
The safety of these radiolytic products has been examined very
critically, and no evidence of their harmfulness has been found.
<P>       
The United States Food and Drug Administration has estimated that
the total amount of undetected radiolytic products that might be
formed when food is irradiated at a dose of 1 kilogray would be
less than 3 milligrams per kilogram of food--or less than 3 parts
per million.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Do the "free radicals" which are
produced during irradiation
affect the safety of the food?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No.  There is no evidence to suggest that free radicals, per se,
affect the safety of irradiated food.
<P>
Free radicals - which in scientific terms are atoms or molecules
with an unpaired electron - can be formed during the irradiation
process, as well as by certain other food treatments (such as
toasting of bread, frying, and freeze drying) and during normal
oxidation processes in food.  They are generally very reactive,
unstable structures, that continuously react with substances to
form stable products.
<P>
Free radicals disappear by reacting with each other in the
presence of liquids, such as saliva in the mouth. Consequently,
their ingestion does not create any toxicological or other
harmful effects. This has been confirmed by a long-term
laboratory study in which animals were fed a very dry milk powder
irradiated at 45 kilogray, more than four times the maximum
approved dose for food irradiation. No mutagenic effects were
noted and no tumours were formed. No toxic effects were apparent
in the animals over nine successive generations. Similarly, a
toast of bread (unirradiated), which actually contains more free
radicals than very dry foods that have been irradiated, can be
expected to be harmless.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Does irradiation adversely affect the
nutritional value of food?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>
Extensive research has shown that macronutrients, such as
protein, carbohydrates, and fat, are relatively stable to
radiation doses of up to 10 kilogray. Micronutrients, especially 

vitamins, may be sensitive to any food processing method,
including irradiation. Different types of vitamins have         
varied sensitivity to irradiation and to some other food
processing methods. For example, vitamins C and B-l (thiamine)
are sensitive to irradiation as well as to heat processing. The
Joint Expert Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and International        

Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which examined these and other
issues, stated in its conclusions in 1980 that irradiation does
not induce special nutritional problems in food.                 

<P> 
The change in nutritional value caused by irradiation depends on
a number of factors. They include the radiation dose to which the
food has been exposed, the type of food, packaging, and         
processing conditions, such as temperature during irradiation and
storage time. Most of these factors are also true for other food
preservation technologies. For example, measurement of vitamin C 

content in three varieties of apples kept in cold storage for up
to 1 year showed decreases of between 40% to 70%, depending on
the variety of apple. Yet it has never been suggested that cold  

storage is an inappropriate technology for apples and should not
be used.
<P>
Reports of high vitamin losses from irradiation of pure vitamin
solutions, or by using doses higher than those which would be
used at commercial irradiation facilities, have no relevance for
predicting the radiation sensitivity of a particular vitamin in
food. The complexity of the composition of foods often protects
individual vitamins from radiation decomposition. 
<P>
Seemingly conflicting results of low versus high losses of
vitamin C for some foods may be attributed to differences in     

analytical approaches used by researchers. Some have measured
only ascorbic acid, while others have measured total vitamin C, a
mixture of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid. Both acids
have vitamin C biological activity and are easily transformed
from one to the other. If only ascorbic acid were measured, any
apparent reduction in vitamin C level would be exaggerated.      

<P>            
Just as vitamins vary in their sensitivity to heat, so do they
vary in their sensitivity to radiation. This sensitivity         
depends upon the conditions under which food is irradiated.
Vitamins A,E,C,K and B-1 (thiamine) in foods are relatively
sensitive to radiation, while some other B vitamins such as
riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin D are much more stable.
<P>
Losses are generally less if oxygen is excluded and if the
temperature during irradiation is low. Under optimal conditions,
vitamin losses in foods irradiated at doses up to 1 kilogray are
considered to be insignificant. At higher doses the effect of
irradiation will depend on the specific vitamin, temperature,
dose, food, and packaging. Depending on the food, thiamine levels
may be reduced further by storage and cooking if the food has
been exposed to air during storage, but not necessarily if it has
been packaged without oxygen.

studies<br>

eating<br> irradiated food<br> causes development<br> of abnormal
chromosomes
<br>- is this true?</B></font>
</TD>
<TD>
No. The issue of abnormal chromosomes
as a result of eating
irradiated food has been more sensationalized than any other.
<P>
The claims focus on the incidence of "polyploidy", which is
alleged to result from consumption of products made from wheat
immediately after irradiation.  Polyploidy means a multiple set
of chromosomes. Human cells normally have 46 chromosomes.  If
they are polyploid they could have 92 or even 138 chromosomes. 
The incidence of polyploid cells is naturally occurring and
varies among individuals; the significance of polyploidy is not
known.
<P>
Media reports frequently cite results that were published in the
mid-1970s by a group of scientists from the National Institute of
Nutrition (NIN) in India.  The scientists reported increases in
the frequency of polyploid cells in rats, mice, monkeys, and even
malnourished children that they attributed to consumption of
products made from wheat immediately after irradiation at 0.75
kilogray.  No polyploidy at all was seen when wheat was
irradiated and stored for 12 weeks before consumption.  A number
of institutions in India and elsewhere have tried to repeat the
studies conducted at NIN based on information made available to
them. Some used absorbed dose as high as 45 kGy.  None of these
institutions could come up with results
similar to those found at NIN.
<P>
Reviews included one done by an independent investigative
committee appointed by the Government of India.  In 1976, the
Committee concluded that the available data failed to demonstrate
any mutagenic potential of irradiated wheat. A number of
national scientific committees and independent researchers in
Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, United Kingdom, and United
States also have evaluated the alleged incidence of polyploidy. 
They all concluded that the reported data from NIN do not support
the incidence of increased polyploidy.
<P>
In 1988 D. MacPhee and W. Hall, advisers to an Australian
Parliamentary Committee Inquiry into the use of ionizing
radiation, examined the NIN results.  They concluded that the
inability of other researchers to replicate the NIN results casts
doubts upon the reliability of the NIN conclusions; that
polyploidy is a poor measure of genetic damage; and that "major
biological implausibilities" exist in the chain of occurrences
"which allegedly links the consumption of irradiated food with
the occurrence of genetic events".

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Besides feeding tests using animals,
have there been any human
feeding studies of irradiated foods?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>Yes.  In the early 1980s, eight
feeding studies using several
irradiated food items, including irradiated wheat, were conducted
in China using human volunteers.  More than 400 individuals
consumed irradiated food under controlled conditions for 7 to 15
weeks.
<P>
One focus of the research was the possibility of chromosomal
changes.  Seven of the eight experiments involved investigation
of chromosomal aberrations in 382 individuals.  No significant
difference between the number of chromosomal aberrations in the
control and the test groups could be discovered in any of the
experiments.  Incidence of polyploidy in those who consumed
non-irradiated food and those who consumed irradiated samples
were
within normal range of the overall value of polyploid cells in
participants.

area?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Many animal feeding tests including genetic studies of different
types of irradiated food were carried out in China, Germany,
Japan, Thailand, U.K. and USA in the past few decades.  None of
these studies could demonstrate the genetic effects as a result
of consuming irradiated food.
<P>
The largest study by far was the one conducted by the Raltech
Laboratory on chicken irradiated either by a cobalt-60 source or
electron machine up to a dose of 58 kGy.  Some 134 tonnes of
chicken meat were used in the study to compare high
dose irradiation with heat sterilization of chicken.  The study
involved chronic feeding studies in mice and dogs, teratology
studies and mutagenicity tests.  The comprehensive results were
reviewed by scientists of the US Food and Drug
Administration at the time a petition for low dose irradiation of
chicken was submitted in the mid-1980s.  The studies provided no
evidence 
demonstrating adverse effects from chicken processed with high
doses of radiation.
<P>
Other  types of extensive feeding tests also have been done. Over
the
last 20 years millions of mice, rats, and other laboratory
animals have been bred and reared exclusively on an irradiated
diet.  The diet, treated at doses between 25 and 50 kilogray, has
been fed to laboratory animals at many institutions involved in
food, drug, and pharmaceutical research in Austria, Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and
United States.  No transmittable genetic defects - teratogenic or
oncogenic - have been observed which could be attributed to the
consumption of irradiated diets.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q:  Can irradiation of food increase the
risk of botulism?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Irradiation at internationally recommended levels of up to 10    
kilogray does not increase the risk from botulism any more so
than other "sub-sterilizing" food processes, such as
pasteurization. Food treated by these methods must be handled,
packaged, and stored following good manufacturing practices
(GMPs). Doing so prevents the growth and toxin production of
Clostridium botulinum. Alternatively, high-dose irradiation
(30-60 kilogray) can be used to destroy any Clostridium botulinum
organisms present in the food. 
<P>
Some types of Clostridia cause more concern than others. 
Clostridium botulinum Type E, for example, is found at low levels
in fish and seafood caught in some areas.  It can grow and
produce toxin even when the food is refrigerated at temperatures
as low as 4&#176; C.  Thus, fish and seafood, including their 
products treated by any of the sub-sterilizing processes
including irradiation, must be kept at 3&#176; C or below at all
times during marketing.  Most other types of Clostridium
botulinum cannot grow and produce toxin at temperatures below
10&#176; C. GMPs require that raw foods such as fish, meat, and
chicken are stored at a specific temperature, whether irradiated
or not, to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>:  Can irradiation of food lead to
increased microbiological
hazards?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No. The microbiological safety of irradiated foods has been
investigated by international scientific bodies. One area        

that scientists have specifically looked at is the reduction of
microorganisms that cause spoilage. These microorganisms         
warn consumers, through off odours or discoloration, that the
food may be bad, or unsafe, to eat. Even if irradiation
suppressed microorganisms in spoiled food, it cannot suppress the
outward signs of spoilage and thus cannot be used to cover up
spoiled food. In addition, scientific evidence indicates that
proper irradiation can neither increase virulence of pathogenic
microorganisms nor their ability to "grow better" in irradiated 
food.                    
<P>
In 1982, at the request of the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization
(WHO), the Board of the International Committee on Food         
Microbiology and Hygiene considered the evidence for the
microbiological safety of food irradiation. It concluded that
modern food handling technology was adequate to control potential

problems created by the suppression of spoilage microorganisms
and that food irradiation does not present any increased
microbiological hazards to health. Independent national expert
committees in Denmark, Sweden, United Kingdom, USA, and Canada
have since reaffirmed these conclusions. They essentially endorse
the findings of the Joint Expert Committee on the Wholesomeness
of Irradiated Foods convened in l 980 by the FAO, WHO, and
International Atomic Energy Agency.                    
<P>
Important to note is that irradiation is not the only food
processing technique which suppresses microorganisms signalling
spoilage. Heat pasteurization, chemical treatments, and certain
packaging methods have the same effect. Food processed by
pasteurization-type methods must be properly packaged,         
handled, and stored to ensure safety.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Are foods in which microbial toxin or
viruses are already formed
suitable for irradiation?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No, only foods of good hygienic quality should be irradiated. In
this respect, irradiation does not differ from heat
pasteurization, freezing, or other food processes. While these
processes can destroy bacteria, they may not totally destroy
preformed toxins and viruses already in the food. It is very
important that foods intended for processing--by whatever
method--are of good quality and handled and prepared according to

good manufacturing practices (GMPs) established by national or
international authorities. In some cases, strict regulations
prohibit distribution of some foods. Many countries, for example,
do not permit oysters to be harvested from areas known to be
contaminated with raw sewage because of the danger of hepatitis  

viruses. No food processing methods should be used to substitute
for GMPs in food production and handling.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Can irradiation be used to make spoiled
food good, or to clean up
"dirty" food?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No.  Neither irradiation nor any other food treatment can reverse
the spoilage process and make bad food good.  If food already
looks, tastes or smells bad - signs of spoilage - before
irradiation, it cannot be "saved" by any treatment including
irradiation.  The bad appearance, taste or smell will remain. 
Food irradiation is not magic.
<P>
Treatments such as heat pasteurization, chemical fumigation, and
irradiation, however, are effective in destroying or suppressing
microbial contamination of food.  Heat pasteurization and
fumigation have been effectively used in this way for decades to
"clean up" foods, specifically to destroy pathogenic
microorganisms in milk and other liquid products, and to destroy
spoilage microflora or microorganisms and insects in spices  and
dry foods.  These treatments are done intentionally for public
health reasons; for example, to destroy microorganisms such as
<I>Salmonella</I>, <I>Shigella</I>, and <I>Campylocbacter</I>
that are associated with
food-borne diseases.  Irradiation is especially effective as a
control measure for parasitic diseases transmitted through solid
food, especially those of animal origin.
<P>
Food processes such as heating, freezing, chemical treatment, and
irradiation are not intended to serve as substitutes for good
hygienic practices.  Both at the national and international
levels, good manufacturing practices (GMPs) govern the handling
of specific foods and food products.  They must be followed in
the preparation of food, whether the food is intended for further
processing by irradiation or any other means.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Does irradiating food that contains
pesticide residues or
additives present any health hazards?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No. There is no scientific evidence to indicate any health hazard
associated with irradiation of food containing pesticide residues
and additives.
<P>
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
examined the irradiation of foods containing pesticide residues.
It specifically calculated the amount of radiolytic products that
would be expected to be formed if foods containing pesticide
residues were irradiated at a dose of 1 kilogray. This dose is in
the upper range of that expected to be used for fruits,
vegetables, and grains for disinfestation purposes. If the
pesticide residue level in the food is about 1 part per million
(an average level) then the calculated total yield of all
radiolytic products from the pesticide residue would be about    
0.000033 milligrams per kilogram of food, or 1 gram in 3000
tonnes of food. The FDA regards this amount as "virtually nil".
It concludes that "the potential toxicity of each radiolytic
product from a pesticide chemical residue in foods that are
irradiated would be negligible" and that "such pesticide residues
do not pose a hazard to health."                    
<P>
Studies have been done on food additives that assume the use of
higher doses of radiation. A food additive is defined by the
Codex Alimentarius Commission of the Food and Agriculture
Organization and World Health Organization as a substance not
normally used as a food ingredient but which is deliberately
added to the food to produce a technological result. Colourants,
man-made anti-oxidants, preservatives such as potassium sorbate,
and polyphosphates are examples of food additives, forming 0.01
to 0.1% of the total food weight.                    
<P>
These studies indicate that at a radiation dose of 10 kilogray,
which is the maximum dose allowed for food irradiation, yields of
all radiolytic products from food additives range from 3 to 30
parts per billion. For a person with a total annual diet of 500
kilograms of food, these figures correspond to a negligible
annual individual intake of radiolytic products--between 0.1 and
milligram--from an additive in a processed irradiated food that
accounts for 5% of the total diet. The probability of harm
occurring from radiolytic product formation from food additives
is therefore considered to be extremely low indeed.

in contact with plastic or

</TD>
<TD>               
No. Results of extensive research have shown that almost all
commonly used food packaging materials tested are suitable for
use at doses up to 10 kilogray, which is the internationally
approved limit for irradiating foods.                    
<P>
Various types of packaging materials have been approved for use
when food is irradiated. Their suitability for food intended for
irradiation has been studied in Canada, the United Kingdom, the
United States, and a few other countries. A number of food
packaging materials were approved for use in food irradiation by
the US Food and Drug Administration more than 20 years ago. More
recently, Canada and Poland has approved additional materials,
including a multi-layered polyethylene film, as safe for
packaging foods which will be irradiated.
<P>
Sophisticated tests have been used to evaluate the effect of
radiation on plastic and other types of packaging materials.     
Researchers look at the material's post-irradiation stability,
mechanical strength, and permeability to water and gases, and at
the extractability of the plastics, additives, and adhesives.

Yes.  Laminated plastic films with aluminium foil are routinely
sterilized by radiation.  They are used for hermetically sealed
"bag-in-a-box" products, such as tomato paste, fruit juices, and
wines.  Other aseptic packaging materials, dairy product
packaging, single-serving containers (for example, for cream),
and wine bottle corks are also sterilized by irradiation prior to
filling and sealing to prevent product contamination.            

<P>      
Other types of materials used to wrap food or other products also
are routinely processed by radiation in many countries. The
radiation process is used to "crosslink" the material's polymer
chains for greater strength and heat resistance, and for
producing plastics with special properties  (for example, shrink
wrap).

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Have there been major accidents at
industrial irradiation         
facilities?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Yes. Over the past 25 years, there have been a few major
accidents at industrial irradiation facilities that caused injury
or death to workers because of accidental exposure to a lethal
dose of radiation. All of the accidents happened because safety
systems had been deliberately bypassed and proper control
procedures had not been followed. None of these accidents
endangered public health and environmental safety.               
<P>
In most cases, reports of "accidents" have actually turned out to
be operational incidents. Such incidents have caused the
irradiator to be shut down but they did not harm anyone or pose a
risk to the environment. The distinction between accidents and
incidents is used by authorities responsible for safety in all
industries. This is the case for many other food technologies,
such as canning, fumigation and the agro-chemical industry, which
are also potentially hazardous to workers. As at irradiation
facilities, controls and formal protocols are required to prevent
accidents.
<P>                    
The radiation processing industry is considered to have a very
good safety record. Today there are about 170 industrial gamma
irradiation facilities operating worldwide, a number of which
process food in addition to other types of products. Most
irradiation facilities are used for sterilizing disposable
medical and pharmaceutical supplies, and for processing other
non-food items.

or <BR>accidental exposure <BR>to radiation?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Any industrial activity includes certain risks to human beings
and the environment.  One of the risks at irradiation facilities
is associated with the potential hazard of accidental exposure to
ionizing radiation.  Under normal operating conditions, all
exposures of workers to radiation are prevented because the
radiation source is shielded. Irradiators are designed with
several levels of redundant protection to detect equipment
malfunction and to protect personnel from accidental radiation
exposure. Potentially hazardous areas are monitored and a system
of interlocks prevents unauthorized entry into the radiation cell
when the source is exposed. Worker safety further rests upon
strict operating procedures and proper training. All radiation
plants must be licensed. In most countries, regulations require
periodic inspection of facilities to ensure compliance with the
terms of operating licenses.  In the United Kingdom, the Health
and Safety Executive has reported to a parliamentary committee
that personnel working in the country's 10 irradiation facilities
face no unusual dangers:  "...<I>the risk is kept under effective
control by the use of sophisticated safety control systems.  The
plants are constructed with very heavy radiation shielding and
thus the process presents no risk to the general public...We do
not expect that the legalisation of foodstuffs irradiation will
present any novel health and safety issues within our area of
interest"</I>.

Radioactive material required for irradiators is transported in

and international standards modelled upon the <I>Regulations for
Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials</I> of the International
Atomic Energy Agency.  Large quantities of radioactive material
are safely shipped all over the world to supply some 170
irradiators processing a variety of goods, mainly medical
products such as syringes, physician gloves, sutures, and
hospital gowns.  From 1955 to early 1988, for example, Canada
shipped approximately 190 million curies of cobalt-60 in 870
separate shipments without any radiation hazard to the
environment or release of radioactive materials.  Over the same
period, approximately one million shipments of radioisotopes for
industrial, hospital, and research use were made in North America
without radiation accidents.  This excellent safety record far
exceeds that of other industries shipping hazardous materials
such as toxic chemicals, crude oil, or gasoline.  The same
procedures used so successfully and safely to transport
radioactive materials to existing irradiators will of course be
used for transporting radioactive materials to any additional
irradiators constructed for food processing.

</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
No.  It is impossible for a "meltdown" to occur in a gamma
irradiator or for the radiation source to explode.  The source of
radiation energy used at irradiators cannot produce neutrons,
substances which can make materials radioactive, so no nuclear
"chain reaction" can occur at an irradiator.  The walls of the
irradiation cell though which the food passes, the machinery
inside the cell, and the product being processed cannot become
radioactive.  No radioactivity is released into the environment.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Do gamma irradiators have radioactive
waste disposal problems?    </B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>

No. Radioactive waste does not accumulate at irradiation
facilities because no radioactivity is produced. The radiation   

energy used at some irradiators--namely electrons or X-rays--is
generated by industrial machines called accelerators. At         
gamma irradiators, radionuclide sources, typically cobalt-60 or
more rarely caesium-137, are used as the sources of radiation    

energy. These elements decay over time to non-radioactive nickel
and non-radioactive barium, respectively. The sources are removed
from the irradiator when the radioactivity falls to a low level,
usually between 6% and 12% of the initial level (this takes 16 to
21 years for cobalt-60). The elements are then returned in a
shipping container to the supplier who has the option of
reactivating them in a nuclear reactor or storing them. Canada
has calculated that all the cobalt-60 it supplied for use in 1988
(about 100 million curies) would require a storage space of about

1.25 cubic metres, roughly equivalent to the space occupied by a
small desk.                    
<P>
Basically the same procedures are followed when an irradiation
plant closes down. The sources can be acquired by another user or
returned to the supplier, the machinery dismantled, and the
building used for other purposes. There is no radiation hazard
for the new occupants or the general public.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Do measures exist to control the
irradiation process to ensure
that foods are properly treated?</B>  </FONT>
</TD>
<TD>                  

Yes. Over the past 30 years, laws and regulations have been      
promulgated to govern operations at irradiators used to process
non-food products, such as medical supplies.  About 170 such
irradiators are operating around the world.  The plants, which
must be approved by governmental authorities before construction,
are subject to regular inspections, audits, and other reviews to
ensure that they are safely and properly operated.  These types
of governmental controls would also be valid for irradiation
facilities processing food.  For example, the principle of lot
traceability is an essential part of process controls, whether
the product is a pharmaceutical or a fruit, and irrespective of
the technology involved.
<P>
At the international level, provisional guidelines for good
manufacturing practices (GMPs) and good radiation practices for a
number of foods have been issued by the International
Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI), a joint group of
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA). They cover all aspects of treatment,
handling, and distribution. These guidelines provide a good basis
for preparing the detailed protocols needed to implement
irradiation on a commercial scale.                    
<P>
The guidelines emphasize that, as with all food technologies,
effective quality control systems need to be installed and
adequately monitored at critical control points at the
irradiation facility. Foods should be handled, stored, and
transported according to GMPs before, during, and after
irradiation. Only foods meeting microbiological criteria and
other quality standards should be accepted for irradiation.      
<P>
The Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO and WHO has further
issued its recommended standards for the irradiation of food.
These standards state that irradiated foods should be accompanied
by shipping documents identifying the irradiator, date of
treatment, lot identification, dose, and other details of
treatment. 
<P>
ICGFI additionally has established an international registry of
irradiators that meet standards for good operations. It also
organizes training courses for irradiator operators, plant
managers, and supervisors on proper processing with emphasis on
GMPs, dosimetry, record-keeping, and lot identification, and for 
food control officials on proper inspection procedures required
for food irradiation processing and trade in irradiated foods.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Besides these regulatory controls, are
there tests to detect
whether food has been irradiated?  </B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Yes, a number of detection methods for irradiated food have been
developed in the past ten years to enforce the labelling
regulation and to bolster consumer confidence.  With the
increasing sensitivity of scientific instruments, methods such as
electron spin resonance, thermo-luminescence, ortho-tyrosine and
free fatty acid analysis, can determine accurately whether
certain
food have been previously irradiated or not.  Some national
authorities, notably those in Germany and the U.K., have already
adopted some of these methods for monitoring irradiated foods. 
No single method, however, has yet been developed that reliably
detects irradiation of all types of foods or the radiation dose
levels that were used.    
<P>        
The lack of a single test to identify a treated product is not
unique to the irradiation process. Organically grown produce
cannot be identified analytically, nor can meat slaughtered in
accordance with Jewish or Islamic requirements. Additionally,
chilled or frozen foods cannot be analyzed for unacceptable
temperature fluctuations which might have occurred during
distribution, nor can thermally sterilized (canned) foods be
analyzed after treatment to assure that the correct
time-temperature regime was applied.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Will irradiation increase the cost of
food?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>

Any food process will add cost. In most cases, however, food
prices would not necessarily rise just because a product has been
treated.  Many variables affect food costs, and one of them is
the cost of processing.  Canning, freezing, pasteurization,
refrigeration, fumigation, and irradiation will add cost to the
product.  These treatments will also bring benefits to consumers
in terms of availability and quantity, storage life, convenience,
and improved hygiene of the food.
<P>
Broken down, irradiation costs range from US $10 to $15 per tonne
for a low-dose application (for example, to inhibit the growth of
sprouts in potatoes and onions) to US $100 to $250 per tonne for
a high-dose application (for example, to ensure hygienic quality
of spices). These costs are competitive with alternative
treatments. In some cases, irradiation can be considerably less
expensive. For disinfestation of fruit in Thailand and the United
States, for example, it has been estimated that the cost of
irradiation would be only 10%-20% of the cost of vapour-heat
treatment.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: How much does a typical food
irradiation facility cost?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
The cost to build a commercial food irradiation plant is in the
range of US
$3 million to $5 million, depending on its size, processing
capacity, and other factors. This is within the range of plant
costs for other food technologies. For example, a
moderately-sized, ultra-high temperature plant for sterilizing
milk, fruit juices, and other liquids costs about US $2 million.
A small vapour-heat treatment plant for disinfestation of fruits
costs about US $1 million.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Is it true that consumers are opposed
to buying irradiated food?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
The view that consumers are opposed to buying irradiated
food cannot be substantiated.  This misconception might have
arisen from opinion polls conducted during the 1980's in some
Western countries. Certain consumer groups often amplified some
poll findings to support their position.
<P>
Most of these surveys, however, did not supply the respondents
with sufficient background information on the safety, benefits
and limitations of food irradiation. As a result they often
confused the term "irradiated food" with radioactive food
contaminated with radionuclides (at a time when such contaminated
food was a valid concern in most countries).<I>(See the fact
sheet on <A HREF="radio.html">Food Irradiation and
Radioactivilty</A>)</I>
<P>
Since the early 1990's, consumers have increased their
understanding of food safety risks has become more realistic. 
Consumers readily choose irradiated foods in commercial marketing
and tests.  When consumer surveys provide accurate, factual
information, allowing consumers to make an informed choice, the
results indicate good support for irradiation processing.  
<P>
In several market trials (in Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, China,
France, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, the Philippines, Poland,
Thailand and the USA)  of labelled irradiated foods sold
alongside their non-irradiated counterparts or the same food
treated
by other methods, consumers willingly bought the irradiated
products, often with preference over non-irradiated ones.  For
example, when irradiated papaya were put on market trials
alongside hot water-treated papaya in California in 1987 (to
satisfy quarantine regulation), irradiated papaya outsold the
other ones by a ratio of 11:1.  When irradiated
strawberries were offered alongside non-irradiated ones in
Chicago during the 1992-93 seasons, consumer preferred
irradiated strawberries by ratios ranging from 10:1 to 20:1,
depending on the time of sale.  In a three-
month trial in Bangkok, Thailand in 1986, irradiated fermented
pork sausages (for <I>Salmonella</I> control) outsold
non-irradiated
ones by a ratio of 10:1.  The most significant factor favouring
irradiated food appears to be superior quality and safety.  In
none of these trials, which were carried out under actual market
conditions, was there any evidence to indicate that informed
consumers will not accept irradiated foods.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: What kinds of irradiated food are being
marketed at retail levels?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Several irradiated foods are used directly by the food
industry - for example spices and mechanically deboned poultry
meat - for
manufacturing various types of processed food. Many irradiated
foods are being marketed at the retail level. They include:
<P>
<B>Fresh Fruits (papaya, citrus, apples, strawberries, lychee,
rambutan, cherimoya, tomatoes).</B>
<P>
Since the first commercial food irradiator in the USA
(operated by Food Technology
Service, Inc., formerly Vindicator Co.) began operating near
Tampa, Florida in 1992,
irradiated strawberries, tomatoes and citrus have been marketed
at some retail outlets in Florida and Illinois.  The USDA
announced its proposed policy in 1995 to accept irradiation as a
quarantine treatment of fresh fruits against fruit flies
regardless of the host commodities.  Fruits from Hawaii including
papaya, rambutan, lychees and cherimoya which are natural host of
fruit flies have been irradiated and marketed at the retail level
in
several States in the USA during 1995.  All irradiated products
were labelled with the irradiation logo and a statement "treated
by
irradiation" either on the package or at the point of sale.  Once
the proposed USDA policy has been finalized, it is possible that
irradiation could be used as a quarantine treatment of fresh
fruits from other countries against fruit flies regardless of
host and commodity as long as the fruit is not a host for other
quarantine pests.
<P>
In China, irradiated apples have been marketed at the retail
level in
Shanghai and other cities since the early 1990s.
<P>
<B>Spices and Dried Vegetable Seasonings</B>
<P>
Irradiated spices and dried vegetable seasonings have been
marketed at retail levels in South Africa over the past 10 years
and the volume is increasing.  In fact, irradiation is used so
routinely by the spice trade in South Africa that it would be
difficult to find spices treated by some other means (fumigation,
heat) in that country.  A variety of processed food (e.g. sauces,
salad dressings, sandwich spread) also incorporate irradiated
spices and vegetable seasonings. All irradiated products have to
be labelled with an irradiation logo plus the word "Radurised". 
Since 1995, irradiated spices and dried vegetable seasonings have
also been marketed at retail levels in India and the USA.
<P>
<B>Frog Legs</B>
<P>
Because of strict microbiological specifications in France, most
if not all frog legs marketed in that country have been treated
by irradiation to ensure their hygienic quality.  The product has
to be labelled "treated by ionizing radiation" to advise
consumers.
<P>
<B>Onions, Garlic</B>
<P>
Vadilla onions have been irradiated in Florida and marketed at
retail level in Chicago since 1992.  Irradiated garlic has been
sold in several cities in China since the early 1990s in
increasing quantities.  All products are labelled to indicate the
treatment.
<P>
<B>Chicken</B>
<P>
Following the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration and
the quality control programme for irradiated poultry in 1993,
small quantities of irradiated chicken have been offered for sale
in some retail outlets in Florida, Illinois, Iowa and Kansas with
success.  Consumers in these States are being given the choice to
buy irradiated chicken without pathogens such as
<I>Salmonella</I> for the first time.
<P>
<B>Fermented Pork Sausages</B>
<P>
Irradiated fermented pork sausages (Nham, a local delicacy in
Thailand) treated for <I>Salmonella</I> control are gaining
popularity
since their first market trial in 1986.  Increasing quantities of
this irradiated product are being supplied to supermarkets in
Bangkok.  There is a widespread demand for this irradiated
product (almost always consumed raw) as the risk from infection
by <I>Salmonella</I> has been removed.  The irradiation logo and
statement indicating irradiation treatment are required on the
label.
<P>
<B>Dried Fish</B>
<P>
Since the semi-commercial irradiator in Chittagong, Bangladesh
went into operation in 1994, small quantities of irradiated dried
fish (for insect control) have been available in the market in
Chittagong and other cities in Bangladesh with labelling
indicating irradiation treatment.
<P>
Successful market trials of other irradiated food such as rice,
mung beans, potatoes, onions, etc.  in several countries in
recent years will likely lead to further commercialization of
irradiated food in the near future.  The actual sale of
irradiated food in the market in several countries has again
demonstrated that consumers will accept irradiated food if they
have the choice and receive proper information to enable them to
make an informed decision.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q: Are irradiated foods being traded
internationally?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Some irradiated foods such as spices and dried vegetable
seasonings and other food ingredients such as mechanically
deboned poultry meat, have already entered international commerce
for use mainly by the food industry for various types of
processed food.  The nature of the spice trade requires that
spices,
e.g. pepper from various sources, be mixed to achieved certain
grades to satisfy market demand.  Thus, it is possible that only
a portion of spices in the same shipment is irradiated.  The
production of and trade in irradiated spices have increased
significantly in recent years from about 5,000 tons in 1987 to
20,000 tons in 1992 to over 40,000 in 1995.
<P>
Commodities such as fresh fruits and vegetables are expected to
be
irradiated to overcome quarantine barriers against fruit flies in
the near future.  The United States Department of Agriculture has
proposed a new policy to accept irradiation as a quarantine
treatment of these fresh commodities against fruit flies
regardless of their host.  A regulation to this effect is
expected during 1996 which should facilitate wider trade in such
irradiated commodities.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q:  How can we be sure that irradiated
food is treated properly?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
Prior to the production of irradiated food, a commercial scale
irradiation facility would have to be established under
authorization of national authorities, e.g. Atomic Energy
Commission, Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Control
Board, etc.  A regulation to permit the production and sale of
irradiated food would have to be in place prior to subjecting the
food to trade.  Such a regulation, for example, specifies that
food of certain
quality be used; that the maximum approved dose is adhered to for
a
particular food; that the irradiation facility and the process of
irradiation are routinely inspected by competent authorities; and
that
irradiated food must be labelled.
<P>
To assist a number of countries to develop proper regulations on
food irradiation, the International Consultative Group on Food
Irradiation (ICGFI) has issued guidelines to
control irradiation facilities, Codes of Good Irradiation
Practices related to different classes of food, established an
International Inventory for Authorized Food Irradiation
Facilities, operated a Food Irradiation Process Control School
or operators of irradiation facilities and food
inspectors, etc.  ICGFI guidelines and recommendations have been
followed by most countries in developing their regulations.
<P>
National regulations require that irradiated food be labelled
with a statement indicating the treatment and, often, with an
international logo for irradiated food.  Such a label provides
consumers with not only the right to choose but essential
information about the product and the purpose of irradiation. 
Experience with both market trials and commercial sale of
irradiated food has proved that informed consumers are not
against
but prefer labelling of irradiated food.

<FONT COLOR=#10ff10><B>Q:  Can a government deny entry of
irradiated food into its country?</B></FONT>
</TD>
<TD>
A government can deny entry of any product into its territory. 
However, under the provision of the Agreement on the Application
of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS), being enforced by
the World Trade Organization (WTO), such a government (if a
member of WTO) may be requested to furnish justifications on
scientific grounds if its import regulations are stricter than
recognized  international standards, guidelines and
recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (food
safety); International Plant Protection Convention (plant
protection
and quarantine); and International Office of Epizootics (animal
health and
quarantine).
</DL>
<P>
With the existence of the Codex  General Standard for Irradiated
Foods - which recognizes the safety and effectiveness of food
irradiation - and the endorsement of irradiation as a quarantine
treatment of fresh agricultural produce by regional plant
protection organizations which operate within the framework of
the IPPC, it will be rather difficult for a government to deny
entry of food treated by irradiation based on the principle of
the Codex Standard.

FOREWORD

<P>
<HR>
<P>
Some forty years ago - with the nuclear arms race gathering      
momentum - the international community determined that a       
special institution was needed in the UN family to tackle       
nuclear issues. The International Atomic Energy Agency       
(IAEA) was thus created in Vienna in 1957 with a particularly    
challenging mandate: to promote peaceful applications of        
atomic energy worldwide for humanity's benefit while,
simultaneously, guarding against the spread of its destructive
use.   
<P>
While this mandate remains the same today, the programmes and
activities of the Agency have considerably broadened as        
nuclear-based technologies have expanded into many new        
fields.
<P>
To the public, the media and lawmakers in IAEA Member        
States, the IAEA is best known for its "safeguards" work -       
ensuring that its worldwide system of monitoring and inspection
of nuclear materials remains effective. Indeed, such activities
receive wide attention when violations are detected, as        
was the case in Iraq where the IAEA was called upon under a      
mandate of the UN Security Council to carry out an unprecedented
effort to neutralize a clandestine weapons programme.
<P>
Beyond specialized circles, however, few are aware that the      
IAEA collaborates with almost every major UN agency on a       
vast array of scientific challenges: improving human health;     
promoting food security; controlling pollution; managing       
freshwater resources; understanding climate change; protecting
the oceans; boosting energy production; and a variety of     
other pressing concerns affecting economic development and       
the environment. This booklet illustrates such inter-agency
co-operation through concrete examples.
<P>
As the world community pauses to reflect on the first 50 years   
of the United Nations, we must recognize the significance of     
the moment. Today we are heading towards a unified global       
economy and trading system; we share a rapidly integrating       
system of high-speed communications; and we move ever closer to
global consensus on a consistent and coherent set of principles
for the conduct of States.
<P>
Clearly, the 21st century will offer both the means and the      
opportunities for greater global co-operation. No doubt, it will 
present ever greater challenges to the United Nations family.    
But as this booklet demonstrates, the UN family has developed
both the capabilities and the expertise to tackle, individually
and in partnerships, a wide range of economic, social, and
environmental problems.
<P>
Working in partnership with UN system organizations and others at
the national and international levels, the IAEA will continue to
contribute to efforts that harness nuclear energy for sustainable
development and for the benefit of humankind.

On Zanzibar Island off the East African coast, thousands        
of adult male tsetse flies are being released from an airplane.
The flies have been bred in a small laboratory in Tanzania, and
then sterilized with radiation. The goal is to interrupt their
reproductive cycle and eradicate them over a three year period,
thus freeing the island from a disease that has decimated cattle
herds across much of Africa.

Two elements unite these seemingly disparate activities:        
nuclear science and international co-operation. Woven together
they nourish a key mission of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) - to promote the safe and peaceful application of
nuclear technologies through intergovernmental exchange and
collaboration.
<P>
These snapshots from around the world highlight just a few of the
beneficial activities under way that benefit from partnerships
forged between the IAEA and other parts of the United Nations
system. As illustrated in this booklet, such partnerships are
aimed at addressing many of the key developmental, arms control,
and environmental challenges currently facing developing
countries and regions, and the global community as a whole.      
<P>
Since its creation in the late 1950s, the IAEA has served as a   
catalyst for the transfer of nuclear technologies to its Member  
States, especially to developing countries. The Agency has       
established strong co-operation arrangements with many of the key
UN development agencies in order to advance the contribution of
nuclear science and technology in the fields of agriculture,
human health, industry, environmental protection and many other
sectors.
<P>
Principal partners in this work are the Food and Agriculture     
Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). The Agency is also
developing co-operative arrangements with multilateral
development banks, bilateral donors and non-governmental
organizations and institutes.

<P>
Food production has made extraordinary advances across most of
the planet in recent decades, and has generally kept pace with
rapid population growth. But production advances have been very
uneven - especially in the developing world.  Per capita food
production across much of Africa, for example, has fallen
significantly over the past two decades as population growth
continued to outstrip food outputs. 
<P>
Indeed, an estimated 800 million people remain undernourished
throughout the developing
world in the mid-1990s. And while the vast majority of the
undernourished poor live in Asia, the greatest recent increases
have been experienced in Africa.
<P>
Scientifically based crop improvements through plant breeding and
genetic engineering have played a major role in helping world
food grain output to double since the early 1970s. But supplying
the developing world's rapidly growing population with an
adequate food supply in the next century will be a far more
formidable challenge. In little more than 50 years, global demand
for food may be up to three times greater than today, according
to the World Resources Institute, and most of this new demand
will be in the developing world. 
<P>
The necessity for combining agricultural and nuclear expertise
was foreseen in the international community more than 30 years
ago when FAO and IAEA began working together in a Joint Division
of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. 
<P>
Today, the foundations for continuing scientific advances are
well established: the Joint Division is managing more than 500
research contracts and providing technical supervision and
support to more than 250 agricultural projects around the world.
The FAO/IAEA Agricultural and Biotechnology Laboratory at
Seibersdorf, Austria, plays a central role in such research and
development and the transfer of technology to countries around
the world.                 
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>Breeding More Productive Plants</A>
</B>
<P>
More productive and sustainable agriculture requires improved
cultivars with increased resistance to plant diseases, insect
pests and soil stresses. But the gene pool of many species,
including many local food crops in developing countries, is often
too narrow to meet such breeding objectives.
<P>
Through the continuing co-operation of IAEA and FAO, nuclear
techniques are being applied - often in conjunction with
biotechnologies - to develop new cultivars of important food
crops. Irradiation-derived mutants, which are genetically
different from parent stock, are selected for further        
breeding.
<P>
One effort focussing on genetic improvements in basic food crops
in a developing West African nation, Mali, has produced very
promising results. Several improved mutants of local varieties of
sorghum and African rice were developed using gamma irradiation.
The sorghum mutants mature earlier and have better grain quality
and greater drought resistance than the local cultivars. They are
being further tested in multi-location trials, and may soon be
released as varieties and multiplied for distribution to farmers.
<P>
As in many other African countries, food production in Mali has
increased slower than the rate of population growth, and the
country must depend on more than US $90 million worth of cereal
imports annually. Utilizing the improved seeds, a modest 15%
increase in rice production alone could save the country US
$24 million a year. 
<P>
Complementary research and development
activities of the IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratory are currently
directed towards optimizing mutation induction techniques to
create greater genetic variation. Increasing emphasis is being
devoted to plants of primary importance in the diets of Africa's
poor, such as bananas, plantain, cassava and rice.               
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_2>Biofertilizer for Farmers in Bangladesh</A>
</B>
<P>
Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest and most densely        
populated countries. Virtually every available piece of farmland
is cultivated with at least one crop per year, and sometimes as
many as three. Rice is the grain staple for most people, while
pulses, the edible seeds of leguminous plants, are the principal
source of protein for the poor.
<P>
In fields cultivated with lentils, chickpeas and peanuts just
outside Dhaka, some pioneering work is being underetaken to
develop <B>biofertilizers</B> that can substantially boost pulse 
yields and substitute for expensive chemical fertilizers. This
work is sponsored by the IAEA's Department of Technical
Co-operation, guided by the FAO/IAEA Joint Division and carried
out by the Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA).   
<P>
Nature provided legumes with a unique gift: when exposed to     
the rhizobia bacterium in the soil, they generate nitrogen
"fixing" nodules on their roots which nourish the plant and help 
it produce more food. BINA scientists have been working to       
identify which strains of pulses can "fix" the most nitrogen     
under specific soil conditions and with varying strains of       
rhizobia.
<P>
Using a unique nitrogen-15 (15N) technique developed by the Joint
Division, BINA's studies have discovered that application of a
mixture of peat and the best strains of local rhizobia can add 70
to 100 kilograms per hectare of atmospheric nitrogen to the soil.
This locally prepared mixture costs as little as US $3-4 per
hectare, and compares quite favourably with the US $20-25 that
would be needed to fertilize with chemical compounds.
<P>
It would take 750 tonnes of such biofertilizers to treat all the 
fields growing lentils, chickpeas and peanuts each year in       
Bangladesh. Thus far, BINA's capacity to produce it has reached
only about 20 tonnes per year. But while the trials will continue
through 1996, the government has already demonstrated strong
interest in encouraging the growth of a biofertilizer industry in
Bangladesh - based on a partnership between BINA, the Agriculture
Ministry and private companies.
<P>
This promising scientific breakthrough could have a very positive
financial impact for a country in a constant battle to attain
basic food self-sufficiency: an increase in overall legume
production of just 25% could save the country US $25 million in
imported foodstuffs and US $6 million in chemical fertilizers.   
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_3>
Freeing Zanzibar from the Tsetse Fly
</A>
</B>
<P>
Tsetse flies transmit a disease causing sleeping sickness in     
humans and the deadly 'nagana' in cattle. The presence of the    
insects has prevented settlement and development of large
expanses of Africa. While some species of the tsetse have been   
temporarily controlled in West Africa, eradication continues to
be an elusive goal. Beginning in 1994, the FAO/IAEA Joint        
Division began targeting one species of tsetse for eradication   
which has caused sizeable losses of cattle in Zanzibar,        
Tanzania.
<P>
The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a unique, non-polluting    
method for insect control and eradication pioneered by the       
Joint Division and applied to numerous pests in recent years     
from the Mediterranean fruit fly to the New World screw-worm.
Radiation-sterilized male insects are released into an infested
area. When they mate with females in nature, no offspring is
produced and infestation can be reduced and ultimately
eliminated.
<P>
Since 1994, weekly aerial releases of sterilized male tsetse
flies have been under way to cover the entire southern portion of
Zanzibar; in the next phase, releases will be initiated in the   
northern half. The sterile flies are being bred both in the
IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratory and at a recently refurbished     
mass rearing facility in Tanga, Tanzania.
<P>
The overall goal is complete eradication of the island's flies   
over three years and the establishment of a quarantine to protect
against reinfestation. Already, up to 45% of all wild female
flies in the southern portion of the island show signs of        
induced sterility.
<P>
The Joint Division is providing experts for the tsetse mass      
rearing technology, the SIT releases and the entomological       
monitoring of the target population. With complete
implementation, the direct economic benefits for Zanzibar from
this project are expected to exceed US $2 million per year.

<P>
<HR>
<P>
One out of five people in the developing world (roughly 800
million people) struggles through life malnourished, a condition
that stunts growth and mental capacity, lowers disease resistance
and limits economic productivity. Malnutrition is also a key
factor in the deaths of some 13 million children each year in
developing countries. Micronutrient deficiencies, moreover,
afflict over 2 billion people around the world, leading to immune
disorders, mental retardation, blindness and even death.         
<P>
In co-operation with the World Health Organization (WHO), the
IAEA's Division of Human Health is helping developing countries
to use nuclear techniques to assess such food and nutrition
problems, and to launch nutrition intervention programmes at the
national, community and household levels.
<P>
Isotope techniques have been applied extensively in
industrialized countries to gain a better understanding of human 
nutrition and energy requirements. In developing countries, they
can help to make the best use of scarce food resources by shaping
the design of food supplementation and dietary diversity
programmes aimed specifically at the most vulnerable groups -
mothers and children.
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>Monitoring Nutritional Advances in Peru</A>
</B>
<P>
Almost 40% of the children under 6 years of age are chronically
undernourished in Peru, and an additional 27% remain at risk.
Pre-schoolers and breast-feeding children are most seriously
affected with deficiencies in iron, vitamin A, iodine and
calories. 
<P>
To directly address this problem, the Government is carrying     
out a major nutritional assistance programme providing
supplemental breakfasts to more than 300 000 undernourished      
primary-school children in six disadvantaged regions. IAEA has
established a Model Technical Co-operation Project to supply
nuclear techniques to improve the evaluation of this initiative's
health impacts, and to utilize the findings in a follow-up phase
to improve the efficacy of the feeding programme using local
foodstuffs. 
<P>
Over a four year period (1994-1997), the project is expected to: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
transfer isotope techniques to Peru for evaluating the        
impact of food and nutrition interventions and improving the
precision of measures of nutritional status;
<P>
<LI>
assist in the transfer of information to the government,        
the food industry and donor agencies in order to improve food
intervention strategies for children at risk;
<P>
<LI>
improve the selection and preparation of food products        
with high nutritional values;
<P>
<LI>
evaluate the impact of new WHO vitamin A interventions; and      
<P>
<LI>
demonstrate the utility of isotope techniques as key tools in the
planning and evaluation of national food and nutrition programmes
throughout the developing world.

Across the world today, renewable water resources available

importing water or creating it through costly desalination.      
<P>
Some 80 countries already face water shortages that threaten     
health and development, according to the World Bank. Fifty       
Chinese cities now face acute shortages, while in less than a    
decade per capita water supplies are expected to drop by 30% in
Egypt, 40% in Nigeria, and 50% in Kenya. Clearly, comprehensive
water resources management has become a prerequisite to
environmentally sustainable development in rich and poor nations
alike.
<P>
To help address this pressing need, nuclear science has developed
a set of analytical tools - isotope techniques - that can        
improve the identification, development, protection and
management of water resources by providing invaluable information
on the sources, movement and quantity of water in different
environments including rivers, lakes and groundwater.
<P>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>
The IAEA-WMO Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation</A>
</B>
<P>
The need for comprehensive global information on water resources
was recognized many years ago, when the IAEA and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) launched the World Survey of
Isotopes in Precipitation Network in 1961. The Survey has since
evolved into the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation
(GNIP), which has grown increasingly important in environmental
studies of global warming and climate change.
<P>
All elements consist of atoms of different mass called
<B>isotopes.</B>
During the evaporation and condensation of water, the
concentration of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that make up       
the water molecule undergoes small changes. Modern instruments
can measure these with great precision, and the analysis can help
to identify replenishing water supplies that can be viably tapped
and exploited.
<P>
Under the supervision of the GNIP, monthly composite samples of
rain and snow are collected at stations around the world and
analysed. The IAEA's laboratory in Vienna performs the analyses
of large numbers of samples while the remainder are assessed in
Member States.  
<P>
The results of this survey, as well as statistical analyses, are
published regularly in the Technical
Reports Series of the IAEA. This data bank provides the basis for
comprehensive analyses of water problems around the globe.

More Water for a Thirsty Lima</A>
</B>
<P>
Peru's Pacific Coast capital, Lima, receives almost no rainfall
and depends for its water supply almost exclusively on rivers    
flowing out of the Andes. But while Lima's population has        
burgeoned in recent decades, its water supply has been        
diminishing and becoming more polluted. Often, piped water is
available from the municipal system only a few hours a day. In
addition, many people have no access to piped water supplies, and
must depend on water vendors using tanker trucks.            
<P>
Lima faces a chronic water shortage, and city authorities have
long looked to the Amazon basin on the other side of the        
mountain peaks for the answer. But the prospect of pumping water
over the mountains or tunnelling through them has remained
daunting.
<P>
In an effort to supplement surface water supplies, in recent 
years groundwater emerging from an abandoned copper mine on the
western Andean slopes had been tapped. But disturbing questions
remained: What were the sources of the water in this tunnel; and
could they be relied upon to supply Lima well into the future?   
<P>
To answer these questions, water samples have been gathered      
at the mine site and at numerous mountainous locations on both
sides of the continental divide and subjected to isotope
analysis. Thus far, the scientific data reveals that the sources
of the mine water are quite diverse in terms of location,
elevation and age. Indeed, a good portion of the water may have
its source on the eastern, Amazonian slopes of the Andes. Experts
believe that through a system of underground faults, the water   
was slipping under the mountain peaks. All of which is very      
good news for the city of Lima, which now relies on the mine     
water for a full 15% of its total municipal supply.
<P>
Similar efforts at enhancing knowledge about water supplies and
improving their management are under way in Venezuela, where the
city of Caracas faces a serious water deficit. A recent,
successful investigation of groundwater sources to supplement the
existing distribution system, which is supplied by reservoirs,
will enable the city to make better investment decisions
concerning expanding supplies and containing pollution of
underground resources.

The world's seas and oceans are at the centre of the global
ecological balance: Fully 97% of the world's water is contained
in saline seas. Moreover, the world's marine ecosystems support
vast quantities of fish that are vital to global food supplies:
an estimated 1 billion people, most of them in developing
countries, depend on fish for their sole source of protein. Three
out of every five people around the world lives in a coastal

For more than 30 years, the IAEA has helped to support and

the Marine Environment Laboratory (MEL), based in Monaco. MEL is
today among the foremost scientific marine laboratories in the
world, and is positioned at the forefront of international
efforts to preserve and protect the marine environment. Principal
UN partners in the work of MEL are UNEP and the International

Tracking Pesticides in Tropical Waters</A>

<P>
Even with the large amounts of pesticides being applied in
agriculture today, insects continue to destroy about one-third of
the world's crops. Moreover, it is estimated that yields would
decline further by 30-75% without the use of such chemicals for
crop protection.
<P>
The known undesirable side effects of persistent agrochemicals
such as DDT and dieldrin have led to increased use of more
biodegradable pesticides such as organophosphate (OP) compounds
in
most industrialized countries. But in the developing world,
massive amounts of persistent pesticides are applied every year,
and very little has been known about the impact of such chemicals
on food chains, fisheries and aquaculture in these tropical
ecosystems.
<P>
IAEA-MEL studies of this problem began in Mexico in the early
1990s; they were next extended to Nicaragua, and have
subsequently developed into a worldwide Co-ordinated Research
Programme which is analysing pesticide concentrations in numerous
tropical ecosystems.
<P>
Utilizing a new carbon isotopic labelling technique, initial     
investigations focussed on a tropical lagoon system that is     
extremely important for Mexico's fisheries. The findings have    
raised considerable new concerns. Pesticides are absorbed rapidly
into the sediment particles on the bottom of tropical lagoons,
and are just as rapidly (from minutes to hours) absorbed into
macroalgae, shrimp, oysters, mussels and fish. In fish and
shrimp, pesticide concentrations are equally high in all tissue,
including the edible parts consumed by humans.                 
<P>
Moreover, while it had been assumed that OP compounds were
rapidly degraded in the tropical marine ecosystem, results
indicate that they do impact on aquatic fauna. It has been shown
that, once absorbed into sediment particles, these compounds are
relatively protected against microbial degradation and hence
persist in tropical lagoon environments far longer than
previously recognized.
<P>
Information obtained through initial studies has already been    
applied in recommendations for improving the integrated        
environmental management of Mexico's coastal lagoons. And while
it appears inevitable that pesticides will remain in large-scale
use in developing countries, better knowledge about how they
affect the marine environment will aid in identifying the most
adverse practices and serve in containing their consequences.

<P>
Over 430 nuclear power plants are at present operational in 30
countries, and they generate about 17% of the world's total
electricity. Far more facilities exist that are involved in
handling radioactive materials at some stage in the nuclear fuel 
cycle or for uses in research, medicine, agriculture or industry.
The IAEA is actively promoting the adoption of international
safety standards in its Member States. In a number of countries
such assistance is provided through co-operation programmes      
executed by the IAEA with funding and management support        
from UNDP.
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>
Power Plant Safety in China
</A>
</B>
<P>
With large coal reserves and sizeable hydropower potential, China
is relatively well endowed with energy resources, especially in
the north. But the geographical distribution of energy resources
make them costly to exploit in terms of electricity transmission
and bulk transportation. The country's rail transport network no
longer has the capacity to meet the growing energy needs of
rapidly industrializing eastern and southern regions. Electricity
shortages averaging 20% are blamed for China's new industrial
enterprises operating well below capacity.
<P>
Such logistic problems, combined with growing environmental
concerns, have led the Chinese to turn to nuclear power for part
of their energy requirements. Three nuclear power plants, one of
indigenous design at Qinshan near Shanghai and two of French
design at Guangdong near Hong Kong, have gone into operation
during the past three years. More units are planned at these two
locations and elsewhere.
<P>
UNDP and IAEA began assisting China's nuclear power programme
back in the mid-1980s by supporting a manpower development and
training programme for the National Nuclear Safety Administration
(NNSA), including the China National Nuclear Corporation which
manages the nuclear industry and employs some 300 000 people,
among them 70 000 scientists and engineers.
<P>
Through the provision of extensive expert services, the joint    
agency effort has fostered an enhanced "safety culture" in the   
NNSA, especially in critical areas: nuclear power plant
licensing; safety review of technical specifications;
probabalistic safety assessment; accident analysis and accident
management; reactor cooling systems; and power plant assurance   
inspection.
<P>
In addition, since the late 1980s the IAEA, under its Operational
Safety Review Team (OSART) programme, has fielded a series of
missions to the plants, sharing with China the collective
experience and knowledge of the best international safety
practices which would be otherwise hard to acquire.              
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_2>
Radiation Safety in Former Soviet Republics
</A>
</B>
<P>
Working in concert with the Group of 24 Countries of the OECD,
the IAEA has been conducting comprehensive safety review
programmes for each of the various generations of pressurized
water reactors (WWERs) and graphite moderated RBMK reactors that
are operating in the countries of the former USSR, and also in
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and the Slovak Republic.   

<P>
As safety concerns extend beyond power generating facilities,
IAEA has developed a programme for providing assistance covering
radiation protection in all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle,
from uranium processing and enrichment to nuclear fuel
fabrication and spent fuel storage. Activities are carried       

out through the Agency's Technical Assistance Programme.         

 <P>
To date, country assistance programmes to improve radiation      
protection infrastructures have been prepared for Belarus,
Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldovia and Uzbekistan
through a joint effort with UNDP.

Between 1971 and 1991, world commercial energy production        
increased by 35%, with the largest increases registered in Africa
(70%), Asia (54%) and South America (55%). In these developing
regions, demand for electricity in coming decades is expected to
rise at even faster rates.
<P>
The UN system does not have an institution which has
responsibilities for all energy sources. Since the early 1990s,  
however, the IAEA has joined forces with organizations both
inside and outside the UN system to collaborate on comparative
assessments of energy sources for electricity production.
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>
"Decades" and Agenda 21
</A>
</B>
<P>
As part of the preparation for the Rio Summit on Environment and
Development in 1992, IAEA experts joined forces with those from
nine other international organizations to examine the health and
environmental effects from different power generating systems.
Subsequently, this work evolved into an IAEA-led inter-agency
project called "Decades," one element of the IAEA's work
addressing Agenda 21 imperatives for sustainable development in
the energy sector. The Decades project has put together one of
the world's most comprehensive databases on competitive energy
sources, and has developed sophisticated software for power
sector planning. It thus provides the basis for countries to more
clearly define their power generation options, taking into
account technical, economic, health and environmental factors.   

<P>
Over many years, the IAEA has provided support to countries for
comparing alternative electricity generation strategies, and
assessing the viability of the nuclear option. In the Asia and
Pacific region, in particular, nuclear power is already an
important contributor to electricity generation in some
countries, and its role is likely to expand in order to support
rapid overall economic growth in the region.
<P>
Where the nuclear option is found viable, the development of a
programme must include careful planning at each level of
implementation, including the establishment of adequate
industrial and organizational infrastructures and personnel      
training, in order to ensure efficient and safe operation and    
maintenance of facilities. In co-operation with the UN family,   
the IAEA is already providing assistance to many countries at    
virtually every stage in nuclear energy development, and
encompassing the full range of technical, legal, regulatory,
environmental and human resource needs.

<P>
In operation since the 1960s, the IAEA's safeguards system has
provided a cornerstone for worldwide efforts to curb the spread
of nuclear weapons. Agreements between Governments and the Agency
allow IAEA inspectors to regularly visit nuclear facilities where
they verify records of nuclear materials, check IAEA-installed
instruments and surveillance equipment, and confirm physical
inventories of nuclear materials.
<P>
As of 1995, there were some 200 safeguard agreements in force
with 118 States and with Taiwan, China. In connection with these
agreements, the IAEA carries out more than 2000 inspections each
year to verify compliance.
<P>
<B>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>Violations and UN Security Council Actions
</A></B>
<P>
Developments in recent years concerning countries such as Iraq,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Africa, have
underlined the important role of the safeguards system. The IAEA
is empowered by its Statute to report violations of safeguards
agreements directly to the UN Security Council.
<P>
In May 1991, the Security Council issued Resolution 687,which was
directed at the complete elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. The Resolution expressly requested the IAEA to
inspect known and suspected nuclear sites; to remove or take
control of all material and equipment usable for nuclear weapons;
and to develop a comprehensive plan for future monitoring and
verification of Iraq's nuclear programme.
<P>
IAEA's mission to safely remove all declared stocks of        
nuclear-weapons-grade material in Iraq was completed in early
1994. It involved inspections at scores of sites and a massive
programme of dismantling, destruction and removal of
weapons-related equipment and materials. For the international
community, however, the key lesson emerging from the Iraq
experience was that the nuclear material accountancy and
verification methods used hitherto may not suffice to prevent
clandestine nuclear weapons development.
<P>
Hence IAEA safeguards are being both expanded and refined to help
identify the signs of possible clandestine programmes. New,
highly sensitive environmental monitoring techniques are being
introduced into the safeguards regime. 
<P>
The IAEA works closely with its Board of Governors, its Member
States, the UN and the
Security Council to buttress the safeguards system and stands
ready to assume any new verification tasks entrusted to it in the
arms control area.

On April 26, 1986 a major reactor accident occurred at the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. This caused acute radiation
injuries and deaths among plant workers and firemen. It also led
to radiation exposure to thousands of persons involved in rescue
and clean-up operations. There was severe radioactive
contamination in the area, resulting in the evacuation of people
from a 30-km zone around the power plant. It became clear over
the months following the accident that radioactive contamination
of varying severity had also occurred in extensive
areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia up to hundreds of kilometers
from the site.
<P>         
Information about the severity and significance of this
contamination was often sparse and uneven; public opinion was
uncertain and even many doctors were not sure how to interpret
information that did become available. As a result, there was a
loss of confidence in the information and in the countermeasures
recommended.
<P>         
The Government of the USSR sought international assistance in
tackling the problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) sent a
team of experts in June 1989 as did the League of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in early 1990.
<P>
The WHO concluded among other things that "scientists who are not
well versed in radiation effects have attributed various
biological and health effects to radiation exposure. These
changes cannot be attributed to radiation exposure, especially
when the normal incidence is unknown, and are much more likely to
be due to psychological factors and stress. Attributing
these effects to radiation not only increases the psychological
pressure in the population and provokes additional stress-related
health problems, it also undermines confidence in the
competence of the radiation specialists". The League of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies
made similar observations.
<P>
In October 1989, the Government of the USSR formally requested
the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) to co-ordinate "an international experts'
assessment of the concept
which the USSR has evolved to enable the population to live
safely in areas affected by
radioactive contamination following the Chernobyl  accident, and
an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the steps taken in these areas to safeguard the
health of the population".
<P>         
As a result, an international project was launched in the spring
of 1990. An independent
"International Advisory Committee" of 19 members was set up under
the chairmanship of Dr.
Itsuzo Shigematsu from Japan.  Dr. Shigematsu is the Director of
the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima, which,
ever since 1950, has monitored and analysed the health situation
of atomic bomb survivors in Japan, the largest population ever
exposed to high doses of radiation. The other scientists on the
Committee came from ten countries and five international
organisations. The expertise encompassed, among other
disciplines, medicine, radiopathology, radiation protection,
nutrition, radioepidemiology and psychology.
<P>         
The most active phase of the project ran from May 1990 until the
end of that year. About 200
independent experts from 23 countries and 7 international
organisations were involved, and 50
scientific missions visited the USSR. Laboratories in several
countries, including Austria,
France, and the USA, helped to analyse and evaluate collected
material.
<P>         
The goals of the project were to examine assessments of the
radiological and health situation
in areas of the USSR affected by the Chernobyl accident, and to
evaluate measures to protect
the population. The purpose of this brochure is to present a
summary of the main results. The
project was directed at the welfare of those people still living
in contaminated areas. The
radiation health effects for people already evacuated (from the
30-km zone) were not
considered except for some of these people which have re-settled
in the areas under review.
Also excluded were the large numbers involved in emergency
clean-up operations (called
''liquidators'') who were brought into the region temporarily.
The health of these people, some
of whom may have been exposed to high levels of radiation,
reportedly is being monitored and also may be the object of
future international work.
<P>         
The international project, carried out in co-operation with local
authorities, deliberately selected a number of settlements in the
contaminated areas of concern to perform the necessary surveys.
Some of the settlements were located in areas with relatively
high soil surface contamination, while other settlements were
chosen in areas of relatively low soil surface contamination, but
with potential for high radiation doses to the people living
there. Other settlements were selected outside the contaminated
areas of concern for purposes
of comparison.

The project received the full support of the USSR Government and
the Governments of the Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Assistance
took various forms, including the participation of local
scientists in cross-checking, extensive discussions with
scientists involved in the project, and in the collection and
preparation of field samples as well as medical examinations
of the population, especially children, in the affected areas.
There were open and frank
conversations with authorities, scientists, and particularly
local citizens that added to the
international experts' understanding of the situation.
<P>         
The numbers of examinations and other such activities reported
later in this brochure give
some idea of the extensive nature of the international effort
deployed within the limits that
were set for the project. The agreed method of operation was to
concentrate on direct study of
the environment and of the population in those more highly
contaminated areas that were still
inhabited (with suitable comparative studies in areas of low
contamination). In parallel with
these detailed independent sampling studies, a general evaluation
was made of Soviet methodology and findings.
<P>         
A short account of the risks of radiation and radioactivity can
be found in the penultimate
section of this brochure to help set in focus some of the
presented information.

If the distribution of radioactive substances in the environment is given, the radiation
exposure ("dose") of the population may be assessed. However, this assessment is by no
means simple. Nor is there a straightforward, uniform relationship between ground
contamination and radiation dose. The dose to the population includes the external gamma
radiation dose as well as the internal dose received by eating food containing radioactive
materials.
<P>         
Different physical data are used in calculating external dose. Additional important data are
biological "transfer factors" influencing the movement of elements from the ground through
food into the human body. Finally, people's living conditions are important for assessing
doses, such as housing, time spent outdoors, and diet. There are complex mathematical
calculations which take all this into account. They always entail certain assumptions and may
be designed to give either conservative or realistic results .
<P>         
Certain checks can be made by direct measurements and this was done during the project.
People can be equipped with dosimeter badges which, if carried at all times, record the
radiation dose they receive externally. Also, by means of devices called "whole body
counters", people can be monitored for the amount of caesium they have absorbed within
their bodies. This provides an effective way of measuring their internal dose. Because of the
nature of the work involved, such checks can be made only on representative samples of the
affected population.
<P>
The project concentrated on examining data for significant radioactive elements that can affect
human health such as caesium, strontium and iodine. A number of representative settlements
in contaminated regions were selected for independent radiation dose assessment. Some 8000
personal dosimeters were distributed to residents of seven such settlements and were carried
for two months. The dosimeters were then sent to France for evaluation.
<P>         
Independent whole body counting of radiocaesium levels was done by project teams on more
than 9000 people in nine settlements. Comparisons between project and USSR whole body
counting facilities and data were made. Finally, independent calculations of past and future
doses were made for the surveyed settlements using internationally accepted calculation
methods and starting from average values for deposition of radioactivity in the soil. Since the
radioactive iodine from the fallout emissions had totally decayed long before the project
began, it was not possible to do independent measurements of this element for verification
purposes. Because the thyroid gland concentrates iodine coming into the body, radioactive
iodine can give a significant dose to that organ. Doses to the thyroid were reported on the
basis of some early direct thyroid measurements as well as assumptions about
iodine intake. For the seven contaminated settlements specifically studied by the project team,
average radioactive iodine thyroid doses for children reported by the USSR varied widely.
<P>         
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The USSR procedure for estimating radiation doses was assessed as being scientifically
sound. Methodologies used in the USSR were intended to, and did, overestimate the doses
actually received.
<P>
<LI>The external dose to people from radionuclides deposited on the ground is generally the
most significant contribution to total dose, especially in the areas where food restrictions are
in force.
<P>
<LI>Of the dosimeters worn for two months by inhabitants of the highly contaminated areas,
only 10 percent registered exposures above the minimum detection limit of 0.2 mSv. This
corresponds to 1.2 mSv per year which is a typical dose an individual would receive from the
natural environment.
<P>
<LI>The whole body counting of radiocaesium generally indicated lower contents of that
element
in peoples' bodies than would be calculated using theoretical models based on transfer from
the environment, intakes from food, and metabolism. This is true for USSR models as well as
for international ones. Comparing whole body counting with basic model calculations
produced results in the USSR similar to those seen in other countries.
<P>
<LI>Independent calculations of past and future doses, based on average deposition results for
the surveyed settlements, gave doses lower by a factor of 2-3 than the USSR estimates for the
same villages.

The nature of the biological effects which can be caused by
ionizing radiation and a
necessarily brief account of human health effects are outlined
later in this brochure. That
account is confined to direct physical effects. However, in the
case of Chernobyl, as
in many other radiological incidents, psychological effects have
predominated.
<P>         
The nature of these effects is complicated and it is wrong to
dismiss them as irrational or to
label them as "radiophobia". Many factors contribute to the
development of this widespread
public response. Among other things, there may be the historical
association with nuclear
bombs, or a lack of openness in the past on the part of
governments, or the absence of
intelligible explanations by scientists. It is noteworthy that
some negative psychological
responses were found in the populations of both "contaminated"
and "uncontaminated"
settlements studied by the project. Such effects are real and
understandable, particularly in a
mainly rural population whose work and recreation are closely
interwoven with the land
where restrictions may have had to be imposed by the authorities.
Even physicians and others
who might be looked to for guidance have often been confused. The
result is that rumors
multiply, fears increase, and any health problem is quickly
attributed to a nuclear cause.
Uncorroborated narratives may become commonly held wisdom and
unverifiable statistical
data may be accepted with insufficient scrutiny.
<P>         
To address these problems, the international project set about
reviewing the health situation
reported by key medical centres and institutes in the Soviet
Union. Subsequently, seven
representative settlements of high contamination were selected
for detailed independent health
examination by the project medical teams. Six control settlements
with the same
socio-economic structure, but with insignificant contamination,
were similarly examined.

<P>
The individuals to be examined were selected according to a  
statistical sampling scheme
giving a representative distribution of age groups. As many as
250 people were examined in
each settlement. The examination focused on disorders that had
been reported or that might
be expected. In addition to direct clinical examination, samples
were taken and sent to the
USA and Japan for laboratory analysis.
<P>         
In any detailed clinical study of a particular population, some
health disorders are bound to be
detected due to the better documentation and closer scrutiny such
a detailed study entails.
This makes careful comparison with a similar population outside
the contaminated area even
more critical and rules out reference to pre-existing national or
regional statistics. 
<P>
<B>Results of the health study</B>
<P>
<UL>         
<LI>There were significant non-radiation related health disorders
in the population of both the
contaminated and the non-contaminated settlements studied, but no
health disorders that
could be attributed directly to radiation.
<P>         
<LI>The accident had, and continues to have, considerable
psychological consequences such
as
anxiety and uncertainty, which extended beyond the contaminated
area. These consequences
were compounded by the socio-economic and political changes in
the USSR.
<P>
<LI>The USSR data that were examined did not indicate a
substantial   increase in incidence
of
leukemia or cancer or hereditary effects. However, the data were
not detailed enough to
exclude a slight increase in the incidence of some tumor types.
The adequately performed
USSR studies, for their part, have not substantiated any of the
reported health effects alleged
to be due to radiation.
<P>         
<LI>Many of the clinical investigations by the USSR were done
poorly, producing confusing
or
contradictory results. The reasons included inadequate equipment,
lack of scientific
information, and a shortage of well trained specialists. However,
a number of USSR clinical
studies were carefully and competently performed, and the
international project was able to
substantiate these studies in most cases.
<P>
<LI>The children examined (mostly 2, 5 and 10 years old) were
found to be generally
healthy.
The field studies indicated that a considerable number of adults
in both the contaminated and
the comparative settlements had substantial medical problems of a
general nature.
<P>
<LI>Diet appeared to be limited in range, but adequate. No
significant differences in reported
eating habits were found between the contaminated settlements
studied and the
uncontaminated. No detrimental effects on growth due to voluntary
or official dietary
restrictions imposed as a result of the accident were found.
There was no evidence of
differences in thyroid function between contaminated and
comparison regions.
<P>
<LI>The intake of iodine in the regions was found to be at the
low end of the acceptable
range.
Most of the dietary components were found to be adequate. Vitamin
intake, however, was not
examined.
<P>
<LI>Dietary intake of toxic elements (lead, cadmium, mercury) was
low in comparison with
those reported from many other countries and was well below the
maximum tolerable intake
levels specified by international organisations.         
<P>
<LI>Blood lead levels were found to be well within the normal
range. Thus, no support was
found for believing that the large quantity of lead dropped on
the reactor to help control the
accident had been widely dispersed in the atmosphere in vapor
form and created a health
hazard for the population at large.
<P>
<LI>Review of USSR data indicated that reported cancer incidence
had been rising for the
last
decade. The rise started before the Chernobyl accident occurred
and has continued at the same
rate since the accident. The project members could not judge
whether the rise is due to
improved detection and diagnosis or to other causes.
<P>
<LI>The data did not show a marked increase in leukemia or
thyroid tumors since the
accident.
However, owing to limitations in the statistical methods, the
possibility of a slight increase in
the incidence of these disorders cannot be excluded. Nor can the
later development of
increased numbers of cases after longer latent periods be
excluded.
<P>
<LI>There was no evidence from special eye examinations of
radiation induced cataracts in
the
general population.
<P>
<LI>High blood pressure was common among adults, but no
differences were observed
between
the contaminated and the comparable settlements. Both resembled
figures available for
Moscow and Leningrad.
<P>
<LI>Review of USSR data for settlements in the contaminated areas
of concern, as well as
for
the three affected republics as a whole indicated relatively high
infant and perinatal mortality
levels. These levels existed before the accident and appeared to
be decreasing.
<P>
<LI>No statistically significant evidence was found of an
increase in the incidence of foetal
anomalies as a result of radiation exposure.
</UL>
<P>         
While the data were not detailed enough to exclude the
possibility of an increase in some
tumor types, it is emphasised that, on the basis of the doses
estimated by the project and
using internationally accepted risk estimates, future increases
over the natural incidence of all
cancers or hereditary effects would be difficult to discern, even
with well designed long-term
epidemiological studies. There remains a possibility of a
statistically detectable increase in the
incidence of thyroid tumors at a later date. Some general
recommendations in the field of
preventive medicine and for further investigations were also made
by the project team.

Over the years, internationally recognised standards have been
developed to limit exposures of
the public to ionizing radiation from nuclear facilities of all
kinds. These criteria can be met
by incorporating particular features into the design of such
facilities, and arranging for them
to be sited and operated under rules and conditions to ensure
compliance with the necessary
standards. In general, by efficient pre-planning, even the most
rigorous limits can be respected
at a reasonably low cost.
<P>         
The situation is different when, for any reason or combination of
reasons, the pre-planned
design and operational control measures fail and an accident
occurs. The existing criteria no
longer apply since the system has broken down and a new approach
has to be adopted. The
objective is to avert, as far as practicable, exposure to people
in the area from future radiation
doses. This limitation must be achieved through various methods,
all of which
may have some negative effects or costs of a health,
socio-economic, psychological or
political nature.
<P>         
Many possible actions may be considered. Some are quite simple.
If there is a minor
radioactive release, people may be advised to stay inside their
homes and keep windows and
doors shut. At the other extreme, whole areas of land or entire
towns may have to be
evacuated and large quantities of food excluded from human
consumption. 
<P>
It is over-simplistic to assume that all measures which would
reduce future dose are beneficial and therefore should always be
fully implemented. For example, one of the measures to be
reconsidered is that of resettling people elsewhere. Moving
people to an area of lower radioactive contamination will
probably reduce dose. Since future dose is considered to have a
proportional effect on future levels of rise, relocation should
reduce the risk of long-term radiation effects. However, it is
known that the stress of extensive changes in lifestyle can have
very serious psycho-social and even physical effects on people. A
balance must be struck between potential reduction in dose and
possible harm that might be avoided on the one hand and the
possible detrimental and disruptive effects of the resettlement.
The calculation of future dose avoidance, either by relocation or
by food restrictions, is also not straightforward; single
measurements of ground contamination do not translate into
predictions of future dose because of factors such as the
interaction of depositedmaterials with soils of different
natures. 
<P>
Many actions had to be taken quickly in the early days after the
accident. Stable iodine tablets were issued, evacuations
organized, and food restrictions imposed based on the best
judgement that could be made on the available information. There
is the opportunity now for longer reflection. As part of that
process, a number of "decision conferences" were held
towards the end of this international project with decision
makers in the Republics and at All Union levels in the USSR to
enable the issues addressed to be spelled out clearly and to
clarify and summarize for the project the socio-economic and
political factors that influenced
the decision-making process in the affected Republics.
<P>
<B>Comments by the projects teams</B>
<P>
The unprecedented nature and scale of the Chernobyl accident
obliged the responsible
authorities to respond to a situation that had not been planned
for.  Thus, many early actions
had to be improvised. The project teams were not able to
investigate in detail many actions
taken by the authorities owing to the complexity of the event. In
those cases in which project
teams were able to assess these actions, it was found that the
general response of the
authorities had been broadly reasonable and consistent with
internationally established
guidelines which prevailed at the time of the accident. Some
measures could doubtless have
been better taken or could have been more timely, but these need
to be seen in the context of
the overall response. It is all too easy, with the benefit of
hindsight, to criticise actions which
had to be carried out in response to a pressing situation.
<P>         
The International Advisory Committee stated that the protective
measures taken or planned for
the longer term, albeit well intentioned, generally exceed what
would have been strictly
necessary from a radiological protection viewpoint. The
relocation and food restrictions could
have been less extensive. The extent to which such measures were
implemented was not
justified on radiological protection grounds. However, any
relaxation of the current
policy would almost certainly be counterproductive in view of the
present high levels of stress
and anxiety among inhabitants of the         contaminated areas
and people's present
expectations. It is recognised, however, that there are many
social and political factors to
be taken into consideration and the final decision must rest with
the responsible authorities. In
any case, future modifications introduced should not lead to more
restrictive criteria.
<P>         
More specific comments included the observation that the
relaxation of the criteria for food
consumption should be considered as a preferable alternative to
relocation when overall
health, social and economic effects are taken into account.
Continuing restrictions on the
consumption of domestically produced food in the contaminated
areas of concern imply, for
some people, a serious deterioration in the quality of life. This
may be remedied only
by relocation to areas where an attempt can be made to resume the
previous way of life if
feasible. The relatively low cut-off levels adopted for food
stuff restrictions may have
exacerbated these problems. The study also found that the
international confusion and
misunderstanding about the appropriate level for such
restrictions made matters much more
difficult for the authorities. Clearer guidance is obviously
necessary for the future.
<P>         
Among more detailed findings in the report was a recommendation
to improve the quality and
quantity of information to the public. In particular, factors
that may influence the acceptability
to the local population of continuing to live in settlements in
the contaminated areas of
concern should be further identified and analyzed.
<P>         
More realistic and comprehensive information should be provided
to the public on
comparitive levels of dose and risk. These risks should be
compared with risks experienced in
everyday life and with risks from other environmental
contaminants such as radon and
industrial pollutant emissions commonly found near large cities.

From a biological point of view, as noted earlier, the most significant radioactive substances
in the emissions from the accident were iodine, caesium, strontium, and plutonium.
<P>         
Different problems arise with different radioactive substances. Radioactive iodine is
short-lived and practically had disappeared some weeks after the accident. Its significance is
due to the fact that, if inhaled or ingested, it accumulates in the thyroid
gland, where it may deliver large radiation doses as it decays. The doses may result in
impaired thyroid function and, many years after the exposure, in thyroid cancer. The difficulty
about radio-iodine is that its original distribution can no longer be measured but
must be inferred.
<P>         
Caesium is the element that clearly dominates the long term radiological situation after the
Chernobyl accident. Due to its penetrating radiation, caesium deposited on the ground may
give an external dose. It may also enter the food chain and give an internal dose. It is
eliminated metabolically in a matter of months. Caesium is relatively easy to measure.
<P>
Plutonium and strontium, on the other hand, present difficulties in measurement; but there is
relatively little strontium in the fallout and it does not give a dose unless ingested or inhaled.
Very little plutonium travelled far from the reactor site, and because of its chemical stability,
it does not find its way easily into food chains.
<P>         
Measurements and assessments carried out under the project provided general corroboration of
the level of surface contamination for caesium reported in the official maps that were made
available to the project in the USSR. Analytical results from a limited set of soil samples
obtained by the project teams, near the evacuated zone, corresponded to the surface
contamination estimates for plutonium. However, project results were lower in the case of
strontium
<P>         
The concentration of radionuclides measured in drinking water and, in most cases, in food
from the areas investigated, were significantly below guideline levels for radionuclide
contamination in food moving in international trade and in many cases were actually below
the limit of detection. The analytical capabilities of Soviet laboratories appeared to be
adequate. The range of performance of the Soviet laboratories that participated in the
intercomparison exercise was broad, but similar to that found in previous international
comparison exercises. The few problems identified, including the tendency to overestimate
strontium, did not significantly affect the use of data for purposes of making conservative
dose assessments.
<P>         
The extensive surface water sampling programmes in the USSR are adequate. Certain
problems during sampling and analytical procedures could result in the possible
overestimation of the concentration of radionuclides in water.
<P>         
Insufficient information was available to evaluate air sampling equipment and procedures.
Although the relative contribution to radiation doses of some resuspension of radioactive
materials in the air (as dust) is believed to be minor, it should be noted that the
occurrence of such airborne resuspension, particularly during agricultural activities or dry
periods, cannot be excluded.
<P>         
Rapid screening and sophisticated techniques used locally for monitoring commercially
available food from production to consumption appeared to be satisfactory. The relevant
instrument calibration technique could not be evaluated sufficiently by the
project owing to the lack of detailed technical information.
<P>         
The radioactive contamination of food samples was found to be in most cases below the
levels established by the responsible authorities for specific countermeasures in the
settlements surveyed. In some settlements, milk from individual farms and food
collected in contravention of official recommendations could be contaminated above these
levels.
<P>         
Some technical recommendations about analytical methods used by Soviet scientists were
made and, in particular, it was felt by the Committee that there should be fuller participation
in the future with international intercomparison programmes and intercalibration exercises.

We meet radiation everywhere in nature. Naturally occurring radioactive elements in the
ground emit radiation which gives an external dose. Some of these elements enter food chains
and can enter the human body, resulting in an internal dose. In addition, there is constant
exposure to radiation from space (cosmic radiation). This is collectively described as
"background radiation".
<P>         
A number of units are used to express quantities of radiation absorbed by the body or
amounts of radioactivity deposited on the ground or existing in a cloud. These units have
been expressed differently over the years and each has its own precise physical
description. For the purposes of this booklet, the most recently agreed international units have
been employed although their detailed scientific descriptions are not addressed.
<P>
The most useful in this context is the unit of effective dose -- the sievert. <I>(The
older unit was the rem. 1 sievert (Sv) = 100 rem.)</I> In the present
context, the millisievert (mSv) is often employed. That equals 1/l000th (1 x 10<SUP>-
3</SUP>) of a sievert. The following notes put the size of this unit in perspective.
<P>         
The total natural background dose varies a great deal. The average is about 1 to 2 mSv per
year, but values several times higher are not uncommon. In some areas, the natural
background dose is more than 60 times the global average. It has not been possible to find a
relation between natural radiation dose and adverse health effects. Natural radiation
background and its variations therefore may serve as an indicator of what doses may be
considered to be acceptable.
<P>         
The naturally occurring radioactive radon gas from the ground is sometimes trapped and
concentrated in buildings. Where houses are well insulated, doses from radon in homes may
exceed the natural background dose many times. Doses of radon of more than 10 mSv per
year are not uncommon, and they are levels at which controls must be exercised.

Man-made sources of radiation have been in existence since the
turn of the century. Radiation
doses have since been administered to patients as a contribution
to medical diagnosis and
therapy. These doses are variable, but in most developed
countries they represent a significant
amount of the additional radiation already received over and
above that from the natural
background.  As an example, one chest X ray may give about 1/50th
of 1 mSv (0.02 mSv).
Other procedures such as fluoroscopy will give considerably
higher doses and patients treated
by radiotherapy may be given doses many times higher than that.
<P>         
Before effective radiation protection practices were generally
adopted, certain occupational
groups such as hospital radiologists received high doses, and
eventually showed deviations
from normal health patterns that could be attributed to
radiation.
<P>         
The most comprehensive experience of the health effects of high
doses of radiation stems
from the atomic bombing, in 1945, of the Japanese cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These
irradiated groups and many more have been monitored for health
effects over many decades.
Additionally, there have been extensive programmes of other types
of biological research. As
a result, there is considerable knowledge as to what kinds of
health effects may occur and
what doses may produce them. There is also information about how
long after exposure these
effects may appear.
<P>         
All these facts are kept under constant review by permanent
international bodies of scientists
which continually assess radiation risks in the light of existing
and new knowledge and
experience. Among these bodies are the United Nations Scientific
Committee on
the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and the International
Commission on
Radiological Protection (ICRP).
<P>         
If the whole body is exposed to a very high level of radiation,
death may occur within a
matter of days or weeks. Other effects such as local skin burns
and sterility can occur if only
part of the body is heavily irradiated. If, however, the exposure
is more spread out in time,
the effects are less severe.
<P>         
In the case of the population studied by the project, such acute
effects were not to be
expected nor were they found.
<P>         
The table below lists the principal harmful radiation effects,
the condition for their occurrence
and the source of information about them.
<P>         
The most important late effect of radiation is cancer, which is
always serious and often fatal.
Tumors appear after what is called the "latent period", which is
normally several years. The
higher the exposure, the greater the risk of an individual
subsequently developing cancer, but
only a relatively small number of people exposed will contract
cancer because of this. It is
important to recall that cancer also has many causes. The
situation is analogous to smoking,
where those who smoke most run the highest risk of lung cancer,
but not all of them will
contract it. Cancer is a very common disease; something like 1 in
every 4 or 5 deaths is
attributable to it. Therefore, unless the number of new cancers
caused by the excess of
radiation is large, it may be difficult to be certain that they
are actually attributable to
radiation. It is for that reason that very careful statistical
studies have been recommended in
various parts of the report.

The International Chernobyl Project was the largest multi-national interdisciplinary venture
ever undertaken in the field of radiological protection. Even with limited objectives, it was a
huge logistical task; the necessity of a tight schedule added to the burden. Scientists from
many lands gave freely of their time and skill. Government institutions, organisations, and
commercial companies provided equipment and supplies, without which some major
parts of the work could not have been carried out. There also were extensive assistance and
contributions from many authorities at the All-Union and Republic levels in the USSR and
from the scientists, experts, technical, and administrative staff of the affected Republics who
co-operated with the visiting project teams.
<P>         
The International Advisory Committee, responsible for the project, is of the opinion that the
project represents a much needed international humanitarian and scientific response to the
needs of the authorities and the people of the USSR who were affected by the Chernobyl
accident.
<P>         
For the future, lessons have been learned by every country in the world which will help in
formulating and strengthening radiological protection policies and in the public presentation
and understanding of these policies.
<P>         
Future scientific studies being planned and co-ordinated on an international scale will
contribute to fuller understanding of the effects of contamination and radiation exposure and
thence to the improved protection of all peoples worldwide.

B.W. Wachholz, National Cancer Institute, USA
<P>         
<I>It is commendable that the Government of the USSR not only
requested but invited the
international community to look over their shoulder to evaluate,
to review, to criticise, to
conclude, to recommend. That in itself is almost unprecedented in
an accident of this
nature.</I>
<P>         
B.G. Bennett, U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
Radiation
<P>         
<I>It is common practice (to overestimate doses). It is something
that scientists would do to
make sure that they do not underestimate the doses. This is
important to provide adequate
radiological protection of the people. But the danger in doing
that is that you take protective
measures which are excessively stringent and you expect health
effects which are exaggerated.
This is what must be kept in perspective. You must estimate doses
as realistically as possible.
You must use the best, most realistic estimate of doses to make
your judgement about
relocation, evacuation, and estimated health effects that might
occur eventually from these
doses.</I>       
<P>
T.R. Lee, University of St. Andrews, Scotland
<P>         
<I>The consequences of relocation depend upon the length of time
for which people have
expected it, their preparedness, whether it is to favourable
circumstances or unfavourable
circumstances, whether it is voluntary or involuntary and so on.
However, the sheer disruption
effect for elderly people can take its tolls.</I>
<P>         
J. Jovanovich, University of Manitoba, Canada
<P>         
<I>I think we should just not forget that we do live in a real
world and that there are other
technologies that are worse for the health of populations than
nuclear power, including the
Chernobyl accident.</I>
<P>
P. Hedemann Jensen, Ris&oslash; National Laboratory, Denmark
<P>         
<I>There had not been, certainly for the people at large, enough
understanding of what might
go
on. And there was clearly a need for much public discussion, not
in the heat of an accident,
but before an accident, with what one might call local liaison
committees, so that the risks are
all explained, so that emergency procedures are understood, and
all be exercised, so that it
does not come out of a clear blue sky, at some terrible time in
the morning, that people know
that there has been planning for this, that something can be done
about it and that something
is being done about it.</I>
<P>         
F. Steinh&auml;usler, Austria
<P>         
<I>I do not think it helps the people in the settlements to state
repeatedly, against the facts of
measurements, that food is contaminated, that it is poisoned, or
that water cannot be drunk,
when the measurements clearly indicate, that in most of the water
measurements for instance,
we could not even detect any radioactivity. Not because we used
unsuitable equipment, but
because there is not  any.</I>
<P>
P. Waight, World Health Organization
<P>         
<I>Before the initiation of the Chernobyl Project, the World
Health Organisation sent a team
of
experts to the Soviet Union in June 1989 which concluded that
scientists who are not well
versed in radiation effects have attributed various biological
and health effects to radiation
exposure. These changes cannot be attributed to radiation
exposure, especially when the
normal incidence is unknown, and are much more likely to be due
to psychological factors
and stress. Attributing these effects to radiation, not only
increases the psychological
pressure in the population and provokes additional stress-related
health problems, it also
undermines confidence in the competence of the radiation
specialists.</I>
<P>         
F.A. Mettler, The University of New Mexico, USA
<P>         
<I>There certainly may be health effects worth studying in the
future. We need organized
studies
with appropriate control groups and the best dosimetry
available.... We must use uniform
methodology in these studies, not only amongst Soviet
investigators, but among international
investigators, if we hope to get useful data out of it.</I>

Introduction:

A Global Water Shortage
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Water scarcity and degradation are growing concerns for countries
around the world.  Global demand for fresh water is doubling
every
21 years according to the FAO.  And as industrial, agricultural
and
domestic pollution threaten finite supplies, water is becoming an
increasingly precious resource. 
<P>
Across the world today, renewable water resources available per
person are roughly half what they were in 1960.  This figure is
expected to drop by half again by the year 2025 according to
estimates of the World Bank (Click here for <A
HREF=fig1.html>figure 1</A>).  Clearly, if water resources are not
better
managed,
they could present a burden on economic growth as well as a
potential danger to human health and the environment.
<P>
To help address this pressing need, nuclear science has developed
a set of specific analytical tools - <I>isotope techniques</I> -
that can improve, when  used  with non-nuclear techniques, the
development and management of water resources wherever they are
located.     
<P>
Isotope techniques provide invaluable information on the sources,
movement and quantity of water in different environments,
including
rivers and lakes. They are particularly effective in
investigating 
water reserves below the earth's surface, or groundwater.
<I>Isotope hydrology</I> provides insights into water's behaviour
and helps to build the foundations for rational utilization of
this
precious resource.

<P>
Elements consist of atoms of different mass called
<I>isotopes.</I>
During the evaporation and condensation of water, the
concentration
of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that make up the water molecule
undergoes small changes. Modern instruments can measure these
with
great precision.
<P>
The history and pathway of water in different parts of the
hydrological cycle (click here for <A HREF=fig2.html>figure 2</A>)
can be followed
by the
abundance
of the stable heavy isotopes of hydrogen (<SUP>2</SUP>H) called
deuterium,
and
oxygen (<SUP>18</SUP>O).  In this way, water in different
environments
develops
isotopic "fingerprints" with which  it can be identified and its
origins traced.
<P>
Some isotopes are radioactive, which means that they decay away
with time.  For example, those of tritium (<SUP>3</SUP>H) and
radiocarbon
(<SUP>14</SUP>C), are naturally produced in tiny amounts in the
atmosphere.
Large amounts of  tritium and radiocarbon were also injected into
the atmosphere by nuclear bomb tests in the 1960s.
<P>
These isotopes are carried into groundwater by infiltrating rain
and they  can also be measured with specialised, sensitive
equipment.  The known "half-life" (click here for <A
HREF=fig3.html>figure 3</A>)
of these
radioactive isotopes allows a measurement of their concentrations
to be interpreted as an "age", or residence time, of groundwater.

Residence time indicates the replenishment rate as well as the
rate
of movement of groundwater.
<P>
In summary, isotope techniques:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
can determine the origins and ages of different water bodies;
<BR>
<LI>
can provide an estimate of the degree of mixing;
<BR>
<LI>
can determine the location and proportion of water recharge; and 
<BR>
<LI>
can indicate the velocity of ground water flow.
</UL>
<P>
Isotope techniques cannot "find" groundwater.  The initial steps
must be taken by geologists and geophysicists. With some springs,
however, isotopes can provide preliminary indications of the flow
paths and origins of the water. This information is important to
access the groundwater during drilling. Radioactive and
non-radioactive or "stable" isotope information is thereafter,
integrated with other available data to produce a comprehensive
hydrological concept of the groundwater system. Hydrologists can
then develop a  water management  model, and strategies for
sustainable development can be formulated. 
<P>
The movement of surface and groundwater can also be investigated
by
artificial tracing, where a substance is purposely injected into
the water and then detected at some other point in the system.
Numerous substances may be employed, such as ordinary table salt
or
dyes. However,  in most applications the sensitivity of
measurement
required can only be achieved by injected  radioisotopes, such as
artificially produced <SUP>3</SUP>H or radioactive iodine,
(<SUP>131</SUP>I).
<P>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>
<B>
Isotopes measure water recharge
</B>
</A>
<P>
Recharge of groundwater is one critical aspect in resource
management, and isotopes can help determine both the area and the
rate of recharge.  The area can be identified by measuring
<SUP>2</SUP>H and
<SUP>18</SUP>O concentrations and correlating them to the
altitude at which
precipitation could have infiltrated the ground.  The rate can be
measured by tracing levels of radioactive tritium in soil at
various depths.  In many instances, the tritium "peak" can be
found
at considerable depths, which indicates the distance travelled by
the moisture since being deposited as tritium fallout in 1963. 
<P>
The tritium peak method has been applied all over the world, and
in many different climates (click here for <A HREF=fig4&5.html>figures 4
and 5</A>).  In moister
climates, where infiltration is high, artificial tritium can be
injected as a tracer to determine the rate of recharge.  Profiles
of either environmental or artificial tritium can also give a
measure of the movement of pollutant, such as nitrates and
pesticides from agriculture.

Isotopes Help Manage Drinking Water Supplies
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Groundwater is heavily utilized by densely populated communities
in the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan.  But its availability and
sustainability in supplying the needs of growing populations is a
problem.  An IAEA Isotope Hydrology-assisted investigation,
through the Technical Cooperation Programme, focussed on
claifying the role of Nile River in the replenishment of the
local groundwater aquifers being exploited for domestic and
agricultural purposes.
<P>
Using <SUP>18</SUP>O, <SUP>2</SUP>H, <SUP>3</SUP>H and
<SUP>14</SUP>C, it was possible to distinguish between fresh
water originating from Nile River infiltration and paleowater
representing a non-renewable resource.  It has been demonstrated
that the influence of the Nile water is seen up to 60 km from the
river bank.  The information about the relative contribution of
fresh and old water in the exploitation of wells helped to
design adequate management strategies for local water supply
systems.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
As in all other investigations stable isotopes, environmental
tritium,  chemistry and other tools will be applied to produce a
comprehensive picture of the hydrological system. 
<P>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_2>
<B>
Isotopes help track pollution
</B>
</A>
<P>
Pollution of surface water may be remedied by concerted
prevention
and controls, but it is more serious when pollution enters the
groundwater. Polluted groundwater may remain in aquifers for
centuries, even millennia, and is very difficult if not
impossible
to clean up.
<P>
Isotope techniques can assess the vulnerability of groundwater to
pollution from the surface by determining how rapidly it moves
and
where it is being recharged.  Surface sources of  pollution can
then be determined,  e.g. natural,  industrial, agricultural, or
domestic. Isotope techniques can also identify incipient
pollution,
providing an early warning when the chemical or biological
indicators do not  give cause for concern.  (Click here for <A
HREF=fig6.html>figure 6</A>).
<P>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_3>
<B>
Isotopes help tap renewable energy sources
</B>
</A>
<P>
When rain water moves deep into the earth's crust, it is heated
to
high temperatures and stored in deep reservoirs as a geothermal
energy resource.  Sometimes it emerges at the surface as hot
springs or geysers.  In many countries, this geothermal energy
resource is harnessed by drilling into the reservoir and using
the
hot water to generate electric power.
<P>
Isotope techniques can determine the origin and flow paths of
geothermal fluids and thus aid in the management of the energy
resource.  The isotopes  <SUP>18</SUP>O and <SUP>2</SUP>H, as
well as artificial
tracers
can determine the effects of exploitation and contribute to
strategies for siting wells both for exploration and geothermal
energy production; and for reinjection of cooled geothermal
fluids
which can extend the production period of the reservoir.  (See
<A HREF=fig7&8.html>figures 7 and 8</A>). 
<P>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_4>
<B>
Isotopes monitor global warming
</B>
</A>
<P>
The rapidly increasing concentration of carbon dioxide
(CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and
methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>)  in the atmosphere may be leading to
global warming
as a result of the so-called "greenhouse effect". Isotope
techniques are also proving to be effective tools in unraveling
this complex  environmental phenomenon. 
<P>
Analysis of carbon isotopes helps to explain what happens to the
man-made "greenhouse" gases (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and (CH<SUB>4</SUB>)
in the atmosphere.
Nitrogen and sulphur isotopes can reveal the connections between
industrially produced oxides and acid rain.  The oxygen and
hydrogen isotopes in water are also very useful indicators of
climate-related parameters such as surface air temperature,
relative humidity and amount of precipitation. 
<P>
<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_5>
<B>
Isotopes document climate changes
</B>
</A>
<P>
The isotopic composition of water can provide information about
past climates. For example, radiocarbon measurements of
groundwater
in the Syrian desert indicate widely varying residence time or
"age," ranging from very recent to nearly 40,000 years ago. 
Deuterium values of this very old water provide a striking record
that the climate then was cooler than today (click here for <A
HREF=fig9.html>figure 9</A>).
<P>
The presence of an enormous freshwater lake that filled the
entire
Dead Sea Valley about 20,000 years ago confirms that the coolest
period revealed in the deuterium record was also the wettest one
during the past 40,000 years.  The isotopes showed that present
day
recharge in the region is negligible and that groundwater is not
being replenished -- information that is invaluable to water
resource management strategies.

Isotope Analysis Protects Groundwater Quality
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Groundwater in the Guayas alluvial aquifer underlying a major
river basin in Ecuador has been heavily exploited for irrigation.

Fears arose that sea water intrusion and salination of the
groundwater could result.  Thus, IAEA conducted an investigation
under its Technical Cooperation Programme.
<P>
An isotope and hydrochemical study showed that groundwater
becomes
more confined, immobile and brackish towards the river mouth, but
that sea water does not as yet influence groundwater quality.  In
the higher-lying parts of the delta, groundwater was found to be
rapidly recharged by rain and river water.  The study showed that
groundwater extraction should be restricted to the upper part of
the delta, leaving groundwater pressure near the river mouth
undisturbed in order to prevent seawater intrusion.  (Click here
for <A HREF=fig10.html>figure 10</A>).

Worldwide research and application of isotope techniques is only
possible with analytical facilities offering adequate precision.
Since the late 1950s, IAEA's Isotope Hydrology Laboratory has
played a pioneering role in refining and expanding such
techniques.
<P>
The main activities of the laboratory include: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
measuring the isotopes <SUP>2</SUP>H, <SUP>3</SUP>H,
<SUP>13</SUP>C, <SUP>14</SUP>C and <SUP>18</SUP>O in water and
other
environmental substances,
<BR>
<LI>
developing new analytical techniques, and producing and supplying
analytical standards, 
<BR>
<LI>
performing isotope and chemical analyses for Agency research,
Technical Cooperation projects, and the Global Network for 
Isotopes in Precipitation.  
<BR>
<LI>
organising international analytical intercomparison programmes, 
<BR>
<LI>
assisting in the installation of analytical facilities in Member
States, as well as providing training in isotope hydrology and
chemical analytical techniques. 
</UL>
<P>
Isotope techniques offer proven methodologies relevant to water
resources assessment and management. The costs involved in
isotope
investigations are modest compared to many other aspects of field
investigations. 
<P>
Human resources and analytical capabilities are being enhanced in
both industrial and developing countries, often with support
provided under the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme.
Coordinated Research Programmes are also enabling research
through
contracts and research agreements in Member States. Such
programmes
encourage investigations on a variety of themes, such as arid
zone
hydrology, pollution, geothermal energy, lake dynamics,
geohydrological modelling as well as specific problems such as
the
rise in water level of the Caspian Sea.

Close cooperation is maintained with in the International
Geosphere
Biosphere Programme (IGBP),  the Global Environmental Monitoring

and Earthwatch of UNEP.
<BR>
<LI>
Training programmes are conducted and results published together
with UNESCO under its International Hydrological Programme (IHP).

<BR>
<LI>
Cooperative efforts with UN Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO)
and other UN bodies allow food security, soil erosion and
sedimentation concerns to be addressed. 
<BR>

Special interagency linkages have been created to address the
pressing environmental problems of the rapidly rising Caspian
Sea. 
</UL>
<P>
<B>
The IAEA-WMO Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation
</B>
<P>
Interpretation of the isotopic composition in terrestrial water
requires knowledge about the meteoric water that feeds them: rain
and snow. Their isotopic composition is quite variable in time
and
space, and depends on climate, geography, nuclear fallout and
other
factors. 
<P>
The need for comprehensive global information was recognized many
years ago, when the IAEA, in cooperation with the World
Meteorological Organisation (WMO), launched the World Survey of
Isotopes in Precipitation Network in 1961. The Survey, now called
the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) has grown
increasingly important in studies of the environment and climate
change. (Click here for <A HREF=fig11&13.html>figures 11 -
13</A>).
<P>
The results of this survey, as well as statistical analyses, are
published regularly in the Technical Report Series of the IAEA.
The
information is also available on diskettes and InterNet.

being
added to the isotope toolbox.  For example: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Boron isotopes can now be used to identify traces of sewage
pollution in groundwater. 
<BR>
<LI>
Chlorine isotopes can supply information about the origin of the
salinity and the complexities of flow in large, slow moving
groundwater systems.  They can estimate the age of water and may
indicate the size of a reservoir.  
<BR>
<LI>
Methods are now further refined for the measurement of isotopes
like krypton-85 and helium-3 for determining the age of young
water
and the origins of fluids. 
<BR>
<LI>
Traces of now-banned chemical species such as freons can be
employed as environmental tracers of surface pollutants in
shallow ground water.
</UL>
<P>
Among the key challenges in future isotope applications are: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Developing approaches to address the water problems of megacities
<BR>
<LI>
Responding to the complex and deepening crisis of environmental
pollution
<BR>
<LI>
Contributing to understanding global climatic change
<BR>

Isotopes Reveal Leaks in a Dam
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The El Colorado dam in Chile forms a reservoir with a volume of
about 1.5 cubic kilometres. Major leakages beneath the wall
developed and a grid of wells was drilled downstream from the dam
to relieve the groundwater pressure.
<P>
A field survey revealed that reservoir water had a mean deuterium
concentrarion of -95<SUP>0</SUP>/<SUB>00</SUB>, which differs
from local groundwater having a mean <SUP>2</SUP>H =
-7<SUP>0</SUP>/<SUB>00</SUB>.  Analysis of water samples from the
boreholes showed that leakages were most pronounced near the
flanks of the dam wall. Guided by this information, an area of
major leakage on the reservoir floor was later confirmed, using
the artificial radioactive tracer <SUP>131</SUP>I.  Mitigation
measures to prevent the eventual collapse of the dam were then
undertaken at this location.

Summary
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Since its formation, the IAEA has conducted missions to
facilitate
the provision of advice and assistance to Member States in
nuclear
safety matters.  Until the early 1980s, industry safety
activities
focused mostly on plant design and construction.  Then, as more
plants completed construction and began operation <A
HREF=/worldatom/inforesource/other/gallery/npu.gif>(Fig. 1)</A>, the industry
recognized the
growing importance of achieving high standards of operational
safety and reliability.  In addition, the industry began to
realize
the benefits of achieving a higher level of safety than the
minimum
standards set by regulatory authorities for the protection of the
public and the environment.  The efforts needed to achieve high
levels of operational safety, such as careful planning,
conservative decision-making and attention to detail, also
contribute directly to enhancing plant reliability and
production.
<P>
In 1982, the Agency added the Operational Safety Review Team
(OSART) programme to its services.  Under this programme,
international teams of experts conduct three-week in-depth
reviews
of operational safety performance at individual nuclear power
plants. These reviews are conducted at the request of the
government of the host country.
<P>
The OSART programme provides an opportunity for nuclear power
plant
operators in all countries to assist other operators through the
dissemination of information on the best international practices.

Each OSART mission is conducted by a team of experts from several
countries.  Each of these experts has extensive experience in
some
aspect of nuclear power plant operation.  Guidelines used by the
teams to review plant programmes and performance are based on
best
international practices, and are applied in light of the
experience
of the entire team.
<P>
OSARTs focus on the safety and reliability of plant operation. 
They review the operation of the plant and the performance of the
plant's management and staff rather than the adequacy of a
plant's
design.  Factors affecting plant management and the performance
of
personnel, such as organizational structure, management goals,
and
the qualification of personnel are reviewed.  Adequacy of
programmes and performance related to operational activities are
given particular attention.
<P>
In the course of detailed discussions with plant personnel,
review
of documents and observation of plant activities, the teams
identify performance strengths that can be shared with others and
areas where improvements could be achieved.  Team members often
discuss possible remedies for problem areas with their host
utility
counterparts.
<P>
The first OSART was conducted at the Ko-Ri nuclear power plant in
the Republic of Korea in August 1983.  By the end of March 1995,
a
total of 79 missions had been carried out at 62 nuclear power
plants in 28 countries, including all the continents that have
nuclear power plants.  (Refer to <A HREF=table1.html>Table 1</A>).

In addition, 30 follow-up visits have been conducted since this
became a standard feature of the OSART programme in 1989.

Purpose and Objectives
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The purpose of the OSART programme is to assist Member States in
enhancing the operational safety of specific nuclear power plants
and to promote the continuous development of operational safety
within all Member States by the dissemination of information on
good practices.  
<P>
In support of this purpose, the key objectives of the OSART
programme are:
<UL>
<LI>
to provide the host countries (plant and utility management, the
regulatory authority and other governmental authorities)with an
objective assessment of operational safety at the host plants
with
respect to proven international performance and practices.
<LI>
to provide the host plants with written recommendations in areas
where performance should be improved to meet proven international
performance and practices.
<LI>
to provide the host plants with written suggestions where
performance could be enhanced by use of proven good programmes
and
practices.
<LI>
to provide key staff at the host plants with informal assistance
or
advice on ways improvements might be achieved.
<LI>
to identify good practices at the host plants which are unique
and
worthy of bringing to the attention of others.
<LI>
to provide all Member States with information regarding good
practices identified in the course of the review.
<LI>
to provide experts and observers from Member States and the IAEA
staff with opportunities to broaden their experience and
knowledge
of their own field.
<LI>
to give experts and observers the opportunity to learn review
methodology that will enhance their management skills.
</UL>
<P> 
OSART missions are peer reviews conducted by international teams
of
experts who have current knowledge of the area which they are
reviewing.  OSART reviews are not an audit against set codes and
standards, rather they are a technical exchange of experiences
and
practices at all levels.  They are a joint search by team members
and designated plant personnel (counterparts) to identify
strengths
and opportunities for improvement in a plant's programmes and
performance.  Judgements of performance are made based on the
combined expertise of the teams.  OSART teams do not attempt to
assess a plant's adherence to regulatory requirements or a
plant's
overall safety.  Neither do they attempt to compare or rank
nuclear
power plants' overall safety performance.  Each mission starts
with
the expectation that the plant meets the safety requirements of
the
host country.

Mission Types
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Various types of missions are available within the OSART
programme. 
The scope and depth is decided during a preparatory visit and can
be tailored to the desires of the host country and the needs of
the
plant. The most common missions are `full scope' covering all of
the areas applicable to the mission type, as outlined below.
<P>
OSART teams also specifically review the safety culture at each
plant visited. Safety culture is defined as <B><I>that assembly
of
characteristics and attitudes in organizations and individuals
which establishes that, as an overriding priority, nuclear plant
safety issues receive the attention warranted by their
significance.</I></B> At the conclusion of each mission, an
assessment of the safety culture at the plant is included in the
report of the mission.  <A HREF=P1.html>(Click here to view
photo).</A>
<P>
During 1995, the following types of missions were available:
<P>
<I>
OSART missions to plants in operation
</I>
<P>
OSART missions can be conducted at any time after a plant is
placed
in commercial operation.  They are not normally conducted during
the first year of operation, nor until completion of the first
refuelling cycle outage for light water reactors.  These missions
focus on the performance of management processes and plant
personnel in achieving safe operation.  OSART missions usually
review performance in the eight areas shown below.  They can
cover
fewer areas, but must include the first five areas in order to
provide an overview of plant safety and performance.

Pre-OSART missions to plants under construction/commissioning
</I>
<P>
Pre-Operation Safety Review Team (Pre-OSART) missions are
conducted
during the construction and commissioning phase of a plant's
life. 
The purpose of these missions is to assist the utility in
achieving
high standards of engineering and construction and to help ensure
effective preparations for commissioning and operations.  The
areas
reviewed are based on the status of the plant with regard to
construction and commissioning.  Pre-OSARTs which are conducted
close to the time of initial startup normally review the same
areas
as a regular OSART mission plus commissioning activities. 
Pre-OSARTS conducted earlier in the construction phase normally
review the following areas:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Commissioning.
<LI>
Project Management.
<LI>
Civil Engineering and Construction.
<LI>
Mechanical Equipment Installation.
<LI>
Electrical and Instrument and Control Equipment Installation.
<LI>
Quality Assurance in Construction and Commissioning.
<LI>
Preparations for Startup and Operation.
<LI>
Safety Review missions (to plants in operation).
</UL>
<P>
Safety Review missions consist of a regular OSART mission,
combined
with an in-depth examination of design features most closely
related to safe and reliable operation.  These missions were
developed to assist nuclear plants in addressing both human
performance issues and recognized design weaknesses in an
integrated way.
<P>
<I>
Technical Exchange missions to power plants under construction or
in operation
</I>
<P>
The term Technical Exchange is used to describe missions other
than
those already defined. To date, seven Technical Exchange missions
have been conducted. A limited number of areas are reviewed,
focussing on specific topics.  In each case, the depth and scope
of
review is carried out in accordance with the wishes of the host
country and the needs of the host plant.  However, since the
scope
of Technical Exchange missions is limited, they are not intended
to
provide comprehensive information on operational safety other
than
for the topics covered.
<P>
<I>
Follow-up Visits
</I>
<P>
Follow-up visits are carried out at the request of the host
country
approximately one year to eighteen months after an OSART mission.

They have become so universally requested that they are now
considered an integral part of the OSART process.  Their purpose
is
to provide an independent assessment of progress in the
resolution
of issues identified in the OSART mission.  There is also
opportunity to assist with the clarification of issues and their
resolution where necessary.  Follow-up visits also help the IAEA
measure the effectiveness of the OSART programme and provide
information that can be shared with the nuclear industry on the
successful resolution of problems.

HOW IS AN OSART CARRIED OUT?

Preparing for an OSART
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
OSARTs are initiated by a request from a Member State to review
performance at a specific nuclear power plant.  Preparation for
an
OSART mission starts shortly after, with formal confirmation and
establishment of contacts with liaison officers at the utility or
nuclear power plant and regulatory authority.  Arrangement of a
preparatory meeting with the plant management and other
organizations involved, and the recruitment of experts for the
review team are then carried out.  These activities are organized
by the OSART liaison officer, who assists the team leader during
the preparation for the mission and while it is in progress.  The
liaison officer also reviews a specific area as a member of the
team.
<P>
A preparatory meeting is held at the plant site and is usually
attended by the team leader and the OSART liaison officer. It
takes
place about one year prior to the start of the mission. Other
organizations involved, such as regulatory authorities and
emergency planning authorities are welcomed at this meeting. If
desired, separate preparatory meetings may also be conducted with
the regulatory authority.  These meetings allow those responsible
for ensuring that the review is carried out effectively to meet
and
reach a common understanding on the conduct of the OSART.  The
participants discuss the main features of the OSART programme,
and
the plant's preparations for the review.  They also discuss the
preparation of an advance information package for team members,
logistical support, arrangements for reporting mission results
and
any intended involvement of the media.  The meeting includes a
tour
of the plant for the IAEA staff members.
<P>
<I>
Team Composition
</I>
<P>
An OSART team usually consists of one experienced nuclear power
plant expert for each area of the review except for operations,
where there are usually two. Typically, two thirds of the team
are
senior managers from nuclear power plants outside the host
country,
the remaining one third are IAEA staff.  The objective is that
approximately 50% of the industry experts will have had previous
experience either on OSARTs or on self evaluation teams. 
Occasionally, a member of a regulatory body from outside the host
country is a team member, provided that he/she has the required
experience.  The team includes up to three observers from
countries
where the nuclear programme is in transition or in the course of
significant development.  The cumulative experience of the team
in
the nuclear industry often exceeds 200 years.  <A
HREF=table2.html>Table 2</A> shows the origin of OSART industry
experts and observers. <A HREF=p2.html>(Click here to view
photo).</A>
<P>
Experts are recruited based on their technical skills in the area
they will review, their investigative skills and their knowledge
of
the OSART working language (English).  These experts change from
one OSART mission to the next.  The IAEA staff members also have
experience in the nuclear industry and have demonstrated
evaluation
skills. Staff members have taken part in many evaluations and
help
provide consistency in the OSART process, as well as a knowledge
of
various national practices.
<P>
The team leader and assistant team leader of each OSART mission
are
senior IAEA staff members and are responsible for the overall
conduct of the mission. This includes co-ordination and liaison
with the host utility, the host plant and the regulatory
authority.
Additionally, they provide training and guidance to the teams, to
help ensure coherent and consistent reviews.
<P>
<I>
Advance Information
</I>
<P>
To enable an OSART team to perform effectively and efficiently
while on site, the nuclear power plant prepares an advance
information package.  This package is sent to the team members
prior to the OSART, so they can familiarize themselves with the
plant organization, administration, layout, performance and
general
design before they begin the review.  This package usually
includes
a section dedicated to each review area including information on
the plant counterparts.  It also contains information on
radiation
protection, and general logistics such as hotel and
transportation
arrangements. Information needs are minimized to avoid undue
translation casts for the plant.

HOW IS AN OSART CARRIED OUT?
</H2>
<P>
<H3>
Carrying out the review
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
When the OSART members arrive at a plant site, they are already
familiar with the plant's main features, operating
characteristics,
history, regulatory provisions, technical specifications,
procedures, organization and key personnel as a consequence of
their study of the advance information package.   The first day
is
used for plant entrance formalities, and to brief the team
members
on applicable security, radiation protection and industrial
safety
requirements.  The experts also meet their plant counterparts,
who
are the designated plant experts in the area being reviewed. 
Together they carry out an initial plant tour and make final
arrangements for their review. <A HREF=p3.html>(Click here to view
photo).</A>
<P>
The standard OSART schedule (Tables <A HREF=table3.html>3</A> and
<A HREF=table4.html>4</A>) shows the activities of the team during the three
weeks of
the mission.  Deviations from the schedule are possible, to take
account of local conditions and the availability of plant
counterparts, so long as the overall coverage of each topic is
not
compromised.  The review of each topic often starts with a brief
presentation outlining the power plants' programmes and
performance
in the subject area.  This is followed by a question and answer
period and observations in the field to determine whether
operational safety performance is consistent with good
international practice.  It is the intention that most experts
will
spend the majority of their time in field observations.  The
OSART
team meets each day to review the results of its activities and,
by
discussion, develops a team consensus on emerging issues.  These
meetings are also an opportunity for the team leader to reinforce
the review methodology and to provide additional training as
required.
<P>
Throughout the mission, there are detailed discussions with the
plant counterparts to verify that the OSART team has a correct
understanding of the plant's strengths and opportunities for
improvement.  The contribution of the plant counterparts is
essential to verify that the experts' observations are correct
which would ensure that they understand the written material,
that
they are not misled by any shortcomings in translation or
interpretation, and that the practices observed are
representative. 
This plant counterpart is a member of the plant staff, who has
current responsibility for the area being reviewed.  In parallel,
the experts present their observations and conclusions to their
fellow team members at the team's daily meetings.  The team's
discussions help ensure that all team members are well informed
on
the progress of the review and allow team members to benefit from
other experts' observations.  Ultimately, the team's
recommendations, suggestions and good practices are arrived at by
the consensus of the team rather than as a consequence of an
individual's opinion.  They must be significant to improving
safety
performance and must be based on facts. <A HREF=p4.html>(Click
here to view photo).</A>
<P>
As the review proceeds, the team leader informs the plant
management (and the regulatory authority if requested) on the
progress made. Opportunities for improvement and areas of
uniquely
outstanding performance are discussed as the issues emerge. The
last days of the mission are reserved for rechecking any open
topics, for completing the Technical Notes and discussing them in
their entirety with the counterparts.  Additionally, each team
member drafts a summary of his/her area for the Technical Notes
and
his/her oral presentation at the exit meeting.
<P>
<I>
Evaluation  criteria
</I>
<P>
Experts are selected to ensure that a variety of national
approaches to operational safety are represented. Each expert has
knowledge of his/her particular area, as well as other review
areas, so that the relevance of issues identified by individual
team members can be discussed by the whole team.  These
discussions
are supplemented by four publications: IAEA Nuclear Safety
Standards (IAEA Safety Series No. 50), International Basic Safety
Standard for protection against ionizing radiation and for the
safety of radiation sources (IAEA Safety Series No. 115-I), OSART
guidelines (IAEA-TECDOC-744) and OSART Supplementary Guidance and
Reference Material.  Some related IAEA publications are listed in
<A HREF=table5.html>(Table 5)</A>.
<P>
The OSART review compares plant programmes and performance with
successful safety practices found at other nuclear power plants.
If
the experts feel that safety performance might be strengthened or
that a safety relevant practice is superior elsewhere, then they
will bring it to the attention of the plant management and make a
recommendation or a suggestion.  The experts may also propose
improvements in plant reliability and cost-effectiveness. 
Similarly, if a safety practice is observed which is markedly
superior to those available elsewhere, the expert will take note
of
it to ensure that it is included in the mission report so that it
can be made known to other nuclear power plants.  The team's
recommendations and suggestions for improvement are focussed on
what improvements should be achieved, but leave decisions on how
to
achieve them to the host plant. <A HREF=p5.html>(Click here to

Approximately one year to eighteen months after the OSART
mission,
a Follow-up visit is conducted.  During this visit, a group of
three to four team members evaluate the progress made in
resolving
the issues raised by the OSART team by interviewing personnel,
reviewing documentation and conducting field visits.  The status
of
the response to each recommendation and suggestion is determined,
and is included in the final report.

Reporting the results
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
While at the site, the OSART members write technical notes on
their
observations and conclusions.  These notes are the preliminary
report of mission results to the host plant and are discussed in
detail with the plant counterparts.  They are also the basis for
the oral presentation at the exit meeting at the conclusion of a
mission.  The technical notes are presented to the plant
management
before the team leaves.  These technical notes are not the
official
report and are provided only to the host plant.  They form the
basis of the official report prepared by the team leader after
each
mission.  This report summarizes the team's observations and
conclusions, and includes reference to all recommendations and
good
practices identified by the team. 
<P>
Before the official report is finalized, the utility and
regulatory
authority concerned are given the opportunity to provide
comments. 
The approved official report is then submitted through official
channels to the Member State that requested the OSART.  The
distribution of each official report is initially restricted to
the
IAEA, the members of the OSART team and the utility and
regulatory
authority involved.  Any further distribution at this time is at
the discretion of the Member State.  Ninety days after the
official
report is issued, it is automatically derestricted and made
available for release to the public unless the host country
requests otherwise.  Alternative reporting arrangements may be
possible if requested by the host country. <A HREF=p6.html>(Click
here to view photo.)</A>
<P>
The results of follow-up visits are reported in a similar manner,
with technical notes being presented to the plant management
before
the team leaves the site.  An official detailed report is then
prepared, using the detailed findings of the original mission
augmented with the results of the follow-up visit.  Publication
of
the official detailed report proceeds as before with an
opportunity
for the host country to comment, followed by initial restricted
distribution and automatic derestriction after 90 days unless the
host country indicates otherwise.  Since 1986, most of the OSART
reports have been derestricted and are available to interested
individuals and organizations.
<P>
Summaries of OSART missions results and good practices from 1983
have been published in the following documents: OSART Results,
IAEA
TECDOC-458 (1986-87); OSART Results II, IAEA TECDOC-497
(1987-88);
OSART Mission Highlights, TECDOC-570 (1988-89) and OSART Mission
Highlights, TECDOC-681 (1989-90).  OSART Mission Highlights for
1991-92 was published in Spring 1995.  
<P>
In addition, a database has been developed, which contains the
major results of all OSART missions from 1991 onwards and their
follow-up visits.  The database can, for example, provide
information on OSART results for specific review areas and
individual topics within those review areas for all OSARTs since
1991.  This will enhance results and maximize their application
in
the industry.  The database is continuously updated with the
results of  OSARTs and the active database comprises ongoing
records for the most current five year period. This data can be
obtained by contacting the Nuclear Power Plant Operational Safety
Services Section of the Division of Nuclear Safety.

Outlook
</H3>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The IAEA closely monitors the OSART programme in an effort to
increase its usefulness and effectiveness, incorporating new
features and deleting outdated ones.  The feedback of experience
takes place in various ways.  At the end of each mission, the
OSART
team members complete questionnaires that provide feedback on the
OSART process, including proposals for improvement.  Similarly,
the
nuclear power plants and utilities are asked to comment on each
OSART mission in general.
<P>
Consultants services and Technical Committee Meetings were held
in
1988, 1990  1992, 1993 and 1994 to review aspects of the OSART
programme.  As a result, improvements to the service have been
made, in particular regarding the mutual co-operation between the
OSART organization and the nuclear power plant, as well as
between
the OSART experts and their plant counterparts.  Future
developments will include reviewing the structure of operational
safety reviews in view of the Nuclear Safety Convention and,
improving team training and reinforcing the concept of basing
findings on actual plant performance, rather than on existance of
programmes.
<P>
In order for the OSART programme to enhance the international
exchange of operating experience at the managerial and working
level, the active participation of all countries with operating
nuclear power plants is essential.  In addition to requesting
nuclear power plants to provide experts to participate in OSART
missions, the IAEA will promptly respond to requests for OSART
missions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>	On 26 April 1986, an accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and the
	world became aware of the name 'Chernobyl'. The IAEA has played a major part in
	the subsequent compilation and dissemination of scientifically assessed information
	about the causes and the consequences of this accident. The results of this work, and
that of other national and international organizations, were brought together at an
international conference which was convened by the IAEA together with the World
Health Organization and the European Commission and held in May 1996. The aim
was to summarize the present state of knowledge on the consequences of the
accident. An account of the IAEA's involvement over the past ten years forms the
subject of the lead article in the <I>IAEA Yearbook 1996</I>.
<P>
Part A of the Yearbook describes the role played by the IAEA in helping to advance sustainable development by the transfer of nuclear and radiation technology. The introduction to this section this year discusses the application of quality assurance practices to this important work. The main article describes new planning procedures that are being adopted to ensure that these technical co-operation activities are of significant and practical benefit to the States concerned.
<P>
The work routinely carried out by the IAEA on the development and dissemination of nuclear and radiation techniques covers a wide range of subjects - the practical aspects of physics and chemistry, hydrology, industrial applications, human health, and food and agriculture. Part B of the Yearbook concentrates on food irradiation and the use of nuclear monitoring techniques in programmes for improving human nutrition. Irradiation of foodstuffs is gaining acceptance as a viable alternative to other means of preserving foods and eradicating pest infestation. Nuclear techniques offer new ways of determining the best approaches to food supplements in areas of malnutrition.
<P>
Part C of the Yearbook deals with nuclear power and its fuel cycle and waste management technology. The section on nuclear power describes developments during 1995 in a wide range of countries. It also details the IAEA's work on the comparative health and environmental impacts of different types of energy systems. Of particular interest this year in the fuel cycle area is the report that the downturn in world uranium activities that has lasted for more than 15 years may be coming to an end. In the waste management section, emphasis is given to the technology of
environmental restoration of sites after contamination resulting from past nuclear
	activities.
<P>
A discussion of different aspects of the safety of nuclear power and of the uses of
	radiation is to be found in Part D, <I>The Nuclear Safety Review</I>. This section starts
	with a discussion of the concept of a global safety culture, dealing with international
	conventions and safety standards, and the advisory services offered by the IAEA. It
	also covers a number of topical issues concerning the safety of nuclear power plants,	
	radiation safety and the safety of radioactive waste management practices. Attention
	is devoted here again to the problem of radioactive residues from past nuclear		
	weapons production and testing and from uranium mining and milling.	
<P>
	The prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a matter of concern to all	
	countries. As in previous years, Part E of the <I>IAEA Yearbook 1996</I> deals with the		
	IAEA's major contribution to the non-proliferation regime - international safe
	guards. In addition to a summary of events in 1995, there are articles on the training	 
	of safeguards inspectors and on the 'Clean Laboratory' which has been built at the	
	IAEA's Safeguards Analytical Laboratory at Seibersdorf to take full advantage of the	
	sensitivity of modern analytical techniques being used to measure very low levels of		
	radionuclides - an important element in the new procedures recently adopted for		
	strengthening safeguards. Part E also contains a description of IAEA activities designed to assist Member States in preventing traffficking in nuclear materials.
	<P>		
	As in previous years, the final part of the Yearbook gives background information on		
	the IAEA - the framework within which it continues to carry out its programme.		
	<P>	
	The last thirty-nine years have seen many developments in the role of the IAEA,	 
	with a range of activities being introduced to meet changes in the outside world. As	 
	it prepares to mark its fortieth anniversary in 1997, the IAEA continues to adapt its	 
	priorities to meet the challenge laid down in its Statute: to "...seek to	
	enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout	 
	the world."

<P>
During 1994, the Agency continued its wide ranging programme of work aimed at a balanced delivery to all Member States. This programme encompasses: nuclear power and its fuel cycle, waste management, the safety of nuclear installations and radiation safety, international safeguards and the use of nuclear techniques to help improve human health, the supply of food and environmental protection within the context of sustainable development. In particular, the Agency's contributions to international security through its verification activities and to the transfer of nuclear technology continued to be major focal points of its work.
<P>
The Agency's activities during 1994 continued to be conducted within the framework of a zero real growth Regular Budget -- the tenth year of operation under such conditions. Further more, the Regular Budget appropriation for Agency programmes of some $214 million was reduced by $20 million in anticipation of shortfalls in contributions. On the other hand, activities with a value of $17.3 million deferred from previous years were implemented. Total new resources amounting to $52 million were available for the technical co-operation programme in 1994. Pledges to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund stood at 72.5% of the target of $58.5 million. Extrabudgetary funds, apart from those directed to technical co-operation and the ICTP, and those received from other United Nations organizations, rose by 11% to $16.4 million and remained vital to some programmes, notably safeguards and nuclear safety.  This introduction highlights the overall activities of the Agency. The main achievements within individual programmes are recorded in the overviews at the beginning of each chapter.    
<P>
The credibility of commitments made by States not to acquire nuclear weapons has become increasingly important, particularly as States which do possess nuclear weapons move to reduce their arsenals. The Agency's system of safeguards for verifying that nuclear energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes has a vital role to play in enhancing this credibility because it enables States to demonstrate compliance with their international undertakings.  In recent years the Agency has introduced a number of measures to improve the safeguards system and further steps in this direction were taken in 1994. With the extensive co-operation and support of Member States, work progressed on Programme "93+2"- a comprehensive set of measures to improve the cost effectiveness of safeguards on declared nuclear material and increase the assurance of the completeness of information on nuclear activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. The work undertaken in this area was reviewed by the Agency's Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI) and by the Board of Governors.
<P>
Overall, the effort to improve the safeguards system has been successful. One example is the so-called New Partnership Approach, which began replacing the previous observation and joint team arrangements between the Agency and EURATOM in 1994, allowing the two organizations to meet their respective safeguards responsibilities more effectively and efficiently. The result of the implementation of the new approach has been a substantial decrease in the cost of the Agency's inspection effort in the ten non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union. These savings have permitted redirection of resources to new requirements in other regions. 
<P>
However, some specific measures that were introduced have yet to generate their full benefits. For example, in February 1993 the Board of Governors endorsed a proposal for the establishment of a reporting scheme for the export and import of nuclear material as well as the export of specified equipment and non-nuclear material. By the end of 1994, only 43 Member States and the European Union had subscribed to the scheme and only 22 States had actually submitted reports.
<P>
The negotiation during the year of comprehensive safeguards agreements with the newly independent States (NIS) of the former USSR which have significant nuclear facilities marked an important step towards the full implementation of safeguards in those countries. 
<P>
To date, safeguards agreements in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have been concluded with eight NIS States. Also, a comprehensive safeguards agreement was concluded with Ukraine covering all nuclear material in peaceful use. In preparing for the full implementation of safeguards in the NIS, the Agency provided advice on the legal framework for control of nuclear activities and, in collaboration with a number of Member States, provided assistance in establishing State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material, and advice on physical protection and on mechanisms for the reporting of imports and exports relevant to safeguards.
<P>
Developments in other regions have led to, or have opened the way to, Agency safeguards being applied to additional nuclear activities. Argentina, Brazil and Chile ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the quadripartite Safeguards Agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the Agency entered into force in March. With the announcement by Cuba that it had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, it can be expected that this Treaty will soon enter into force, thus formalizing the nuclear weapon free status of the Latin American and Caribbean region. 
<P>
 At the request of the General Conference, the Director General continued consultations with countries in the Middle East to facilitate the early application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region. Furthermore, in the context of promoting mutual confidence and security in the Middle East, the Agency provided expert assistance to the participants in the Multilateral Working Group on Arms Control and Regional Security.
<P>
The implementation of safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remained a matter of great concern during the year. Following an understanding with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in February on the inspection activities required to provide continuity of safeguards knowledge at declared facilities, an inspection was carried out in March. However, refuelling of the 5 MW experimental reactor at Nyongbyon started without the presence of Agency inspectors and despite the subsequent arrival of an inspection team, no Agency verification of selected discharged fuel was permitted. In June, the Board of Governors decided to suspend non-medical assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On 15 June, the Agency was informed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had decided to withdraw from the Agency with effect from 13 June. This withdrawal did not affect the validity of the safeguards agreement, which remains in force.
<P>
Bilateral talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the USA resulted in an Agreed Framework, signed in Geneva on 21 October. On 4 November, the President of the United Nations Security Council issued a statement requesting the Agency to take all steps it might deem necessary, as a consequence of the Agreed Framework, to monitor the freeze on the graphite moderated reactors and related facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. An Agency technical team visited the country in November to discuss the implementation of safeguards and arrangements were made to enable the Agency to meet most of its objectives. The Agency team visited the facilities subject to the freeze and was able to confirm that they were not in operation and that construction work had stopped. 
<P>
During 1994, the Agency carried out 5 inspections in Iraq, bringing the total number of inspections to 27. It continued to carry out activities related to the destruction, removal and rendering harmless of items requiring such action pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 687. The remaining action in that regard, the removal of a further 100 spent fuel assemblies from Iraq, was completed under a contract between the Russian Federation and the Agency in February. The fuel assemblies will be processed and stored, under Agency safeguards, in the Russian Federation. The Agency continued to phase in elements of the plan, approved by the Security Council in Resolution 715, for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with Security Council Resolutions 687 and 707.  
<P>
As a result of the dismantling of nuclear weapons by the USA and the Russian Federation and the ongoing reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, substantial quantities of plutonium and high enriched uranium are being recovered. President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed in January 1994 to establish a joint working group to consider steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of putting a portion of the fissionable material under Agency safeguards. The USA submitted to Agency safeguards a portion of its fissile material no longer needed for defence purposes and Agency inspections commenced at two locations.
<P>
In December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution which recommended the negotiation of a verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices. The Assembly requested the Agency to provide assistance for examination of verification arrangements for such a treaty as required. In compliance with this request the Agency began examining the verification issues involved and preparing background papers.
<P>
During the year the Agency was invited by the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban of the Conference on Disarmament to provide information about its infrastructure and technical expertise in connection with the discussion on the verification arrangements for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT). Although the scope of the treaty and the modalities for its verification are not yet agreed, the draft text of a CTBT being considered by the negotiating States, noting the need for cost effective arrangements and for effective use of relevant experience and expertise, foresees a role for the Agency in the verification of compliance with a future treaty.
<P>
An increase in reports of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials caused the Agency's General Conference in September to call upon Member States to take all necessary measures to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear material and to invite the Secretariat to prepare proposals for Agency activities, in consultation with experts designated by Member States and competent international organizations. The consultations took place in November and in December the Board gave initial consideration to a set of proposals to increase the Agency's support to Member States in strengthening their systems to ensure security of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. 
<P>
The Conference on the Nuclear Power Option, convened by the Agency in September, showed that while it is relatively easy to describe the current status of nuclear power, it is hard to predict the timing of its future growth. Some Member States continue expanding their nuclear power capacity, while others expect to expand their supply when current surplus capacity has been utilized and a feware decided opponents of nuclear power.  However, even with ambitious conservation efforts the world must increase its use of electricity in the coming decades in order to secure economic development, environmental benefits and improvements in standards of living. The consensus of the conference was that nuclear power will
continue to provide about the same proportion of electricity as at present. A mix of nuclear and other fuels is beneficial in achieving stability in supply and the price of electricity. At the same time global concern with the production of so-called greenhouse gases and the prospect of climate change was reflected by the entry into force in March 1994 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Underpinning international efforts in this area are the scientific assessments being conducted by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Agency has contributed to some elements of that work. The latest IPCC assessments prepared in 1994 will be circulated to participating governments for comment before finalization in 1995. In the Agency's view the draft assessments do not adequately reflect the potential contribution that nuclear energy could make to meeting energy demands while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
<P>
To assist Member States in assessing and comparing the costs and benefits of nuclear and other sources of energy for electricity generation, the Agency, together with a number of other international organizations, has been developing tools for the comparative assessment of different electricity generation options taking into account economic, environmental and health considerations. This inter-agency joint project, known as DECADES, has now evolved from its development phase to a point where the Agency has begun responding to Member State requests to utilize the tools for assessment purposes. 
<P>
A major accomplishment in the area of nuclear safety was the adoption in June of the Convention on Nuclear Safety,  the culmination of three years of preparation and negotiation. In addition, the new Basic Safety Standards sponsored by six international organizations, including the Agency, were approved by the Board of Governors in September. They contain guidelines on responsibilities for the control and safety of radiation sources as well as for the protection of workers, the general public and medical patients, together with guidelines for intervention levels in emergency situations. Both the Convention and the new Basic Safety Standards supplement the existing extensive framework of safety guidelines and standards and the Conventions on Early Warning and Assistance in the Event of a Nuclear Accident. Negotiations continued on a more widely accepted international regime for liability for nuclear damage. The importance of an early conclusion of a new convention on liability has been heightened by the practical requirement for an acceptable liability framework for upgrading safety at nuclear power plants of older designs.  
<P>
The Agency's activities on the safety of nuclear power plants in eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR resulted in a consensus between the operators and the countries engaged in safety assistance programmes on the safety issues to be addressed, and on their significance, in relation to the different models of WWER and RBMK reactors. This consensus provided guidance for both national programmes to improve safety and the international assistance co-ordinated through the G-24 mechanism. It also offered information of relevance for the work being performed by the World Association of Nuclear Operators(WANO). Special attention was given to the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl after the decision of Ukraine in 1993 to continue its operation. Following examination of the plant by an Agency team of safety experts, a meeting was convened in April to consider possible measures to deal with the safety situation which had been identified. A clear majority of the participants expressed the view that operation of the Chernobyl plant should be discontinued as soon as conditions allow. At the end of the year the matter was still under discussion between Ukraine and countries which might offer assistance. 
<P>
The preparation for the joint project with UNDP for assistance to the newly independent States of the former USSR in strengthening nuclear and radiation safety infrastructures has resulted in the identification of needs and the preparation of plans for remedial action. Implementation of the plans will depend on the availability of funding. Since no resources have yet been raised by UNDP, other channels will now have to be pursued. 
<P>
The management of spent fuel from research reactors was the subject of increased international discussion. The life of a large number of research reactors is being extended and this is leading to a need to expand interim spent fuel storage capacities pending decisions on longer term solutions. The Agency has established a database on research reactor spent fuel inventories and has registered the problems of individual facilities.
<P>
International normative work regarding radioactive wastes continued to progress under the Agency's Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) programme. Two documents, the Safety Fundamentals on the principles of radioactive waste management and a Safety Standard on establishing a national system for radioactive waste management, were prepared for consideration by the Board of Governors. The preparation of the documents involved an extensive process of consultations amongst Member States with a view to obtaining international consensus. As a further step towards codifying good waste management practices, the General Conference in September invited the Board and the Director General to commence preparations for a convention on the safe management of radioactive wastes.   
<P>
The Agency's Safety Standards as approved by the Board of Governors must be applied to all Agency
technical co-operation projects. In this connection, a systematic approach to help strengthen radiation protection and waste management infrastructures in Member States has been introduced in the technical co-operation programme, where specific activities are being implemented within the framework of a model project initiative. The proposed activities will help Member States to reach the required level of expertise for their particular circumstances. In its first year, this new approach has already resulted in considerable improvements in terms of legislation, codes of practice, licensing and personnel monitoring. 
<P>
At the meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention 1972) in November 1993, the dumping of radioactive wastes at sea was banned by international agreement. When the ban became operative on 20 February 1994 for all Contracting Parties except those which had made a declaration of non-acceptance before that date, the Russian Federation declared that it was not able to comply with it. However, it is presently working together with other countries to find technical solutions which would remove its need to dispose of low level wastes at sea. During 1994, the IAEA-MEL participated in scientific missions to examine the environment surrounding the sites of past dumping of radioactive wastes and equipment in the Kara Sea in the Arctic and in seas further to the east (i.e. the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Yellow Sea), and of the nuclear submarine which sank in the North Atlantic containing two nuclear warheads and a nuclear reactor. While it appears that there are no effects at present from the dumped wastes, the gradual  deterioration of the waste packages and containment's could lead to impacts in the future.   
<P>
The lack of adequate waste management facilities for low and intermediate level radioactive wastes sometimes raises problems for small and developing nuclear programmes where  nuclear techniques are applied only in research, medicine, agriculture and industry. Waste management strategies are required if there is to be confidence in the use of such applications. In this connection, the Agency began to assess the feasibility of applying a regional approach to the management of spent radium sources in Africa. 
<P>
The Agency's technical co-operation programme continued to be redirected by the development of the model project approach. Of the 12 model projects approved for 1994, 11 have been successfully started. One, however, has been delayed by the failure to attract adequate extrabudgetary funding. Building on the ideas behind the original initiative, the Agency prepared proposals for a further set of model projects which were approved by the Board of Governors for implementation starting in 1995-1996. Unlike the first set, which were based mainly on initiatives of the Secretariat, the new projects stem from proposals made by Member States and reflect the extent to which there orientation to an emphasis on demonstrable benefit for end users has been embraced. It is expected that the characteristics of model projects will in time be observable across the spectrum of the technical co-operation programme and indeed the work of other areas of the Agency which are contributing to technology transfer.
<P>
Simultaneously with the introduction of the model project approach, the Agency has sought to collaborate more closely with other international organizations such as FAO, WHO and UNIDO. It has also sought to tap new and additional sources of multilateral and bilateral funding by demonstrating how effectively nuclear techniques can contribute to the development process. In this way the Agency aims to become an effective partner in development.  
<P>
In accordance with global priorities, the focus of the Agency's technical co-operation activities continues to be on the transfer of technology that will help to increase food supplies, improve human health and contribute to sustainable development and protection of the environment. A fourth focus of emphasis  and one which emerges from the Agency's own work  is to ensure adequate radiation protection.  
<P>
In September the Agency convened the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar at which Member States: agreed that high priority be assigned to radiation protection and waste management; accepted a proposal for introducing medium term country plans to provide a framework for future co-operation programmes; and considered the extent to which the Agency should reorient its technical co-operation activities towards maximizing direct socio-economic impacts.
<P>
While there was widespread support for these new directions in the technical co-operation programme, contributions to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund (TACF) dropped to 72.5% of the target compared with 76.5% in 1993. The downward trend in pledges and payments in relation to the agreed targets for the TACF is a major obstacle to meeting the priority needs of Member States.
<P>
Within the area of the Agency's work on the use of nuclear techniques to help increase the supply of food, the programme related to the control of rinderpest in Africa has attained an important turning point.The programme, which uses regular budget, extrabudgetary and TACF resources, has involved the use of a nuclear based technique for testing the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign, and a programme of quality control amongst the regional institutes which carried out the actual testing. The campaign has now reached the stage where the cumulative impact of vaccinations, as confirmed by the Agency's testing programme, is leading to a reduced need for intervention. Additional extrabudgetary resources have now been offered to enable the Agency to continue monitoring progress in the coming years.
<P>
Other highlights in the area of food and agriculture include the following. Genetically improved varieties of sorghum and African rice developed through an Agency CRP are now ready to be released in Mali for testing in the field under the auspices of a model technical co-operation project. Bulk reagents for a new and inexpensive radioimmunoassay technique for monitoring fertility in animals, developed by the  Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf and tested through co-operation with Member States, are now being made generally available, leading to greater reliance on and more sustained use of this aid to livestock production. A number of advances were made in the use of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for pest control.
<P>
In the work on human health, preparations were made to commence a CRP and initiate a model project to foster the use of nuclear technologies to monitor applied nutritional intervention programmes. In response to approaches by the Agency, some commercial manufacturers have begun producing simple, low-cost, updated gamma cameras and brachytherapy machines and discussions are continuing with companies to produce simple, low-cost SPECT (single photon emission tomography) systems and teletherapy units. These developments are leading to lower costs for the supply of these items under technical co-operation projects and wider commercial availability in developing countries. Agency sponsored research activities received commendation at the 1994 World Congress of Nuclear Medicine for their novel approach to randomized, multicentre, clinical trials for the validation of new treatment strategies in cancer patients.  
<P>
The analytical capabilities of the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf in the field of environmental monitoring have been strengthened through the acquisition of additional equipment and technologies. Examples include the following. The Agency has acquired access to a beam line facility which will be used for the measurement of low levels of contamination in environmental samples. An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer will provide state-of-the-art elemental analysis in environmental and biological samples. Newly acquired molecular based technology will complement a battery of techniques already available for research and diagnostic purposes in the agricultural area. 
<P>
The Laboratory continued to provide direct support to field projects. For example, fellowship training in 1994 reached a total of over one hundred fellows from more than fifty countries. More than 1.8 million tsetse fly pupae were shipped to the eradication project on Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania. A major reduction in the tsetse fly population on the island has already been achieved. In the area of verification, the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory participated in field trials of environmental sampling for safeguards under Programme 93+2. 
<P>
As noted above, the IAEA-MEL made a particular contribution to the monitoring of radioactive contamination in the marine environment. The laboratory was awarded the Philip Morris Scientific Prize for Biogeochemistry for its pioneering work, along with French scientists, on the use of isotopic techniques and direct particulate sampling to quantify the carbon flux in the oceans  a matter of major relevance to the understanding of climate change. This important work is continuing with extrabudgetary support.
<P>
By the end of the year, the Agency had taken major steps to simplify and standardize its programme, budget and accounting systems in order to provide managers with more timely and relevant information and make the Agency's operations more transparent. A revision of the financial rules and regulations had been completed and a framework for systematic programme monitoring and evaluation had been introduced.
<P>
The Agency has continued to work closely with other elements in the international system. In matters relating to verification, the Agency continued to interact with the United Nations Security Council as the body politically responsible for ensuring implementation of nuclear arms control measures. The Agency continued to play its part in system-wide efforts to promote sustainable development through the many programmes and technical assistance projects which directly or indirectly support the objectives of Agenda 21. Its co-operation with other organizations in the United Nations system continued to be extensive. In this regard, special mention may be made of the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Joint IAEA/FAO Division set up to pursue the use of nuclear techniques for food production and preservation.
<P>
In 1995 the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and the Review and Extension Conference of the NPT will provide focal points for thinking about future directions of Agency activity. However, the immediate priorities are clear: the financing of safeguards and of technical co-operation; the implementation of the recommendations of Programme 93+2 for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of safeguards; preparations for the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and for the negotiation of a convention on the safe management of radioactive wastes; the implementation of the various initiatives relating to the technical co-operation programme, including the outcomes of the policy review seminar in 1994; the introduction of a new programme for enhancing the security of nuclear and radioactive materials; and the continued effort to introduce improved management practices and systems which will provide a better basis for decisions about resource allocation.
<P>
Member States have an interest in the effective pursuit of all the functions and activities foreseen in the
Statute of the Agency and in ensuring that none of them are neglected. The various activities are mutually supportive and to make a distinction between promotional and regulatory functions does not do justice to the full range of the Agency's endeavours. The real constraint to the strengthening of various parts of its mandate lies not in any statutory limitation, but in the zero real growth policy that has been followed for over ten years.

A major conference entitled The Nuclear Power Option, held in
September, confirmed the viability of nuclear power for future
growth as an economic and environmentally sound technology. One
conclusion was that it could be used in conjunction with other
energy resources to provide a reliable supply of energy in the
event of disruptions in fossil fuel supply and prices. The actions
which should be taken by governments to maintain the nuclear power
option were identified.<P>
The training and qualification of nuclear
power plant personnel were identified in 1993 as areas requiring
greater attention from the Agency. In 1994, the first meeting of an
International Working Group was held to formulate recommendations
on the programme of work to be undertaken over the next few years.
The initial emphasis will be on a training methodology, i.e. a
systematic approach to training, the general objective being to
help utilities become self-sufficient in identifying and satisfying
their training needs.  
<P>
A revised Power Reactor Information System
(PRIS) database was completed and will be made available to Member
States in 1995. This database is now accessible on-line to anyone
using a PC with the appropriate software. The revision of the
Agency's Quality Assurance Code and Safety Guides within the NUSS
programme advanced to the point where final drafts were sent to
Member States. Completion and publication of these documents is
planned for 1995.  
<P>
In its activities on advanced reactors the
Agency continued to monitor and document trends in the development
and design of next generation reactors, with special attention
given to the status of small and medium sized reactors and their
application for the desalination of sea water. The availability of
potable water is an emerging issue in many Member States and the
Agency was requested at the regular session of the General Conference to study options for the demonstration of nuclear
reactors coupled to seawater desalination processes.

<P>
The planning methodologies developed by the Agency for energy, electricity and nuclear power planning continued to receive wide
acceptance among Member States and international organizations. New developments in 1994 included the following:
<UL>
<LI>A new version of WASP, known as WASP-III Plus, was fully incorporated into the ENPEP package;
<LI>New versions of several ENPEP modules were completed and the User's Manual was updated accordingly;         
<LI>New versions of the Agencys planning models were distributed in response to requests by
several Member States.
</UL>
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.6">Assistance in nuclear power programme planning</B></A>
<P>
Support was given to technical co-operation projects in developing Member States, especially for nuclear power programme
planning and development, including energy and nuclear power planning studies, project feasibility studies and infrastructure
development planning:   
<UL>
<LI>Colombia, Pakistan, Peru and Romania
received assistance in carrying out planning studies using the
ENPEP package with the aim of assessing the nuclear option, taking
due account of economic and environmental issues.
<LI>Croatia received assistance in defining an overall framework for a
technical co-operation project on energy sector planning, to be funded by UNDP.         
<LI>Indonesia continued to receive assistance in carrying out energy/electricity planning studies 
and nuclear power feasibility studies, including financial analysis of electricity
generation system expansion strategies. Training courses and workshops were held on a range of topics, including economics, financing and project management.
<LI>The Czech Republic and Slovakia received assistance in the evaluation and selection of final
repository sites for spent nuclear fuel through a project supported by extrabudgetary funding from Spain.   
<LI>China received assistance in carrying out energy, electricity and nuclear power planning
studies, using the ENPEP model, for Fujian Province, which has rapidly growing energy and electricity demands. The results from
these studies and the experience gained in the use of the ENPEP model were reported at a workshop held in October in Fuzhou; China
intends to use the expertise and planning capabilities developed with the Agency's assistance in order to apply the ENPEP approach in
other provinces of the country.
<LI>Expert group meetings were conducted for RCA countries with the aim of providing
recommendations in evolving effective strategies for nuclear power
programmes in these countries, and to improve the reliability and
availability of data needed by the Agency's planning models, with emphasis on WASP.

The migration of the Energy and Economic Data Bank (EEDB) from the mainframe to the
PC environment has been accomplished. Following the completion of improvements to 
the EEDB - planned for the first half of 1995 - various PC application packages
from EEDB will become accessible through the LAN to Agency staff. An electronic 
version of the publications Reference Data Series No. 1, Energy, Electricity and 
Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2015, and Energy and Economic Tables, 
will be made available to Member States by early 1995.Also, an updated PC version 
of the Micro-EEDB package will be made available to Member States upon request in 1995.
<P>
Following a review of training needs, an International Working Group on Nuclear Power Plant
Personnel Training and Qualification (IWGT&Q) was established. The Group met during 1994 and adopted terms of reference and proposed
areas for further work, including a systematic approach to the training of nuclear power plant personnel, the use of simulators
for training and the importance of management involvement in and support for training for the safe, reliable and economic operation
of nuclear power plants.
<P>
The training and qualification of personnel continued to be emphasized as a key element in ensuring
the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants. A
preliminary draft was prepared, with extrabudgetary support from
the USA, of a technical document on the training and evaluation of
nuclear power plant personnel; this is a revision of an earlier
publication (IAEA-TECDOC-525) on the systematic approach to training. 
<P>
A major conference entitled The Nuclear Power Option was
held in September. A positive future for nuclear power was
foreseen. It was felt that the demand for more electricity would be
concentrated in areas of rapid economic and population growth. Many
countries recognized that there were environmental and public
health benefits to be gained from the use of nuclear power. The use
of a balanced mix of energy resources was generally considered to
be necessary to protect economies against delivery or price
disruptions in fuel supply. The consensus reached at the conference
was that nuclear power was not only a viable option, but the
preferred option in many countries, being a proven, economically
competitive and environmentally sound technology. However, the safe
and reliable operation of nuclear power plants, convincing
solutions for waste storage and disposal problems, and a regular
licensing process were considered to be pre-requisites for the
revival and expansion of this source of power. The reduction in
available qualified nuclear power plant staff was identified as an
area requiring attention. Government action, and a supportive
policy consistently applied, were also needed to achieve positive
public acceptance.

The PRIS database continued to be maintained
and updated. Information services were provided to Member States by
way of on-line access to PRIS and with the distribution of a subset
of the MicroPRIS databank to PC users. PRIS has also been
redesigned and migrated to the LAN environment with the objectives
of making it available on-line, improving the flexibility of data
entry, reducing the complexity of information retrieval, and making
it more user friendly. The system is already available in-house and
a group of trial users was established in Member States. Access to
external users in Member States will be available at the beginning
of 1995. Currently, there are 73 on-line users of the original
mainframe version in 29 Member States and 4 international
organizations, but this access will be discontinued in 1995 when
the new system becomes fully available to Member States.
Improvements are also being introduced by expanding the database to
include more information on plant site and characteristics.
<P>
Co-operation with WEC and UNIPEDE continued, with Agency
participation in the Committee on Performance of Thermal Plants,
and work also progressed on the promotion and harmonization of
internationally compatible terminology and definitions.
<P>
Work continued on the establishment of country nuclear profiles,
covering a country's energy and economic situation, forecast of
nuclear energy and main organizations and institutions playing a
role in the nuclear area. Information was provided by several
Member States, and the structure and contents of the profile were
designed; a database will be finalized in 1995.
<P>
A technical document on the analysis of the performance of WWER-440 units was
completed and is being prepared for publication.

<B><A NAME="A1.91">Nuclear power plant life management</B></A>
<P>
At a meeting of the International Working Group on Life Management of Nuclear Power Plants (IWG-LMNPP), national and international programmes on the subject of plant life management were discussed and recommendations developed on the priority, scope and content of publications and meetings to be organized by the Agency.

An Advisory Group meeting was convened in Vienna to review the final draft of a status report on
small and medium size reactors (SMRs). The purpose of this document
is to provide up to date information so that design approaches and
features of SMRs can be made more transparent, in particular with
respect to their simplicity and flexibility for various
applications, and the incorporation of passive safety systems. Part
of the report is addressed to policy makers who are planning to
evaluate SMRs, giving them an overview of the present status of SMR
development, and the requirements and preconditions that would make
their deployment beneficial.
<P>
An Advisory Group meeting on the technical feasibility and reliability of passive safety systems,
held in Juelich, Germany, provided a forum for discussing the present situation in this area. Passive systems and components have been deployed in present reactor designs
and some data on reliability, common mode failures and common cause failures should be available; the need for a joint effort to collect and validate
such data is under consideration in several countries. One conclusion from the meeting was that a mixture of passive and active systems would provide the best solution for safety issues, taking into consideration cost, reliability and safety.
<P>
The services of consultants were used for a meeting on the
feasibility of nuclear reactors with unattended operation. The aim was to decide on the scope and structure of the working programme for a
Technical Committee meeting on this subject that will take place in 1995. Since the number of reactor concepts designed for unattended operation is
quite small, it was concluded that the scope of the meeting should be expanded to include small reactor designs which feature a minimum of staff, or
have remote monitoring which contributes to the operational mode of these reactors. It was concluded that the review of applications of these reactors
in remote areas for many different purposes (e.g. heating, communication, power generation or desalination) could provide important feedback for
potential users. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.13">Water cooled reactors</B></A>
<P>
Within the framework of the International Working Group on Advanced Technologies for Water Cooled Reactors (IWGATWR), the
Agency organized a Technical Committee meeting and workshop in Moscow on comparison of advanced LWR design approaches. The meetings
provided an opportunity to discuss, review and compare different design approaches for advanced pressurized LWRs, with the objective of further
improving the common understanding of the respective rationales for selected design features. A further meeting was convened to summarize the
findings and recommend follow-up activities. 
<P>
The emergence of a large variety of advanced design concepts has prompted the use of different technical
terms. Since such inconsistencies may create confusion, the Agency initiated work on a draft document on the definitions of terms describing
features of advanced reactors. This draft, in the IAEA-TECDOC series, will be distributed to the International Working Groups on water cooled, gas
cooled and fast reactors, as well as to the International Fusion Research Council, for review and comments. A final version will be prepared in late
1995.
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting and workshop on a comparison of best estimate methods for judging the design margins of advanced water
cooled reactors were held in Lyon, France, to discuss the status and further needs forther development of best estimate methods, and specifically
to identify factors which determine key margins, to examine differences in licensing and best estimate approaches and to identify the means of reducing
the uncertainties of predicted margins. It was concluded that best estimate approaches can be used to significantly increase thermal margins and the
resulting increased margins can be used to enhance the economy and operating flexibility of a reactor. Much effort is required to develop and qualify
best estimate methods for licensing applications. 
<P>
The final Research Co-ordination meeting for a CRP to establish a thermo-physical properties
database for light and heavy water reactor materials was convened in Vienna. This CRP has been conducted within the framework of the International
Working Group on Advanced Technologies for Water Cooled Reactors. The CRP has collected, critically evaluated and systematised a
thermophysical properties database for materials of advanced water cooled reactor sunder normal operating, transient and accident conditions.
The materials for which the properties have been collected are fuel cladding, absorbers, steels, concrete, light and heavy water, hydrogen, xenon and
mixtures of inert gases. The important thermophysical properties, including thermal conductivity, thermaldiffusivity, specific heat capacity, enthalpy,
thermal expansion, oxidation of zirconium based alloys and characteristics of concrete core melt interaction, are presented in the database. A report is
currently being prepared for publication.
<P>
A CRP on thermohydraulic relationships for advanced water cooled reactors was approved. The main goal of
this CRP is to promote the exchange of information in establishing a consistent set of thermohydraulic relationships which are appropriate for use in
analysing the behaviour of advanced water cooled reactors. The overall programme will encompass the following main research areas: pressure
drop characteristics for single and two phase flow in forced and natural circulation situations; investigations of after heat removal from the reactor; critical heat flux (CHF) and post-CHF heat transfer; quenching/rewetting and boiling instability at the fuel bundle and subchannel levels; and the influence of non-condensable gases on heat transfer. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.14">Liquid metal cooled reactors</A></B>
<P>
At the 27th annual meeting of the International Working Group on Fast Reactors (IWGFR), held in Vienna,
reviews were made of the status of national fast reactor development programmes, topics for Technical Committee meetings to be organized in 1995,
CRPs currently in progress and preparations for an international topical meeting on fast reactor safety to be held in Obninsk, the Russian Federation. 
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on the evaluation of material coolant interaction and material movement and relocation in liquid metal fast reactors
(LMFRs) was held at the Oarai Engineering Centre in Japan to review recent progress
with regard to in-pile and out-of-pile experimental data (fuel and coolant interaction) and material movement and relocation for the entire spectrum of
core disruptive accidents postulated for sodium cooled fast reactors. One key objective of the meeting was to identify common trends in the
interpretation of the experiments and the influence on design features. A broad range of technical subjects was discussed, covering all aspects of
material motion and interactions relevant to the safety of LMFRs. Recent achievements and the current status of research and development in this
area were presented by Member States. The general consensus was that the future direction of safety research should also examine approaches that facilitate harmonization. 
<P>
A Research Co-ordination meeting for a CRP on intercomparison of LMFR seismic analysis codes was held at the Oarai
Engineering Centre in Japan to compare experimental and analytical results obtained by various organizations for the analysis of French Italian tests on Rapsodie, PEC (Prova Elementi di Combustible) and Monju make-ups to validate LMFR structural codes. A wide range of topics dealing with
the seismic behaviour of LMFR cores was discussed and it was concluded that more experimental data are needed. At present, it is very difficult to
perform an analysis of the whole core, given current limitations on computing power in some countries, but detailed core analyses are very important in ensuring reactor safety in the event of earthquakes.
<P>
Another Research Co-ordination meeting for a CRP on acoustic signal processing for the detection
of sodium boiling or the sodium/water reaction in LMFRs was held in Kalpakkam, India. The purpose of this meeting was to review the results
obtained,finalize the preparation of test data from experiments carried out on prototype fast breeder reactor steam generating units (SGUs) and make
recommendations for the future. The possibility of detecting leaks between 0.1 and 1 g/s in a few seconds was demonstrated. The completion of this
CRP in 1995 will lead to the development of a highly reliable diagnostic system for the safety surveillance of LMFR SGUs. 
<P>
A specialists meeting on the correlation between material properties and thermohydraulic conditions in LMFRs, held in Aix-en-Provence, France, focused on the thermo mechanical aspects of temperature fluctuations such as mixing jet phenomena, temperature gradient fluctuations and the transfer of fluctuations from the fluid to
the structure materials wall. One key objective of the meeting was to identify common trends in the interpretation of experimental and analytical work
and the influence on design codes. It was concluded that with respect to thermo-hydraulics, great advances have been made, but limited available
computer capacity prevents the calculation of fluid temperatures at all times at all important locations; however, capacity improvements are planned.
With regard to design codes, significant progress has been made, but the codes are still very restrictive in terms of allowable temperature amplitudes.
Experimental justification is needed to permit a reduction of the current safety factor of about 2.
<P>
At the annual meeting of the IWGFR, it was proposed that the transient characteristics of the BN-800 reactor be evaluated. A joint IAEA/EC benchmark exercise for a severe accident (an unprotected loss of flow (ULOF)) in a BN-800 reactor with a near zero void core was endorsed by all the participants and preparations for the exercise have been initiated. The main objective is twofold: (1) to establish a basis for evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of a BN-800 type reactor with a nearly zero void reactivity core design under hypothetical severe accident conditions, as far as an
energetic ULOF is concerned; and (2) to analyse the conditions which help to prevent prompt fuel and steelmelting in the improved fast reactor core
under ULOF type and other severe accident conditions. To this end, the Agency made use of the services of consultants to review the general
objectives and scope of the comparative calculations, agree upon the input data and establish a work plan for the first year of the exercise. The exercise should be concluded within two years, after which a final report will be prepared. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.15">Gas cooled reactors</B></A>
<P>
The Agencys CRPs on gas cooled reactor development focus on
technical areas which are predicted to provide advanced HTGRs with a high degree of safety, but which must be proven. These technical areas are:        
<UL>
<LI>The safe neutron physics behaviour of the reactor core,
<LI> Reliance on ceramic coated fuel particles to retain fission products even under extreme
accident conditions,    
<LI>The ability of the designs to dissipate decay heat by natural heat transport mechanisms. 
</UL>
<P>
A CRP in the field of HTGR applications is focused on the design and evaluation of 
heat utilization systems for the Japanese High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor
(HTTR), currently under construction at the Oarai Research Establishment of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute.
<P>
Research Co-ordination meetings were convened for each of these CRPs. Highlights include the progress made by the international team assembled at the PROTEUS critical experiment facility of the Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland,which has now completed investigations of six core configurations, and the selection of the first priority candidates of steam (and/or CO2) reforming of methane and gas turbine systems for demonstration at the HTTR.  
<P>
In order to improve the Agencys capability to perform fuel burn up calculations of graphite moderated, carbon dioxide cooled reactors, the core physics codes VSOP and ORIGEN-JUEL II have been installed on the Agencys mainframe computer and in the computer of the Agencys Department of Safeguards, in co-operation with the Nuclear Research Centre in Juelich, Germany.
Core burn up analyses for several graphite moderated reactors have been carried out. The computer codes can be
utilized to carry out burnup calculations and, after further code improvements have been introduced, in three dimensional geometry to
predict the isotopic composition of selected fuel elements. By means of these codes it is possible to describe the buildup and
decay of 100 heavy metal isotopes, 250 light elements and more than 800 fission products, including their nuclear properties.

At the regular session of the General Conference, Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/
RES/7, a Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically, was
adopted. This requested the Director General to continue
consultations with interested States, the relevant organizations of
the United Nations family and other relevant inter-national
organizations concerning the main conclusions of the report on the
Technical and Economic Evaluation of Potable Water Production
Through Desalination of Sea Water by Using Nuclear Energy and Other
Means. The Director General was further requested to undertake
similar consultations for the implementation of the main
recommendations of the Advisory Group on Demonstration Facilities.
<P>
To this end, the Agency has initiated an Options Identification
Programme to reduce the very broad range of possibilities to a much
more limited set of practical demonstration projects. The work will
be carried out by a working group which will define and perform the
activities necessary to identify and characterize a set of
practical demonstration options within a time frame of about two years.  
<P>
An Advisory Group meeting on technical and economic
development in seawater desalination by using nuclear energy was
held in Cairo, with the purpose of reviewing current and future
options for local participation in the planning, manufacturing,
construction, operation and maintenance of nuclear desalination
complexes using nuclear energy, both at the level of individual
countries and on a regional level. 
<P>
The accumulated experience in
the petrochemical industry, desalination and the nuclear field is
considerable and could contribute substantially to the goal of
maximum local participation. Potential user countries plan to study
this further by identifying the regional capabilities that could be
used in the planning, manufacturing, construction, operation and
maintenance of a nuclear demonstration facility. It was recommended
that a users group be set up to co-ordinate this and other related
activities. Depending on the technological lines chosen for the
nuclear power source and desalination method, a reasonable level of
local participation would be between 35 and 45%.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.18"> Transmutation of actinides</B></A>
<P>
A special scientific programme on the use of high energy accelerators for the
transmutation of actinides and power production was held in
conjunction with the 1994 regular session of the General
Conference. The scientific programme was organized to present
various technical options for the transmutation of actinides and
power production using high energy accelerators, and to discuss
their advantages and disadvantages, together with prospects for
their technical and economic viability. It was agreed that the
possible benefits of this new approach to radioactive waste
management warrant further investigation and support.
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on the feasibility of the transmutation of
actinides in advanced reactors was held in December as the first
step in preparing a status report on actinide transmutation in
advanced nuclear reactors in non-OECD/NEA countries. Its objective
was to review the status of research and development activities,
discuss relevant programmes on transmutation development and
provide input for the preparation of the status report. A follow-up
meeting will be held in 1995 to finalize the draft of the status
report, which is expected to be published by the end of 1995.
<P>
Another Technical Committee meeting on unconventional options for
plutonium disposition was held in November in Obninsk, the Russian
Federation, to review unconventional methods and approaches for the
elimination of stockpiles and the disposal of plutonium. It was
noted that plutonium can be efficiently and effectively consumed in
LMFRs, primarily by removing the uranium blanket. This capability
has already been demonstrated. The elimination of plutonium
stockpiles and disposal can be achieved in a MOX core by decreasing
the fuel volume fraction, increasing core leakage, or adding
neutron absorbing materials. In addition, it may be possible to
remove the plutonium producing isotope uranium-238 from the fuel,
replacing it with inert matrix carriers so that the net plutonium
consumption increases significantly. One of the conclusions was
that the conventional options (MOX fuel in LWRs, LMFRs and ATRs)
that are already used industrially are able to efficiently cope
with the disposal of separated plutonium stockpiles, provided that
the manufacturing capacity for MOX fuel is increased adequately.

A CRP on lifetime predictions for the first wall of fusion machines
was completed in 1994. The objective of this CRP was to compare
methods used in the various participating laboratories for
predicting the lifetime of first wall components and to compare
these analytical predictions with the results of experiments at the
Ispra Joint Research Centre of the EC. The results of the CRP have
shown that the design codes used for predicting the thermal cycling
lifetime of stainless steel first wall components are adequate and
conservative when compared with experimental results. A technical
document reporting on these results will be prepared in 1995.  
<P>
The 15th Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion
Research was held in Seville, Spain, in September-October. The
technical papers presented at this meeting indicated the steady
progress made in plasma science and fusion technology in the world,
both in magnetic and inertial fusion research.
<P>
A CRP on the development of plasma heating and diagnostic systems in institutes
in developing countries using middle and small scale plasma devices
has the aim of co-ordinating various types of experimental plasma
physics and fusion research programmes in developing countries. The
CRP includes research using tokamaks and alternative magnetic traps
on specific problems which could be resolved using the scientific
and technical potential of developing countries.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.21">Nuclear Fusion Journal</B></A>

<P>
In the nuclear fuel cycle area, the Agency continued to: assist
in the decision making process in Member States by furnishing
relevant information; provide help in ensuring the safety,
reliability and economic viability, and in minimizing the
environmental and health impacts, of nuclear fuel cycle facilities;
help meet the needs of Member States for the safe management of
spent fuel and plutonium; and assist the development in Member
States of fuel with improved performance.
<P>
Work continued on the compilation of information on uranium resources and production in
eastern European countries and countries of the former USSR. Newly
acquired information has been incorporated into Uranium 1993
Resources, Production and Demand (Red Book'), a joint publication
with the OECD/NEA.  
<P>
Planning started on organizing an advisory
service to be known as Uranium Production Safety Assessment Team.
This is intended to help in the safe operation of uranium mining
and ore processing through the technical exchange of experience and
practice. 
<P>
In the area of reactor fuel technology and performance,
the main effort was aimed at providing a forum for information
exchange under the umbrella of the International Working Group on
Fuel Performance and Technology.
<P>
Problems associated with the
increasing amounts of separated plutonium became of special
international concern. The Agency continued to collect and develop
a worldwide database on separated plutonium in civilian nuclear
programmes to determine the present world stockpile of civilian
plutonium and forecast its future evolution. Work was started on a
safety document for the handling and storage of plutonium.  
<P>
In the area of spent fuel management, developments in technology and
safety are of high priority and reflect urgent needs in Member
States. Three safety documents on the safe storage of spent fuel
from power reactors were published in 1994. The preparation of a
safety document on the safe handling of spent fuel from research
reactors was initiated. Implementation began of the Irradiated Fuel
Management Advisory Programme to assist and advise Member States on
spent fuel management from both power and research reactors. 
<P>
With regard to the handling and storage of spent fuel from research and
test reactors, the responses received to questionnaires sent to
research reactor operators were compiled into a spreadsheet. Of
great concern is the issue of materials ageing in fuel storage
facilities. This is being addressed under several activities, the
most important of which is a CRP on the corrosion of aluminium clad
research reactor fuels.
<P>
Under the subprogramme Information on the Nuclear Fuel Cycle, 
efforts continued on updating and formulating databases on the Nuclear Fuel
Cycle Information System (NFCIS) and the Actinides Database and Fuel Cycle Balance. 
The NFCIS database will be published in 1995.

World uranium production continued to decline, following a trend
that started in 1988. Uranium production in 1994 is estimated to
have been below 32 000 t, down slightly from the previous year's
production, which was 2000 t less than that estimated in The Annual
Report for 1993. The year 1988 also marked the beginning of growing
uranium imports from the former USSR. Six countries, namely
Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Niger, the Russian Federation and
Uzbekistan, produced over 66% of the world total. The 1994
worldwide reactor related requirements are estimated to be about 58
500 t U, which is about 26 500 t greater than world production. In
other words, only about 55% of the requirements is met by current
production.
<P>
While it is forecast that demilitarized HEU (high
enriched uranium) warheads, blended to LEU (low enriched uranium),
will meet some portion of reactor requirements, it is expected that
80% or more of the worldwide reactor requirements of 1 070 000 t U
over the period 1995-2010 will be met by uranium production.
<P>
Projected uranium demand worldwide for the period 1993-2010 is
derived from the expected development of nuclear electricity
generating capacity. It is estimated that the world capacity will
grow from 337.8 GW(e) in 1993 to about 446 GW(e) in 2010. This
results in the projected annual uranium requirements for the same
period increasing from 58 500 to 75 000 t. The corresponding
projection for the world uranium supply, however, is not available,
as the necessary information regarding the production capabilities
of important producers in Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and
Uzbekistan has not yet been made known. Considering only the former
WOCA (World Outside Centrally Planned Economies Areas), where such
information exists, uranium production capability by the year 2010
is estimated to be around 32 000 t. Part of the balance may be met
through production from the newly independent States of the former
USSR, from eastern Europe and China, where the total 1994
production was estimated at about 10 000 t U. Assuming a stable
production level in the latter group of countries, there will be
unfilled requirements of about 33 000 t that will have to be met
through the expansion of existing facilities and the development of
new production centres, as well as from LEU produced from HEU. The
contribution to supply from reprocessed uranium and mixed oxide
(MOX) fuel is expected to remain modest up to the year 2010. The
planned facilities for the use of reprocessed uranium and for
fabricating MOX fuel have an annual capacity that could provide a
maximum equivalent contribution of less than 5% (about 3 000 t U
equivalent) of the projected requirements of 75 000 t U.  
<P>
The new edition of the joint Agency and OECD/NEA report Uranium 1993
Resources, Production and Demand (Red Book) was published early in
1994, representing a shortening of the preparation time by nearly
one year over the previous edition. The Red Book was also issued in
a computer accessible electronic version. The 1993 edition had the
broadest coverage ever,  including reports from 50 countries, 7 of
which submitted reports for the first time.

The Agency co-operated in the preparation of the final report of the International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP)
Project 259, a Global Geochemical Database for Environmental and Resource Management, which was sponsored by the International Union
of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and UNESCO. This project was established to consider the methodology for quantitative assessment 
of the geochemical diversity of the Earth's land surface. The Agency contributed its expertise and data on the distribution of natural
radioelements obtained through uranium exploration.

Cadarache, France, reviewed the state-of-the-art in the area of
PIE, with special emphasis on recently developed techniques for
poolside and hot cell application. The presentations and
discussions focused on: non-destructive testing; the development of
analytical destructive methods for characterization of fuel and
cladding; mechanical testing; and refabrication techniques for
re-irradiation of fuel rods in reactors. Papers presented at this
meeting demonstrated the significant progress that has been made in
PIE and the continuing importance of co-operative approaches in
this field.

Special attention was given to the programmes on fuel safety, the
Agencys work in eastern European countries and collaboration with
other international organizations. 
<P>
The second Research Co-ordination meeting of a CRP on fuel modelling at extended burnup
(FUMEX) was held after a blind exercise was completed by the
participants. The exercise was carried out on six irradiated fuel
rods in the OECD/NEA Halden reactor. Nineteen computer codes were
involved. Since the previous CRP, carried out in 1984, much
progress has been made in hardware and software and in the
evaluation of the main fuel parameters. This CRP has shown that
modern codes can be run on state-of-the-art PCs. Despite the
complexity of the experimental cases chosen for this exercise, the
codes could handle the volume of data and required mathematical
convergence without difficulties. Most of the codes give a
reasonable estimate of fuel temperature in steady state conditions.
Some problems still remain with modelling of fission gas release,
particularly in the region of 1% release. For several codes there
is also a need for improvement in the modelling of transient
conditions, especially at high burnup.
<P>
A Technical Committee
meeting on water reactor fuel element modelling at high burnup and
experimental support was held in Windermere, the United Kingdom.
Significant advances in the subject have taken place in recent
years owing to progress in computer technology, computational
methods and the ability to measure fuel centreline temperatures at
the start of life and throughout irradiation to high burnup. Fuel
thermal conductivity degradation, fission gas release and modelling
improvement  were discussed.

of separated civilian plutonium crossed the 100 t level during the
early part of 1994. The data collected on projected separation and
rates of use for plutonium are being checked and refined.
<P>
The services of consultants were used to start the development of a
safety practices document for the handling and storage of separated

A Technical Committee meeting on unconventional options for plutonium
disposition was held at the Institute of Physics and Power
Engineering (IPPE) in Obninsk, the Russian Federation, in November.
The meeting considered unconventional approaches for plutonium
disposition, from the points of view of the fuel cycle and the fuel
type. A number of options were discussed, such as Th-Pu, U-Th and Pu
in non-fuel matrices to be used in high temperature gas cooled,
molten salt and other reactors. Evaluations were made of the
technical feasibility, licensing and timeliness aspects. It was
concluded that these options require considerable time and
resources for their development, demonstration and industrial
implementation.

A symposium entitled Safety and Engineering Aspects of Spent Fuel Storage  was organized jointly
with the OECD/NEA. The meeting provided an opportunity for an exchange of information on the state-of-the-art and prospects for
spent fuel storage, the worldwide situation and the major factors influencing national policies in this field and the directions that
national efforts and international co-operation in this area should take. The changes in nuclear policy across the world, together with
practical considerations, have made interim storage a necessity in the nuclear power industry.  This question is being addressed by
utilities, vendors and regulators. 
<P>
At an Advisory Group meeting on the development of transport and storage casks for spent fuel,
national programmes were reviewed and issues concerning
multipurpose casks were identified. It was reported that some
countries have chosen to develop storage casks with a requirement
for transportation. This approach reduces the amount of handling,
thus enhancing the safety of the system by reducing the
occupational radiation exposure and the potential for radioactive
contamination. 
<P>
A final draft was prepared of a Technical Reports
Series document on experience in the selection, design and
operation of away-from-reactor (AFR) storage facilities. The
document will provide information on examples of good practices and
general guidance on the type of criteria to be considered and the
processes to be undertaken during evaluation and selection of AFR
storage system designs. 
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting on remote
technology related to the handling, storage and/or disposal of
spent fuel, was organized in co-operation with Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, USA. It was noted that many operators
are becoming aware that remote technology is a cost effective
option for a wide range of operations. The previous hands-on option
is seen as more problematic; considerations such as regulatory
requirements and the cost and availability of radiation workers are
making this option less attractive. One of the reasons for the
major change has been the development of a new generation of remote
handling products, i.e. robots, manipulators, tools, sensors and
the associated software and hardware. These products are now easily
available and are inexpensive. Adaptation of proven industrial
robots to meet nuclear application requirements offers a
significant cost advantage over special new designs. 
<P>
At the request of the Ukrainian State Committee on Nuclear and Radiation
Safety, a team of experts visited the Ukraine to advise the
regulatory body on existing Agency and international requirements
for the interim storage of spent fuel. The experts provided up to

the participants to discuss their special problems and concerns
about spent fuel storage with experts from Member States who have
experience in the design, construction, licensing and day-to-day
operation of existing safe, reliable and interim storage
facilities, both wet and dry, for various types of research reactor
spent fuels. The results of the workshop consisted of the
identification of key areas of spent fuel storage technology in

to continue with the updating of  the NFCIS  database and to issue
it in electronic form.
<P>
Benchmarking of the nuclear fuel cycle
actinide database continued. The worldwide estimates of nuclear
spent fuels arisings, the quantities of actinides generated, fuel
fabrication and natural uranium requirements were compared with the
available data on actual inventories and requirements of the
nuclear fuel cycle. A delay in verification of the model occurred
because of poor availability of the actual data. The benchmarking
has shown that the error of estimate of nuclear materials is within
about 5%. The results of this work are being used for the
preparation of various Agency documents.

<P>
In response to a request by Member States for more international
guidance and co-ordination in the field of radioactive waste
management and in recognition of the need to assist some Member
States in improving their waste management programme
infrastructures, the Agency in 1994 focused on: the continued
implementation of the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS)
programme; the development of radiological and safety criteria for
waste disposal and the co-ordination of international radiological
and environmental assessment projects; and the implementation of
programmes for improving national infrastructures and the
development of mechanisms for better and more effective technology
transfer. Other areas receiving emphasis included direct advisory
and review services, guidance on the safety, technical and planning
aspects of decommissioning, quality assurance management for waste
packaging and disposal systems, safety assessment of near surface
disposal facilities and the environmental restoration of
contaminated land masses.
<P>
The RADWASS programme continued to be
one of the core efforts of the Agency's waste management programme.
In addition, RADWASS became a basic foundation for many of the
tasks and projects within other subprogrammes. The importance of
RADWASS to Member States was again reaffirmed during the 1994
regular session of the General Conference by a resolution which
requested the Agency to maintain emphasis in the field of
radioactive waste management. In addition, to better co-ordinate,
harmonize and facilitate consensus for key RADWASS documents, a
subgroup of the International Radioactive Waste Management Advisory
Committee (INWAC) was created to review all documents requiring
approval of the Board of Governors.
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the
regular session of the General Conference in September 1994, Member
States invited the Board of Governors and the Director General to
commence preparation for a convention on the safety of waste
management and begin the process of collecting relevant background
information (including appropriate RADWASS documents) that would be
useful in drafting the convention.  
<P>
With the changes in eastern
Europe and the countries of the former USSR, information has become
available revealing the existence of environmental problems.
Workshops were organized in 1994 to focus on detailed planning
methods and technologies available for the restoration of
contaminated sites.  
<P>
The Agency is the competent international body
on matters related to radioactivity to the Convention on the
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter (London Convention 1972). In 1994, the Agency was requested
to develop guidance on exemption in the context of disposal of
materials at sea. The disposal of radioactive wastes by dumping at
sea was banned by international agreement in February 1994. The
purpose of the Agency's work is to provide guidance on how to
define radioactive in the context of the London Convention.
<P>
A CRP on the validation of environmental model predictions (VAMP) was
completed. The objective of the VAMP studies, started in 1988, was
to provide a mechanism for the validation of assessment models by
using the environmental data on radionuclide transfer which have
resulted from the Chernobyl release. The project has resulted in
both technical and administrative achievements in the field of
model validation. 
<P>
Efforts are under way to upgrade waste
management programme infrastructures in Member States which
generate wastes primarily from nuclear applications. In addition,
development began of Minimum Acceptable Waste Infrastructure
criteria to be used for evaluating waste management programmes and
needs in developing Member States. Activities are co-ordinated
under an Agency model project on waste management and through
advisory missions.
<P>
The development of a report on in situ solidification processes aimed at converting contaminated soil and
sludges, currently stored in underground tanks, into a durable leach resistant product which will meet current
requirements for near surface waste disposal, was restarted in 1994 after temporary deferment in 1993 due to
budgetary constraints.
<P>
The first draft of a technical manual on the application of the Sealed Radiation Sources (SRS) Registry as a
tool for record keeping and information management was prepared in late 1994, after deferred funds from
1992 were released.
<P>
IAEA-MEL contributed to the International
Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP) by offering assistance in
analytical quality assurance, radioactivity monitoring, computer
based dispersion modelling, radiological assessment and database
provision. It participated in the 1994 Russian-Norwegian expedition
to the Arctic dump sites to sample and subsequently analyse water,
sediment and biota in the region. The first set of analyses of sea
water and sediment samples from a joint expedition to the Sea of
Japan was completed. The IAEA-MEL also continued its involvement in
the Agency's Emergency Response System and in an expanded
environmental monitoring programme in which waste effluents provide
useful isotopic signals in the marine and aquatic environment.
<P>
IAEA-MELs contribution to marine carbon flux studies was
acknowledged by its winning, along with collaborators in France, of
the 1994 Philip Morris Scientific Prize for Biogeochemistry.

radioactive wastes, providing straightforward and low cost
solutions to waste handling and processing problems. A second phase
of the programme was initiated during the year to determine areas
of applications not covered in the initial programme development.

<P>
During 1994, the focus of a project on environmental restoration in the countries of eastern
Europe and the former USSR was the identification and
characterization of radioactively contaminated sites. Before any
action in regard to environmental restoration could be taken, it
was necessary to obtain an overview of the environmental state in
each of the countries. The Agency therefore requested selected
Member State experts to survey and categorize the sites according
to location, volume, radioactive concentration, proximity to
populous areas and potential spreading of contamination. An
IAEA-TECDOC collecting the results of the project will be published
in 1995.

<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.50">Application of exemption principles to radioactive waste management</B></A>
<P>
Since the international consensus was reached on
principles for the exemption of radiation sources and practices
from regulatory control in 1988, published as Safety Series No. 89,
the principles have been used as a basis for developing practical
guidance for use in relation to radioactive waste management.
Various national and international studies concerned with deriving
clearance levels for very low level wastes and for the recycle and
reuse of materials from the nuclear fuel cycle have been published
since 1988. On the basis of all of these studies, international
guidance has been developed on clearance levels for radionuclides
in solid materials. These levels, termed 'unconditional clearance
levels', can be used as a basis for decision making when it is
desired to release materials containing very small amounts of
radionuclides from regulatory control. It is expected that the
levels will find use in relation to transboundary movements of
materials. For use in this application, there should be no further
need for concern after release no matter what the use or
destination of the materials might be and, therefore, the values
have been derived taking into account amounts of exposure in a wide
range of possible circumstances. After extensive review by expert
groups, a document on this subject, containing values derived
taking into account exposures in a wide range of possible
circumstances, has been approved for publication as RADWASS Safety
Guide No. 111-G-1.5. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.51"> Development of safety criteria for radioactive waste repositories</B></A>

The discussions of the INWAC Subgroup on
Principles and Criteria for Radioactive Waste Disposal on the
subject of appropriate indicators of safety for waste repositories
and of the nature of safety assessments at long time-scales, which
have taken place over the last three years, culminated in the
publication of a report (IAEA-TECDOC-767). It is expected that the
concepts and ideas contained in the report will be used in the
future development of RADWASS documents on the subject of
geological disposal. The Subgroup is continuing to discuss other
issues related to the safety of waste repositories, notably the
problem of complying with regulatory criteria at long times in the
future when predictive uncertainties become large.

The first test case of a CRP on the safety assessment of near surface disposal
facilities was completed and evaluated. A report on the test case,
in which the results of participants are presented, analysed and
discussed, has been prepared and approved for publication as an IAEA-TECDOC.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.53">Validation and assessment of radionuclide transfer models</B></A>
<P>
In 1988, the Agency started a CRP on the validation
of environmental model predictions (VAMP) with the following
objectives: to provide a mechanism for the validation of assessment
models by using the environmental data on radionuclide transfer
which resulted from the Chernobyl release; to acquire data from
affected countries for that purpose; and to produce reports on the
current status of environmental modelling and the improvements
achieved as a result of post-Chernobyl validation efforts. In
October 1994, the last meeting of the VAMP programme was held in
Vienna. At this meeting, the progress made and the achievements of
the programme were reviewed. The results of the VAMP study are in
the process of being documented in the IAEA-TECDOC series.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.54"> Environmental studies in relation to marine disposal</B></A>
<P>
The Agency is committed to presenting a report in 1996 on the potential
impact of the high level radioactive wastes dumped in the shallow
waters of the Kara Sea, and on the feasibility of possible remedial
measures, to the London Convention 1972. Progress was made on this
project in 1994, especially in obtaining a more detailed
understanding of the nature of the wastes and of the form of their
containment. It has been possible to postulate release rates of
radionuclides from the wastes into the surrounding water as a
function of time. The national modelling groups taking part in the
project are improving their ability to represent radionuclide
movement in the Kara and surrounding seas. The third joint
Norwegian-Russian cruise to the area in 1994 obtained useful data on
the wastes dumped in two of the bays. The measurements made during
the cruise confirmed that very little radioactivity has been
released to date from the dumped wastes. IAEA-MEL participated in
the third joint Russian-Norwegian exploratory cruise to the Kara Sea
to sample and subsequently analyse seawater and sediment samples.
It also organized analytical laboratory control exercises for the
participating Norwegian and Russian laboratories. Analyses of
samples from the 1993 cruise have shown that leakage from dumped
objects in the Stepovovo and Tsivolky Bays of Novaya Zemlya has
occurred, leading to contamination with 137Cs and 60Co of locally
restricted areas, but at radiologically insignificant levels. 
<P>
 A set of analyses was completed of seawater and sediment samples from
the first joint expedition (Japan, Republic of Korea and the
Russian Federation) to the Sea of Japan. The measured levels of
typical anthropogenic radionuclides in the marine environment
(239+240Pu for alpha emitters, 90Sr for beta emitters and 137Cs for
gamma emitters) represent the expected global fallout
concentrations.  
<P>
IAEA-MEL also participated in the cruise to sample
sea water and sediment around the sunken nuclear submarine
Komsomolets in the Norwegian Sea. The samples are presently under
investigation.
<P>

During 1994, two reports on intercomparison
exercises were completed. Sea water and fish were collected in the
Irish Sea for large scale intercomparison exercises. A specific
exercise was organized at the request of the French Commissariat  
l'energie atomique to analyse biological samples collected
around the Mururoa atoll. The Laboratory also continued
its association with the Helsinki Commissions Group of
Experts on Monitoring of Radioactive Substances in the
Baltic Sea and three specific intercomparison exercises
on sediment samples were completed.
<P>
A new technique based on liquid scintillation counting was established
for the analysis of soft beta emitters of 3H, 129I and
241Pu in the marine environment, while collaboration with
the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute has allowed
renovation and upgrading of the inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer used for multi-element and
radionuclide assays. 
<P>
IAEA-MEL analysed several samples in
the framework of the programme on environmental
monitoring for safeguards purposes and participated in
the intercomparison exercise for the analysis of
safeguards samples.
<P>
A final report of a CRP on sources
of radioactivity in the marine environment and their
relative contributions to overall dose assessment from
marine radioactivity was completed and for the first time
dose rates based on 137Cs and 210Po in sea water and fish
have been estimated for the world population. It has been
shown that the doses to humans from anthropogenic
radionuclides (137Cs) in the marine environment are
generally two to three orders of magnitude less than the
doses from natural radionuclides (210Po).   
<P>
In-service training in radionuclide measurements and radiotracer
applications in environmental studies continued to be a
major focus in IAEA-MELs activities. As a means of
hands-on training, IAEA Fellows from Colombia and Turkey
directly participated in laboratory experiments aimed at
assessing the behaviour of natural and artificial
radionuclides in corals and other benthic organisms. In
addition, Fellows from Mexico, France and Belgium, funded
by external sources, participated in similar research
projects dealing with laboratory radiotracer
applications.

As part of the International Joint Global
Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS), particle flux samples from
200 and 1000 m depths covering a period of 323 days were
obtained in the northwestern Mediterranean using sediment
traps moored in the deep sea.  These long term,
time-series samples were essential for quantifying
variations in carbon removal to the deep sea. 
<P>
In the Adriatic, four cruises were undertaken to examine the
flux of carbon and radionuclides in contrasting areas of
high and low sedimentation rates. Emphasis was placed on
the use of radioactive disequilibrium between particle
reactive 234Th and its soluble parent 238U to evaluate
the downward flux of particulate organic carbon produced
in the surface layers. Through the EC sponsored ELNA
programme, three stations in the northern Adriatic were
profiled for these natural radionuclides. Additional
sampling to test the 234Th scavenging model for carbon
export and the seasonal scavenging behaviour of 210Po and
210Pb by particles was carried out in the northwestern
Mediterranean under the French JGOFS programme DYFAMED.
<P>
Techniques were developed in the application of
multitracer gamma spectrometry for simultaneously
measuring the transfer of radionuclides and heavy metals
through key marine food chains. Laboratory experiments
utilizing these techniques have demonstrated that certain
bottom dwellers such as starfish and sea urchins
accumulate and strongly retain the key radionuclides
137Cs, 241Am and 60Co as well as several heavy metals.
These results are essential for developing radionuclide
food chain transfer models in the Arctic and other seas.
<P>
In collaboration with the European Oceanological
Observatory in Monaco, methodologies were developed to
culture coral in small microcosms in which multitracer
techniques were used to quantify the uptake and release
rates of radionuclides and trace elements in different
tropical coral colonies. Results showed a marked
preferential uptake and strong binding of certain
artificial radionuclides (such as 241Am) into coral
skeleton rather than in the living tissues, an
observation which suggests that dead corals may serve as
a sink for certain long lived radionuclides.
<P>
 To better evaluate the intake of the key natural radionuclide 210Po
by humans living in the Mediterranean basin, fresh
seafood samples of fish, shrimp, oysters, clams, mussels
and squid were collected and analysed for 210Po and its
parent 210Pb. The effect of cooking procedures on 210Po
and 210Pb concentrations in seafood was also examined, as
well as the natural radioactivity ingested with complete
meals of similar seafoods which were obtained
commercially.
<P>
Laboratory research continued on the
interaction and behaviour of 210Po and 210Pb in marine
biota and particulates. Work focused on measuring rates
of 210Po and 210Pb sorption by sedimenting particles and
on the influence of organic matter on the sorption
processes. In addition to various classes of non-living
detrital particles, the role of marine bacteria in 210Po
and 210Pb cycling was investigated.

<B><A NAME="A1.620"> Programme overview</B></A>
<P>
The programme on comparative assessment of nuclear power and
other energy sources seeks to incorporate health and
environmental aspects, as well as technical and economic factors,
into policy making for the power sector. While ensuring an
adequate supply of electricity is a prerequisite for social and
industrial development in many Member States, alleviating and
mitigating the impacts of human activities on health and the
environment have become worldwide objectives.
<P>
Work has progressed in the framework of the DECADES project on
databases and methodologies for the comparative assessment of
different energy sources for electricity generation. This project
is being carried out jointly by nine international organizations
(the Agency, EC, ESCAP, IIASA, OECD/NEA, OPEC, UNIDO, WMO and
the World Bank) under the supervision of a Joint Steering
Committee composed of representatives of all the participating
organizations. The Steering Committee has decided to continue the
DECADES project in 1995 and 1996 with the aim of enhancing the
tools developed and implemented in 1993 and 1994, and
disseminating the results through seminars, workshops and
training courses.
<P>
Preparation of an inventory of electricity generation
technologies was pursued under the guidance of experts from
Member States and international organizations participating in
DECADES. A user oriented database management system, the
Reference Technology Data-base (RTDB), was implemented. This
allows easy access to, and handling of, the information by a
broad range of users. Furthermore, the computer structure has
been released to Member States, upon request, for the
establishment of country specific databases which provide a
framework for storing data on electricity generation technologies
currently used and expected to be implemented in the country.
<P>
Integrated electricity system analysis software (DECPAC) was
developed for screening, assessing and comparing different system
expansion strategies, taking into account electricity generation
chain emissions and other burdens, as well as economic and
technical factors.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.62">Assessment of costs of nuclear and other energy systems</B></A>
<P>
Work continued on the collection and analysis of the costs of
nuclear power and other energy systems. In particular, the costs
of pollution abatement technologies were analysed in a series of
meetings and a preliminary assessment of their influence on the
competitiveness of nuclear power was carried out. Information
gathered through these activities was included in the RTDB.
<P>
Activities continued, in co-operation with the OECD/NEA, on
nuclear fuel cycle costs, operating and maintenance costs and the
economic aspects of nuclear power plant life management. A report
on nuclear fuel cycle costs was published by the OECD/NEA in
1994, and this organization will publish a report on nuclear operating and
maintenance costs in 1995.
<P>
In connection with the economic evaluation of potable water
production through desalination using nuclear energy, a regional
study for North Africa was completed. The study covers the
analysis of potable water demand in the region, identification of
sites for desalination plants and assessment of the economics of
nuclear power for potable water production.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.63"> Comparative assessment of the health and environment impact of nuclear power and other energy systems</B></A>
<P>
A Technical Committee meeting was held in Vienna in May to
explore the use of environmental indicators in the comparison of
environmental impacts from energy systems. The papers presented
at the meeting provided information on the establishment and use
of environmental indicators that are being incorporated into a
procedural guidelines document for conducting comparative
assessments.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.64"> IAEA/UNEP/UNIDO/WHO project on risk assessment</B></A>
<P>
In conjunction with the development of guidelines for integrated
risk assessment and management in large industrial areas, support
continued for case studies in North Bohemia, the Czech Republic,
and in Zagreb, Croatia. A new case study in Sosnovy Bor, the
Russian Federation, has also been initiated.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.65">Comparative assessment of the ecological impact and effect on climate change of nuclear and other energy systems</B></A>
<P>
The Agency participated in the plenary meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), held in
November, in Nairobi, during which the Special Report to the
Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate
Change was adopted. The Agency also participated in meetings of
the three IPCC Working Groups. A supporting document to the IPCC
Second Assessment Report on nuclear power as an option for
alleviating greenhouse gas emissions was prepared and will be
published in 1995.
<P>
The services of consultants were used to study 85Kr radiation
induced impacts on atmospheric ozone. On the basis of information
provided, it was concluded that atmospheric 85Kr concentration
levels do not significantly affect the tropospheric concentration
levels of ozone.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.66">Incorporation of comparative assessment in energy and electricity planning</B></A>
<P>
The Joint Steering Committee for the inter-agency DECADES project
on data-bases and methodologies for the comparative assessment of
different energy sources for electrical generation met twice to
review the progress of work and design a programme of activities
for 1995 and 1996. It is expected that the programme will focus
on clarifying the project results and disseminating them to
Member States and other international organizations.
<P>
Work has continued on the establishment of the RTDB, which
contains an inventory of technologies for electricity generation.
The services of consultants were used and a Technical Committee
meeting was held to collect data on technical and economic
parameters, and on emissions and residuals for technologies
currently used or under development at the different levels of
electricity generation chains. An operational version of the
computerized database (diskettes for use on PCs) was made
available and will be released to Member States, upon request, in
1995. A database management system, which supports the RTDB,
permits data access and display and offers capabilities for the
comparative assessment of different energy chains for electricity
generation. The computerized structure of RTDB is being used by
experts from several Member States to establish country specific
databases (CSDBs).
<P>
Electricity system analysis software, known as 'DECPAC Phase 1'
was developed for release in 1995. This software is an integrated
package for electricity system expansion planning, taking into
account economic and environmental factors, and is designed for
use on PCs, together with the RTDB or CSDBs.
<P>
A review of computer tools for the comparative assessment of
electricity generation options and strategies was carried out. A
report describing the main characteristics and assessment
capabilities of these tools will be published early in 1995.
<P>
Work has started, in co-operation with other international
organizations including the World Bank, on the preparation of a
reference book on economic, health, environmental and social
aspects of policy making for the power sector.

<P>
The food and agriculture programme operated jointly with FAO is
designed to assist Member States in using nuclear techniques in
their agricultural research and development in order to improve the
quantity and quality of food and fibre produced. This implies,
among other things, optimizing the use of scarce resources for
agricultural production while at the same time protecting the
environment.  
<P>
Progress was made in increasing the effective use of
irrigation water by wheat, maize and cotton by identifying growth
stages of these crops that are more resistant to drought, the
amount of irrigation water required being reduced by omitting or
reducing irrigation during the resistant stages. In a new CRP, the
use of the 15N isotope gave rise to useful data on nitrogen
dynamics under irrigated wheat. These data will be included in
CERES wheat model simulations with the aim of producing
recommendations to reduce pollution of groundwater by nitrogenous
fertilizers. Also, genotypes of legumes with a high capability for
nitrogen fixation and yield were identified. Through breeding,
genotypes with the two traits were developed. 
<P>
Because of a lack of staff and financial difficulties, the initiation of a CRP on the
use of nuclear techniques to improve crop production in highly acid
soils was postponed until further notice.
<P>
Genetic improvements in both quality and quantity of grain through induced mutations were
made in sorghum and African rice in Mali. These achievements have
resulted in a major programme leading to the release of promising
mutants to farmers. Progress was also made in the genetic
improvement of root and tuber crops by establishing procedures for
combining the use of induced mutations and in vitro techniques.
<P>
Isotopes continued to play a useful role as a tool in the Agency's
programme for tackling animal nutrition and health problems. A new
radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique for measuring progesterone in milk
was developed. This new technique requires that materials other
than progesterone antibody are prepared or purchased locally in
Member States, thus ensuring a greater degree of self reliance and
therefore sustained use of RIA technology. From the results of
field trials conducted in collaboration with the International
Office of Epizootics (OIE) and WHO, the indirect enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was designated as a
prescribed test for Brucella abortus in cattle by the OIE Standards
Commission. 
<P>
Over 2000 RIA kits for the measurement of the
reproductive hormone progesterone were used in over 200 000
individual animal tests in about 50 Member States, and ELISA kits
sufficient for 0.7 million individual animal tests in about 60
Member States were distributed for diagnosing diseases such as
rinderpest, brucellosis, trypanosomiasis and enzootic bovine
leukosis.
<P>
Major progress was made in the eradication of the
Mediterranean fruit fly in the province of Mendoza in Argentina.
Fruit fly populations were reduced to 99% of the original level.
Commercial fruit crops are already free of the pest and in the
future eradication will be carried out in urban areas. The
robustness of the Vienna 42 genetic sexing strain of the
Mediterranean fruit fly was widely demonstrated. Work on
eradication of the tsetse fly in Zanzibar, United Republic of
Tanzania, progressed well. Fly monitoring following aerial release
for a period of four months indicated that over one fourth of the
wild tsetse females showed signs of induced sterility.
<P>
CRPs were initiated to address the development of advanced attractant systems
and mass rearing automation. Progress was made in automating the
sexing of tsetse fly adults on the basis of visual imaging.
<P>
Pursuant to Agenda 21 of UNCED 1992, emphasis continued to be
placed on assisting Member States to establish nuclear and related
analytical techniques with which to monitor the quality of
pesticide products on the market and levels of pesticide residues
in food, soil, water and wildlife. Quality assurance measures were
also introduced. The results of a study on the effect of methods of
extraction and refining on insecticide residue levels in vegetable
oils showed that different procedures do not reduce residues of all
insecticides equally. It is thus possible for the farmer to select
compounds which are effectively removed by the particular process
used locally.
<P>
A significant milestone was the publication of
English and Russian editions of Guidelines for Agricultural
Countermeasures Following an Accidental Release of Radionuclides,
which draws largely on information gathered following the Chernobyl
accident.
<P>
Through a CRP, five methods for the detection of
irradiated food were developed and tested in various countries. A
feasibility study conducted in 1993 led to the decision by China
and Mexico to build semi-commercial and commercial irradiation
facilities, respectively. Several developing countries have
introduced large quantities of irradiated food in their domestic
markets.

A regional CRP for Asia and the Pacific is using 15N isotopic
techniques to measure the nitrogen fixed in different lines,
cultivars and mutants of chickpea, cowpea, groundnut, mungbean and
soybean. The aim is to identify superior plants and management
conditions, e.g., Rhizobium inoculation that will give higher
nitrogen fixation and grain yield. Plant breeding is also being
used as a tool to combine the desirable genetic traits of high
nitrogen fixation and high yield. Recently, attempts have been made
to quantify the benefits of including high nitrogen fixing legumes
into cropping systems, and the results so far have demonstrated
around 20-30% cereal grain yields in legume-cereal rotations versus
cereal-cereal rotations. Mixed cropping of legumes and cereals also
resulted in an increased capability of grain legumes to fix N2.

Through a CRP on the optimization of N2 fixation by tree crops for
enhancing soil fertility and soil conservation, studies are being
made of the use of the 15N methodology for investigation nitrogen
fixing tress (NFTs) with a high capacity for biological nitrogen
fixation (BNF), management practices that enhance BNF in NFTs and
also the use of the 15N isotope dilution technique for measuring
the release of N from decomposing litter of multipurpose trees.
Wide differences in the BNF capacities of different NFTs and among
different provenances or isolines within the same NFT have been
observed; also the litter of some tree species has been found to
decompose faster than others. This has important implications on
differences in nutrient release for uptake be food crops grown
together with these NFTs, and also, on organic matter buildup which
is crucial for maintaining overall soil fertility and increasing
water retention in soil.

<P>
A CRP on increasing and stabilizing
plant productivity in low phosphate soils in the semi-arid and
subhumid tropics and subtropics involved the search for genotypes
of food crops and trees which are highly efficient in the use of
limited supplies of water and phosphorus. Several genotypes of
wheat tested in Morocco and Tunisia were found to be more efficient
in water use than others, but only two of these, Massa and Sarif,
showed the combined features of high water use efficiency and high
yield. In Sierra Leone, significant genotype variation in phosphate
use efficiency was discovered in the cowpea genotypes tested.  Two
genotypes exhibited both high phosphate use efficiency and high
grain yield. In Kenya, field studies with tree species showed that
from the 21 tree provenances tested, a Prosopis from Costa Rica and
a Casuarina from Senegal emerged as best with respect to
adaptability to phosphorous deficient soils. In the Sudan, studies
with the gum arabic tree Acacia senegal revealed that three
provenances were superior to the other eleven tested in their
ability to survive and produce sufficient biomass in water limited
environments such as those prevailing in the gum-belt region.
Detailed studies with selected genotypes indicate that the root
system plays a significant role in making some genotypes more
efficient than others in their ability to take up and use of both
water and phosphorous.
<P>
A symposium on nuclear and related techniques in soil-plant studies in sustainable agriculture and 
environmental preservation was held in October. The symposium assessed the progress made in the use of 
nuclear techniques for studying various aspects of soil fertility and plant nutrition, environmental 
preservation and the potential and limitations of existing methods. The proceedings contain reports of 
original work and comprehensive reviews of nuclear techniques for studies on fertilizer and water use by 
plants, biological nitrogen fixation, organic matter turnover and erosion. Highlights include the new 
dimensions in organic matter turnover studies through the integaration of 13C in stugies where traditionally 
only 15N and 14C have been used, and the recently developed marker gene technology which has greatly 
facilitated studies on the ecology of soil microorganisms such as rhizobia.

<P>
A CRP on the assessment of irrigation
schedules of field crops to increase the effective use of water in
irrigation projects has identified growth stages of maize, wheat
and cotton that are most resistant to drought. These stages were:
the vegetative stage in maize (in contrast to the flowering stage),
the tillering and ripening stages in wheat (as against the stem
extension and heading growth stages), and the ball formation stage
of cotton (in contrast to the vegetative stage). Thus by reserving
the water, which otherwise would have been applied unnecessarily
during the more drought resistant stages, optimum crop growth and
yield can still be obtained with minimum irrigation water
requirements.

A CRP on the use of nuclear techniques to improve crop production on salt-affected soils was completed 
and an IAEA-TECDOC will be published in 1995. The results showed that a wide genetic variability exists 
for salt tolerance in all crop and tree species. Millet and sorghum grown in salt affected soils showed a 
significant decrease in both salinity and sodicity, while the growth of barley, rice (variety Bastani 370) and 
<I>Sesbania aculeata</I> and Kallar grass ameliorated salt affected soils.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.74"> Laboratory activities</B></A>
<P>
Isotopic studies at the Agency's Laboratory of Seibersdorf contributed to the development
and transfer of nuclear technology in soil science and plant
productivity in support of the various CRPs. These techniques were
used in various ways to optimize the use of soil resources
(nutrient and water) for increasing crop productivity and
minimizing the impact of the excess use of fertilizer on the
environment.
<P>
The primary role of the Laboratory is to provide support in terms of R&D, training, analytical and other 
services. Approximately thirty field, greenhouse and laboratory experiments
were conducted in 1994.
<P>
The Laboratory provided 47 person-months
of training to 19 fellows on the use of isotope and related nuclear
techniques in soil/plant studies and isotope analysis. Analytical
services, mainly nitrogen isotopic ratio determinations of
approximately 12 500 plant and soil samples, were provided for the
implementation of CRPs and technical co-operation projects.

was held in October in Guatemala. This recently started programme
will build on results and experience from the regional technical
assistance given to most of the participants. Areas of research and
strategies were discussed for crops such as rice, wheat, barley,
quinoa, banana, sugarcane, chrysanthemum, citrus and grape.
Advanced plant material and putative mutants will be further

<B><A NAME="A1.77">Genetic improvement of basic food crops in Africa</B></A>
<P>
Promising results were achieved in technical co-operation projects
and the CRP on the genetic improvement of basic food crops in
Africa through plant breeding, including the use of induced
mutations. In Mali, several improved mutants of the local varieties
of sorghum and African rice (Oryza glaberrima) were obtained by
gamma irradiation. The mutants of sorghum have short height,
improved grain quality and increased drought tolerance. Two mutants
have light orange coloured, vitreous grain, which is preferred by
the local people for cooking. Seeds were made available to local
farmers, but without any official performance tests and there is
insufficient certified seed for carrying out subsequent
multilocation field trials. It is now proposed to test the selected
mutants in multiplication trials, officially release them as
variety(ies) and subsequently multiply seed for distribution to the
growers. The mutants of African rice have white grains instead of
the red kernel of the parental variety and one of them is much
earlier in maturity. The white grain rice sells at a premium price
over the red grain types. Overall performance and consumer
acceptance will have to be tested further before they can be
considered for official release as varieties.

mutation induction and screening, and problems related to
chimerisms and ploidy level of variants must be overcome.
Furthermore, it was recognized that more effort is required for
research in the use of cell and protoplast cultures for mutation

conditions was held in April. The main objective of this CRP is
develop in vitro procedures for irradiation of plant tissues and
cells and rapid isolation and multiplication of mutants suitable
for adverse environmental conditions such as salinity, drought,
high temperature, cold, flooding and aluminium toxicity. The
interest of the participants covers topics such as tolerance to
water-logging in sugarcane (Bangladesh), tolerance to frost
(Colombia) and salinity (Egypt and Pakistan), high temperature and
late blight (India) in potato, drought tolerance and resistance to
African Cassava Mosaic Virus in cassava (Kenya), tolerance to acid
soils and fusarium wilt in banana (Malaysia), and drought tolerance
and Moko disease resistance in plantain (Guyana). The development
of in vitro selection for salinity and characterization of the
cloned gene functions in alfalfa (USA) was presented.

The R&D activities of the Agencys Laboratory at Seibersdorf focused on
mutation induction to create genetic variation with minimal plant
injury and to increase the overall efficiency of this system in
plant breeding with special emphasis on crops such as banana,
plantains, cassava and rice, which are of importance to developing
countries. In vitro micropropagation is routinely applied to build
up appropriate plant populations for mutation induction. However,
mutagenic treatment of complex multicellular systems will always
give rise to the problem of causing chimeras. Somatic embryogenesis
and other tissue culture techniques are under investigation to
prevent this problem from occurring. Genetic markers, i.e. rapid
amplified polymorphic ONA and DNA fingerprinting, are used to
detect genetic diversity in putative mutants. Molecular biology
techniques are explored and evaluated for their usefulness in
mutation breeding for developing early screening techniques for the
determination of mutant genotypes with more resistance to pathogens
and environmental stress.
<P>
In rice breeding, studies focused on
three approaches for in vivo and in vitro mutation breeding, i.e.
irradiated anther culture, somatic embryo culture from irradiated
roots and induction of multiple shoots from irradiated seeds. The
work resulted in an increased efficiency in haploid plant
regeneration from anther culture after cold pre-treatment and
anther incubation, as well as in the development of an improved
technology to re-establish the original diploid level. A high
number of mutants was observed and selected for traits such as stem
height, maturity period, plant shape, panicle size and grain size.
Progenies of these materials are currently under field evaluation
for genetic confirmation. Somatic embryos were obtained from root
culture segments and plants derived from somatic embryos were
transplanted in pots and the seed collected for evaluation of
genetic variation in the M2 generation.
<P>
Somatic embryogenesis was
induced in recalcitrant African cassava clones. The clone with the
highest regeneration capability was chosen for radiosensitivity
tests. Somatic embryos were irradiated at doses between 2 and 60
Gy. Doses lower than 15 Gy had no significant influence over
cassava regeneration. Mixoploidy was induced to study chimera
behaviour and the number of in vitro subcultures needed for
establishment of solid mutants.  
<P>
The Laboratory continued to
provide training on appropriate technologies to solve specific
problems in the field of plant mutation breeding. Local cultivars
of different species were brought by scientists from developing
countries to the Seibersdorf Laboratories and used for experimental
work. Protocols and techniques arising from this collaboration were
directly applied in national breeding programmes.  
<P>
The Laboratory also continued to provide services in the mutagen treatment of
seeds, organs and tissue culture in support of mutation breeding
activities in Member States. The services included the
establishment of optimal doses and bulk irradiation of plant
material for both practical breeding and basic research in plant
genetics.

of ruminant livestock in developing countries</B></A>
<P>
Under an interregional CRP involving animal
production research institutes in Asia and Latin America,
measurements of progesterone by RIA and of nutritional metabolites
by colorimetric methods are being used to assess the reproductive
and nutritional status of dairy cattle kept by smallholder farmers.
At present, these measurements are being used along with basic
productivity parameters to identify management and nutritional
constraints to milk production. Later, participants will
investigate simple, low-cost interventions based on locally
available feed resources for improving milk production as well as
monitor the sustainability of these interventions. 
<P>
Over the past ten years, counterpart laboratories have been provided with a
standardized RIA kit for measuring progesterone, based on a coated
tube, non-extraction method. In order to ensure the sustained use
of RIA technology, a greater degree of self-reliance in the
preparation of RIA components by counterparts is important. Thus,
a so called self-coating RIA method for progesterone determination
in milk has been developed at the Agency's Laboratories and in
future bulk quantities of progesterone antibody will be supplied by
the Agency and the remaining materials (125I labelled progesterone,
tubes, buffers and standards) will be either purchased directly or
prepared locally by the end user.This approach has been field
tested in several counterpart laboratories and technology transfer
will be carried out in a controlled manner to selected laboratories
during the forthcoming year.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.84">Validation and use of immunoassay tests for the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis in 
African livestock</B></A>
<P>
A CRP was initiated to use immunoassays developed jointly by ILRAD in Kenya and the Agency's
laboratory at Seibersdorf to monitor tsetse and trypanosomiasis
control programmes in 14 African countries. These tests are much
more sensitive and specific than conventional parasitological
methods to detect trypanosomiasis in cattle blood and can therefore
provide a more accurate indication of the progress of control
programmes based on drugs or insecticides. These tests are also
being used to monitor the effectiveness of the SIT project being
conducted on Zanzibar.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.85">Validation and international standardization of immunoassay test kits for the 
diagnosis and surveillance of selected bacterial and parasitic diseases of livestock in developing 
countries</B></A>
<P>
The FAO/IAEA Central Laboratory continued to develop standardized ELISA based approaches for the 
diagnosis of animal diseases. Of particular importance was a field trial
conducted in collaboration with OIE and WHO to evaluate an indirect
ELISA for the detection of antibodies to Brucella abortus in
cattle. As a result of the trial, the OIE Standards Commission
agreed that this test was now sufficiently validated to be
designated as a prescribed test for B. abortus in cattle. This
means that the test can be used for the diagnosis of bovine
brucellosis for the purposes of international trade.     
<P>
An external quality assurance system was developed for recognizing the
diagnostic competence of national testing laboratories for
particular diseases. Laboratories using FAO/IAEA immunoassay kits
will henceforth be required to test a number of blind samples twice
a year. This approach should assist developing countries in
overcoming livestock trade restrictions arising from the suspected
presence of diseases in the exporting country.    
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.86">Laboratory activities</B></A>
<P>
In 1994, the Central Laboratory provided over 2000 RIA kits for the measurement
of the reproductive hormone progesterone to counterpart
laboratories in approximately 50 Member States, representing over
200 000 individual animal tests. 
<P>
In addition, the Laboratory provided clinical chemistry kits for the measurement of nutritional
metabolites and trace minerals to 16 countries in support of a CRP
on feeding strategies for milk producing livestock. Approximately
80 kits for the measurement of total serum protein, serum albumin,
blood urea/nitrogen, -hydroxy butyrate and inorganic phosphorus
were shipped from Seibersdorf, together with detailed manuals and
controls and standards. 
<P>
The Laboratory continued its support of
animal health programmes through the provision of FAO/IAEA enzyme
immunoassay (ELISA) kits to counterpart laboratories in about 60
Member States. These kits and their reagents and protocols have
been standardized in collaboration with major veterinary research
centres throughout the world. In 1994, kits sufficient for 0.7
million individual animal tests for diagnosing diseases such as
rinderpest, brucellosis, trypanosomiasis and enzootic bovine
leukosis were distributed.

<P>
Major progress was made in the eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly in the Province of
Mendoza in Argentina. In collaboration with the provincial and
federal governments, all activities of the sterile insect technique
(SIT) programme were scaled up and 200 million sterile flies are
now being released weekly covering the 500 hectares of orchards
and urban areas of the province. Commercial fruit crops are already
free of the pest and eradication in urban areas will be attempted
in the season 1995-1996. A quarantine barrier with ten inspection
stations along all passes over the Rio Colorado has been
established, so that preparatory activities for a similar SIT
eradication programme in the Patagonia provinces can be initiated.
<P>
The Mediterranean fruit fly mass rearing facility in Arica, Chile,
also started operation in 1994. At present, preventive sterile fly
releases are being made along the northern border, to intercept
wild flies moving in from southern Peru. Another programme was
initiated in Madeira, Portugal, with the objective of using the SIT
against the Mediterranean fruit fly, the only fruit fly on the
island. The sterile fly mass rearing facility has been designed and
construction will be initiated in early 1995.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.89"> Improved economy and reliability of the sterile insect technique for use against 
tsetse fly vectors of animal trypanosomiasis</B></A>
<P>
The tsetse fly SIT eradication programme on Zanzibar, Tanzania, made rapid progress.
For the first time, sterile tsetse flies were released by air.
According to schedule, the entire southern part of the island,
including the Jozani and Muyuni forests where the highest tsetse
populations are located, is now under aerial sterile fly releases.
Sterile flies are being reared at the facility in Tanga, United
Republic of Tanzania, in addition to those produced at the
Seibersdorf Laboratories. The first phase of the refurbishment of
the Tanga facility is completed, thereby increasing significantly
the sterile fly production capacity. Fly monitoring indicates that
already one fourth to one third of all wild tsetse females captured
in the entire southern part of the island show signs of induced
sterility. With increasing fly production, the aerial release of
sterile flies will be extended progressively to the northern half
of the island.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.90">Laboratory activities</B></A>
<P>
Under a recently completed CRP,  progress was made in the development of
genetic sexing strains for field application in SIT programmes. A
critical aspect in this relates to the mass rearing characteristics
of the temperature sensitive strain, Vienna-42. In support of a
technical co-operation project in Tunisia, approximately one
million sterile male medflies from the above strain were supplied
weekly for field release. During this large scale rearing and
shipping exercise many quality parameters of the strain were
checked. These included strain stability, male production, shipping
effects and field performance; in no case was the Vienna-42 strain
inferior to a pupal colour sexing strain that was also produced and
shipped under the same conditions. On the basis of these results
and previous field tests with the strain, there is now confidence
that Vienna-42 demonstrates the necessary robustness to play an
important role in large scale SIT programmes for the eradication of
the medfly. The strain was recently supplied, upon request, to the
fruit fly mass rearing factories in Hawaii and Guatemala.
<P>
Further advances in genetic sexing technology will arise from
research being conducted at the Agencys Laboratories Seibersdorf
and through a CRP in the area of molecular biology, specifically in
the analysis of male determining genetic elements. It has now been
clearly demonstrated in the medfly that the element responsible for
maleness can be localized to a very small part of the Y chromosome.
This provides the basis for attempts to clone the gene, which are
at present under way.  
<P>
The Laboratory has also initiated research into a fine grained analysis of medfly mating behaviour using 
video analysis. Although mating is the critical behavioural component
required for the SIT, very little is known about it in the medfly
and, more importantly, no information is available on strain and
geographic variation. This research aims at improving quality
control procedures for mass reared medflies. 
<P>
 The use of radiation as a quarantine methodology for fruit flies is gaining greater
acceptance; its major drawback is that it does not always kill the
insect immediately and quarantine inspectors cannot identify if an
insect has been irradiated or not. A simple colorimetric test has
now been developed in the Entomology Unit on the basis of the
enzyme phenoloxidase. The test is simple and cheap and is now
suitable for larger scale testing.
<P>
Work in the tsetse group has been dominated by support to the project for the eradication of
Glossina austeni from Zanzibar using the SIT. This has resulted in
a continued expansion of the G. austeni colony at Seibersdorf in
order to supply the project with sufficient flies both for field
release and to build up the breeding colony at the Tanga insectary
in the United Republic of Tanzania. In the first months of the
year, almost 200 000 breeding females were being maintained in
Seibersdorf and approximately 150 000 pupae were being shipped
every month to Tanga. 
<P>
 A critical factor to enable any laboratory to produce good quality tsetse flies is a guaranteed supply of high
quality blood. In-house technology and expertise was utilized to
supply 1000 litres of irradiated frozen bovine blood to the
laboratory in Tanga in 1994. Progress has been made, in
collaboration with the Technical University of Vienna, in
automating the sexing of tsetse adults on the basis of visual imaging.

<H3><A NAME="A1.91">AGROCHEMICALS AND RESIDUES</H3></A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.92">Monitoring pesticide residues in food and the environment</B></A>
<P>
A CRP completed in 1994 evaluated a variety of methods
for extracting and refining vegetable oils with regard to their
effectiveness in removing pesticide residues. Over 20 methods from
12 countries were examined, involving soybean, cottonseed,
rapeseed, sunflower, palm, olive and coconut. In general, steam
deodorization was effective for removing organochlorine residues
while alkali treatment was effective for organophosphorus compounds
but other processes also removed particular compounds. 	
<P>
 Work on the effects of organochlorine insecticides on flora and fauna in
Africa, which uses lindane as the model compound, confirmed the
1993 observations that the numbers of soil living insects are
usually reduced for about two months following application. An
improved methodology allowed the numbers of aerial insects to be
recorded and these showed no effects from the insecticide. Organic
matter breakdown in the soil was reduced at some but not all sites.
Lindane reduced damage by maize stem borers in almost all cases but
this was not well correlated with crop yield. An important element
of this programme is to adapt methods usually developed in
temperate countries for use under African conditions. 	
<P>
A companion programme for Central America (where climate, crops and pesticide
use are very different from those in Africa) was started; this will
be closely integrated with the Programme on Environment and Health
in the Central American Isthmus (MASICA). Considerable attention
will be paid to pesticides in water resources.  
<P>
The first results from a CRP comparing immunochemical with conventional methods for
pesticide residue analysis were produced. Despite considerable
interlaboratory variation, there was an encouraging similarity in
values obtained for the insecticide dieldrin in soil samples. There
were, however, indications that some soil and water samples
contained components that interfere with the immunochemical response.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.93">Development of controlled release and other formulations of pesticides using

<P>
Results for both wet and dry seasons were reported for
studies of the effects of additives on the uptake and activity of
herbicide glyphosate in the commercial formulation using 14C
labelled material as a tracer. Additional surfactants generally
improved glyphosate performance on the sedge Cyperus rotundus
(purple nutsedge), which is generally acknowledged to be the world's
worst weed. However, the most effective treatment varied from
country to country and results for the wet season were different
from those in the dry season. Once the reasons for the variability
are understood the prospects for a substantial improvement in the
control of this weed are good. 	 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.94">Laboratory activities</B></A>
<P>
The Agencys Laboratory Seibersdorf was heavily involved with a number of CRPs,
particularly those concerned with the ecological effects of
insecticides in Africa and Central America and the use of nuclear
and immunochemical methods of analysis. Analytical quality
assurance services were provided for several CRPs and some
technical co-operation projects. 	
<P>
Field and laboratory tests of insecticides applied to tsetse fly targets as aqueous formulations
have indicated that the use of high concentrations does not
significantly improve the efficacy of the targets, indicating that
the insecticide degrades quickly regardless of the concentration.
However, the use of oil formulations of the insecticides with an
added ultraviolet absorber compound enhances the environmental
stability and toxicity to the flies. This technique was found to
work with the organopyrethroid insecticides including permethrin,
a relatively inexpensive, but also environmentally less stable,
insecticide.

The mandate of the International Consultative
Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI) was extended for another five
years, i.e. until May 1999. China, Croatia, and the Republic of
Korea became members of ICGFI, bringing the total membership to 42.
The principles and guidelines developed by ICGFI, especially in the

irradiated food and their reliability has been confirmed through
a series of collaborative trials.

<B><A NAME="A1.98">Demonstration of technoeconomic feasibility of food irradiation in developing 
countries</B></A>
<P>
As a result of a feasibility study conducted in 1993, three companies in Mexico
have decided to build commercial food irradiation facilities to
process food items for both domestic and export markets. China is
building a semi-commercial irradiator in Beijing to process rice,
garlic, spices and other food items with some input from the
Agency. Feasibility studies conducted in Brazil and the Islamic
Republic of Iran during 1994 showed positive results. Several
developing countries, including Bangladesh, Chile, China,
Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Thailand, have
introduced larger quantities of irradiated food into their domestic
market.

<B><A NAME="A1.99">Use of irradiation in combination with other food processes</B></A>
<P>
With the global phasing out of methyl bromide, the most
widely used fumigant for food and agricultural products, by the
year 2000, much larger quantities of irradiated food in both
advanced and developing countries are expected to be processed by
irradiation in the near future.   Through consultants services,
data have been compiled on the wholesomeness of food treated by
irradiation in combination with other food processes (at doses
above 10 kGy). The data will be made available for evaluation by
the Joint FAO/IAEA/WHO Expert Committee on the Wholesomeness of
Irradiated Food following a recommendation of the ICGFI in 1995.

The Action Plan for Food Irradiation Activities with Technical

the Board of Governors. This Action Plan will be implemented in
addition to on-going technical co-operation projects and will
include pre-project missions, economic feasibility studies and
resource requirements. A four-year project on improving safety and
quality of food and food ingredients in trade by irradiation has
been agreed by FAO, IAEA, WHO and the International Trade Centre
for joint implementation in 1995. The first phase of the project
will deal exclusively with promoting international trade in
irradiated spices and dried vegetable seasonings and will address
problems related to: quality maintenance and safety in spice
producing/exporting countries; a marketing/information campaign
in spice importing/consuming countries; and feasibility studies on irradiation as a means of decontaminating 
spices.

<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.102">Programme overview</B></A>
<P>
The Agency's programme on human health for 1994 continued to focus
on initiatives launched in 1991. However, there has been a gradual
transition from a technically oriented programme to one that is
medically guided, where the major objective is not the simple
transfer of technology but the effort to make it readily available
to effectively solve clinical problems. In accordance with this new
policy, the highest priorities were given to the curative and
palliative treatment of cancer, the detection of diseases prevalent
in children and the assessment of nutritional status and the
planning and evaluation of applied nutritional programmes for women
and children.
<P>
Research activities carried out by the Agency
received special mention at the 6th Congress of the World
Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology, held in Sydney, as a
model for education, training and research. A CRP on
immunoscintigraphy of colonic cancer, which was completed during
the year, pioneered the use of monoclonal antibodies labelled with
99Tcm. Other CRPs were designed as randomized multicentre clinical
trials for monomodal and multimodal therapeutic approaches, using
either open (nuclear medicine) or sealed (radiation therapy)
radioactive sources in the treatment of diseases, including
hyper-thyroidism and different types of cancer. The aims are to
define scientifically  in well selected patient populations  the
best treatment protocols for each type of disease for worldwide
application. A new approach was also introduced to increase
efficiency in CRPs dealing with advanced technology in nutritional
studies by twinning institutes in developed countries with
institutes in developing ones. The techniques developed in previous
CRPs on the detection of communicable diseases using radioactive
nucleic acid probes and the polymerase chain reaction can now be
transferred from biological research institutes to clinical
practice in hospitals.
<P>
Successful completion of previous CRPs on
the indigenous production of reagents for radioimmunoassay (RIA)
has allowed the start of regional and national programmes for the
detection of neonatal hypothyroidism, a major cause of mental and
physical deficiency in the world. Similarly, ongoing CRPs on the
indigenous production of radioimmunoanalytic reagents for the
detection of hepatitis B will provide the springboard for future
programmes dealing with this disease of increasing prevalence in
the developing world and closely linked to the aetiology of cancer
of the liver.
<P>
The model project criteria seem to be especially
suited for the medical field, as shown by the successful
implementation of national projects for nuclear medicine
development initiated in Bolivia and other countries since 1992.
During 1994, five model projects on human health were approved,
dealing with nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, nutritional
studies and radiation sterilization of tissue grafts for
reconstructive surgery. 
<P>
As radiation therapy is only curative during
the earlier stages of cancer, a collaborative agreement was
reached with WHO by which the Agency would give higher priority to
radiotherapy projects in which WHO already sustains national
programmes for the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer.
<P>
As result of the Agency's mediation, some commercial firms began in
1994 the production of simple, low cost gamma cameras and radiation
therapy machines with updated technology. These will reduce the
cost of technical co-operation projects in the medical field and
will enable developing Member States to have better access to
equipment. The gamma cameras can be upgraded at minimal cost to
digital data and image processing by using the hardware interface
and the processing software which have been developed by the Agency
and are presently undergoing field trials at selected centres.
<P>
The principal emphasis in the field of dosimetry was placed on
starting quality assurance (QA) programmes. In co-operation with
the European Union, a pilot study for quality control is now being
carried out at European radiotherapy centres. In order to improve
the calibration of irradiation beams, this programme also includes
the examination of all dosimetric steps from dose prescription to
dose delivery. Similar QA programmes are being organized for
radiotherapy centres in developing countries. A QA programme has
been also established for high dose dosimetry.
<P>
A CRP on therapy level dosimetry with the alanine/ESR system was terminated in 1993
on the recommendation of the SSDL Scientific Committee since the
majority of the participants had changed their priorities and were
slow in developing this dosimetry system. The termination data of
a CRP on development of quality control dosimetry techniques for
particle beam radiation processing was postponed to 1995 because of
the deferment of a Research Co-ordination meeting as a result of
financial restrictions.
<P>
Emphasis in the human nutrition programme
continued to be placed on persistent nutrition problems in which
nuclear and related techniques can provide critically needed
information to improve the efficacy of interventions. To increase
the impact on end-user populations, closer collaboration was
established with expert groups associated with other relevant
international organizations (WHO, UNU, International Union of
Nutritional Sciences). Human health related environmental studies
have continued to place emphasis on environmental pollution using
nuclear and isotopic techniques and on the monitoring of
accidentally released radionuclides in environmental and food
samples.
<P>
The IAEA-MEL continued to act as an experimental focal point for interagency
co-operation on marine pollution monitoring, in particular with
UNEP and the IOC of UNESCO. It provided training and capacity
building related to the implementation of the recommendations of
UNCED, Chapter 17, Agenda 21 and it continued therefore to organize
training courses, in-service training, Analytical Quality Control
Service (AQCS) support to 235 laboratories worldwide, issuance of
reference methods for marine pollution studies, equipping of
laboratories and the carrying out of pilot monitoring studies.
Significant new techniques were added to the Laboratorys analytical
capability. Important results in 1994 included the observations
that marine corals can record past contamination by oil and that
pesticide behaviour in coastal waters is largely controlled by
interactions with organic humic compounds.

<B><A NAME="A1.104">Enhancing the capabilities of developing countries to perform dynamic functional studies</B></A>
<P>
Two CRPs aimed at enhancing capabilities to perform brain and heart
function studies have yielded interesting results. Apart from
studying diseases of the brain and heart which are common to all
parts of the world, attention is being given to disease conditions
and treatment practices relevant to developing Member States. Two
examples are objective documentation of regional brain blood flow
changes following acupuncture and the use of indigenously
manufactured drugs to induce pharmacological stress in heart
studies.

<B><A NAME="A1.105">Screening for neonatal hypothyroidism</B></A>
<P>
A CRP in the Latin American region, aimed at
introducing filter paper based RIA of thyroid related hormones
using bulk reagents, was concluded. Institutions participating in
the CRP were able to absorb this simple and robust technology and
use it for large scale screening programmes in a cost effective
manner.   
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.106">Diagnosis of communicable diseases</B></A>
<P>
There were promising developments in CRPs on molecular
diagnostics. Results from a CRP on tuberculosis have shown the
potential of molecular methods in the early diagnosis of
tuberculous meningitis, a condition which is especially difficult
to diagnose and which could lead to irreversible neurological
damage if specific treatment is delayed. A CRP on blood borne
diseases has led to the development of kits for Chagas' disease and
leishmaniasis.

A model tissue banking project was initiated in Sri
Lanka. Large scale production has begun of clinical quality
radiation sterilized tissue grafts, such as bones, skin, fascia
lata, duramater and chorion-amnion.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.109">Advanced techniques in brachytherapy</B></A>
<P>
Progress in the development of after-loading techniques, which effectively eliminate the
exposure of staff to radiation, has resulted in a general
resurgence of interest and an increasing role for brachytherapy in
cancer management. Further impetus has been given by the
availability of inexpensive PC based treatment planning systems
which have been implemented through a recently concluded CRP in the
countries of the Asia and Pacific region. Another CRP, on
brachytherapy in combination with other methods for the treatment
of malignant neoplasia at various anatomical sites, is continuing
to provide the potential for introducing high dose rate
brachytherapy techniques. The projected activities continue to
encourage an evolution towards optimal QA through adherence to
basic clinical standards and collimated instruments, as well as
proper techniques, dosimetry and reporting systems in clinical
brachytherapy. 
<P>
In order to help developing countries to start or
upgrade radiotherapy facilities, projects have been implemented
through technical co-operation programmes. Model projects in Ghana
and Mongolia are currently in the early implementation phase.
Expert missions to Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic and Jordan
were carried out to assess current facilities and needs for
training radiotherapists and medical physicists. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.110">Comparative assessment of mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of low level radiation and toxic chemicals released from energy cycles</B></A>
<P>
Research on the mechanisms involved in mutagenic and carcinogenic effects from
exposure to low level radiation and to genotoxic chemical
pollutants has continued in a CRP on radiological methods in
comparing the health impacts of radiation and conventional
techniques. The work has been facilitated through the provision and
validation of current molecular radiobiology techniques, along with
the rapid accumulation of data on chemical mutagenesis and
carcinogenesis. The nuclear methodologies suitable for quantitative
evaluation of mutagenic and carcinogenic effects could thus serve
as a basis for a comparative assessment of the potential risk to
human health posed by chemical pollutant emissions from fossil fuel
energy sources.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.111">Exploration of the stimulative effects of low dose radiation</B></A>
<P>
Results confirming the existence of adaptive
response to low dose radiation were generated through a CRP which
was completed in 1994. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved
relate to the stimulation of cellular repair capacity for damage to
the genetic material and also for the enzymatic systems. The
findings are expected to have an impact on the interpretations of
low dose radiobiological effects and, on particular, on attendant
risk assessment.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.112">Development of criteria for tumour responsiveness to radiation for use in treatment planning</B></A>
<P>
Radiobiology data on the radiosensitivity of human
tumours generated through a CRP have illustrated that predictive
assays can be utilized in radiotherapy treatment planning with the
concomitant prospect of enhancing cancer cure rates. Both the
intrinsic radiosensitivity of a tumour and its growth kinetic
parameters play a role in tumour radioresponse and are hence

The IAEA/WHO network of SSDLs presently
includes 69 laboratories and 6 SSDL national organizations in 56
Member States, as well as 14 affiliated members (i.e. Primary
Standard Dosimetry Laboratories (PSDLs)). The support of the member
laboratories has continued. Calibration of 14 secondary standard
dosimeters was provided through the Agency's Laboratory at
Seibersdorf. The annual dose intercomparisons with SSDLs were
extended to medical accelerator beams in addition to the radiation
beams of 60Co radiation therapy units. Four SSDLs had a larger
deviation than the established acceptance limit of 3.5%. In a
repeat of the exercise, three of these four SSDLs corrected their
deviations. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.115">Dose intercomparison and assurance</B></A>
<P>
The IAEA/WHO Thermoluminescence Dosimetry (TLD)
service was continued for nearly 300 radiotherapy centres in
developing countries, checking the calibrations of photon radiation
beams from 60Co radiotherapy units and medical accelerators used
for patient treatment. About one third of the results were beyond
the 5% acceptance limit.  In the follow-up measurements, 30% of the
participants again showed a deviation above the acceptance limit.
<P>
Two TLD dose intercomparison runs with 12 radiotherapy centres in
Europe and the USA were implemented for electron beams from medical
accelerators. The results provided baseline data for energy
correction factors needed to expand the IAEA/WHO TLD service for
electron irradiation beams. This additional service is presently
being tested with 36 radiotherapy centres in Europe and the USA
before it enters into routine operation for hospitals in developing
countries.
<P>
All TLD intercomparison runs received support from the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the Austrian
Primary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (BEV) or the Radiation
Physics Department of the University of Umeaa, Sweden. They
provided reference irradiations for all TLD runs as an external
quality control measure for the TLD dosimetry service. The BIPM
calibrated two therapy level secondary standard dosimeters of the
Agency providing traceability to the international measurement
system. 
<P>
The International Dose Assurance Service (IDAS) for high
dose dosimetry in radiation processing facilities was continued. A
complete QA programme has now been established. The alanine/ESR
dosimetry system was calibrated by the National Physical
Laboratory, the PSDL in the United Kingdom providing traceability
to the international measurement system for high dose measurements.
A total of 46 alanine dosimeter sets were distributed to 12
participating institutes from 11 Member States.  
<P>
An intercomparison for gamma ray irradiation beams between nine
calibration laboratories (six out of the nine are primary
laboratories), organized in collaboration with BIPM, was started.
The last such intercomparison was held about ten years ago.

Work continued on a number of projects relating
to protein energy and micro-nutrient malnutrition. Two new large

were developed for Ethiopia and Peru (the latter a model project).
<P>
Using the services of consultants, and in collaboration with WHO,
protocols were developed for a new CRP on helping to eliminate
vitamin A deficiency disorders using nuclear and related
techniques. Vitamin A deficiency, which is the most common cause of
childhood blindness and which also weakens the immune system,
currently affects around 200 million people, mostly young children
living in developing countries. The new IAEA/WHO programme will be
concerned with the use of isotope techniques to assess vitamin A
status and to examine the bioavailability of carotenoids and their
conversion to vitamin A. 
<P>
A new CRP on comparative international
studies of osteoporosis using isotope techniques was initiated.
This is concerned mainly with studies of bone density in selected
population groups living in developing countries. Nutritional and
lifestyle data are being collected and the role of trace elements
in bone metabolism, composition, structure and disease will also be
investigated. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.119">Applied research on environmental pollution using nuclear and isotopic techniques</B></A>
<P>
Work continued on studies of air pollution
using nuclear related analytical techniques. Experience gained from
a global CRP on this subject was used to help develop similar
activities within the framework of a joint UNDP/RCA/IAEA project on
the use of isotopes and radiation to strengthen technology and
support environmentally sustainable development. Arrangements were
made to supply 15 countries in the Asia and Pacific region with a
standard air sampler for the collection of airborne particulate
matter, and intercomparison exercises were initiated with three
kinds of analytical quality control material.
<P>
Progress was achieved in a CRP on the assessment of environmental exposure to
mercury in selected human populations as studied by monitoring the
concentrations of total mercury and methylmercury in human hair.
Mercury has long been known to be a toxic element, but only rather
recently has it been recognized that it may have toxic effects on
the nervous systems of newborn babies, even at very low
concentrations. At the third Research Co-ordination Meeting, held
in Monaco, data were presented on total mercury and methylmercury
in human hair, emphasizing data for pregnant women and their
newborn babies. Through this CRP a network of laboratories has now
been established that can reliably determine mercury and
methylmercury in hair samples. An intercomparison on total mercury,
methylmercury and other trace elements in two human hair materials
(IAEA-085/086) was organized in 1994. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.120">Services to international marine pollution monitoring programmes</B></A>
<P>
Quality assurance work within
the AQCS programme continued and a mussel homogenate sample
(IAEA-142) was distributed worldwide to 235 laboratories for
intercomparison of organic contaminants. In addition, 15 expert
laboratories were invited to measure methylmercury compounds for
subsequent certification purposes. Work commenced on the
preparation of a new intercomparison sample called IAEA-140, Sea
Plant Homogenate. This material will be distributed to over 400
laboratories worldwide for the analysis of organic contaminants,
trace elements and methylmercury. 
<P>
A report on the worldwide and regional intercomparison for the determination of trace elements
and methylmercury compounds in polluted marine sediment, IAEA-356,
was completed. In total, 68 laboratories from 41 countries reported
results for up to 61 elements. Methylmercury was also certified and
this represents the first sediment sample ever certified for this
very toxic organomercury compound. The IAEA-356 sample can now be
considered as a reference material.  
<P>
In co-operation with the IOC
of UNESCO, IAEA-MEL has been active in the International Mussel
Watch project, which was set up to assess the global distribution
and investigate the transport of persistent organochlorine
pollutants. Mussel samples taken from Central and South America
were analysed. Results identify some hot spots, but a comparison
with data for the USA issued by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration shows that contamination is generally
lower than in North America.
<P>
The IAEA-MEL continued to assist the
Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment
(ROPME) in Kuwait in obtaining information on the spatial and
temporal distribution of marine contaminants in various locations
in the Persian Gulf. During 1994, two new projects were established
between IAEA-MEL and ROPME. One project on QA for contaminant
measurements involves co-ordinating intercomparison exercises and
training activities in the region. The second deals with a thorough
screening for key contaminants in the northern waters of the
Persian Gulf.
<P>
During 1994, a new research activity was introduced
on the use of corals as historical recorders of pollution. The
tissues of corals deposit an exoskeleton beneath their outer living
film at a rate dependent on growth and hence on environmental
conditions. This typically results in annual (seasonal) bands being
formed within colonies. Recent results suggest that coral skeletons
record contamination from oil and could potentially be used to
investigate other anthropogenic and biogenic organic inputs.
Analyses of sections from within corals sampled from the coasts of
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia demonstrate discrete bands of oil
contamination which, using selected terpenoid biomarkers, can be
source indexed to specific oil fields. Together with dating using
microscopic and X ray inspection, this offers the opportunity
precisely to investigate contamination during recent years.
<P>
Work continued on the development and testing of new methodologies for
the quantification of organometallic compounds and achievements in
this field led to the IAEA-MEL being selected as a Reference
Laboratory in the first international intercomparison exercise for
the determination of organomercury compounds in natural water
samples.
<P>
Mechanisms controlling the cycling and fate of pesticides
in the marine environment were studied under controlled laboratory
conditions using 14C labelled organochlorine and organophosphorus
compounds. It was found that the partitioning of these pesticides
between water and sediments is largely controlled by their
interaction with organic matter such as humic substances.   
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.121">Laboratory activities</B></A>
<P>
The R&D work at the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf focused mainly on
environmental pollution studies using nuclear and isotopic
techniques for investigations of environmental exposure to mercury
and in air pollution research. In the latter project, the
laboratory joined efforts on the evaluation and use of PM10 air
particulate matter samplers and related analytical work. A
collection of 24 h samples was carried out in Vienna, and
analytical results have been obtained by proton induced X ray
emission (PIXE), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). In support of such
measurements, new intercomparison and reference materials for air
pollution studies are being developed. A set of relevant samples,
urban dust, soil dust and coal fly ash, were prepared and
distributed to the RCA participant group on nuclear analytical
techniques.   
<P>
Services related to the development and selection of
analytical techniques and procedures for the monitoring of
accidentally released radionuclides into the environment included
the implementation of a new rapid chromatographic separation in the
90Sr procedure. Simultaneously, low level gamma spectrometry
procedures were developed and established. The increased
sensitivity is utilized in studies relating to the assessment of
effluents from nuclear operations (and also for safeguards
purposes) and residues at former weapons test sites (Kazakhstan).
<P>
Two milk powder quality control materials for radionuclides (with
different levels of 134Cs, 137Cs and 40K) were provided by the AQCS
for a collaborative study with the WHO Regional Office for Europe
to evaluate laboratory proficiency.

The Agency's activities in the area of the industrial applications
of radiation and radioisotopes have focused on methods for
minimizing industry related environmental pollution,
non-destructive testing (NDT), and nucleonic control systems for
on-line mineral analysis and tracer applications. Industrial
radiation sterilization is now established as a major technology
with hitherto unattainable environmental, technical and economic
benefits. A pilot scale demonstration model technical co-operation
project was initiated using radiation technology for the removal of
toxic flue gases from coal fired power stations. Personnel
development in Member States in the area of NDT and other aspects
of industrial radiography continued to be stressed.  
<P>
The following subject areas were emphasized in the hydrology programme:
development and management of water resources, focusing on arid and
semi-arid regions; environmental investigations, including the
evaluation of contamination processes and contaminant transport in
water bodies; geothermal resources assessment, with emphasis on
high enthalpy fields; studies of sediment transport and related
problems; and analytical and intercalibration services.  
<P>
A regional co-operation project, focusing on isotope field investigations at
ten different aquifer systems in countries in the Middle East,
including the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey and the United Arab
Emirates, was completed. Another regional project on the use of
nuclear and related techniques for the study of leakages in dams
and reservoirs was started in five Latin American countries
(Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela).

Two CRPs have been concerned with the applications of radiation
technology in bioengineering and the synthesis of biomaterials. In
one CRP on the synthesis of biomaterials, which was completed in
1994, techniques were developed for the production of air permeable
burn and wound dressings, and for the controlled release of drugs.
Some of these applications are already in commercial use. The other
CRP, on the applications of radiation technology, resulted in the
development of new radiation techniques for the immobilization of
bioactive materials for use as diagnostic reagents in the early
detection of communicable diseases.

A CRP on nuclear methods
for assessing healing pathways of pollutant damage in the
environment, particularly for the bulk analysis of coal and
estimation of pollutants in coal and coke, resulted in a new
technique based on the inelastic scattering of neutrons in carbon.
This makes it possible to evaluate the calorific value and the ash
content of Polish coal. Techniques based on dual gamma, natural
radiation, prompt gamma and X ray fluorescence methods were
successfully demonstrated for the determination of the ash content
of coals from several countries. Furthermore, a number of on-line
nucleonic measurement systems for use in coal fired power stations
have been developed. Similarly, low coal ash gauges based on the
attenuation of soft gamma radiation have been developed in Viet Nam
and China, and their performance has been evaluated.

A CRP on mathematical models for the quantitative evaluation of
isotope data in hydrology was completed. The results of the
programme were published as an IAEA-TECDOC. Various quantitative
evaluation methodologies for natural isotope data in groundwater
systems were successfully assessed in this programme. A manual on
mathematical models for isotope hydrogeology is being prepared as
another product of the CRP. 
<P>
A CRP on isotope techniques in lake
dynamics investigations was started. The emphasis is on the water
dynamics of large lakes and related problems, such as solute
dynamics, sedimentation processes and isotopic effects due to
evaporation. The programme is expected to help elucidate the
potential of environmental isotope techniques for such studies. 
<P>
A regional project was started in five Latin American countries
(Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela) with the aim of
using nuclear and related techniques for the study of leakages in
dams and reservoirs. These leakages endanger the stability of the
dam and could also give rise to significant water losses. A
workshop was held in S. Luis Potosi, Mexico, to provide training in
the application of tracer techniques for the identification of
leakages, as well as the flow paths of the water from leakages.
<P>
In Venezuela, a model technical co-operation project was initiated
with reserve funds. The increasing water deficit in the city of
Caracas made it necessary to search for new water sources to
complement the existing distribution system, which basically is fed
by reservoirs. The rational exploitation of groundwater resources
is expected to help supply drinking water to peripheral areas of
the city. The hydrogeological investigations will be complemented
by geochemical and isotopic techniques for characterizing quality
and the amount of water to be pumped from the Valle de Caracas
aquifer.
<P>
Geothermal projects with Agency technical assistance to
El Salvador, Mexico and Greece were completed. In these projects,
isotope techniques were used to study the occurrence of geothermal
water. The origin and flow directions of geothermal waters could be
identified and, to some extent, the temperature of geothermal
reservoirs determined. Assistance was given for the development of
water, gas and isotope laboratories in China, El Salvador,
Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Nicaragua and the Philippines.  
<P>
To promote research on water-rock interaction by means of isotope
techniques, co-operation was started with the Russian Federation
and the Philippines. The investigations are expected to extend the
applicability of isotope geothermometry to depths in geothermal
systems where chemical indicators may fail. The research based on
sulphur isotopes will, similarly, provide a better understanding of
the sources of acid fluids in geothermal systems.  
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.129">Water resources evaluation in arid and semi-arid regions</B></A>
<P>
A regional technical co-operation project on isotope hydrology in the Middle
East was completed after four years. The aquifer systems
investigated include coastal aquifers in Lebanon and the Syrian
Arab Republic, a karst aquifer in the Islamic Republic of Iran,
aquifers with different characteristics in Jordan and in Turkey,
overexploited karst aquifers in the United Arab Emirates, and water
movement in the unsaturated zone in Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab
Republic and Kuwait. A core of well trained staff was created in
each of the participating countries, capable of planning,
implementing and evaluating isotope studies. 
<P>
In the Peruvian Altiplano, isotope techniques have contributed to identifying
groundwater origin and altitude of recharge and characterizing the
hydrogeological parameters of the aquifers. These results help to
make available additional sources of drinking water which are badly
needed in the water scarce coastal areas of Peru. In Brazil,
tritium is being used as a tracer to investigate the dynamics of
the surface reservoir supplying potable water for the city of Sna
during August, in co-operation with the International Association
of Hydrological Sciences. Presentations were made on six main
topics related to tracer applications in arid zone hydrology.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.130">Environmental investigations with isotope techniques</B></A>
<P>
A CRP on the application of isotope techniques to investigate
groundwater pollution was started. It aims at the use of isotope
techniques to identify groundwater pollution sources, characterize
the level of pollution, predict the movement of pollutants and help
prevent or mitigate contamination. Isotopes such as 2H, 3H, 18O,
13C, 14C, 15N and 34S address specific pollution sources and
provide information which complements chemical and hydrological
data. The CRP addresses issues related to urban groundwater
pollution by domestic wastes and sewage disposal, landfill
performance and hazard assessment, seawater intrusion and pollution
from agricultural practices. The results of these investigations
will help develop methodologies for monitoring so that management
of water resource utilization can be more effective.
<P>
An Advisory Group meeting on the use of isotope techniques in the hydrological
appraisal of radioactive waste disposal sites was held in June.
Scientific presentations illustrated the investigations of
residence times in low permeability rocks, the origin of waters,
fluidrock interaction and transport of radionuclides in groundwater
that affect the performance of radioactive waste disposal sites.
The meeting emphasized that isotope techniques are indispensable
for the assessment of the performance of potential geological
repositories for nuclear wastes from the standpoint of
understanding groundwater flow and radioactive migration under low
permeability conditions.
<P>
A CRP on isotope variations of carbon
dioxide and other trace gases in the atmo-sphere was concluded. The
CRP made a significant contribution towards solving the missing CO2
sink' problem: the data on 14C concentration in atmospheric CO2
point to an oceanic carbon sink smaller than previously believed;
and the 13C data for atmospheric CO2 being gathered under
programmes run by the United States National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and Australias Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization suggest a large CO2 sink at
temperate northern latitudes, mostly of terrestrial origin. The
achievements of the CRP with regard to methodological developments
include revised data acquisition procedures for high precision 13C
and 18O analysis of atmospheric CO2, and an intercomparison
exercise between laboratories engaged in high precision isotope
analyses of atmospheric trace gases, based on whole air samples.
<P>
In pursuance of the recommendations made by consultants in 1993 on
the Caspian Sea environmental crisis, a proposal was prepared for
a regional project to be implemented within the Agency's technical
co-operation programme. In order to assess the commitments of the
Governments of the riparian countries to the implementation of this
project and the extent of local infrastructural support available
to execute the project, Agency staff, an Agency recruited expert
and a UNESCO representative visited the countries in August and
September. The mission reported that all the countries were willing
to take part and had offered complete infrastructural support. The
priority areas to be tackled were discussed with the potential
local counterparts.   
<P>
Pollution problems were dealt with using
isotope techniques in a number of field studies carried out within
the technical co-operation programme. In Costa Rica, one of the
studies carried out during 1994 was centred on the determination of
the transfer rate of nitrate and other pollutants to groundwater
using tracer techniques. In Cuba, the effectiveness of a 50 km dike
in increasing the recharge of water derived from precipitation and
in preventing seawater intrusion due to intense pumping in a
coastal aquifer was studied. It was found that the dike increased
the recharge and stabilized the coastline. This led to the
development of a mangrove swamp and a reduction in the adverse
effects caused by seawater intrusion. The results of a study on
contamination sources and surface water dynamics carried out in the
Bay of Montevideo revealed that the contamination originating in
the Bay reaches the bathing areas of Montevideo city in the Rio de
la Plata.
<P>
Studies on bedload sediment transport using radioactive
tracers were performed in the Magdalena River near Barranquilla and
Las Flores, Colombia. The objective of the study was to evaluate
the river transport capacity for dredged sediments to a dumping
site. The results show that the location of the proposed new
dumping site was properly selected. Field experiments with
radioactive tracers were continued in the Hai Phong port area in
Viet Nam to study bottom sediment dynamics near the navigation
channel. The studies will be completed in 1995. Field work to
tackle erosion and siltation problems in the Danube delta, Romania,
and the Markala Reservoir, Mali, was initiated.
<P>
Co-operation between the Agency and UNESCO in the field of isotope hydrology
continued with the convening of a working group in Vienna in
December on nuclear techniques in hydrology. The scope and layout
of a suitable textbook in this area were discussed.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.131">Analytical and intercalibration services</B></A>

The Isotope Hydrology Laboratory organized the fifth Agency intercomparison
exercise for the low level tritium analysis of water.
Intercomparison samples were prepared and sent to 82 laboratories,
out of which 65 returned the results of their measurements. The
results were evaluated by three external experts from New Zealand,
the United Kingdom and the USA.
<P>
In order to improve the overall
quality and intercomparability of data from the joint IAEA/WMO
Isotopes in Precipitation Global Network, the Isotope Hydrology
Laboratory organized an intercomparison exercise for 28
laboratories engaged in stable isotope analyses of precipitation.
Four water samples (of 50 mL each) covering the range of 2H and 18O
values usually observed in precipitation were sent to participating
laboratories for analysis. The results will be evaluated and made
available to all participating laboratories.   
<P>
Assistance was
provided to five projects oriented towards strengthening analytical
capabilities for environmental isotope assay (tritium, radiocarbon,
stable isotopes) in Member States. This includes setting up new
laboratories and upgrading existing ones.

The emphasis in the nuclear data subprogramme has been on:
modernization of the computer related activities of the nuclear
data centre; completion of the FENDL-1 nuclear data library to be
used in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
project; improvement of atomic and molecular data needed for fusion
plasma edge studies and for heavy element impurities in fusion
plasmas; and data important for analysing activation in different
areas of nuclear technology.
<P>
Improvements to the analytical
capabilities of the nuclear instrumentation used by Member States
were made by the upgrading of several Agency software packages. In
training courses, attention continued to focus, where possible, on
recent developments in nuclear instrumentation  as well as on the
more basic repair and maintenance aspects. The existing spare parts
provision service was extended to the Africa region.  
<P>
Work in the area of research reactors and accelerators focused on identifying
the causes of underutilization, providing assistance in resolving
relevant issues and promoting new techniques and technologies.
<P>
The focus of the chemistry subprogramme was on the production of high
quality medical radioisotopes, diagnostics and therapeutic
radiopharmaceuticals, in vivo diagnostic kits, radioimmunoassay
(RIA)/immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) reagents and procedures.
Technical support was provided for expanding applications of new
radiopharmaceuticals for functional studies of the heart and brain
and for SPECT imaging, including the development of radiolabelling
of monoclonal antibodies for immunoscintigraphy.

During 1994, the Agency fulfilled more than 800 requests from
scientists in 70 Member States, by dispatching 170 magnetic tapes,
510 diskettes and 1600 copies of printed material and arranging
electronic data transmission to 140 users.  
<P>
Further progress was
made in the standardization of nuclear data software. Three of the
four major nuclear data centres (in the USA, the Russian Federation
and at the Agency) now use a common software package for database
management and on-line services. The package was donated by the USA
and recently installed in the Russian centre at Obninsk. All atomic

The first international benchmark calculation of the radioactive
inventory in fission reactors for decommissioning purposes was
organized. It has been shown that predictions of the amount of
radioactivity produced during the service life of fission reactors
inside the core and in pressure vessels can be made with sufficient
accuracy. Large deficiencies in predicting the radioactivity in the
concrete bio-shield were identified and the urgent need for more
accurate documentation of material composition in fission reactor
shields was emphasized.
<P>
Two evaluated fission yield libraries,
UKFY2 (United Kingdom) and ENDF/B-6 (USA), have been finalized and

co-ordinated by the Agency. These data are important for decay heat
calculations after reactor shutdown, burnup determination,
safeguards, identification of source reactor accidents and nuclear

The Agency, in co-operation with several
national nuclear data centres and research groups, has completed
the first version of the internationally available Fusion Evaluated
Nuclear Data Library, FENDL-1. This library has been selected to
serve as the source of processed and tested nuclear data tailored
to the requirements of the Engineering and Development Activities
(EDA) of the ITER project and other fusion related development
projects. It is composed of several sub-libraries for neutron-photon
transport calculations and the resulting radiation effects. To
facilitate the ITER EDA applications, two processed FENDL-1
sub-libraries were derived: processed multigroup and processed
Monte Carlo. The BENCHMARKS sublibrary for validation of FENDL-1
has been created and tests of FENDL-1 were started. The complete
FENDL-1 library was put on-line on Internet. 
<P>
During 1994, recommended cross-section databases were established for the
particle interchange ion-molecule reactions taking place in the
fusion plasma edge, for the elastic and momentum transfer processes
in ion-atom and neutral-neutral collision systems, for the particle
impact induced secondary emission from fusion relevant materials
and for the radiative cooling rates of helium, carbon and oxygen
plasma impurities. A CRP on atomic and molecular data for plasma
edge studies was successfully completed with the preparation of a
compendium of critically assessed data for all important
collisional processes. A similar compendium is now in preparation
for the collisional processes of medium and high Z impurities in
fusion plasmas. A critically evaluated collection of
thermomechanical properties data for the candidate fusion reactor
plasma facing materials has been assembled by an international
group of experts and prepared for publication.

develop a universal database of neutron and charged particle
activation cross-sections and related decay data for nuclear and
fusion technology and for environmental protection and estimates of
potential radiation hazards connected with any kind of nuclear
installation and technique. Of practical importance are about 2400
radionuclides which may be built up by more than 20 000 nuclear
activation reactions for which the cross-sections must be measured
or estimated.

In-house services and technical support
continued to be offered to other parts of the Agency's Laboratory at
Seibersdorf. In addition, technical assistance was provided to
upgrade 12 X ray fluorescence (XRF) laboratories and extend the
applications of this analytical technique for environmental
pollution monitoring in the Africa region. Within the framework of
a regional technical co-operation project, the Laboratory provided
complete water preconcentration kits, Agency reference materials
and standard samples for calibration and quality control,
chemicals, parts for spectrometry systems and updated versions of
QXAS (quantitative X ray analysis) software. The Laboratory also
organized an intercomparison survey to assess the quality of the
analytical performance of XRF laboratories in Africa. Moreover, to
upgrade infrastructures for the repair and maintenance of nuclear
instruments in developing Member States, in particular in the
Africa region, technical support was given through expert missions,
and the provision of spare parts, technical documentation, power
conditioning kits, mains disturbance analysers and instruments for
troubleshooting and repair.
<P>
The Laboratory was involved in: the
design and construction of special instruments and training kits;
a high precision current source for the calibration of dosimeters;
a power supply unit for ionization chambers; a portable dosimeter;
a switch-mode power supply and UNOLAB optical feedback preamplifier
training kits; and a temperature control unit for a dosimetry
irradiation chamber. It contributed to the development of central
station software for heterogeneous early warning systems for the
Middle East and Europe. Also, three types of new X ray
detectors for microanalysis and portable instruments were tested.
<P>
Most methodological work carried out by the Laboratory in the field
of XRF dealt with the improvement of accuracy and detectability - as
well as an extension of the applicability range of the analytical
technique. A simple method for the quantitative XRF analysis of
in homogeneously loaded samples and a Monte Carlo simulation method
for the calculation of geometrical parameters and excitation
detection efficiency of a radioisotope excited XRF system were also
developed. An X ray microfluorescence system with a new 10 m glass
capillary and a total reflection XRF unit were used for the
analysis of various environmental, geological and biological
materials. It was demonstrated that XRF can be optimized to combine
a broad range of applicability with very low detection limits,
which are the essential features for many environmental monitoring
applications, including the analysis of air particulates, water,
soil and sediments. To perform routine and systematic monitoring of
air pollution as well as to provide adequate training, a high
volume sampler was installed in Seibersdorf.

<P>
The regular budget was composed of
contributions from the Agency ($1 486 828), UNESCO ($373 500) and
the Italian Government ($11 765 000). An extraordinary contribution
from the Italian Government, amounting to $3 692 300 for 1994, was
granted in April. Half of it was used to set up a reserve fund. The
number of participants was higher in 1994 because of the tendency
to let co-organizing institutions pay for the travel and living
expenses of their own lecturers, thus becoming co-sponsors of
activities. This released funds for scientists from developing
countries.  
<P>
For the second year, the CEC funded seven fellowships,
tenable at ICTP, under its 'Go West' and 'Human Capital and Mobility'
schemes. Contributions were received from the Swedish Agency for
Research Co-operation with Developing Countries (SAREC), and the
Governments of Japan and Kuwait to support the visits of associate
members and affiliates from federated institutes. The contribution
from SAREC covered the external activities as well. Spain also gave
$15 000 for external activities. The funds utilized for training
and research in Italian laboratories (about $190 000) came from the
Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Sincrotrone Trieste S.p.a. and
the Centro Informazioni Studi Esperienze. Resources for research
activities in the various fields of interest, amounting to $89 000,
came from the Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (Brazil), the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Accademia dei Lincei
(Italy), the University of Trieste (Italy), the Istituto Nazionale
di Geofisica (Italy), the Union radio-scientifique internationale,
and the Centre nationale de la recherche scientifique (France). The
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (Kuwait) contributed
$67 300 to support visits from Arab countries.

In order to enable the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf to provide advanced analytical
services in support of Agency programmes, it was decided to
construct and install a beam line analytical facility at an
existing accelerator in a nearby Member State. The beam line
including proton induced X ray emission (PIXE) chamber, vacuum
system, energy dispersive X ray spectrometer with Si(Li) detectors
and a germanium detector  was inaugurated at the EN Tandem Van de
Graaff of the Laboratory for Nuclear Microanalysis at the Ruder
Boskovic Institute, in Zagreb, Croatia. The host institution
offered the Agency three days per month beam time on a cost-free
basis as well as supporting facilities, such as a sample
preparation laboratory and a mechanical/electronic workshop.
Following the installation of the beam line, the Agency's Laboratory

The major event during 1994 in the radiation protection programme   
was the completion, and adoption by the Board of Governors, of the   
new International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against   
Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources. The   
Standards are now in the process of being formally adopted by the   
other co-sponsoring organizations, namely FAO, ILO, OECD/NEA, PAHO   
and WHO. These new Standards are considerably more comprehensive   
than the previous standards and cover the basic responsibilities   
and obligations for the protection of people and the safety of   
sources in all fields of application. Specific requirements apply   
to public, occupational and medical exposures, to the safety of   
sources and to intervention in accidental and chronic situations.   
<P>   
Prompted partly by the adoption of the new Basic Safety Standards,   
a review of all Safety Series documents (including, in particular,   
the Agency's Transport Regulations and supporting publications)   
relevant to radiation safety was started to check for consistency   
with the new Standards and to identify omissions or duplications.   
<P>   
A conference entitled Radiation and Society: Comprehending   
Radiation Risk, held in October in Paris, brought together   
specialists from many disciplines to discuss problems related to   
the comprehension of radiation risk. At the conference the   
difficulty of expressing scientific facts relating to radiation   
health effects in a form useful to non-specialists was underlined   
and insights were gained into the barriers to better comprehension.   
It was clear that further efforts to promote communication of   
radiation risk in relation to other risks are needed.   
<P>   
As part of a move to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical   
support for the technical co-operation programme for radiation   
safety, a system of 'country officers' has been instituted. Each   
officer will be responsible for a limited number of countries,   
usually grouped in a geographical region, and will maintain an   
overview of the radiation safety situation in each country.   
<P>   
At the request of the Government of Kazakhstan, missions were undertaken   
to assess the current environmental and radiological situation at   
the former nuclear weapons test site of Semipalatinsk. This is part of a growing concern over   
rehabilitation of large contaminated areas. The developing situation with respect to the rising incidence of   
thyroid cancer in children who were irradiated as a result of the Chernobyl accident has been closely   
monitored and preparations have started for a major interagency conference to mark the 10th anniversary   
of the accident at which the health consequences will be summarized.

New International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against   
Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources were   
completed and approved by the Board of Governors. They are now   
undergoing formal approval by the other co-sponsoring   
organizations, namely FAO, ILO, OECD/NEA, PAHO and WHO. The new   
Standards reflect the 1990 recommendations of ICRP Publication 60,   
as well as subsequent developments, and replace the Agency's Basic   
Safety Standards, which were based on the ICRP 1977   
recommendations and published in 1982. The new Standards cover the   
basic responsibilities and obligations for the protection of people   
and the safety of all sources. Detailed requirements applying to   
public, occupational and medical exposures, to the safety of   
sources, and to intervention in accidental and chronic   
circumstances are given.    
<P>   
The adoption of the new Basic Safety   
Standards has provided an impetus for a review of all Safety Series   
documents relevant to radiation safety. The aim is to check for   
consistency with the new Standards and to identify omissions or   
duplications. This is intended to form the basis over the next few   
years for systematic revision or replacement of existing documents   
and the creation of new documents.   
<P>   
Radiation and Society:Comprehending Radiation Risk was the title of the first major   
international conference on the comprehension of radiation risk.   
Held in October in Paris, the conference consisted of technical   
sessions reviewing the current status of scientific knowledge   
concerning radiation risk and case studies which examined those   
risks not normally considered within this body of knowledge. One of   
the conclusions was that further efforts were needed to promote a   
proper understanding of radiation risk as compared with other types   
of risk. The first volume of the conference proceedings was   
published in 1994 as background material.

Pilot courses in   
English and French for the programme on education and training in   
radiological protection and nuclear safety were run during 1994,   
based on a standard syllabus prepared and published in the six   
official languages of the Agency. The courses are intended to meet   
the educational and initial training requirements of graduate level   
staff with a few years of experience, or staff who are designated   
to take up positions in radiation protection.

collaboration of UNSCEAR and WHO, work has started on the   
development of a database which will include external radiation

At the same time, the necessary revisions to guidance on radon in   
underground mines are also being developed. Preparation of a   
technical document on the quality assurance of radon measurements   
continued in order to improve the quality of measurements and   
facilitate the international intercomparability of data. The

The Standing Advisory Group for the Safe Transport of Radioactive   
Material (SAGSTRAM) met in March to advise on the priority of work   
for the transport safety programme, focusing on the task of   
comprehensively revising, through a Revision Panel, the Agency's   
Transport Regulations in 1996. At the meeting endorsement was given   
to the incorporation of a system of radiological protection that is   
consistent with the new Basic Safety Standards. The Revision Panel   
met in October to discuss the preparation of a second draft of the   
Regulations for distribution to Member States for formal comment in   
January 1995. The Panel considered the input from two Technical   
Committee meetings: on radiation protection matters, held in June,   
and on the air mode, held in August, as well as six meetings   
utilizing consultants services held during 1994. As a result of   
this major effort, the revision process is almost complete. The   
second draft will include the more stringent regulatory   
requirements for packaging used to carry large amounts of   
radioactive material by air.    
<P>   
Several tasks associated with the   
implementation of the Regulations were completed in 1994. A   
training manual was translated into Russian and Spanish with   
publication scheduled for early 1995. A training video on the safe   
transport of radioactive material which complements the policy   
document published in 1993 was produced. Also, an electronic   
version of Safety Series Nos 6, 7, 37 and 80, called HYPERTRANS!,   
was released by the Agency. This tool provides users of these   
publications with an easy method to search for text and follow the   
extensive cross-referencing within the documents.   
<P>   
A CRP on the   
development of probabilistic safety assessment techniques related   
to the safe transport of radioactive materials was completed. A   
computer program, called INTERTRAN-2, was prepared to assess the   
safety of transporting radioactive material. The program can be   
run on a PC, and a supporting manual will be published. To improve   
the underlying data set of INTERTRAN-2, a follow-up CRP was   
established to analyse relevant accident data.    
<P>   
The maritime transport of radioactive material continues to be the subject of   
debate within bodies such as the IMO. A newly established CRP on   
accident severity at sea with particular reference to fires on   
board ships will contribute to the review of the joint IAEA/IMO   
Code of Practice for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,   
Plutonium and High Level Waste on Board Ships.

Work continued on maintaining and improving the capabilities of the Emergency   
Response Unit and the overall effectiveness of the Agency to   
respond to a nuclear accident or radiological emergency. These   
activities included:     
<UL>   
<LI>Drills and training to maintain a basic   
response capability; monthly internal communications exercises to   
test the ability to contact Agency staff and quickly form a team to   
respond to the initial notification of a nuclear accident or   
radiological emergency; periodic external communication exercises   
involving Member States and other international organizations;   
periodic Agency staff training, and participation in emergency   
exercises with Finland, the Nordic Countries, the Russian   
Federation and the EC.   
<LI>Upgrading and modernizing communication   
with emergency Duty Officers during off-duty hours.     
</UL>   
At the request of the Estonian Government, the Agency provided medical and   
radiological assistance for an emergency situation involving the   
overexposure of several individuals resulting from the theft and   
mishandling of a radioactive source. One individual died and   
several others received very high exposures.     
<P>   
There was continued effort to sustain and upgrade co-ordination and co-operation with   
other United Nations organizations which would have a role to play   
in responding to a nuclear accident or radiological emergency.   
These activities included:   
<UL>   
<LI>Participation in the development of   
the WMO Environmental Emergency Response programme, which has been   
developed primarily to support State meteorological services. In   
the event of a nuclear accident, specialized meteorological centres   
will provide atmospheric transport products to the Agency for quick   
identification of those States most likely to feel the impact of a   
nuclear accident. Specific operating procedures for this   
arrangement were adapted. The Agency can request these services   
whenever there is a need.    
<LI>Agency participation in workshops in   
eastern and central Europe to discuss the Agency's Emergency   
Response System, as a result of recent interest expressed by the   
United Nations for the inclusion of military and civil defence   
assets in disaster relief operations. The United Nations has, as a   
consequence, established an on-line Register of Emergency   
Stockpiles which can be used in the event of a major accident.   
<LI>Development of operating procedures for the interface between   
the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the   
Agency's Emergency Response Unit.   
<LI> Start of work with UNEP's Global   
Resources Information Database (GRID) programme for the development   
of requirements for local site and regional maps of nuclear power   
plants.The Agency was invited by various Member States to observe   
and evaluate comprehensive nuclear power plant exercises in the   
USA, South Africa, Slovenia and the Russian Federation.

A project proposal was approved at the regular session of the General   
Conference in September to direct efforts to assist Member States   
in the prevention of further accidents involving radiation sources.   
This will initially focus on large industrial irradiators with the   
compilation of an inventory of such irradiators, the collection of   
design and safety information and the provision of safety   
assessment services. Work has started on the implementation of this   
project.   
<P>   
A major collaborative project with WHO to produce a   
series of five training manuals on aspects of the medical uses of   
radiation has been essentially completed. The manuals are being   
reviewed prior to publication by WHO. Work has also continued on   
the production of Practical Radiation Safety Manuals and the   
development of computer based training assessment modules to   
accompany them.

information in order to learn from incidents and events relevant to   
radiation safety. The system will be implemented in 1995.

The only specific RAPAT mission carried out during the   
year was made in conjunction with a WAMAP mission to Saudi Arabia.   
However, a number of missions of a similar type were mounted under   
a joint IAEA/UNDP programme for the improvement of radiation   
protection, nuclear safety and waste management infrastructures for   
countries of the former USSR.    
<P>   
A major field evaluation of the   
effectiveness of RAPAT and WAMAP missions was carried out for four   
countries in the Asia and Pacific region. One of the conclusions   
was that a more systematic procedure was required for monitoring   
and providing assistance in the implementation of recommendations.   
Accordingly, a system was set up involving country officers who   
would be responsible for assembling and maintaining current   
information on the radiological protection infrastructure of a   
country and using it to provide the most appropriate assistance.

The Agency continued to routinely monitor more than 400 of its   
staff categorized as radiation workers (external dose exposure and   
internal contamination monitoring). There were no cases of internal   
or external overexposure. As in the previous year, all individual   
doses were maintained far below the annual dose limits.     
<P>   
Individual monitoring services continued to be provided to Member States and   
co-operation with WHO continued. Approximately 9000 dosimeters were   
distributed and 1000 finger dosimeters were sent to Member States.

<P>  
More than fifty countries have signed the Convention on Nuclear Safety since it was opened for signature   
in September 1994. The Convention applies to land based civil nuclear power plants and obliges   
Contracting Parties to establish and maintain proper legislative and regulatory frameworks to govern   
safety. Through the Convention, States commit themselves to the application of fundamental safety   
principles for nuclear installations and agree to participate in periodic peer review meetings to submit   
national reports on the implementation of their obligations.    
<P>  
This year has confirmed the general interest of Member States in the Agency's nuclear safety review   
services, with continuing requests in particular for OSART and ASSET missions. Follow-up missions are   
also considered useful as confirming implementation of solutions to safety problems previously identified.   
The number of site and seismic review missions has increased; these missions are linked in many cases to   
safety re-evaluations of plants built to earlier standards. Since fire hazards and fire protection have proved   
to be of concern for existing nuclear power plants, fire safety missions are now being performed at the   
request of Member States.   
<P>  
The Agency has continued its programme on the safety of nuclear power plants built to earlier standards.   
Consensus has been reached on all safety issues on WWER and RBMK type reactors in close co-  
ordination with the G-24 Nuclear Safety Assistance Co-ordination Secretariat. For WWER-440/230   
reactors, reviews of the safety upgradings and progress achieved have begun.     
<P>  
Fifty-four countries are now participating in the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES)  information   
system, which was jointly developed by the Agency and the OECD/NEA. National officers of participating   
countries met in 1994 to review the systems operation, noting that the system is proving effective in   
facilitating common understanding and the prompt communication of events.  
<P>  
Work under a joint IAEA-UNDP initiative to strengthen nuclear and radiation safety infrastructures in   
countries of the former USSR continued in three stages: collection of more detailed information through   
further fact-finding missions; preparation of country specific programmes; and preparation of assistance   
packages. Using the information from the fact finding missions, country specific programmes have been   
prepared for eight countries and are awaiting suitable donors.  
<P>  
A CRP on accident methodology validation could not be implemented owing to budgetary constraints.

A meeting of senior regulators was held during the regular session of the General Conference. The   
meeting included regulators from over forty countries with nuclear power programmes and covered the   
following topics: utilization of INES, the future direction of Agency safety services and the control of   
large radiation sources.  
<P>  
New 'Terms of Reference' were discussed to ensure proper understanding and interpretation by all   
members of the reconstituted Nuclear Safety Standards Advisory Group (NUSSAG),which met for the   
first time in 1994 with nine new members. It was noted that the Terms of Reference continued to give   
emphasis to NUSS and other Agency standards and included a requirement to give advice to the Agency   
on nuclear safety issues and programmes relevant to the regulatory process. It was concluded that   
NUSSAG should serve as a source of expert advice on regulatory matters, giving priority to providing   
guidance on the development, coverage and efficient implementation of NUSS.   
<P>  
The following NUSSAG taskgroups were formed:  	  
<UL>  
<LI><I>Task group on the NUSS programme</I>: Concerned primarily with reviewing the status and   
plans for developing new and revising existing NUSS documents, including documents concerning   
research reactors and to propose such plans.  
<LI><I>Task group on regulatory practices</I>: Concerned with the development and use in practice of   
regulatory tools.   
</UL>  
In response to General Conference Resolutions GC(XXXV)/RES/553 and GC(XXXVI)/RES/582, relating   
to the assessment of the safety level of operating nuclear power plants built to earlier standards, a Safety   
Guide on the periodic safety review of operational nuclear power plants was issued. The purpose of the   
Guide is to provide a basis for dealing with the cumulative effects of plant ageing and technical and   
standards development. The Guide will also support the implementation of the Convention on Nuclear   
Safety.  
<P>  
With the intention of strengthening the Agency's contribution to ensuring radiation protection and nuclear   
safety, a database on regulatory organizations and practices in Member States (ROPDB) is being    
established by the Agency in co-operation with the OECD/NEA. This database lists the organizations that   
govern nuclear programmes, and describes the practices that ensure radiation protection and nuclear   
safety. Some 48 items have been classified and summarized, in five categories, i.e. general, the licensing   
process, regulatory inspection and enforcement, emergency preparedness and international co-operation.    
<P>  
The Agency, in fulfilment of its commitments to a joint initiative with UNDP to strengthen radiation and  
nuclear safety infrastructures in countries of the former USSR, has continued to collect detailed   
information through fact-finding missions and the preparation of country assistance programmes. Fact-
finding missions were undertaken to Moldova, in April, and to Belarus, in May, making a total of  
eight missions to the countries of the former USSR. Visits to other countries are in the planning stage. On   
the basis of these missions, country assistance programmes were prepared for Belarus, Estonia,   
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Uzbekistan.

The Agency organized an International Regulatory Review Team (IRRT) mission to China to carry out a   
review of the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). The objective of the mission was to obtain   
a clear understanding of the actual status of the NNSA and its effectiveness in meeting its duties. It was   
concluded that the initial challenges of organization and structuring the development of a consistent set of   
codes and regulations and the carrying out of licensing and commissioning activities for the Qinshan and   
Guangdong nuclear power plants had been met by NNSA.  
<P>  
Within the framework of a technical co-operation project aimed at strengthening regulatory bodies, the   
first co-ordination and programming meeting was held in April in Kiev, Ukraine, to assess the status and   
identify the needs and priorities for assistance through workshops, training courses, expert missions,   
fellowships and scientific visits. A regulatory assistance programme was established covering expert   
services for the development of national nuclear safety legislation, regulatory requirements for operational   
safety, commissioning and decommissioning, conduct of the licensing process and regulatory staff   
training.

<P>  
With a growing number of regulatory bodies in the world requesting plant specific probabilistic safety   
assessments (PSAs) for every operating reactor, the regulatory use of PSA increased in many Member   
States. A Technical Committee meeting was held in December to discuss this topic. The evaluation of a   
questionnaire sent to Member States showed differences in the actual use of PSA. It was found that most   
of the countries were using PSA in support of more traditional safety assessment techniques to balance   
safety related decisions. Only a small number of more experienced countries were using PSA in   
connection with basic licensing. It was recommended that more concise guidance be developed, in   
particular for application to older reactors.  
<P>  
An IAEA-TECDOC, to be published as a result of a Technical Committee meeting on the identification of   
generic and plant specific safety issues based on PSA results, describes the experience and practices in this   
field, including the support given by PSA techniques. It was demonstrated that additional and important   
plant specific and generic safety issues can be identified on the basis of a systematic comparative   
evaluation and interpretation of PSA information and results from past PSAs.   
<P>   
The services of consultants were used to begin preparation of a guide on the use of PSA to optimize  
operational limits and conditions. This PSA application is attracting much interest worldwide and the   
methodology is mature enough to warrant the preparation of international guidance.   
<P>  
A comprehensive users manual for PSAPACK,a software package developed by the Agency, was   
finalized. This package contains the necessary tools to perform a level 1 PSA and, in addition, a module to   
apply the information and results of the completed PSA for operational safety management.    
<P>  
Complementing the users manual is a programmers manual that contains a detailed description of the  
software modules and their interfaces. This manual is used for adaptation and further development of the   
package by users.

<B><A NAME="A1.194">Information on unusual events in nuclear power plants</B></A>  
<P>  
Development began of a compendium of actions to be taken in response to events reported to the Agency's   
Incident Reporting System (IRS). In order to assist national organizations involved in IRS activity, special   
guidelines were developed to identify the causes of events reported to the IRS and for better reporting of   
human dominated occurrences in nuclear power plant events. To improve the ability of nuclear safety   
experts to draw conclusions from the collection of IRS national reports, the full text and an image   
database known as AIRS (Advanced Incident Reporting System) were developed. It is planned that this   
database will be available for trial use in the first half of 1995.  
<P>  
A document on national practices in operational safety experience feedback was prepared and will be   
issued as a supplementary document to Safety Series No. 93, <I>Systems for Reporting Unusual Events in   
Nuclear Power Plants.</I>

A new initiative in IRS activities was the holding of a meeting to review and prepare an in-depth study of   
a single event at the international level, in this case the primary system coolant leak event at the Kola-2   
nuclear power plant on 3 March 1994.

The decreasing tendency in the reporting rate to the IRS was discussed at the annual meeting of IRS co-  
ordinators. The co-ordinators agreed that this was a serious threat to the objectives of the IRS. The need   
was stressed for personal commitment on the part of co-ordinators to meet the objectives of the system.    
<P>  
At a Technical Committee meeting held in November, the use of safety indicators for regulatory bodies   
was discussed and it was agreed that safety indicators could be efficiently used to monitor the safety level   
at nuclear power plants. Different levels of safety indicators were considered, including high level (top   
management) and low level (supervisory) indicators.

During 1994, there were six OSART missions, including two safety review missions and seven follow-up   
visits. From 1983, when the first OSART mission was conducted, to the end of 1994, 77 missions to 62   
power plant sites in 28 Member States had been completed and 30 follow-up visits had been carried out.    
<P>  
A fundamental review of the OSART programme was carried out using the services of consultants,   
including consideration of its place in the Agency's services with respect to the Convention on Nuclear   
Safety and means to ensure that the programme effectively meets the current needs of nuclear power   
plants and regulatory authorities.  
<P>  
A new database compiling OSART mission results was presented at a review meeting. The availability of   
the database on diskette and as a hard copy will improve the dissemination of OSART results within the   
nuclear community by facilitating access to and use of the results.

In 1994, six ASSET review missions were carried out at nuclear power plants in Bulgaria (Kozloduy),   
Romania(Cernavoda), Russian Federation (Kalinin), South Africa (Koeberg)and Ukraine (Chernobyl and   
Zaporozhe). One follow-up mission was performed at the Balakovo nuclear power plant in the Russian   
Federation, while 17 training missions were undertaken in 12 countries.   
<P>  
The mission to the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, requested in October 1994, had to be postponed to   
January 1995 owing to a cholera epidemic in the region.    
<P>  
The cycle of ASSET missions to WWER-1000 nuclear power plants will be completed in 1995 with visits   
to the South Ukraine and Rovno plants. Theservices of consultants were used to compile the results  
of ASSET missions to the WWER-1000 plants already visited: Khmelnitsky, Kalinin, Balakovo,   
Zaporozhe and Kozloduy.   
<P>  
The ASSET Users Manual, derived from <I>ASSET Guidelines: Revised 1991 Edition</I>(IAEA-  
TECDOC-632), incorporates the latest refinements in ASSET analysis procedures. This manual is   
intended as a practical tool for: plant managers carrying out their own analysis of plant safety   
performance and producing the standard ASSET report for peer review missions; and members of ASSET   
teams performing analysis missions and drafting the standard ASSET report.    
<P>  
The ASSET option peer review was recommended for adoption at the June meeting of ASSET users.   
ASSET peer review missions do not require root cause analysis of plant safety performance deviations to   
be carried out by external experts, as needed for other options in the ASSET service. The plant   
management requests plant staff to carry out their own analysis according to the procedures of the ASSET   
Users Manual and produce the standard ASSET report, which is submitted to an international ASSET   
mission for peer review.

During 1994, there were five International Peer Review Services (IPERS) PSA review missions and one   
pre-review mission. The reviews considered PSAs for nuclear power plants in Bulgaria, Hungary, the   
Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. They were conducted by international reviewers from   
regulatory bodies, operating organizations, consulting companies and nuclear power plant manufacturers.   
A focus of a major part of the reviews was on PSAs recently developed for WWER type nuclear power   
plants, including the first one for a WWER-1000. One of the reviews considered the IPE (individual plant   
examination) type PSA for the Yonggwang 3 and 4 nuclear power plants in the Republic of Korea.    
<P>  
The IPERS reviews are conducted according to procedures given in the document <I>Procedures for   
Conducting Peer Reviews of Probabilistic Safety Assessment: Guidelines for the IPERS   
Programme</I>(IAEA-TECDOC-543), which was issued in 1990. A revision of this document was   
finalized to include experience gained from completed missions, level 2 and level 3 PSA techniques and   
progress made in PSA methodology and techniques.   
<P>  
One topic attracting great interest is shutdown PSA. The final draft of a shutdown PSA methodology   
guide was approved at a Technical Committee meeting held in Arnhem, Netherlands,in November.  The   
document will be published in the Agency's Safety Series. Also discussed at this meeting was the current

in 1995.  
<P>  
A Technical Committee meeting on advances in reliability analysis for PSA contributed to the preparation   
of a status report on the state-of-the-art of PSA methods and applications. A comprehensive review was   
also carried out of the status of PSA activity in eastern Europe. The review indicated that a major effort is   
currently under way to prepare PSAs for nuclear power plants in this region.

In September, an Assessment of Safety Culture in Organizations Team (ASCOT) review took place in   
parallel with the ASSET mission to the Koeberg nuclear power plant in South Africa. In general, a strong   
effort to promote and enhance safety culture was found at this plant. An indication of this was the   
commendably open interface with the regulatory body, and the Koeberg plant management's  
commitment to achieve and maintain high standards of safety.  
<P>  
A Technical Committee meeting on experience with strengthening safety culture in nuclear power plants   
was organized in June. The purpose of the meeting was to exchange experience in the area of safety   
culture and to encourage agreement on a common position on specific topics. The papers presented at the   
meeting covered a wide range of topics, including experience with assessing and monitoring safety   
culture, as well as practical techniques for changing and improving the safety culture of organizations. A   
report, which will be published as an IAEA-TECDOC, addresses the following topics: the regulatory   
interface and its effect on safety culture; implementing good safety culture in the nuclear industry; and the   
contractors safety culture.

A CRP on the development of safety related expert systems was completed. The various topics in the  
CRP concerned hazard identification, emergency operating procedures, modelling nuclear power plant   
behaviour during transients, verification and validation, as well as diagnosis, human factors and PSA. The   
results of the CRP indicate that expert systems can be used for safety related applications. However, before   
implementation in nuclear installations, user acceptance and regulatory concerns must be dealt with.

The Agency's Component Reliability Database continued to be an important source of data for PSA and   
safety analysis. The database will be expanded in the future to include common cause failure data. A   
technical document containing component failure data collected at 15 research reactors in 10 countries   
was prepared. This document is expected to become a major source of data for research reactor safety   
studies worldwide.

In response to comments from the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG), the draft of a   
document on the development of safety principles for the design of future nuclear power plants was   
revised at an Advisory Group meeting and by consultants. This document was prepared in response to   
General Conference Resolutions GC(XXXV)/RES/553 and GC(XXXVI)/RES/582. The document   
presents two complementary technical objectives for future nuclear power plants, the first applying to all   
plants and the second intended primarily for future nuclear power plants. The first technical safety   
objective addresses the prevention and mitigation of accidents, both within and beyond the traditional   
deterministic design basis, with its critical focus on the objective of protecting public health and safety.   
The second complementary design objective has as its focus the minimization of off-site effects. Explicitly   
considered are certain severe accidents in the design of the plant -- severe accidents addressed in the  
design.   
<P>  
A survey was carried out using the services of consultants on the safety aspects of designs for future LWRs   
(innovative reactors). The term innovative is used in accordance with the definition developed by the   
Agency referring to reactors with radical changes in safety systems for which prototype demonstrations   
are feasible. Among the innovative designs considered are: PIUS (Sweden), VPBER-600 (Russian   
Federation) and ISIS (Italy). There were detailed analyses of safety features, plant response to important   
sequences, PSA aspects, research and development activities and regulatory aspects.

<I>WWER-440/230 programme:</I> A report was prepared on safety improvements to WWER-440/230   
nuclear power plants containing the results of follow-up missions to the Bohunice, Kola, Kozloduy and   
Novovoronezh nuclear power plants and the findings of the Agency review of major safety upgrading for   
the Bohunice plant. On the basis of earlier identified safety issues, the report describes the plant specific   
situation, including remedial actions taken by the plant authorities, and remaining safety concerns.  
Conclusions on the progress achieved and the actions remaining to solve the issues at the various plants   
are presented. Areas of operational experience and PSA studies are also summarizad in the report.   
<P>  
A follow-up mission was conducted to the Kola nuclear power plant to assess the safety improvements   
made against the list of safety measures given in IAEA-TECDOC-640, <I>Ranking of Safety  
Issues for WWER-440 Model 230 Nuclear Power Plants</I>. It was found that in the design area, only   
about one third of the issues specified had been either partially or fully implemented, though  
the remaining issues are expected to be addressed in the future. It was recommended that compensatory   
measures be implemented as soon as possible and close attention be paid to the integrity of the  
reactor pressure vessel.     
<P>  
A mission was organized to the Kozloduy plant to update information on the  status of upgrading   
measures. Relevant information was included in the database.  
<P>  
The applicability of the leak before break (LBB) concept was reviewed at the Bohunice and Kozloduy  
nuclear power plants. Guidance for the application of this concept specifying the conditions to be fulfilled   
and the programme needed to implement the LBB concept was prepared.     
<P>  
<I>RBMK programme:</I> In March, the Agency organized a mission to the Chernobyl nuclear  
power plant to review the scope and status of safety modifications implemented and proposed and the   
safety aspects related to plant operation. The review found numerous safety deficiencies in the two  
units of the plant which remain operational, in particular in Unit 1, which is a first generation RBMK   
design.   
<P>  
A safety review mission to the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania was conducted to assess the   
utility of earlier findings and the recommendations of the Agency's RBMK programme for this particular   
power plant. The review covered the following areas: core monitoring and control; pressure boundary   
integrity; accident mitigation; safety and support systems; and instrumentation and control.  
Recommendations were made regarding the safety standards applied to the design and operation of the   
power plant, the exchange of information with other plants and the need to establish adequate control in   
order to ensure orderly and timely implementation of modifications.    
<P>  
A topical meeting on multiple pressure tube rupture in channel type reactors was convened to exchange   
experience on approaches adopted in Member States operating this type of reactor, and review analysis   
methodology, criteria and the results obtained. The review was carried out in two areas: pressure tube   
integrity and the potential for failure propagation; and multiple pressure tube rupture scenarios.   
Recommendations made for further work in this area covered the analysis of accident scenarios which   
could lead to multiple pressure tube rupture, validation of the computer code used and obtaining a better   
understanding of some of the physical phenomena involved.  
<P>  
<I>WWER-1000 programme:</I> The first safety review mission to a WWER-1000 plant was  
conducted in May at the Zaporozhe nuclear power plant. The purpose of the mission was to review plant   
specific design and operational safety issues. The results of the review provided major insights for further   
work. The services of consultants were used to consolidate the Agency's findings and recommendations   
and to identify a list of safety issues for WWER-1000 reactors.  
<P>  
An intercomparison exercise was carried out between the Russian safety standard (OPB-88) and the   
Agency's NUSS codes. The results of this comparison were used as input for documents on safety issues  
for WWER-1000 and WWER-440/213 nuclear power plants.     
<P>  
A core control and protection strategy is of particular interest for the WWER-1000 type  
reactor. A review of the design of core control and protection systems was carried out focusing on core   
design, including burnable absorber and control rod designs, core power distribution and control strategy   
and instrumentation systems.   
<P>  
<I>WWER-440/213 programme:</I> At the request of the Slovak safety authorities, the Agency   
organized a review in May of the safety upgrading measures proposed for the Mochovce nuclear power   
plant. It was concluded that the improvements suggested correctly addressed the issues and most of the   
proposed measures were endorsed.     
<P>  
An analysis was made of the safety issues for WWER-440/213 reactors, compiling the results of reports   
and various studies. The issues were ranked according to their safety significance based on degradation of   
defence-in-depth and safety function performance.   
<P>  
The bubbler-condenser is a key element in the safety of WWER-440/213 nuclear power plants. In   
recognition of this, preparation was started of guidelines on the evaluation of the bubbler-condenser   
metallic structure. An in-depth study of its strength was undertaken to determine possible weak points and   
the safety improvement measures required.  
<P>  
<I>Database on technical information:</I> The results of the WWER and RBMK programmes are   
incorporated in a computerized database which contains different sets of recommendations addressing the   
safety issues and information on plant status. A questionnaire was prepared to update information on plant   
status for WWER-440/230 type reactors.   
<P>  
A workshop was organized in Vienna on the use of Agency databases on safety issues to provide training   
and to discuss data collection procedures. Recommendations were made to prepare a user friendly format   
for interrogation, which was later implemented for the database on safety issues of WWER-440/230   
nuclear power plants.  
<P>  
In co-operation with the G-24 Nuclear Safety Assistance Co-ordination Secretariat, the Agency   
participated in the preparation of a procedure to check the accuracy of data in the G-24 Project Data Bank.

Portugal joined the INES information system in July, making a total of 54 countries who are committed to   
the prompt communication of those nuclear events significant for safety (level 2 and above),  
or those significant for the public interest (level 1 and below). In 1994, 63 events were reported to the   
system. Eight events at level 2 occurred at nuclear power plants. Three events reported at levels 2 or 3   
occurred at nuclear facilities other than power plants.  
<P>  
The third meeting of the INES Advisory Committee took place in March. At the meeting, additional   
guidance was drafted for the INES User's Manual. This guidance will be published as an addendum to the   
manual. The use of this guidance is expected to eliminate the overrating or underrating of events in   
nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities.  
<P>  
In order to facilitate prompt and consistent INES rating by the INES co-ordinator at the plant  
level, a computerized analysis procedure, INESAR, was developed for the assessment of the consequences   
for safety (actual and potential) of nuclear events.  
<P>  
At a meeting of Senior Regulators, held during the regular session of the General Conference in  
September, the use of INES by regulatory bodies was discussed. While it was generally agreed that INES   
constitutes a valuable service for the prompt reporting of incidents to the media and the public, it was   
stressed that the strength of INES lies in its promptness, which also defines its limitations. Efforts should   
be made to use INES only for its intended purpose, namely prompt reporting of incidents to the media and   
the general public. In addition, no technical conclusions should be drawn on the basis of statistical   
analyses of INES reports. The matters raised at the Senior Regulators meeting were discussed by the INES   
National Officers at their annual meeting in October. The National Officers also reviewed experience and   
feedback on the use of INES.

<B><A NAME="A1.246">Regular Budget</B></A>
<P>
The General Conference appropriated an amount of $200 103 000 for
the Agency's Regular Budget on the basis of an exchange rate of
12.70 Austrian Schillings to one United States dollar, of which
$195 018 000 was related to Agency programmes. The latter amount
was adjusted to $213 946 000 in accordance with the adjustment
formula presented in the attachment to Resolution
GC(XXXVII)/RES/610 in order to account for the average United
Nations exchange rate of 11.41 Austrian Schillings to one US
dollar which was actually experienced during the year. However,
because of a shortfall in expected contributions, steps were
taken to reduce the budget by 9.3% to $194 048 700.
<P>
The Regular Budget for 1994, at an exchange rate of 11.41
Austrian Schillings to one US dollar, amounted to $219 536 000,
of which $210 863 000 was to be financed from contributions by
Member States on the basis of the 1994 scale of assessment, $5
590 000 from income from reimbursable work for others and $3 083
000 from other miscellaneous income.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.247">Expenditures</B></A>
<P>
The actual expenditures for the Agency's Regular Budget in 1994
amounted to $197 252 145, of which $190 839 587 was related to
the Agency's programmes. In addition, the authority to spend an
amount of $13 468 800 was reserved for Deferred Programme
Activities to be carried out in 1995 if arrears of contributions
would be received in time. The unused budget from Agency
programmes amounted to $9 637 613, whereas the total unused
budget was $8 815 055 after taking into account reimbursable work
for others.
<P>
Total 1993 and 1994 expenditures amounted to $13 967 199 from a
total of $16 254 297 for the 1992 Deferred Programme Activities
related to the Agency's budget. Total expenditures incurred in
1994 amounted to $13 216 058 from a total of $16 662 248 for the
1993 Deferred Programme Activities related to the Agency's
budget.

The target for voluntary contributions to the Technical
Assistance and Co-operation Fund in 1994 was established at $58.5
million, of which $42.4 million was pledged by Member States.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.249">Extrabudgetary contributions</B></A>
<P>
A total of $55 888 877 in extrabudgetary funds was provided by
Member States, the United Nations, other international
organizations and other sources during 1994. Of this amount, $6
844 713 was in support of safeguards, $5 244 093 was for
technical co-operation projects, $2 886 550 for projects in the
field of food and agriculture, $2 584 103 for nuclear safety and
$10 768 125 for the implementation of United Nations Security
Council Resolution 687 on Iraq. In addition to $1 846 154 set
aside for accrued end of service allowances, an amount of $19 088
727 (supplemented by the Agency's contribution of $1 486 828) was
available for the ICTP, and $2 137 646 (supplemented by the
Agency's contribution of $2 626 332) for IAEA-MEL. The remaining
$6 334 920 was in support of various other projects implemented
by the Agency.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.250">Trust funds</B></A>
<P>
In 1994, a total of $126 202 was provided by Member States for
technical assistance and co-operation activities as
funds-in-trust. Furthermore, a total of $1 247 559 was
administered on behalf of research institutions and $2 400 000
for ITER.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.251">Financial Regulations and Financial Rules</B></A>
<P>
The Agency's Financial Regulations, which have governed the
financial administration of the Agency's activities, included a
number of provisions reflecting neither the practices of the
Agency's organs nor the Agency's budget and financing structure.
A comprehensive review of the Regulations and Rules was thus
initiated in mid-1993, in accordance with an action plan and
timetable determined by the Board of Governors. Following
extensive consultations with the Board and Member States, the
revised Financial Regulations, which represent a complete
overhaul of the previous Regulations, were adopted by the Board
in September 1994 and became operative on 1 January 1995. The
Interim Financial Rules have also been reviewed in the light of
the newly adopted Financial Regulations; the new Rules came into
effect on the same date.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.252">Personnel</B></A>
<P>
At the end of 1994 the number of members of the Secretariat was
2248  861 in the Professional and higher categories and 1387 in
the General Service category. These figures represent: regular
staff (1671), temporary assistance staff (148), extrabudgetary
(326), cost-free experts (76) and consultants (27). Among the 622
staff members in posts subject to geographical distribution, 87
nationalities were represented.
<P>
The General Conference adopted resolutions GC(XXXVIII)/RES/12 and
GC(XXXVIII)/RES/13 which request the Director General to
intensify his efforts and take specific measures to increase the
staff drawn from developing countries and the number of women in
the Secretariat. A number of steps were taken internally as well
as in respect of Member States to facilitate the implementation
of these resolutions. In particular, the services of a consultant
were used to carry out a qualitative assessment of a
representative sample of applications received from people in
developing countries. The report indicated that no cases of
discrimination against an applicant from a developing country or
a female applicant had been found. Also, a cost-free expert was
provided by a Member State for a period of six months to develop
an action plan to improve the representation of women in the
Agency. A report was submitted in November.
<P>
At the end of 1994 the percentage of women among the Professional
staff was 16.7%; at the same time developing countries provided
31.8% of the staff subject to geographical distribution.
With funds from the deferred programmes, training continued
through 1994 with the delivery of further courses on the
essentials of management in which 60 middle level managers
participated. Training in the analysis of programme performance
(Programme Performance Assessment System) was completed for 97
project managers. Skills training in interviewing, presentation
and non-technical writing was introduced and 165 staff members
benefitted from these courses. In addition, approval was granted
for external training in programme specific areas to 20 staff
members. Induction Courses and Insight Series for orientation
purposes were held for 217 staff members. Training provided in
the above areas reached 22.2% of staff during 1994. In addition,
more than 200 staff members participated in language training in
the official languages as well as in German.
<P>
The personnel part of the new payroll/personnel system, developed
by an outside company with financial support from Germany, became
available.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.253">Management services</B></A>
<P>
A total of 12 projects aimed at promoting good management and
cost effective working practices were completed during the year.
In addition to management and efficiency reviews in various areas
of the Secretariat, project support was provided for the
introduction of new administrative systems and procedures,
notably in the areas of procurement, home leave entitlement and
information technology management.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.254">Liability for nuclear damage</B></A>
<P>
The Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage
concentrated on the proposals for the revision of the Vienna
Convention of 21 May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage
and the establishment of a supplementary compensation system. The
consideration of the two issues continued, for the time being, in
an integrated manner with a view to finalizing the preparatory
work in time to submit them to the same diplomatic conference.
The proposals on international State liability and its
relationship to the civil liability regime were not directly
addressed but remained before the Committee for consideration in
the context of the Vienna Convention revision.
<P>
In the absence of agreement on the basis of the initial proposals
regarding a supplementary funding convention, i.e. the "levy" and
"pool" drafts, the Standing Committee, in order to expedite
negotiations, considered new approaches to the structure of
compensation under both the revised Vienna Convention and a
supplementary funding system. In particular, it was agreed to
insert the installation State tier in the revised Vienna
Convention, and on the basis of this, a new single draft
convention on supplementary funding was prepared for further
discussion. It is linked to the Vienna and Paris conventions and
envisages an additional level of compensation provided by all
States Parties collectively in accordance with an agreed formula
(the "collective State contributions" draft). As the draft
contains alternative formulations on some fundamental issues such
as geographical scope, and a system of and criteria for
contributions, including the status of States without nuclear
installations in this regard, it was agreed to take decisions,
within the mandate of the Committee, at its forthcoming session.
<P>
The Standing Committee also considered a new proposal for a
convention on supplementary compensation for transboundary
nuclear damage from a nuclear incident at a civil nuclear power
plant (the "umbrella" draft). This draft convention sets out
basic principles of nuclear liability in a manner allowing
adherence to it regardless of participation in other
international agreements on nuclear liability. The Standing
Committee agreed to continue in-depth discussion of the
"umbrella" draft, including its relationship to existing
conventions.
<P>
Several Member States from Latin America stated that they were
studying the creation of a regional mechanism for nuclear
liability taking into account the characteristics of their
nuclear sectors. In their opinion the formula for a worldwide
supplementary funding system should be compatible with the
regional approach.
<P>
During the consideration of the question of nuclear liability by
the Board of Governors in June and the thirty-eighth regular
session of the General Conference, the Standing Committee was
urged to expedite general agreement and completion of the
preparatory work so that the diplomatic conference could be
convened at an early date. In the meantime, further adherences to
the existing instruments on nuclear liability were welcomed. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.255">Convention on Nuclear Safety</B></A>
<P>
The Group of Experts on a Nuclear Safety Convention, set up by
the Board of Governors in 1992, completed the task of finalizing
a draft text of a convention in January 1994. The Board of
Governors at its February session requested the Director General
to convene a diplomatic conference in June 1994 for the purpose
of adopting the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The four day
Diplomatic Conference adopted the Convention on 17 June 1994
without a vote. The Convention was then opened for signature on
20 September 1994, in conjunction with the thirty eighth regular
session of the General Conference. By the end of 1994, 54 States
had signed the Convention and one had ratified it. It will enter
into force on the 90th day after deposit of the 22nd instrument
of ratification, acceptance or approval, including the
instruments of 17 States each having at least one nuclear
installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core.
<P>
The Convention provides that it shall apply to "nuclear
installations", defined as "land-based civil nuclear power
plants". The obligations of the Contracting Parties are based to
a large extent on the principles contained in the Safety
Fundamentals document The Safety of Nuclear Installations. They
include, in particular, the obligation to establish and maintain
a legislative and regulatory framework for nuclear installations
and the obligation to implement a number of measures, based on
general safety considerations, regarding, for example, the
availability of financial and human resources, the assessment and
verification of safety, quality assurance and emergency
preparedness. Other obligations concern technical aspects of the
safety of nuclear installations, including siting, design,
construction and operation.
<P>
For the Agency, the most relevant feature is that the Convention
provides for an obligation of the Contracting Parties to submit
reports on the implementation of the Convention for review at
meetings of the Contracting Parties: the Convention provides that
after its entry into force the Contracting Parties shall hold, at
regular intervals, meetings for the purpose of reviewing national
reports to be submitted by each Contracting Party on the measures
taken by it in fulfilling its obligations under the Convention.
The Agency will provide the secretariat for these meetings. The
Convention also provides that the Director General of the Agency
shall be the Depositary of the Convention.

4 April 1990, was accepted by two States during 1994. By the end
of the year 19 States had accepted the Agreement. 
<P>
The Agreement to Extend the Regional Co-operative Agreement for
Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and
Technology, 1987 (RCA) (reproduced in document INFCIRC/167/Add.
15), entered into force on 11 June 1992. By the end of the year 3
States had accepted the Agreement, bringing to 17 the total
number of acceptances.
<P>
The Convention on Nuclear Safety (reproduced in document
INFCIRC/449) was signed by 54 States and ratified by 1.

<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.258">General</B></A>
<P>
The most significant development during 1994 in the Agency's
technical co-operation activities was the approval by the Board
of Governors of the 19951996 Technical Co-operation Programme,
including 11 new model projects. These additional model projects
join the original group of 12 that began implementation in 1994
and continue the commitment to the model project concept in new
areas of nuclear technology. The new model projects were
formulated to address high priority national objectives and
reflect substantial national commitment to achieving results.
<P>
In September, the Third Technical Co-operation Policy Review
Seminar was held. The discussions concentrated on three priority
topics: the establishment of action plans to develop radiation
protection and waste management infrastructures for Member
States; the introduction of medium term country plans to ensure
that the Agency's technical co-operation activities are fully
linked to a country's sectoral or national development
objectives; and methods and means for ensuring that maximum
impact occurs to beneficiaries from the Agency's technical
co-operation projects. The event provided important guidance in
the formulation of follow-up activities and strategies, which
were later outlined at the November meeting of the Technical
Assistance and Co-operation Committee.
<P>
In recent years, the emphasis in global technical co-operation
has been on water resources, food security, health and nutrition,
the environment and the alleviation of poverty. The Agency's
technical co-operation programme for 19951996 reflects a clear
orientation towards these priorities, as well as the Agency's
efforts to create programme links with multilateral and bilateral
development organizations, and with sources of supplemental
financing such as the International Fund for Agricultural
Development and the Global Environment Facility.
<P>
The dependence of countries of eastern Europe and the former USSR
on WWER and RBMK reactors is considerable. In 1994, a principal
aim of technical co-operation activities in Europe and the
countries of the former USSR was the identification of design and
operational shortcomings of these reactors and their safety
significance and the assessment of the completeness and adequacy
of the safety improvements proposed or being implemented. The
results of these activities have played an important role in
focusing national and international attention on the need to
achieve and maintain high levels of nuclear safety, and have
provided new guidance and assistance to national nuclear safety
authorities.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.259">Resources and Implementation</B></A>
<P>
Total new resources available for technical co-operation totalled
$52.8 million, a slight reduction from 1993. Funding was higher
by 7% than in the previous year for assistance in-kind, funds
from UNDP increased by 29%, and miscellaneous income rose by
192%, owing entirely to positive gains on exchange of currencies
compared to last year's losses. The Technical Assistance and
Co-operation Fund (TACF) increased by 2%, while extrabudgetary
funding declined by 23% to the second lowest level in 12 years.
The major source of technical co-operation funds continued to be
the TACF with 84.7%, but the share of the $58 500 000 target
actually pledged dropped to 72.5%, a significant decline from the
76.5% achieved in 1993.
<P>
The adjusted programme, which includes assistance brought
forward, totalled $78 million at the end of the year. Overall
implementation against this was 69.7%, the highest level ever
achieved. As illustrated below, total new obligations climbed to
over $54.3 million, an increase of almost $9 million over the
previous year. During the last two years the volume of new
obligations has increased by almost $20 million, while the rate
of financial implementation has risen from 59% to almost 70%. The
unobligated balance of the TACF, after rising significantly in
1992 and 1993, was reduced to $18.3 million in 1994. Further
efforts in the coming two year cycle will be made to reduce this
to about $15 million, which is the amount necessary to meet
financial exigencies.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.260">Programme delivery and support</B></A>
<P>
During 1994, there were 1192 operational projects. This programme
was comprised of 1114 projects continued from 1993 plus 9 newly
approved core model projects for the second year of the biennial
cycle, and 47 training courses, 5 footnote-a/ projects, 17
Reserve Fund projects and one UNDP project. During the year, 289
projects were completed and 20 projects were cancelled.
<P>
A record number of 3205 expert and lecturer assignments were
carried out by 2022 individuals for a total of 1288 months.
Fellowships, scientific visits and training courses provided 4316
months of training to 2785 persons. The total number of training
courses was 127. This training programme included 18
interregional, 95 regional and 14 national courses.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.261">Technical co-operation programme delivery</A></B>
<P>
The technical officers in the Department of Research and Isotopes
supported 780 projects and those in the Department of Nuclear
Energy and Safety supported 366. A total of 1604 fellowship applications
were evaluated, and Agency staff members undertook 583
assignments for a total in excess of 132 months. The volume of
project actions requiring technical intervention is increasing
and the Agency is taking steps to provide systematic support to
the co-ordination function, including joint work planning and
sectoral programming. This has become even more important in view
of the 23 ongoing and new model projects planned by the end of
the year.
<P>
Assistance to the different regions reflected shifts to Africa
and Europe. Asia and the Pacific continued to receive the largest
share, with 24.8%, but Africa again increased its share to 24.3%,
the highest level yet achieved.
<P>
The largest share of disbursements in 1994 was for safety related
activities comprising radioactive waste management, radiation
protection and the safety of nuclear installations, which
increased to 22.9% of total disbursements. The volume of
disbursements for food and agriculture increased by over 30%, but
the 22.4% share of total disbursements placed this traditionally
important activity slightly behind safety. Physical and chemical
sciences accounted for 17.3% of the total. Other significant
programmes included human health with 13.1%, and industry and
earth sciences with 12.1%.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.262">Evaluation</B></A>
<P>
The evaluation activities carried out in 1994 covered eight
national and regional projects, through both desk and field
evaluation exercises. These evaluations included major technical
sectors, such as human health, industrial applications, design,
production, calibration and maintenance of nuclear instruments,
as well as the RAPAT/WAMAP programmes in four countries.
<P>
Several in-depth evaluations were conducted on: non-destructive
testing projects in several countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean; environmental monitoring in the Middle East; and the
impact of nuclear related technologies in the industrial sector
in the Asia and Pacific region. A major finding of the 1994
evaluation exercises was the need to improve national commitment
so as to ensure the sustainability of the Agency's technical
assistance.
<P>
Twelve country programme summaries were prepared in 1994. The
routine monitoring activities of operational projects included
follow-up of some 200 projects through the Interim Project
Implementation Report (IPIR) system, which identified valuable
information about the difficulties being encountered, thus
enabling corrective actions. Additionally, 24 interregional and
AFRA courses were monitored through follow-up questionnaires.
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="A1.263">SPECIALIZED SERVICE ACTIVITIES</H3></A>
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.264">Public Information</B></A>
<P>
Public and media interest in the Agency's activities remained at
a high level throughout the year regarding safeguards inspections
in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and that country's
withdrawal from the Agency. Illicit trafficking in nuclear
materials was a further subject prompting frequent dealings with
the media. Non-proliferation overall was an item of growing
importance.
<P>
The follow-up work and monitoring activities in Iraq under
Security Council Resolution 687 attracted recurring attention,
albeit at a lower level of intensity. A  documentary film
entitled Mission Iraq was completed, and was used by many
television stations. A didactic film  on the transport of
radioactive materials  was also completed.
<P>
Safety concerns and the Agency's involvement in safety related
matters (visits to reactors, analyses, the nuclear safety
convention, etc.) were also high on the public information
agenda. Emphasis was additionally placed on the ongoing
reorientation of the Agency's technical co-operation programme.
This was reflected in publications covering technology transfer
(especially health related) as well as radiation applications.
<P>
Under the enhanced public information programme, seminars on
nuclear energy were held in Bulgaria, Egypt, Morocco and the
Philippines.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.265">INIS</B></A>
<P>
Croatia, Lebanon and Lithuania joined INIS during 1994 (while the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea is no longer a member). The
number of participating Member States is therefore 88, together
with 17 international organizations.
<P>
A total of 77 107 records of the published literature were added
to the INIS database and announced in the abstracting journal
INIS Atomindex, bringing the total number of records available in
the database to 1 777 185.
<P>
New versions of the FIBRE software for input preparation were
finalized. Version 2.1 was made available to all Member States
who use FIBRE for input preparation to the database. The
Developer's Edition of the software has been completed and can be
used to prepare input to INIS-like databases.
<P>
The INIS database was sent on tape or cartridge to 21 INIS
members. Through arrangements made by a number of Member States
with database hosts, the INIS database is available on-line in
many countries from various commercial and non-commercial
sources. It also continues to be available on-line from the
Agency's computer in Vienna, where it was used by external users
for a total connect-time of about 230 hours in 1994.
<P>
The INIS Clearinghouse distributed the full text of
non-conventional literature (reports, dissertations, etc.) on
microfiche with a volume of about 432 000 microfiche,
representing 23.5 million printed pages of documents. Twenty-nine
INIS members have standing orders for the full microfiche
collection. By the end of 1994, the number of documents available
on microfiche was almost 292 000.
<P>
At the invitation of the Government of India, the 22nd
Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers was held in New
Delhi in April. The Liaison Officers discussed and made
recommendations on:
<UL>
<LI>Strategy for training activities;
<LI>Production and distribution of the INIS database on compact 1disc (CD-ROM);
<LI>Simplification of input procedures;
<LI>Redefinition of the subject scope in the area of nuclear weapons reduction and conversion;
<LI>INIS future development.
</UL>
<P>
An INIS Advisory Committee meeting held in Vienna discussed and
approved a new statement defining the "mission" of the INIS
system. This new mission foresees the provision of nuclear
information services to the Agency's Member States based not only
on products derived from a single bibliographic database, but
also the provision of services through alternative mechanisms
tapping into other sources of bibliographic data and related
nuclear information. Within the framework of this new mission
statement, the Advisory Committee made recommendations that will
guide strategic developments for INIS in the next five years.
<P>
A very large project was executed during the year in an attempt
to establish the nuclear information needs of users of the system
throughout the world. Some 25 000 questionnaires were distributed
in 87 Member States. In part with outside contractual assistance,
the results of the User Needs Study were analysed and an
evaluation report prepared.
<P>
With the participation of the national INIS centres of Australia,
France, the Russian Federation and Spain, the Secretariat
conducted a subject search study to ascertain how search points
provided by the INIS records in the database are used for
retrieving specific information according to subject relevance.
The study analysed over 1000 search query formulations.
<P>
The feasibility study for the electronic storage of the full text
of non-conventional literature was completed in 1994. Following
the suggestions of the consultants that outlined requirements for
a pilot study, the Secretariat sought bids from appropriate
commercial enterprises; a selection has been made and plans are
set for the implementation of the pilot project.

<B><A NAME="A1.267">Library services</B></A>
<P>
After a year of planning and preparation, the VICLION integrated
library system became operational. The on-line catalogue was
released in February with remote access from offices in the VIC
following shortly thereafter. Throughout the year, a number of
data cleanup and data transfer projects were undertaken. The
acquisitions module was implemented to replace outdated mainframe
software. In order to better serve the library users, small
specialized collections were established throughout the VIC and
reflected in the on-line catalogue. Numerous collections of
information were made available via CD-ROM and a pilot CD-ROM
network was implemented to explore the possibilities for
decentralized access to these resources.
<P>
A costbenefit review of the Library's exchange agreements was
conducted. These agreements authorize exchange of Agency
publications in return for receipt of valuable publications from
the exchange partner organizations.
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.268">Central computer services</B></A>
<P>
The major goal in 1994 for the central computer services was to
complete the implementation of the Standard Technology
Architecture (STA) five-year plan which was approved in 1991. The
infrastructure to support STA was in operation in almost all of
the Agency by the end of 1994.
<P>
Following the goal to upgrade departmental computing services by
1996 and thereby decrease the need for central mainframe
computers, four major systems were moved to LAN based
environments in 1994: the Library, Payroll, the Power Reactor
Information System, and the Energy and Economic Database. Further
LAN based systems were in development. Modern information
technology is being used to enhance programme operations. For
example, in 1994 the Advanced Incident Reporting System was
developed; it includes full text and graphics and hypertext links
to relevant incident reports.
<P>
Electronic mail (e-mail) was introduced as a service under STA in
mid-1993. By the end of 1994 almost all the staff in the Agency
had access to e-mail. E-mail was approved as an official
communications medium and substantive communications are now
handled through this medium according to usual Agency policy.
<P>
The Agency expanded its international networking services
significantly in 1994. Several Agency information sources, such
as vacancy notices, press releases, INIS and nuclear data
databases, were made available to the international community via
the Internet, through the "Gopher" service, and work is in
progress to implement several World-Wide-Web services and
electronic document distribution in 1995. 
<P>
During 1994, the central computer services increased the Agency's
role as provider of computer services to the VIC. The Agency
resumed operation of UNIDO's mainframe computer services in early
1994 and continued to operate the central LAN servers for the
United Nations Office at Vienna (UNOV) and the United Nations
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).
<P>
<B><A NAME="A1.269">Publishing</B></A>
<P>
Some two hundred titles and journal issues were prepared for
press and published. In addition to those listed or mentioned in
other parts of The Annual Report for 1994, four books were
published in French, ten in Russian and nine in Spanish.
<P>
Of particular note amongst the books published in 1994 were:
<UL>
<LI>The Law and Practices of the International Atomic Energy
Agency 19701980. Supplement 1 to the 1970 edition of Legal
Series No. 7

<H2>Matters Relating to the Board of Governors and the General Conference</H2>
<I>Excerpt from the IAEA Annual Report for 1994</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
It was another productive and busy year for the Agency's Policy-making Organs --the Board of Governors and the General Conference. In addition to the scheduled meetings of the Board, three additional meetings were held, exclusively devoted to the implementation of Agency safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Decisions and resolutions adopted by the Agency's Policy-making Organs were followed up in the Secretariat.  However, some matters not explicitly dealt with elsewhere are mentioned here.
<P>
The following States became Members of the Agency by depositing an instrument of ratification of the Agency's Statute: Kazakhstan, the Marshall Islands, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Uzbekistan and Yemen. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea withdrew from membership of the Agency on 13 June 1994.
<P>
In February, the Board adopted measures relating to arrangements for the preparation of agendas of the Board. No changes were made to the Rules of Procedure. However, changes were made to the scheduling of Board sessions and the distribution of agenda items between the different sessions so that individual sessions would be able to focus on particular issues. In addition, deadlines were set for the issue, in all working languages, of the provisional agendas and documents requiring Board action. It was further decided that the Secretariat will submit to the Board before the end of each session a list of items expected to be brought before the Board at its next session. At the same meeting, the Board streamlined the manner in which the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee and the Administrative and Budgetary Committee report to it.  
<P>
Discussions were also held both in the Board and in the General Conference on a review of Article VI of the Statute as a whole relating to the possible expansion of the Board, on long term arrangements for the financing of safeguards and on the financing of technical assistance through more predictable and assured resources.  Working groups were set up to deal with each of these issues and their reports were submitted through the Board to the General Conference at its thirty-eighth regular session in September. At the request of the General Conference, the Board re-established the informal working groups on the financing of safeguards and on the financing of technical assistance, and also established an open-ended consultative group on Article VI of the Statute with a view to submission by the Board of recommendations on proposed amendments to Article Vl for approval by the General Conference in 1995.

  <HR NOSHADE>
  <FONT SIZE=+2><B>L</B></FONT>a population mondiale a pratiquement
doubl&eacute; au cours des trente derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es et la progression va se
poursuivre. Selon les estimations actuelles, la plan&egrave;te comptera environ 8,1 milliards
d'individus en 2020 sous l'effet d'un accroissement d'&eacute;mographique &agrave; mettre
pour 90% au compte des pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Dans ces derniers, la consommation
actuelle d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; par personne, qui peut &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;e comme
un indicateur du niveau de vie, est tr&egrave;s faible (de 10 &agrave; 100 fois moindre que
dans les pays industrialis&eacute;s). Outre les besoins &agrave; satisfaire en priorit&eacute;,
tels que la nourriture, le v&ecirc;tement, le logement et le travail, la disponibilit&eacute;
d &eacute;nergie est, dans le monde entier, une importante condition pr&eacute;alable au
d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et social.
<P> 
Selon leur situation g&eacute;ographique et leur niveau d'industrialisation, les pays utilisent
l'&eacute;nergie finale pour l'&eacute;clairage, pour les transports ou pour le chauffage.
Parmi les diverses sources d'&eacute;nergie qu ils peuvent choisir, le nucl&eacute;aire est
l'une des quelques options qui fournit un moyen de produire de l'&eacute;nergie sous toutes
ses formes   par exemple &eacute;lectricit&eacute;, chaleur industrielle &agrave; faible et
haute temp&eacute;rature, vapeur industrielle   &agrave; la fois &eacute;conomiquement et
dans des conditions acceptables pour l'environnement. Les pr&eacute;occupations
&eacute;cologiques suscit&eacute;es par les effets des &eacute;nergies fossiles ont conduit
&agrave; s'int&eacute;resser aux sources d'&eacute;nergie peu polluantes. La poursuite du
d&eacute;veloppement et de l'utilisation de l'&eacute;nergie nucl&eacute;aire peut donc
&ecirc;tre pour certains pays une solution attrayante contribuant &agrave; un
approvisionnement durable, s&ucirc;r et fiable en &eacute;nergie.
<P>
Les syst&egrave;mes d'&eacute;nergie nucl&eacute;aire existants, &eacute;conomiques et
fiables, ont permis depuis trente ans d'accumuler des milliers d'ann&eacute;es de
r&eacute;acteur d'exp&eacute;rience en mati&egrave;re d'exploitation. De nouvelles
g&eacute;n&eacute;rations de centrales nucl&eacute;aires, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant de ces
ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents, ont &eacute;t&eacute; ou sont mises au point, et les nouveaux
mod&egrave;les de type avanc&eacute; devraient donc devenir plus s&ucirc;rs, plus
&eacute;conomiques et plus fiables encore que leurs pr&eacute;d&eacute;cesseurs.
<P>
En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, les mod&egrave;les avanc&eacute;s ont des
caract&eacute;ristiques de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; am&eacute;lior&eacute;es, en particulier des
dispositifs qui laisseront aux op&eacute;rateurs plus de temps pour ex&eacute;cuter des
actions de s&ucirc;ret&eacute;, et qui fourniront une plus grande protection encore contre
des rejets &eacute;ventuels de substances radioactives dans l'environnement. Ils peuvent
&eacute;galement &ecirc;tre dot&eacute;s de syst&egrave;mes de s&ucirc;ret&eacute;
passive fond&eacute;s sur des forces naturelles comme la convection et la gravit&eacute;, ce
qui rend les fonctions de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; moins tributaires de syst&egrave;mes et de
composants actifs tels que des pompes et des soupapes.
<P>
On s'attache beaucoup &agrave; rendre les nouvelles centrales plus faciles &agrave;
exploiter, &agrave; inspecter, &agrave; entretenir et &agrave; r&eacute;parer, de fa&ccedil;on
&agrave; accro&icirc;tre leur rentabilit&eacute; globale. En cas d'anomalies ou d'accidents,
des syst&egrave;mes de commande, de surveillance et de protection en grande
partie num&eacute;ris&eacute;s ram&egrave;neront directement la centrale aux conditions
normales ou &agrave; un &eacute;tat d'arr&ecirc;t s&ucirc;r. L'id&eacute;e est de faire
en sorte que les op&eacute;rateurs puissent disposer d'au moins trente minutes
avant que leur intervention devienne n&eacute;cessaire, ce qui leur laissera le temps
d'&eacute;valuer soigneusement la situation avant d'agir. L'accroissement de l'inertie
thermique du r&eacute;acteur et la diminution des densit&eacute;s de puissance du coeur,
par exemple, vont dans ce sens.
<P>
Pour ce qui est des dispositifs de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; passive, leur fonction sera normalement
ind&eacute;pendante elle aussi de l'alimentation &eacute;lectrique (du moins apr&egrave;s
avoir &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;clench&eacute;e), gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'utilisation de
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes thermohydrauliques tels que les diff&eacute;rences de
densit&eacute; r&eacute;sultant de diff&eacute;rences de temp&eacute;ratures, et de
r&eacute;servoirs d'eau sur&eacute;lev&eacute;s, par exemple, pour alimenter le circuit de
refroidissement du r&eacute;acteur en maintenant le niveau du fluide caloporteur.
<P>
La mise au point d'un nouveau mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;acteur est une t&acirc;che
co&ucirc;teuse et difficile qui exige beaucoup de ressources. C'est pourquoi la
coop&eacute;ration, au niveau national ou international, est une formule souvent retenue, qui
a fait la preuve de ses avantages. En tant que tribune internationale pour l'&eacute;change de
renseignements scientifiques et techniques, l'Agence internationale de l'&eacute;nergie
atomique (AIEA) joue en la mati&egrave;re un r&ocirc;le de premier plan. Elle rassemble
des experts du monde entier qui &eacute;changent des informations sur les programmes
nationaux, et co-ordonnent les programmes de recherche portant sur des projets de mise au
point de r&eacute;acteurs avanc&eacute;s.
<A NAME="note_a"><P>
<B>Mod&egrave;les avanc&eacute;s</B>
<P></A>                     
Un moyen de satisfaire les besoins futurs en &eacute;nergie est de d&eacute;velopper
progressivement l'utilisation de l'&eacute;nergie nucl&eacute;aire en introduisant dans les
syst&egrave;mes de fourniture d'&eacute;nergie du monde entier des mod&egrave;les
avanc&eacute;s. On notera &agrave; ce propos qu un mod&egrave;le avanc&eacute; est un
mod&egrave;le dont la conception est d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t actuel, mais qui n a pas
encore &eacute;t&eacute; construit ou exploit&eacute;; parmi les mod&egrave;les
avanc&eacute;s, on distingue les mod&egrave;les &eacute;volutifs et les mod&egrave;les
innovants. Les mod&egrave;les &eacute;volutifs s'inspirent d'une centrale existante dont la
conception est am&eacute;lior&eacute;e et modifi&eacute;e en fonction de
l'exp&eacute;rience acquise et des progr&egrave;s technologiques; ils exigent tout au plus des
essais techniques et des essais de confirmation avant d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s
&agrave; l'&eacute;chelle industrielle. Les mod&egrave;les innovants s'&eacute;cartent
davantage des mod&egrave;les connus, et peuvent exiger la construction d'une installation de
d&eacute;monstration et/ou d'un prototype avant d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s
&agrave; l'&eacute;chelle industrielle. Un mod&egrave;le innovant qui pr&eacute;sente des
modifications radicales en mati&egrave;re de conception peut &ecirc;tre qualifi&eacute; de
<I>r&eacute;volutionnaire</I> et constitue une sous-cat&eacute;gorie particuli&egrave;re.
<P>
<UL>
Les mod&egrave;les avanc&eacute;s actuellement en d&eacute;veloppement comprennent
essentiellement trois types de r&eacute;acteurs:
<P>
<LI>Les r&eacute;acteurs refroidis par eau;
<P>
<LI>Les r&eacute;acteurs rapides;
<P>
<LI>Les r&eacute;acteurs refroidis par gaz.
</UL>
<P>
<B>R&eacute;acteurs refroidis par eau</B>
<P>
Les r&eacute;acteurs refroidis par eau se caract&eacute;risent par l'utilisation de l'eau
comme mod&eacute;rateur, comme fluide caloporteur ou bien les deux: eau <I>ordinaire</I>
(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) dans les r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; eau ordinaire (REO) et eau
lourde (D<SUB>2</SUB>O), du moins comme mod&eacute;rateur, dans les
r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; eau lourde (REL). Dans l'eau lourde, les atomes d
hydrog&egrave;ne (H<SUB>2</SUB>) sont remplac&eacute;s par des atomes de
deut&eacute;rium (D<SUB>2</SUB>), qui est un isotope lourd de l'hydrog&egrave;ne.
<P>
Il y a actuellement dans le monde quelque 330 centrales &eacute;quip&eacute;es de REO en
exploitation, ce qui repr&eacute;sente environ 75% du parc de centrales nucl&eacute;aires en
service. Ce sont les am&eacute;liorations constantes de ce type de r&eacute;acteur,
exploit&eacute; depuis plus de trente-cinq ans, qui sont &agrave; la base de la conception des
REO de type avanc&eacute;, qu il s'agisse de r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; eau bouillante
(REB) ou de r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; eau sous pression (REP).
<P>
Les travaux actuels portent &agrave; la fois sur les r&eacute;acteurs de forte et moyenne
puissance; les premiers seront en quelque sorte des prolongements de mod&egrave;les
existants, tandis que les seconds se caract&eacute;riseront par l'utilisation de dispositifs de
s&ucirc;ret&eacute; passive, l'objectif &eacute;tant de simplifier la centrale et de
r&eacute;aliser des &eacute;conomies pour lui permettre, malgr&eacute; une puissance
moindre, de devenir comp&eacute;titive au niveau des co&ucirc;ts. Certains mod&egrave;les
innovants, en particulier les mod&egrave;les r&eacute;volutionnaires, tel le r&eacute;acteur
&agrave; eau ordinaire su&eacute;dois PIUS, incorporent des fonctions de
s&ucirc;ret&eacute; qui diff&egrave;rent, par leur nature, des dispositifs traditionnels que l'on
trouve dans les mod&egrave;les existants, par exemple des fonctions d'autoprotection pour
l'arr&ecirc;t du r&eacute;acteur en cas de conditions d'exploitation inacceptables et pour
l'extraction fiable de la chaleur de d&eacute;croissance (chaleur qui se d&eacute;veloppe dans
le combustible apr&egrave;s l'arr&ecirc;t) du coeur.

Les centrales en exploitation n'ont cess&eacute; de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier, au fil des
ann&eacute;es, d'am&eacute;liorations portant sur le combustible. C'est ainsi que l'emploi
accru d'absorbeurs consommables dans le combustible et l'accroissement du taux de
combustion de ce dernier ont entra&icirc;n&eacute; une forte r&eacute;duction de la
consommation d'uranium, de l'ordre de 20% par rapport au chiffre relev&eacute; par
l'Evaluation internationale du cycle du combustible nucl&eacute;aire (INFCE) de 1978/1979.
<P>
Le recyclage du plutonium par l'utilisation de combustible &agrave; oxydes mixtes (MOX)
est devenu courant dans un certain nombre de pays (Allemagne, France et Suisse), et
plusieurs autres pays pourraient suivre leur exemple.
<P>
Les r&eacute;acteurs avanc&eacute;s essaieront normalement de tirer pleinement parti des
progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans le domaine du combustible; la conception de
leur coeur sera optimis&eacute;e, gr&acirc;ce aux strat&eacute;gies d'utilisation
d'absorbeurs
consommables avanc&eacute;s et &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des taux de
combustion. Beaucoup d'entre eux seront capables de fonctionner avec 100% de combustible
MOX dans le coeur.
<P>
Les centrales nucl&eacute;aires &eacute;quip&eacute;es de r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; eau
lourde (en majorit&eacute; de type CANDU, le mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;acteur canadien
&agrave; tubes de force) repr&eacute;sentent environ 7% de toutes les centrales
nucl&eacute;aires en exploitation. Elles ont pour la plupart fonctionn&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on
s&ucirc;re, fiable et comp&eacute;titive depuis leur d&eacute;marrage initial.
<P>
Les am&eacute;liorations de la conception des r&eacute;acteurs de type CANDU visent
&agrave; renforcer la s&ucirc;ret&eacute; de la centrale, porter sa dur&eacute;e de vie jusqu'
&agrave; cent ans, simplifier le remplacement de tous les composants ne pouvant &ecirc;tre
con&ccedil;us pour une p&eacute;riode aussi longue, r&eacute;duire les d&eacute;lais de
construction, et produire de l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; &agrave; des co&ucirc;ts
comp&eacute;titifs par rapport &agrave; d'autres sources d'&eacute;nergie   le lignite par
exemple.
<P>
<B><I>R&eacute;acteurs rapides</I></B>
<P>
Dans les r&eacute;acteurs rapides et dans les r&eacute;acteurs refroidis par eau et par gaz,
ce sont respectivement des neutrons rapides et des neutrons thermiques qui entretiennent le
processus de fission. Les r&eacute;acteurs rapides sont commun&eacute;ment appel&eacute;s
surg&eacute;n&eacute;rateurs car, s'ils consomment du combustible, ils en produisent
aussi. La surg&eacute;n&eacute;ration du plutonium permet aux r&eacute;acteurs rapides
d'extraire soixante fois plus d'&eacute;nergie de l'uranium que ne le font les r&eacute;acteurs
thermiques, et ils sont donc &eacute;conomiques et avantageux pour les pays n ayant pas de
ressources abondantes en uranium. Le d&eacute;veloppement de l'&eacute;nergie
nucl&eacute;aire dans les d&eacute;cennies &agrave; venir entra&icirc;nerait probablement
un &eacute;puisement des ressources en uranium, aussi sera-t-il peut-&ecirc;tre
n&eacute;cessaire, au cours des cinquante prochaines ann&eacute;es, d'utiliser des
r&eacute;acteurs surg&eacute;n&eacute;rateurs pour produire des mati&egrave;res fissiles.
<P>
Aux &eacute;nergies des neutrons rapides qui entrent en jeu dans les r&eacute;actions de
surg&eacute;n&eacute;ration, tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments transuraniens deviennent
fissionables; par cons&eacute;quent, les r&eacute;acteurs rapides peuvent &eacute;galement
&ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;s pour br&ucirc;ler du plutonium provenant de l'exploitation d'autres
types de r&eacute;acteur et du d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement d'armes nucl&eacute;aires,
ainsi que pour contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;duire la quantit&eacute; de transuraniens
pr&eacute;sents dans le <I>macrosyst&egrave;me</I> en les transmutant en &eacute;nergie et
produits de fission; le retraitement et le recyclage du combustible dans des r&eacute;acteurs
rapides permettraient de <I>br&ucirc;ler</I> les radio-isotopes transuraniens &agrave;
tr&egrave;s
longue dur&eacute;e de vie, ce qui abr&eacute;gerait consid&eacute;rablement la
dur&eacute;e d'isolement requise pour les d&eacute;chets de haute activit&eacute;.
<P>
La plupart des r&eacute;acteurs rapides sont refroidis par un m&eacute;tal liquide, le
sodium. Des centrales &eacute;quip&eacute;es de tels r&eacute;acteurs ont
&eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;ues, construites et exploit&eacute;es avec succ&egrave;s, par
exemple
BN-600 en Russie, Superphenix (1200 MWe) en France et Monju (280 MWe) au
Japon.
<P>
Les recherches consacr&eacute;es au perfectionnement des r&eacute;acteurs rapides mettent
l'accent sur la r&eacute;vision des exigences en mati&egrave;re de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; et
d'&eacute;conomie pour la prochaine g&eacute;n&eacute;ration de centrales
nucl&eacute;aires.
Elles visent aussi &agrave; am&eacute;liorer le taux de combustion ainsi que la technologie
de recyclage du combustible afin de r&eacute;duire les quantit&eacute;s de d&eacute;chets

<P>
Un certain nombre de types de r&eacute;acteurs rapides refroidis par m&eacute;tal liquide,
de m&ecirc;me que l'utilisation accrue de syst&egrave;mes passifs pour am&eacute;liorer la
s&ucirc;ret&eacute; sont &agrave; l'&eacute;tude (BN-800M en Russie, DFBR au
Japon et PFBR en Inde). Un mod&egrave;le avanc&eacute; de r&eacute;acteur refroidi par
m&eacute;tal liquide mis au point par General Electric, aux Etats-Unis, dans la gamme des
petite &agrave; moyenne puissance, incorpore des dispositifs de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; passive,
comprend des installations de gestion et de retraitement des d&eacute;chets, ainsi qu une
installation de fabrication de combustible sur le site de la centrale, et forme un <I>parc
nucl&eacute;aire</I> unique destin&eacute; &agrave; limiter au minimum le risque de
prolif&eacute;ration de mati&egrave;res fissiles. Parmi les autres r&eacute;acteurs rapides de
type avanc&eacute; figure le r&eacute;acteur rapide europ&eacute;en, qui pourrait &ecirc;tre
largement utilis&eacute; &agrave; l'avenir pour le recyclage du plutonium et
la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;.
<P>
<B><I>R&eacute;acteurs refroidis par gaz</I></B>
<P>
Les r&eacute;acteurs &agrave; haute temp&eacute;rature refroidis par gaz (RHTRG) sont
&agrave; l'&eacute;tude depuis longtemps, et un certain nombre de prototypes ou de
centrales de d&eacute;monstration ont &eacute;t&eacute; construits, mais leur exploitation n'
a pas &eacute;t&eacute; un succ&egrave;s total. Le RHTRG est pour l'essentiel un
r&eacute;acteur dont le mod&eacute;rateur est du graphite et le fluide caloporteur de
l'h&eacute;lium. L'emploi de ce gaz inerte, ainsi qu une conception sp&eacute;ciale du
combustible, permet d'exploiter le r&eacute;acteur &agrave; des temp&eacute;ratures
beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es que celles des r&eacute;acteurs refroidis par eau, de
sorte que l'on peut produire de la vapeur &agrave; une temp&eacute;rature et &agrave; une
pression elles aussi beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es pour alimenter des
g&eacute;n&eacute;rateurs de turbines &agrave; vapeur traditionnels, avec un
rendement thermique nettement sup&eacute;rieur, ou produire de la chaleur industrielle
&agrave; haute temp&eacute;rature pour des applications sp&eacute;ciales.
<P>
Ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, on s'est surtout int&eacute;ress&eacute; aux petites
unit&eacute;s modulaires, les exp&eacute;riences et les analyses ayant montr&eacute; qu
elles pouvaient atteindre un degr&eacute; exceptionnel d'autoprotection.
<P>
Le combustible des RHTRG n' est pas contenu dans des aiguilles gain&eacute;es de
m&eacute;tal comme c'est le cas du combustible des REO et des r&eacute;acteurs refroidis
par m&eacute;tal liquide, mais form&eacute; de particules sph&eacute;riques d'oxydes ou de
carbures de 0,2 &agrave; 0,6 mm environ. Pour retenir les produits de fission, les
particules sont enrob&eacute;es de plusieurs couches de mat&eacute;riaux c&eacute;ramiques
stables &agrave; haute temp&eacute;rature. Elles sont r&eacute;parties de fa&ccedil;on
homog&egrave;ne dans une matrice en graphite, ensuite compress&eacute;e en
&eacute;l&eacute;ments sph&eacute;riques, en galets, ou sous forme de barres,
ins&eacute;r&eacute;es dans les canaux de combustible d'un bloc de graphite &agrave; trous
multiples. Elles restent intactes et retiennent pratiquement tous les produits de fission jusqu
&agrave; une temp&eacute;rature d'environ 1600&#176;C. Elles ne fondent pas &agrave; une
temp&eacute;rature seuil donn&eacute;e et ne se d&eacute;gradent que progressivement dans
des conditions accidentelles; il ne peut donc se produire de d&eacute;gagement brutal de
produits de fission.
<P>
Le perfectionnement des RHTRG aura pour but d'am&eacute;liorer la performance et de
prolonger la dur&eacute;e de vie des centrales. Pour le premier point, de nombreuses
recherches sont actuellement consacr&eacute;es &agrave; ce que l'on appelle le cycle
&agrave; turbine &agrave; gaz, o&ugrave; un gaz &agrave; haute temp&eacute;rature
alimente directement une turbine &agrave; gaz   ce qui permet d'obtenir un rendement
thermique tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; et un co&ucirc;t de l'&eacute;nergie tr&egrave;s
int&eacute;ressant   ainsi qu &agrave; la production de chaleur industrielle &agrave;
tr&egrave;s haute temp&eacute;rature.

<P></A>
Les pr&eacute;occupations croissantes suscit&eacute;es par l'impact sur l'environnement de
la combustion de combustibles fossiles ont entra&icirc;n&eacute; un regain
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t au niveau international pour la technologie nucl&eacute;aire. Les
programmes de d&eacute;veloppement nationaux ont &eacute;t&eacute;
compl&eacute;t&eacute;s par des efforts internationaux en mati&egrave;re de mise au point
de r&eacute;acteurs avanc&eacute;s, en particulier pour ceux qui ont des
caract&eacute;ristiques r&eacute;volutionnaires. Les programmes et projets techniques de
l'AIEA dans ce domaine portent sur l'am&eacute;lioration de la s&ucirc;ret&eacute;, de la
fiabilit&eacute;, de l'efficacit&eacute; &eacute;conomique, la compr&eacute;hension du

<B><I>Groupes de travail internationaux</I></B>
<P>
Les activit&eacute;s de l'Agence dans le domaine de la mise au point de mod&egrave;les
avanc&eacute;s sont coordonn&eacute;es par trois groupes de travail internationaux, lesquels
se r&eacute;unissent p&eacute;riodiquement pour discuter et &eacute;changer des
informations sur les programmes des diff&eacute;rents pays, identifier les domaines
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun pour la coop&eacute;ration et conseiller l'Agence sur ses

Par l'interm&eacute;diaire de ses programmes d'assistance technique, l'Agence aide les pays
en d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; se doter des comp&eacute;tences n&eacute;cessaires pour
int&eacute;grer les technologies des r&eacute;acteurs avanc&eacute;s dans leurs
programmes de recherche en leur fournissant des conseils d'experts, des cours de formation,
des bourses d'&eacute;tudes, du mat&eacute;riel sp&eacute;cial et en effectuant des
recherches. Pour les pays int&eacute;ress&eacute;s par l'&eacute;laboration de programmes
de recherche, elle publie des rapports faisant le point sur les mod&egrave;les de
r&eacute;acteurs de type avanc&eacute;.

  <HR NOSHADE>
  <FONT SIZE=+2><B>E</B></FONT>n los &uacute;ltimos tres decenios, la
poblaci&oacute;n mundial  casi se ha duplicado y continuar&aacute; en aumento.
Seg&uacute;n las estimaciones actuales, en el a&ntilde;o  2020 habitar&aacute;n en este
planeta unas 8100 millones de personas, y casi el 90% del incremento de la poblaci&oacute;n
se registrar&aacute; en los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. El consumo actual de electricidad por
  habitante en estos pa&iacute;ses, que puede utilizarse como indicador del nivel de vida, es
muy bajo, en uno o dos  &oacute;rdenes de magnitud inferior al de los pa&iacute;ses
industrializados. Adem&aacute;s de las numerosas  necesidades urgentes, tales como los
alimentos, la vestimenta, el alojamiento y el trabajo, la disponibilidad de  energ&iacute;a es
un requisito previo importante para el desarrollo socioecon&oacute;mico en todas las partes
del  mundo.
<P>Dependiendo de la ubicaci&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica y el nivel de
industrializaci&oacute;n, la   energ&iacute;a final se consume de distintas maneras: como
electricidad, para el transporte, o como fuente de calor.   Entre las distintas fuentes
energ&eacute;ticas de que disponen los pa&iacute;ses, la energ&iacute;a  
nucleoel&eacute;ctrica representa una de las pocas opciones que permite producir
energ&iacute;a en todas sus  formas, es decir, como electricidad, calor industrial en
r&eacute;gimen de baja y alta temperatura y vapor industrial, en forma econ&oacute;mica y
en condiciones ambientalmente aceptables. Las preocupaciones respecto de los   efectos
ambientales del quemado de combustibles f&oacute;siles para la producci&oacute;n de
energ&iacute;a han  fomentado el inter&eacute;s por las fuentes de energ&iacute;a poco
contaminantes. Por lo tanto, el desarrollo y   despliegue de la energ&iacute;a
nucleo-el&eacute;ctrica podr&iacute;an ser para algunas naciones una  opci&oacute;n
atractiva para contribuir a un suministro energ&eacute;tico seguro y fiable a largo plazo.
<P> 
En los &uacute;ltimos tres decenios, se han acumulado miles de a&ntilde;os-reactor de
experiencia  operacional con los sistemas nucleares econ&oacute;micos y fiables actualmente
existentes. Sobre la base de estos  logros y de las ense&ntilde;anzas extra&iacute;das de la
experiencia de las centrales en explotaci&oacute;n, se han  desarrollado, o se est&aacute;n
desarrollando, nuevas generaciones de centrales nucleares; por lo tanto, se  prev&eacute; que
los nuevos dise&ntilde;os avanzados ser&aacute;n a&uacute;n m&aacute;s seguros,
  econ&oacute;micos y fiables que sus predecesores.
<P>
Los dise&ntilde;os avanzados incorporan generalmente mejoras de los conceptos relacionados
con la  seguridad, incluidas, entre otras cosas, caracter&iacute;sticas que permitir&aacute;n a
los operadores disponer de  m&aacute;s tiempo para tomar medidas de seguridad, y que
proporcionar&aacute;n una protecci&oacute;n aun  mayor contra cualquier liberaci&oacute;n
posible de radiactividad al medio ambiente. Los dise&ntilde;os mejorados  tambi&eacute;n
pueden incluir la introducci&oacute;n de caracter&iacute;sticas de seguridad pasiva basadas
en  fuerzas naturales tales como la convecci&oacute;n y la gravedad, lo que permite reducir
la dependencia de las  funciones de seguridad de los sistemas y componentes activos, tales
como las bombas y v&aacute;lvulas.
<P>
Se presta gran atenci&oacute;n a la simplificaci&oacute;n de las actividades de
explotaci&oacute;n,  inspecci&oacute;n, mantenimiento y reparaci&oacute;n de las nuevas
centrales, a fin de aumentar su eficacia general desde el punto de vista de los costos. En caso
de perturbaciones y accidentes, los sistemas de control, vigilancia  y protecci&oacute;n
ampliamente digitalizados pondr&aacute;n autom&aacute;ticamente a la central a funcionar de
  nuevo en condiciones normales o en un estado de cierre seguro, sin la intervenci&oacute;n
del operador. Los  objetivos de dise&ntilde;o caracter&iacute;sticos permiten a los operadores
disponer de por lo menos 30 minutos  para tomar medidas de seguridad y contar as&iacute;
con el tiempo necesario para evaluar la situaci&oacute;n  minuciosamente antes de intervenir.
La mayor inercia t&eacute;rmica en el sistema del reactor y las menores  densidades de
potencia en el n&uacute;cleo son dos factores de ese tipo relacionados con el dise&ntilde;o.
<P>
En lo que respecta a los dispositivos de seguridad pasiva, sus funciones tambi&eacute;n
ser&aacute;n  normalmente independientes del suministro de corriente el&eacute;ctrica (al
menos despu&eacute;s de la  iniciaci&oacute;n de la funci&oacute;n), aprovechando
mecanismos termohidr&aacute;ulicos tales como las  diferencias de densidad debidas a
diferentes temperaturas, y tanques de agua elevados, a fin de, por ejemplo,  permitir el flujo
del refrigerante al sistema del reactor por gravedad para alcanzar los niveles m&aacute;ximos
de  refrigerante.
<P>
La labor de desarrollo de un nuevo dise&ntilde;o de reactor es costosa y dif&iacute;cil, y
requiere gran  cantidad de recursos. Este problema se ha resuelto frecuentemente mediante la
cooperaci&oacute;n a escala  nacional o internacional, y se han demostrado las ventajas de
mancomunar los recursos en proyectos de desarrollo.  En su calidad de foro internacional para
el intercambio de informaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica,  el Organismo
Internacional de Energ&iacute;a At&oacute;mica (OIEA) desempe&ntilde;a una
funci&oacute;n  importante en este contexto, reuniendo expertos para un intercambio de
informaci&oacute;n a escala mundial sobre  los programas nacionales y los programas
coordinados de investigaci&oacute;n relativos a proyectos de desarrollo  de reactores
avanzados.
<A NAME="note_a">  <P>                    
  <B>Dise&ntilde;os avanzados</B>
<P></A>
Una forma de atender a las necesidades energ&eacute;ticas futuras es aumentar gradualmente
el  despliegue de la energ&iacute;a nuclear, introduciendo dise&ntilde;os avanzados en los
sistemas de suministro de  energ&iacute;a del mundo entero. En este contexto, cabe
se&ntilde;alar que por dise&ntilde;o avanzado se entiende  el dise&ntilde;o de una central de
inter&eacute;s o m&eacute;rito actual, pero que todavia no ha sido construida ni  explotada;
dichos dise&ntilde;os avanzados pueden, a su vez, dividirse en dise&ntilde;os evolutivos y de
desarrollo.  Un dise&ntilde;o evolutivo es un descendiente del dise&ntilde;o de una central
existente que presenta las mejoras y  modificaciones del dise&ntilde;o efectuadas en base al
aprovechamiento de la experiencia e incluye nuevos  adelantos tecnol&oacute;gicos; el
dise&ntilde;o evolutivo de una central requiere a lo sumo ensayos  t&eacute;cnicos y
confirmatorios previos al despliegue comercial. Por otra parte, el dise&ntilde;o de desarrollo
  incluir&aacute; diferencias m&aacute;s significativas con respecto a los dise&ntilde;os de
centrales existentes, y  puede requerir igualmente la construcci&oacute;n de una planta de
demostraci&oacute;n y/o planta prototipo antes  del despliegue comercial en gran escala. Un
dise&ntilde;o de desarrollo que incluye cambios radicales en el  dise&ntilde;o puede
denominarse dise&ntilde;o innovador, y representa, por lo tanto, una subcategor&iacute;a
especial de dise&ntilde;os de desarrollo.
  <P>
  <UL>
Actualmente se desarrollan tres tipos b&aacute;sicos dise&ntilde;os avanzados:
  <P>
<LI>reactores refrigerados por agua;
  <P>
<LI>reactores r&aacute;pidos; y
  <P>
<LI>reactores refrigerados por gas,
  <P>
 </UL>  
que se examinan a continuaci&oacute;n.
  <P>                    
  <B><I>Reactores refrigerados por agua</I></B>
  <P>
Los reactores refrigerados por agua se caracterizan por utilizar agua como moderador y
refrigerante; los  reactores de agua ligera (LWR) utilizan agua  ligera  normal
(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) y los
reactores de agua pesada (HWR) utilizan  agua pesada (D<SUB>2</SUB>O), al menos como
moderador. En
el agua pesada, los &aacute;tomos de hidr&oacute;geno (H<SUB>2</SUB>) han  sido
reemplazados por
deuterio (D<SUB>2</SUB>), un is&oacute;topo pesado del hidr&oacute;geno.
<P>
Actualmente se encuentran en funcionamiento en todo el mundo unas 330 centrales LWR, lo
que  representa un 75% de todas las centrales nucleares en explotaci&oacute;n. Este tipo de
reactor se ha venido  explotando desde hace m&aacute;s de 35 a&ntilde;os. El continuo
perfeccionamiento y mejoramiento evolutivo de  los dise&ntilde;os de centrales LWR han
constituido la base para el desarrollo de dise&ntilde;os de LWR  avanzados (ALWR), tanto
del tipo BWR (reactor de agua en ebullici&oacute;n) como del tipo PWR (reactor de
 agua a presi&oacute;n).

<P>
Actualmente se desarrollan reactores grandes y medianos; los primeros representar&iacute;an,
en gran  medida, ampliaciones de los dise&ntilde;os existentes, mientras que en los
m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os se  emplear&iacute;an mayormente dispositivos de seguridad
pasiva con miras a la simplificaci&oacute;n de las  centrales y la realizaci&oacute;n de
econom&iacute;as, a fin de lograr que, no obstante su menor tama&ntilde;o,  sean
competitivas desde el punto de vista del costo. Algunos dise&ntilde;os de desarrollo,
particularmente los  dise&ntilde;os innovadores, tales como el PWR PIUS sueco, incluyen
funciones de seguridad de naturaleza distinta  a las caracter&iacute;sticas de seguridad
tradicionales de los dise&ntilde;os existentes, por ejemplo, funciones de 
autoprotecci&oacute;n para la parada del reactor en caso de condiciones operacionales
inaceptables y para la  eliminaci&oacute;n fiable del calor de desintegraci&oacute;n (el calor
que se produce en el combustible  despu&eacute;s de la parada) del n&uacute;cleo del
reactor.
<P> 
En el transcurso de los a&ntilde;os se han realizado constantes mejoras del combustible en las
centrales  en funcionamiento; por ejemplo, el mayor empleo de absorbentes consumibles en el
combustible y el mayor grado  de quemado del combustible han permitido lograr reducciones
considerables en el consumo de uranio, de un 20%  en comparaci&oacute;n con el estudio de
1978 1979 realizado por la INFCE (Evaluaci&oacute;n internacional del  ciclo del
combustible nuclear).
<P>
El reciclado de plutonio mediante combustible de mezcla de &oacute;xidos (MOX) se ha
convertido en  una pr&aacute;ctica com&uacute;n en varios pa&iacute;ses, tales como
Alemania, Francia y Suiza, y puede que  varios otros pa&iacute;ses adopten tambi&eacute;n
esta pr&aacute;ctica en un futuro.
<P>
Los dise&ntilde;os avanzados procurar&aacute;n normalmente aprovechar todos los progresos
en la  esfera del combustible; los dise&ntilde;os del n&uacute;cleo se optimizar&aacute;n
teniendo en cuenta las  estrategias avanzadas en materia de absorbentes consumibles y los
mayores grados de quemado del combustible.  Muchos de ellos tendr&aacute;n la capacidad
de funcionar con un n&uacute;cleo que contenga hasta un 100% de  combustible MOX. Las
centrales HWR representan un 7% de todas las centrales nucleares en explotaci&oacute;n;
  la mayor&iacute;a de ellas son tipo CANDU, el dise&ntilde;o canadiense de reactor de
tubos de presi&oacute;n. La  mayor&iacute;a de estas centrales han funcionado de manera
segura, fiable y competitiva desde su primera puesta  en marcha.
<P>
Las mejoras de dise&ntilde;o efectuadas en los reactores tipo CANDU se centran en el
aumento de la  seguridad de la central, la prolongaci&oacute;n de su vida &uacute;til hasta
100 a&ntilde;os, la  simplificaci&oacute;n de las actividades de sustituci&oacute;n de todos
los componentes que no puedan  dise&ntilde;arse para una vida &uacute;til de esa
duraci&oacute;n, la reducci&oacute;n del plazo de  construcci&oacute;n y la
producci&oacute;n de electricidad a costos que sean competitivos con los de otras fuentes
  de energ&iacute;a (por ejemplo, el carb&oacute;n bituminoso).
  <P>                    
  <B><I>Reactores r&aacute;pidos </I></B>
<P>
Los reactores r&aacute;pidos utilizan neutrones  r&aacute;pidos  en apoyo del proceso de
fisi&oacute;n,  contrariamente a los reactores refrigerados por agua y por gas, los cuales
utilizan neutrones  t&eacute;rmicos . Los  reactores r&aacute;pidos se conocen
tambi&eacute;n generalmente como reproductores, ya que producen combustible,
adem&aacute;s de consumirlo. La reproducci&oacute;n de plutonio permite a los
reactores r&aacute;pidos  extraer 60 veces m&aacute;s energ&iacute;a del uranio que los
reactores t&eacute;rmicos por lo que  podr&iacute;an resultar econ&oacute;micos y
ventajosos para los pa&iacute;ses que no disponen de abundantes  recursos de uranio. El
mayor despliegue de la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica en los decenios venideros
  conducir&aacute; probablemente a un agotamiento de los recursos de uranio, y puede que en
la primera mitad del  pr&oacute;ximo siglo sea necesario recurrir a los reactores
reproductores para producir material fisionable.
<P>
 En el espectro de neutrones r&aacute;pidos presentes en tales reacciones, todos los elementos
  transur&aacute;nicos se vuelven fisionables, por lo que los reactores r&aacute;pidos
podr&iacute;an contribuir  igualmente al quemado del plutonio procedente de la
explotaci&oacute;n de otros tipos de reactores y del  desmantelamiento de las armas
nucleares, as&iacute; como a la disminuci&oacute;n del inventario total de 
transur&aacute;nicos dentro del  macrosistema , transmut&aacute;ndolos en energ&iacute;a y
productos de  fisi&oacute;n; la reelaboraci&oacute;n y el reciclado del combustible en los
reactores r&aacute;pidos  permitir&iacute;a el  quemado  de los radis&oacute;topos
transur&aacute;nicos de per&iacute;odo muy largo,  reduciendo considerablemente el tiempo
de aislamiento requerido en el caso de los desechos de actividad alta.
<P>
Los reactores r&aacute;pidos est&aacute;n refrigerados normalmente por metal l&iacute;quido
(sodio),   por lo que se denominan reactores r&aacute;pidos refrigerados por metal
l&iacute;quido (LMFR). Se han  dise&ntilde;ado, construido y explotado con &eacute;xito
centrales LMFR, tales como el BN-600 en Rusia, el  Superph&eacute;nix de 1200 MWe en
Francia, y el Monju de 280 MWe en el Jap&oacute;n. 
<P>
Los nuevos trabajos de desarrollo de los reactores r&aacute;pidos se centran en los requisitos
  econ&oacute;micos y de seguridad revisados para la pr&oacute;xima generaci&oacute;n de
centrales nucleares.  Prosiguen igualmente los trabajos encaminados a mejorar el grado de
quemado y la tecnolog&iacute;a de reciclado  del combustible, a fin de reducir las cantidades
de desechos radiactivos producidos en las centrales. 
<P>
Actualmente se encuentran en estudio varios tipos distintos de LMFR, as&iacute; como el
empleo  m&aacute;s amplio de sistemas pasivos para lograr una mayor seguridad; entre
&eacute;stos se encuentran el  BN-800M de Rusia, el DFBR del Jap&oacute;n, y el PFBR de
la India. Tambi&eacute;n existe un dise&ntilde;o de  LMFR avanzado de peque&ntilde;a y
mediana potencia, desarrollado por la General Electric de los Estados Unidos  de
Am&eacute;rica. Este concepto de ALMR incorpora dispositivos de seguridad pasiva, e
incluye instalaciones de  gesti&oacute;n y reelaboraci&oacute;n de desechos, as&iacute; como
la fabricaci&oacute;n de combustible en el  emplazamiento de la central, formando un
s&oacute;lo  parque nuclear  a fin de minimizar los riesgos de  proliferaci&oacute;n de
materiales fisionables. Entre otros reactores r&aacute;pidos avanzados figura el reactor
  r&aacute;pido europeo (EFR), que podr&iacute;a llegar a ser ampliamente utilizado para el
reciclado de plutonio y   la producci&oacute;n de electricidad.
  <P>
  <B><I>Reactores refrigerados por gas</I></B>
  <P>
Los reactores de alta temperatura refrigerados por gas (HTGR) se vienen desarrollando desde
hace  mucho tiempo, y aunque ya se han construido varias centrales prototipo o de
demostraci&oacute;n, no se ha  logrado tener pleno &eacute;xito en su explotaci&oacute;n. El
HTGR es b&aacute;sicamente un reactor moderado  por grafito con un gas (helio) como
refrigerante. El gas He inerte y el dise&ntilde;o especial del combustible hacen  posible su
funcionamiento a temperaturas considerablemente superiores a las de los reactores
refrigerados por agua,  lo que permite, a su vez, producir a una temperatura (y
presi&oacute;n) mucho m&aacute;s alta el vapor destinado  a los generadores convencionales
accionados por turbina de vapor, logr&aacute;ndose asi una mejora considerable  de la
t&eacute;rmica de la central, o producir calor industrial en r&eacute;gimen de alta
temperatura para  aplicaciones especiales. 
<P>
En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os, los trabajos de desarrollo se han centrado en unidades
modulares  peque&ntilde;as, visto que los experimentos y an&aacute;lisis han demostrado que
dichas unidades pueden lograr  un grado excepcional de autoprotecci&oacute;n. 
<P>
A diferencia del combustible LWR y LMFBR, el combustible HTGR no est&aacute;
contenido en  agujas de combustible revestidas de metal, sino en part&iacute;culas de
combustible. Estas part&iacute;culas miden  entre 0,2 y 0,6 mm y consisten en una mezcla de
&oacute;xido o carburo de uranio o torio o uranio/torio. A fin de  retener los productos de
fisi&oacute;n, cada part&iacute;cula est&aacute; revestida con varias capas de material
  cer&aacute;mico resistente a altas temperaturas. Las part&iacute;culas se dispersan de
manera homog&eacute;nea  en una matriz de grafito que se comprime ulteriormente en
elementos esf&eacute;ricos, bolas, o en forma de barras,  que se introducen en los canales de
combustible de un bloque de grafito de agujeros m&uacute;ltiples. Las  part&iacute;culas
permanecen intactas y retienen pr&aacute;cticamente todos los productos de fisi&oacute;n
hasta  una temperatura de unos 1600 C. Estas part&iacute;culas no se funden a una
temperatura umbral dada y  s&oacute;lo fallan gradualmente en condiciones de accidente; por
lo tanto, no se puede producir una  liberaci&oacute;n s&uacute;bita de los productos de
fisi&oacute;n.
<P>
Los futuros trabajos de desarrollo de los HTGR se centrar&aacute;n en los estudios para
mejorar el  comportamiento y prolongar la vida &uacute;til de las centrales. Con respecto a lo
primero, actualmente se realizan  considerables esfuerzos en relaci&oacute;n con el
denominado ciclo de turbina de gas, en el que el gas en  r&eacute;gimen de alta temperatura
pasa directamente a una turbina de gas, lo que permite obtener una eficiencia
  t&eacute;rmica muy elevada y prever costos energ&eacute;ticos reducidos, asi como en lo
que ata&ntilde;e a la  producci&oacute;n de calor industrial en r&eacute;gimen de muy alta
temperatura.

<B>Actividades de desarrollo del OIEA en la esfera de los reactores  avanzados</B>
<P></A>
Las crecientes preocupaciones respecto de los efectos ambientales del quemado de
combustibles  f&oacute;siles han conducido a un renovado inter&eacute;s por la
tecnolog&iacute;a nuclear a escala internacional.  Los programas nacionales de desarrollo se
han complementado con actividades internacionales en la esfera del  desarrollo de los
reactores avanzados, particularmente de aquellos con caracter&iacute;sticas innovadoras. Los
  programas y proyectos t&eacute;cnicos del OIEA en esta esfera se centran en el aumento de
la seguridad,  fiabilidad, eficacia econ&oacute;mica y comprensi&oacute;n del
p&uacute;blico, as&iacute; como en la posible  introducci&oacute;n de los reactores
avanzados.
  <P>                    
  <B><I>Grupos internacionales de trabajo</I></B>
  <P>
La coordinaci&oacute;n de las actividades del Organismo en la esfera del desarrollo de
dise&ntilde;os  avanzados est&aacute; a cargo de tres grupos internacionales de trabajo que se
re&uacute;nen  peri&oacute;dicamente para examinar los programas nacionales e intercambiar
informaci&oacute;n al respecto,  determinar las esferas de cooperaci&oacute;n de
inter&eacute;s com&uacute;n y asesorar al Organismo sobre sus  programas y actividades
t&eacute;cnicos, incluido el establecimiento de programas coordinados de 
investigaci&oacute;n. Las actividades de los grupos abarcan igualmente talleres sobre temas
relacionados con el  desarrollo de dise&ntilde;os avanzados.
  <P>
  <B><I>Programas de asistencia t&eacute;cnica</I></B>
  <P>
Mediante sus programas de asistencia t&eacute;cnica, el Organismo ayuda a los pa&iacute;ses
en  desarrollo a establecer los conocimientos especializados necesarios para incorporar las
tecnolog&iacute;as de los  reactores avanzados a sus propios programas de
investigaci&oacute;n, proporcionando asesoramiento de expertos,  capacitaci&oacute;n, becas,
equipo especial y asistencia en materia de investigaci&oacute;nes. Para los  pa&iacute;ses
interesados en establecer programas de investigaci&oacute;n, el OIEA publica informes sobre
el  estado de desarrollo de los dise&ntilde;os avanzados.
<A NAME="note_c">  <P>                    
  <B>Tendencias</B>
  <P></A>
Los dise&ntilde;os avanzados de reactores nucleares aprovechan la amplia experiencia
operacional  adquirida de los sistemas actuales y los resultados de las actividades de
investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo a escala  mundial, con el fin de proporcionar centrales
nucleares muy seguras, fiables y econ&oacute;micas, que sean  tambi&eacute;n favorables al
medioambiente.
  <P>
La mejora de los sistemas de reactores y la creciente consciencia y preocupaci&oacute;n del
  p&uacute;blico en lo que respecta al calentamiento global y la contaminaci&oacute;n
ambiental han llevado a los  encargados de adoptar decisiones en el plano nacional a
examinar m&aacute;s de cerca la opci&oacute;n nuclear  para su futura mezcla de
producci&oacute;n de electricidad. El empleo eficaz de la energ&iacute;a 
nucleoel&eacute;ctrica en los a&ntilde;os venideros no depende solamente de la excelencia
t&eacute;cnica: un  requisito previo indispensable es la comprensi&oacute;n y
aceptaci&oacute;n tanto por el p&uacute;blico como por  las autoridades nacionales.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>L'</B></FONT>&eacute;nergie nucl&eacute;aire
sauve des vies.
Ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e au service de la sant&eacute; humaine,
elle offre des techniques
vari&eacute;es qui permettent de pr&eacute;venir, de
diagnostiquer et de traiter la maladie.
<P>
Les techniques nucl&eacute;aires utilis&eacute;es en
m&eacute;decine ont l'avantage
irrempla&ccedil;able de fournir rapidement une
repr&eacute;sentation pr&eacute;cise des
fonctions corporelles dans le temps, &agrave; la fa&ccedil;on
dont d&eacute;filent les images
d'un film. L'importance de cet avantage appara&icirc;t clairement
lorsque l'on sait que, dans
les
h&ocirc;pitaux des pays industrialis&eacute;s, un patient sur
trois b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie
d'un type quelconque de proc&eacute;dure nucl&eacute;aire.
L'Agence internationale de
l'&eacute;nergie atomique (AIEA) et l'Organisation mondiale de la
sant&eacute; (OMS)
jouent un r&ocirc;le cl&eacute; dans le d&eacute;veloppement et
le transfert aux Etats
Membres --  et particuli&egrave;rement aux pays en
d&eacute;veloppement --  des
techniques, de l'exp&eacute;rience et du savoir-faire dans le
domaine nucl&eacute;aire.
<A NAME="methods"><P>
<B><I>M&eacute;thodes de diagnostic</I></B>
<P></A>
D'apr&egrave;s les estimations de l'OMS, plus de la moiti&eacute;
des cas de cancers dans le
monde se trouvent dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Environ
75% de ces patients ont
&eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute;s incurables au moment du
diagnostic. Ces statistiques
&eacute;voluent gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des techniques de diagnostic
de deux types : <I>in vivo</I> et
<I>in vitro</I>. Ces techniques permettent de d&eacute;terminer
la pr&eacute;sence d'une maladie et
le degr&eacute; d'infestation du corps et elles peuvent aider
&agrave; choisir le traitement le
plus appropri&eacute;.
<P>
<B>Techniques <I>in vivo</I></B>
<P>
Les techniques de diagnostic <I>in vivo</I> sont bas&eacute;es
sur la m&eacute;thode des
<I>traceurs</I>. Un produit radiopharmaceutique --
c'est-&agrave;-dire un
radio-nucl&eacute;ide dont la forme chimique et la dur&eacute;e
de vie sont soigneusement
choisies -- est administr&eacute; au patient afin de suivre un
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne
physiologique sp&eacute;cifique au moyen d'un d&eacute;tecteur
sp&eacute;cial -- souvent
une gamma-cam&eacute;ra -- plac&eacute; en dehors du corps. Le
radiopharmaceutique peut
&ecirc;tre con&ccedil;u de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; ne se fixer que
sur certains tissus ou
organes, par exemple les poumons. En permettant de diriger les
rayonnements sur les endroits
o&ugrave; ils sont n&eacute;cessaires, et non au hasard, les
techniques modernes accroissent
les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices que les applications
nucl&eacute;aires peuvent apporter &agrave;
la sant&eacute;.
<P>
On dispose de 100 &agrave; 300 radiopharmaceutiques permettant
d'&eacute;tudier les
organes et les tissus sans les perturber. La plupart sont de
nature organique et sont
marqu&eacute;s &agrave; l'aide de radionucl&eacute;ides
artificiels tels que l'indium 111 et le
gallium 67. Les m&eacute;thodes nucl&eacute;aires de diagnostic
exposent le patient
&agrave; de faibles doses de rayonnement. Ces doses sont en outre
r&eacute;duites au
minimum gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'utilisation de radio-isotopes de
p&eacute;riode plus courte,
tels que le techn&eacute;tium 99m, qui se stabilisent en quelques
heures.
<P>
En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, le radiopharmaceutique est
administr&eacute; au patient par voie
intraveineuse, par ingestion ou par inhalation. Un dispositif de
d&eacute;tection
sp&eacute;cial (gamma-cam&eacute;ra) permet d'observer son trajet
&agrave; travers le corps
o&ugrave; il se concentre de fa&ccedil;on sp&eacute;cifique sur
un tissu ou un organe
donn&eacute;. La gamma-cam&eacute;ra d&eacute;tecte les photons
s'&eacute;chappant du
corps et une image plane est cr&eacute;&eacute;e &agrave; l'aide
d'un ordinateur et d'un
&eacute;cran vid&eacute;o. Ces images traduisent la
qualit&eacute; r&eacute;gionale d'une
fonction sp&eacute;cifique d'un organe donn&eacute;.
Ce proc&eacute;d&eacute; s'appelle imagerie plane ou
scintigraphie statique.
<P>
Lorsqu'elles se succ&egrave;dent avec rapidit&eacute;, ces images
fournissent une
repr&eacute;sentation dynamique du comportement du
radiopharmaceutique et
r&eacute;v&egrave;lent des renseignements d&eacute;taill&eacute;s
sur des
fonctions telles que l'&eacute;vacuation par l'estomac, le
processus de la respiration dans les
poumons ou l'activit&eacute; de pompage du coeur.

<P>
Comme une radiographie, ces proc&eacute;dures permettent
d'obtenir une image de la
totalit&eacute; ou d'une partie d'un organe donn&eacute;. La
principale diff&eacute;rence est
qu'en m&eacute;decine nucl&eacute;aire l'image obtenue donne une
mesure de
l'<I>activit&eacute;</I> d'une
fonction physiologique ou biochimique sp&eacute;cifique dans le
corps, alors qu'une image
radiographique ne donne qu'une repr&eacute;sentation anatomique.
<P>
La puissance des ordinateurs modernes permet d'obtenir, sous des
angles multiples, des
images cliniques qui constituent une r&eacute;plique de la coupe
du corps (technique de la
tomographie informatis&eacute;e). La tomographie
informatis&eacute;e &agrave;
&eacute;mission
monophotonique (SPECT) et la tomographie &agrave; &eacute;mission
de positons (PET)
sont les deux techniques les plus avanc&eacute;es dans ce
domaine.
<P>
La technique SPECT utilise une gamma-cam&eacute;ra rotative pour
obtenir sous
plusieurs angles des images de la distribution d'un
radiopharmaceutique &eacute;metteur
gamma classique dans un organe. Cette technique est
irrempla&ccedil;able pour localiser la
position exacte d'une anomalie physiologique dans le corps et
elle permet
de produire, &agrave; l'aide d'un ordinateur, une s&eacute;rie de
coupes bidimensionnelles
&agrave; partir desquelles des images tridimensionnelles peuvent
&ecirc;tre reconstruites.
<P>
La technique PET est pr&eacute;cieuse pour la d&eacute;tection et
la gestion du
cancer. Un ou plusieurs anneaux de d&eacute;tecteurs
stationnaires plac&eacute;s autour du
corps du patient permettent de d&eacute;tecter les rayonnements
gamma (511 keV)
tr&egrave;s fortement divergents produits par l'interaction de
positons (&eacute;mis par un
radionucl&eacute;ide administr&eacute; au pr&eacute;alable) avec
les &eacute;lectrons libres
se trouvant dans le corps. Ces informations sont ensuite
trait&eacute;es pour cr&eacute;er des
coupes du corps similaires &agrave; celles de la m&eacute;thode
SPECT. La m&eacute;thode
PET est un excellent moyen de repr&eacute;senter les processus
biochimiques
r&eacute;gionaux du corps et de mettre en &eacute;vidence
l'origine biochimique de
d&eacute;sordres neurologiques et de maladies mentales.
<P>
<B>Techniques <I>in vitro</I></B>
<P>
La deuxi&egrave;me m&eacute;thode de diagnostic, <I>in vitro</I>,
permet d'effectuer un diagnostic
clinique sans exposer le patient &agrave; des rayonnements. Ce
dernier n'a d'ailleurs
m&ecirc;me pas besoin d'&ecirc;tre pr&eacute;sent. Un
&eacute;chantillon de son sang est
envoy&eacute;
au laboratoire et examin&eacute; au moyen de techniques
nucl&eacute;aires telles que le
radioimmunodosage (RIA) ou le dosage immunoradiom&eacute;trique
(IRMA).
<P>
Ces tests donnent une mesure pr&eacute;cise de l'exposition
ant&eacute;rieure et du moment
&agrave; l'infection en &eacute;valuant les anticorps. La
technique RIA sert
&eacute;galement &agrave; mesurer des substances telles que les
hormones, les vitamines et
les m&eacute;dicaments dans les fluides corporels, en vue de
d&eacute;tecter des
d&eacute;sordres nutritionnels et endocrinologiques et de
d&eacute;celer des infections
bact&eacute;riennes et parasitaires telles que la tuberculose et
le paludisme. Recevant un
appui dans le cadre de programmes de recherche coordonn&eacute;e
de l'AIEA, quelque 500
h&ocirc;pitaux, universit&eacute;s et laboratoires, rien que dans
les pays en
d&eacute;veloppement, pratiquent la m&eacute;thode RIA &agrave;
des degr&eacute;s divers.
Les chiffres augmentent chaque ann&eacute;e.
<P>

     Les techniques RIA et IRMA permettent &eacute;galement de
d&eacute;tecter des
marqueurs de tumeurs, substances sp&eacute;cifiques
s&eacute;cr&eacute;t&eacute;es par de
nombreuses tumeurs (mais non par toutes) et qui peuvent
r&eacute;v&eacute;ler la
pr&eacute;sence de tumeurs malignes. A l'heure actuelle, on
conna&icirc;t presque deux
douzaines
de marqueurs de tumeurs. En d&eacute;pit d'une pr&eacute;cision
accrue ainsi que d'un cot
faible et d'une certaine commodit&eacute;, la d&eacute;tection
des marqueurs de tumeurs
continue &agrave; &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;e en compl&eacute;ment
d'autres
proc&eacute;dures de
diagnostic pour le d&eacute;pistage du cancer au stade
pr&eacute;coce, mais cette technique
est particuli&egrave;rement utile pour suivre l'&eacute;volution
de la maladie et les effets du
traitement.
<A NAME="disease"><P>
<B><I>M&eacute;thodes de traitement</I></B>
<P></A>
Les rayonnements sont tr&egrave;s utilis&eacute;s dans le
traitement de maladies telles que
l'hyperthyro&iuml;die et le cancer. Pour lutter contre la maladie
ou emp&ecirc;cher une
r&eacute;cidive qui pourrait survenir si des cellules
canc&eacute;reuses isol&eacute;es se
propageaient, risquant d'entra&icirc;ner un cancer secondaire,
toutes les cellules malignes
d'une
tumeur doivent &ecirc;tre enti&egrave;rement d&eacute;truites.
<P>
La radioth&eacute;rapie y parvient en dirigeant sur une tumeur
sp&eacute;cifique des
rayonnements provenant le plus souvent d'une source gamma au
cobalt 60 ou d'un
syst&egrave;me &agrave; TLE (transfert lin&eacute;ique
d'&eacute;nergie)
&eacute;lev&eacute;.
<P>
La source de rayonnements peut soit n'avoir aucun contact avec la
tumeur et, dans ce cas, le
traitement appliqu&eacute; est une
t&eacute;l&eacute;th&eacute;rapie, soit &ecirc;tre en
contact direct avec la tumeur ou en &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s proche
et, dans ce cas, le
traitement appliqu&eacute; est une curieth&eacute;rapie. Pour
certains types de cancers -- tels
que le cancer du col de l'ut&eacute;rus ou celui de la t&ecirc;te
et du cou, la
curieth&eacute;rapie prot&egrave;ge les organes et tissus
d&eacute;licats et sains puisque les
rayonnements ne sont dirig&eacute;s que sur un site
pr&eacute;cis. La curieth&eacute;rapie
permet non seulement de traiter mais aussi, dans certains cas, de
gu&eacute;rir un grand
nombre de patients.
<P>
Efficace, d'emploi simple et relativement bon march&eacute;, la
curieth&eacute;rapie permet
de sauver, en Egypte par exemple, les vies de centaines de
patientes atteintes de cancer du col
de l'ut&eacute;rus gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des travaux
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant de l'appui de
l'AIEA, de l'OMS et du Gouvernement italien.
<P>
Mise au point r&eacute;cemment, une autre proc&eacute;dure, qui
fait appel &agrave; des
anticorps monoclonaux radiomarqu&eacute;s, permet d'obtenir des
r&eacute;sultats dans le
traitement du cancer. Les anticorps monoclonaux, qui sont des
prot&eacute;ines combattant la
maladie, se fixent de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence sur un tissu ou
une cellule canc&eacute;reuse
sp&eacute;cifique. Un radionucl&eacute;ide li&eacute;
chimiquement &agrave; ces anticorps
monoclonaux peut dispenser
une forte dose de rayonnement dans une r&eacute;gion
sp&eacute;cifique sans toucher les
tissus environnants.
<A NAME="manage"><P>
<B><I>Gestion de la maladie</I></B>
<P></A>
<B>R&eacute;duction et &eacute;limination de la douleur</B>
<P>
La m&eacute;decine nucl&eacute;aire a &eacute;galement une autre
fonction
th&eacute;rapeutique: la r&eacute;duction de la douleur. De
nombreux patients atteints d'un
cancer des os ou d'un cancer qui s'est &eacute;tendu aux
os souffrent de douleurs intol&eacute;rables. La
radioth&eacute;rapie peut servir de palliatif,
rempla&ccedil;ant les antalgiques qui finissent par
perdre leur efficacit&eacute;.
<P>
Les m&eacute;decins peuvent administrer un compos&eacute;
ost&eacute;otrope
marqu&eacute; au moyen d'un &eacute;metteur radioactif &agrave;
TLE
&eacute;lev&eacute;. Cette technique permet de r&eacute;duire
rapidement l'intensit&eacute;
de la douleur ou de l'&eacute;liminer compl&egrave;tement, et
elle procure un soulagement
quasiment instantan&eacute; au patient.
<P>
<B>St&eacute;rilisation d'instruments m&eacute;dicaux</B>
<P>
Les instruments m&eacute;dicaux utilis&eacute;s pour le
diagnostic ou le traitement d'un
patient --  et tout particuli&egrave;rement ceux qui traversent
la barri&egrave;re protectrice
de
la peau --  doivent &ecirc;tre exempts de tout germe. Si un
instrument m&eacute;dical non
st&eacute;rile, telle une seringue ou une aiguille hypodermique,
&eacute;tait utilis&eacute;
par inadvertance, il pourrait transmettre une infection,
qui se solderait par une infection crois&eacute;e ou, dans le
pire des cas, un
d&eacute;c&egrave;s, ce qui irait de toute fa&ccedil;on &agrave;
l'encontre des objectifs de
la m&eacute;decine.
<P>
Les rayonnements gamma du cobalt 60 servent &agrave;
st&eacute;riliser des
instruments qui ne peuvent pas l'&ecirc;tre autrement, et cela
avec des risques beaucoup plus
faibles pour la sant&eacute;. Quelque 150 installations
situ&eacute;es dans 44 pays
fournissent des instruments m&eacute;dicaux
st&eacute;rilis&eacute;s m&ecirc;me dans les
parties les plus recul&eacute;es du monde.
<P>
<B>Dosim&eacute;trie</B>
<P>
Pour assurer l'efficacit&eacute; des proc&eacute;dures, il est
extr&ecirc;mement important
que les doses appliqu&eacute;es soient pr&eacute;cises et
d&eacute;termin&eacute;es pour
chaque patient par des &eacute;valuations et des calculs
minutieux. Sans &ecirc;tre une
m&eacute;thode de diagnostic ou de traitement, la
dosim&eacute;trie joue donc aussi un
r&ocirc;le important dans l'application des radionucl&eacute;ides
et dans la
radioth&eacute;rapie. En collaboration avec l'OMS, l'AIEA
coordonne un r&eacute;seau

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>L</B></FONT>a energ&iacute;a nuclear salva vidas. Como
instrumento utilizado en la esfera de la sanidad humana, la energ&iacute;a nuclear puede
aprovecharse y emplearse en diversas t&eacute;cnicas con fines de prevenci&oacute;n,
diagn&oacute;stico y tratamiento de enfermedades.
<P>
Las t&eacute;cnicas que dentro de las ciencias m&eacute;dicas utilizan energ&iacute;a
nuclear tienen la capacidad excepcional de mostrar las funciones corporales a trav&eacute;s
del tiempo, al igual que una pel&iacute;cula muestra una tras otra las im&aacute;genes, con
rapidez y exactitud. La importancia de esta ventaja es evidente si se considera que uno de
cada tres pacientes que acuden al hospital en un pa&iacute;s industrializado recibe los
beneficios de alg&uacute;n tipo de procedimiento nuclear.
<P>
El Organismo Internacional de Energ&iacute;a At&oacute;mica (OIEA) y la
Organizaci&oacute;n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) desempe&ntilde;an una funci&oacute;n
esencial en la transferencia de t&eacute;cnicas, experiencias y conocimientos especializados
de car&aacute;cter nuclear a los Estados Miembros, especialmente a los pa&iacute;ses en
desarrollo, y en el desarrollo de esas t&eacute;cnicas.
<A NAME="methods"><P>
<H3><I>M&eacute;todos de diagn&oacute;stico</I></H3>
<P></A>
Seg&uacute;n estimaciones de la OMS, m&aacute;s de la mitad de todos los casos de
c&aacute;ncer en el mundo se registran en los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. Se ha determinado
que un 75% de estos pacientes eran incurables en el momento del diagn&oacute;stico. Estas
estad&iacute;sticas est&aacute;n cambiando gracias a dos t&eacute;cnicas de
diagn&oacute;stico: las t&eacute;cnicas <I>in vivo</I> y las t&eacute;cnicas <I>in vitro</I>.
Estos m&eacute;todos permiten descubrir la presencia de una enfermedad y la medida en que
&eacute;sta ha invadido el Organismo, y pueden ayudar a determinar la mejor forma de
tratamiento.
<P>
<B>T&eacute;cnicas <I>in vivo</I></B>

<P>
Las t&eacute;cnicas de diagn&oacute;stico <I>in vivo</I> se basan en el enfoque conocido
como el principio de los ``trazadores''. Un radionucleido con una forma qu&iacute;mica y
una duraci&oacute;n de la radiactividad minuciosamente seleccionadas, denominado
radiof&aacute;rmaco, se administra al paciente para observar un fen&oacute;meno
fisiol&oacute;gico espec&iacute;fico mediante un detector especial, frecuentemente una
c&aacute;mara gamma, colocado fuera del cuerpo. El radiof&aacute;rmaco puede concebirse
de tal manera que vaya exclusivamente a los tejidos u &oacute;rganos deseados, como por
ejemplo los pulmones. Al dirigir la radiaci&oacute;n exclusivamente donde se necesita, y no
aleatoriamente, las t&eacute;cnicas modernas aumentan los beneficios que las aplicaciones
nucleares pueden arrojar para la salud.
<P>
Unos 100 a 300 radiof&aacute;rmacos, en su mayor&iacute;a de naturaleza org&aacute;nica y
marcados con radionucleidos artificiales, tales como el indio 111 y el galio 67, se utilizan
para estudiar &oacute;rganos y tejidos sin alterarlos. Los m&eacute;todos nucleares de
diagn&oacute;stico exponen al paciente a una dosis peque&ntilde;a de radiaci&oacute;n. Esta
dosis puede minimizarse a&uacute;n m&aacute;s con el empleo de radis&oacute;topos de
per&iacute;odo m&aacute;s corto, tales como el tecnecio 99m, que se desintegra y adquiere
una forma estable en pocas horas.
<P>
El radiof&aacute;rmaco se administra al paciente, generalmente por inyecci&oacute;n
intravenosa, ingesti&oacute;n oral o inhalaci&oacute;n. A trav&eacute;s de un dispositivo de
detecci&oacute;n especial, como por ejemplo una c&aacute;mara gamma, se observa el
recorrido del radiof&aacute;rmaco por todo el organismo hasta que se concentre
espec&iacute;ficamente en un tejido u &oacute;rgano determinado. La c&aacute;mara gamma
detecta los fotones que escapan del cuerpo, creando una imagen bidimensional con la ayuda
de una computadora y una unidad de v&iacute;deo para visualizaci&oacute;n. Estas
im&aacute;genes muestran la calidad regional de una funci&oacute;n espec&iacute;fica en un
&oacute;rgano dado. Este proceso se denomina obtenci&oacute;n de im&aacute;genes planas
o escintigraf&iacute;a est&aacute;tica.
<P>
Cuando se reciben en forma r&aacute;pida y consecutiva, estas im&aacute;genes permiten un
estudio din&aacute;mico del comportamiento del radiof&aacute;rmaco, revelando
informaci&oacute;n funcional tan detallada como el vaciado del est&oacute;mago, el proceso
de respiraci&oacute;n en los pulmones o la actividad de bombeo del coraz&oacute;n.

<P>
Al igual que una radiograf&iacute;a, tales procedimientos pueden proporcionar una imagen de
un &oacute;rgano concreto del cuerpo o de una parte del mismo. La diferencia fundamental
es que, en medicina nuclear, la imagen obtenida proporciona una medida de la actividad de
una funci&oacute;n fisiol&oacute;gica o bioqu&iacute;mica espec&iacute;fica dentro del
cuerpo, mientras que una radiograf&iacute;a muestra los detalles anat&oacute;micos.
<P>
Gracias a las mayores posibilidades que ofrecen las computadoras modernas, las
im&aacute;genes cl&iacute;nicas pueden obtenerse desde m&uacute;ltiples &aacute;ngulos,
creando una r&eacute;plica de la secci&oacute;n eficaz del cuerpo, t&eacute;cnica que se
denomina tomograf&iacute;a computadorizada (CT). Las dos formas m&aacute;s avanzadas
que utilizan radionucleidos son la tomograf&iacute;a computadorizada de emisi&oacute;n de
fot&oacute;n simple (SPECT) y la tomograf&iacute;a por emisi&oacute;n de positrones
(PET).
<P>
La <B>SPECT</B> utiliza una c&aacute;mara gamma giratoria para obtener
im&aacute;genes, desde m&uacute;ltiples &aacute;ngulos, de la distribuci&oacute;n de un
radiof&aacute;rmaco convencional emisor de rayos gamma dentro de un &oacute;rgano. Esta
t&eacute;cnica es particularmente &uacute;til en vista de su capacidad excepcional para
ubicar la posici&oacute;n exacta de una anormalidad fisiol&oacute;gica en el cuerpo a
trav&eacute;s de una serie de secciones bidimensionales del &oacute;rgano producidas por la
computadora, a partir de las cuales pueden reconstruirse im&aacute;genes tridimensionales del
&oacute;rgano.
<P>
La <B>PET</B>, que es una t&eacute;cnica &uacute;til en la detecci&oacute;n y la lucha
contra el c&aacute;ncer, emplea uno o varios anillos de detectores estacionarios alrededor del
cuerpo del paciente para detectar rayos gamma divergentes muy fuertes (511 keV) producidos
por las interacciones de los positrones (emitidos por un radionucleido previamente
administrado) con los electrones libres dentro del
cuerpo. Seguidamente se procesa esta informaci&oacute;n para crear secciones del cuerpo
similares a las obtenidas mediante la SPECT. La PET tiene la capacidad excepcional de
mostrar procesos bioqu&iacute;micos regionales dentro del cuerpo, y puede revelar el origen
bioqu&iacute;mico de los trastornos neurol&oacute;gicos y las enfermedades mentales.
<P>
<B>T&eacute;cnicas <I>in vitro</I></B>
<P>
El segundo m&eacute;todo de diagn&oacute;stico, el de las t&eacute;cnicas <I>in vitro</I>,
permite efectuar un diagn&oacute;stico cl&iacute;nico sin exponer al paciente a las
radiaciones. De hecho, el paciente ni siquiera tiene que estar presente. Una muestra de sangre
del paciente se env&iacute;a al laboratorio y se examina mediante t&eacute;cnicas nucleares
tales como el radioinmunoan&aacute;lisis (RIA) o el an&aacute;lisis
inmunorradiom&eacute;trico (IRMA).
<P>
Estos an&aacute;lisis permiten medir con precisi&oacute;n la exposici&oacute;n pasada y
presente a una infecci&oacute;n, evaluando los anticuerpos. El RIA tambi&eacute;n se utiliza
para medir sustancias como las hormonas, vitaminas y medicamentos en los fluidos
corporales, para detectar trastornos relacionados con la nutrici&oacute;n y trastornos
endocrinol&oacute;gicos, para descubrir infecciones bacterianas y parasitarias tales como la
tuberculosis y la malaria. Apoyados por los programas coordinados de investigaci&oacute;n
del OIEA, unos 500 hospitales, universidades y laboratorios de los pa&iacute;ses en
desarrollo realizan trabajos de RIA en determinada escala, y esta cifra aumenta anualmente.
<P>
Entre otras aplicaciones de las t&eacute;cnicas de RIA e IRMA figuran la detecci&oacute;n
de marcadores de tumores, que son sustancias espec&iacute;ficas segregadas por muchos
tumores, aunque no por todos, y que pueden indicar la presencia de un tumor maligno.
Existen unas dos docenas de marcadores de tumores. No obstante su mayor exactitud, su
costo favorable y su conveniencia, los marcadores de tumores siguen utiliz&aacute;ndose
s&oacute;lo como complemento de otros procedimientos de diagn&oacute;stico para la
detecci&oacute;n temprana del c&aacute;ncer, y son especialmente &uacute;tiles en la
vigilancia del avance de la enfermedad y los efectos del tratamiento.
<A NAME="disease"><P>
<H3><I>Tratamiento de enfermedades</I></H3>
<P></A>
Las radiaciones se utilizan ampliamente en el tratamiento de enfermedades tales como el
hipertiroidismo y el c&aacute;ncer. Con el fin de controlar la enfermedad o de impedir su
recurrencia como resultado de la diseminaci&oacute;n de c&eacute;lulas cancerosas sueltas
que pueden originar otro c&aacute;ncer, es preciso destruir completamente todas las
c&eacute;lulas malignas de un tumor.
<P>
La radioterapia permite alcanzar ese objetivo, concentrando las radiaciones en un tumor
espec&iacute;fico, para lo que se utilizan muy frecuentemente rayos gamma de cobalto 60 o
sistemas de TLE (transferencia lineal de energ&iacute;a) alta, como fuentes de
energ&iacute;a.
<P>
La fuente de radiaci&oacute;n puede no tener contacto con el tumor, en cuyo caso se trata de
una t&eacute;cnica de tratamiento externo denominada teleterapia, o puede estar en contacto
directo o inmediato con el tumor, en cuyo caso se trata de una t&eacute;cnica denominada
braquiterapia. La braquiterapia, que se aplica frente a ciertos tipos de c&aacute;ncer, como el
del cuello del &uacute;tero o el c&aacute;ncer de la cabeza y el cuello, protege de las
radiaciones a los &oacute;rganos o tejidos delicados y sanos, al dirigir exclusivamente las
radiaciones a un lugar espec&iacute;fico. En determinados casos, la braquiterapia no solo
sirve para tratar, sino tambi&eacute;n para curar a numerosos pacientes.
<P>
En vista de su eficacia, sencillez de utilizaci&oacute;n y costo relativamente bajo, tan solo en
Egipto la braquiterapia ayuda a salvar las vidas de cientos de pacientes con c&aacute;ncer del
cuello del &uacute;tero gracias a la labor realizada con apoyo del OIEA, la OMS y el
Gobierno de Italia.
<P>
Existe otro procedimiento &uacute;til para el tratamiento del c&aacute;ncer, que solo ha sido
desarrollado recientemente y que utiliza anticuerpos monoclonales radiomarcados. Los
anticuerpos monoclonales, que son prote&iacute;nas que luchan contra las
enfermedades, se dirigen y adhieren a una c&eacute;lula cancerosa o tejido espec&iacute;fico.
Un radionucleido ligado qu&iacute;micamente a estos anticuerpos monoclonales puede
administrar una dosis de radiaci&oacute;n alta a una zona espec&iacute;fica sin afectar al
tejido circundante.
<A NAME="manage"><P>
<H3><I>Lucha contra las enfermedades</I></H3>
<P></A>
<B>Reducci&oacute;n y eliminaci&oacute;n del dolor</B>
<P>
La medicina nuclear cumple otra funci&oacute;n terap&eacute;utica: la reducci&oacute;n del
dolor. Numerosos pacientes con c&aacute;ncer de huesos, o c&aacute;ncer propagado a los
huesos, sufren dolores intolerables. La radioterapia puede aplicarse para paliar el dolor,
reemplazando a los analg&eacute;sicos que pierden su eficacia con el tiempo.

<P>
Los m&eacute;dicos pueden administrar un compuesto oste&oacute;tropo marcado con un
emisor de radiaciones de TLE alta. Gracias a esta t&eacute;cnica nuclear, el dolor disminuye
r&aacute;pidamente o desaparece por completo, proporcionando alivio casi instant&aacute;neo
al paciente.
<P>
<B>Esterilizaci&oacute;n de art&iacute;culos m&eacute;dicos</B>
<P>
Los instrumentos m&eacute;dicos que se utilizan en el diagn&oacute;stico o tratamiento de un
paciente, especialmente los que pueden penetrar la barrera protectora de la piel, deben estar
completamente exentos de g&eacute;rmenes. El uso inadvertido de art&iacute;culos
m&eacute;dicos no est&eacute;riles, tales como jeringuillas y agujas hipod&eacute;rmicas,
puede transmitir una infecci&oacute;n por contagio o, en el peor de los casos, causar la
muerte, contradiciendo en ambos casos el objetivo de la medicina.
<P>
Los rayos gamma provenientes del cobalto 60 se utilizan para esterilizar instrumentos que no
pueden ser esterilizados por otros m&eacute;todos, y con
riesgos considerablemente menores para la salud. Unas 150 instalaciones de 44 pa&iacute;ses
del mundo proporcionan art&iacute;culos m&eacute;dicos esterilizados hasta en las zonas
m&aacute;s remotas.
<P>
<B>Dosimetr&iacute;a</B>
<P>
La aplicaci&oacute;n de dosis exactas, determinadas para cada paciente mediante evaluaciones
y c&aacute;lculos minuciosos, es sumamente importante para una aplicaci&oacute;n eficaz de
las radiaciones. Por lo tanto, sin ser un m&eacute;todo de diagn&oacute;stico ni de
tratamiento, la dosimetr&iacute;a tambi&eacute;n desempe&ntilde;a una funci&oacute;n
importante en la aplicaci&oacute;n de los radionucleidos y la radioterapia. El OIEA, en
cooperaci&oacute;n con la OMS, coordina una red mundial de Laboratorios Secundarios de
Calibraci&oacute;n Dosim&eacute;trica (LSCD), ubicados en 51 Estados Miembros, con el
fin de mejorar la exactitud dosim&eacute;trica, particularmente en la esfera de la radioterapia.
<P>
Estos laboratorios mantienen el v&iacute;nculo entre los usuarios de las radiaciones y un
sistema internacional de mediciones que calibra los dos&iacute;metros de los centros de
radioterapia. Las comparaciones permiten a los LSCD comprobar la exactitud de sus
dos&iacute;metros ``de patrones secundarios'' con miras a garantizar la unificaci&oacute;n de
las mediciones a escala mundial.
<P>
La exactitud y el empleo apropiado de los dos&iacute;metros de los centros de radioterapia
tambi&eacute;n se comprueban a trav&eacute;s del servicio postal de dosimetr&iacute;a
OIEA/OMS que utiliza dos&iacute;metros termoluminiscentes. Desde 1969 se han realizado
unas 2 000 comprobaciones, en las que han participado m&aacute;s de 700 centros de
radioterapia de 89 pa&iacute;ses.
<A NAME="future"><P>
<H3><I>Planes y nuevos adelantos</I></H3>
<P></A>
El Organismo ha contribuido a elevar el nivel de la atenci&oacute;n sanitaria en los Estados
Miembros mediante la transferencia de t&eacute;cnicas nucleares ultramodernas,
especialmente a los pa&iacute;ses menos adelantados, donde no se dispone de instalaciones o
&eacute;stas son muy inadecuadas. El Organismo organiza cursos de capacitaci&oacute;n,
ofrece becas y presta asistencia y cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnicas para optimizar los
recursos humanos y el equipo existentes.
<P>
Los planes para el futuro consisten en introducir las t&eacute;cnicas m&aacute;s sencillas y
los instrumentos especializados de que carecen muchos laboratorios de los Estados Miembros
del OIEA. Estos planes ayudar&aacute;n a reducir los gastos y a aumentar la disponibilidad
de t&eacute;cnicas nucleares en la medicina.
<P>
A medida que las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares sean m&aacute;s f&aacute;ciles de utilizar y que,
por lo tanto, su aplicaci&oacute;n vaya adquiriendo car&aacute;cter universal, la necesidad de
una tecnolog&iacute;a apropiada y pr&aacute;ctica para la atenci&oacute;n sanitaria y la
investigaci&oacute;n seguir&aacute; siendo un desaf&iacute;o en evoluci&oacute;n constante
al que el OIEA tendr&aacute; que hacer frente.

<B><I>Electricit&eacute; et progr&egrave;s</I></B>
<P>
La consommation d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; est pratiquement indissociable de la vie
moderne dans le monde industrialis&eacute;. Nos syst&egrave;mes de communication, nos
moyens de transport, nos disponibilit&eacute;s alimentaires et la plupart des
&eacute;quipements dont sont dot&eacute;s aujourd'hui les habitations, les bureaux et les
usines d&eacute;pendent d'une alimentation en &eacute;lectricit&eacute; fiable.
<P>
Le nombre de pays industriels ne cessant d'augmenter, la consommation
d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; progresse constamment. La consommation mondiale
d'&eacute;nergie a &eacute;t&eacute; multipli&eacute;e par 25 depuis le si&egrave;cle
dernier, et la consommation moyenne d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; par habitant est environ dix
fois plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e dans les pays industriels que dans les pays en
d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>
Or, comme les &eacute;conomies de maints pays en d&eacute;veloppement connaissent
maintenant une expansion rapide, la demande d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; dans le Sud devrait
cro&icirc;tre annuellement de plus de 5 % au cours des 15 prochaines ann&eacute;es. Seule
une augmentation spectaculaire de la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; permettra de
satisfaire cette demande.
<A NAME="price"><P>
<B><I>Le prix &agrave; payer</I></B>
<P></A>
Dans le monde, la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;
 reste en grande partie tributaire des combustibles fossiles -- p&eacute;trole, gaz et charbon --
qui sont fortement polluants. Une des menaces les plus graves qui p&egrave;sent sur
l'environnement mondial est due &agrave; l'augmentation rapide des &eacute;missions de
<I>gaz &agrave; effet de serre</I>, notamment de dioxyde de carbone
(CO<SUB>2</SUB>) qui, selon de nombreux scientifiques, est le principal
responsable du r&eacute;chauffement de la plan&egrave;te.
<P>
De fait, dans son dernier rapport, le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur
l'&eacute;volution du climat (GIEC) formule une mise en garde: si la communaut&eacute;
internationale ne prend pas imm&eacute;diatement des mesures draconiennes pour
stabiliser et r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions de ces
gaz r&eacute;tenteurs de chaleur, les temp&eacute;ratures pourraient augmenter dans le
monde d'au moins 1,5 degr&eacute; centigrade d'ici le milieu du si&egrave;cle prochain. Ce
r&eacute;chauffement serait comparable &agrave; celui qui a mis fin &agrave; la
derni&egrave;re glaciation et pourrait avoir des effets aussi marqu&eacute;s sur le niveau des
mers et le climat. Ce rapport contient des pr&eacute;visions dont voici quelques-unes des plus
alarmantes: des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes entiers pourraient dispara&icirc;tre avec la
modification des r&eacute;gimes des pr&eacute;cipitations et des temp&eacute;ratures; de
vastes zones &agrave; forte densit&eacute; de population pourraient &ecirc;tre
inond&eacute;es en raison de l'&eacute;l&eacute;vation du niveau de la mer; et les
s&eacute;cheresses, les inondations et les temp&ecirc;tes pourraient s'aggraver.
<P>
Dans l'esprit du GIEC, il s'agit peut-&ecirc;tre d'un sc&eacute;nario pessimiste, mais les
scientifiques s'accordent largement &agrave; penser que l'augmentation des &eacute;missions
de gaz &agrave; effet de serre, associ&eacute;e &agrave; d'autres formes nocives de pollution
atmosph&eacute;rique, constitue une menace tr&egrave;s r&eacute;elle &agrave; la fois pour
l'&eacute;quilibre &eacute;cologique mondial et la sant&eacute; humaine.
<A NAME="done"><P>
<B><I>Fait-on quelque chose?</I></B>
<P></A>
Quand les repr&eacute;sentants de pays du monde entier se sont r&eacute;unis au
Br&eacute;sil en 1992 pour la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies sur l'environnement
et le d&eacute;veloppement, ils ont approuv&eacute; dans leur principe une s&eacute;rie de
propositions visant &agrave; diminuer les &eacute;missions des gaz &agrave; effet de serre.
Les pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s les plus riches se sont engag&eacute;s &agrave; ramener
d'ici &agrave; l'an 2000 les rejets dans l'atmosph&egrave;re au niveau de 1990. Toutefois,
depuis le sommet de la Terre, les progr&egrave;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; in&eacute;gaux,
voire n&eacute;gligeables dans certains cas. Les d&eacute;bits d'&eacute;mission de dioxyde
de carbone n'ont diminu&eacute; que de fa&ccedil;on marginale dans certains pays
industrialis&eacute;s, et ce en raison essentiellement du ralentissement de l'&eacute;conomie,
alors que, dans la plupart des pays en d&eacute;veloppement, ils ont augment&eacute;
sensiblement sous l'effet d'une demande d'&eacute;nergie croissante et de l'utilisation de
combustibles fossiles polluants.
<P>
Il est en outre peu probable que les sch&eacute;mas de consommation des ressources
changent par suite de la rar&eacute;faction et du rench&eacute;rissement des combustibles
fossiles. D'apr&egrave;s l'Institut des ressources mondiales, la production et la consommation
de ces derniers continuent d'augmenter pratiquement partout. Par ailleurs, on estime
actuellement que les r&eacute;serves prouv&eacute;es de p&eacute;trole, de gaz naturel
et de charbon devraient permettre de satisfaire la demande pendant 40, 60 et 230 ans
respectivement. Au cours des 20 prochaines ann&eacute;es, l'Inde pr&eacute;voit
de tripler et la Chine de doubler la consommation de charbon destin&eacute;e &agrave; la
production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;.
<P>
Pour tenter de r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions de gaz &agrave; effet de serre, certains
pays se tournent vers le gaz naturel, qui est &eacute;conomiquement comp&eacute;titif par
rapport au p&eacute;trole et au charbon. Toutefois, l'utilisation de gaz naturel produit aussi du
dioxyde de carbone (mais moins cependant que le charbon ou le p&eacute;trole) et les fuites
de m&eacute;thane lors de l'extraction, du transport et de la distribution du gaz naturel sont
globalement de l'ordre de 5 &agrave; 10 %, ce qui annule largement les avantages
retir&eacute;s d'une r&eacute;duction des &eacute;missions de CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
<P>
Comme tout laisse &agrave; pr&eacute;voir que l'on utilisera toujours davantage de
combustibles fossiles pour la production d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; et que la menace qui
p&egrave;se sur l'environnement mondial ira en s'aggravant, le nucl&eacute;aire peut jouer
un r&ocirc;le important dans les pays qui ont besoin d'accro&icirc;tre leur approvisionnement
&eacute;nerg&eacute;tique tout en &eacute;vitant d'augmenter les &eacute;missions de
gaz &agrave; effet de serre.
<A NAME="option"><P>
<B><I>L'option nucl&eacute;aire</I></B>
<P></A>
Les centrales nucl&eacute;aires produisent d&eacute;j&agrave;  environ 17 % de
l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; mondiale. Elles n'&eacute;mettent pratiquement pas de dioxyde de
carbone (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), de dioxyde de soufre (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) ou d'oxydes
d'azote (NO<sUB>2</SUB>). Dans cinq pays au moins, dont la Belgique, la France et la
Su&egrave;de, le nucl&eacute;aire assure plus de 50 % de l'approvisionnement total en
&eacute;lectricit&eacute;. Dans dix autres, dont la Cor&eacute;e (R&eacute;publique de),
l'Espagne, la Finlande, le Japon et la Suisse, la proportion est d'au moins 30 %. En outre, un
grand nombre de pays en d&eacute;veloppement, dont l'Argentine, le Br&eacute;sil, la Chine,
l'Inde, le Mexique et le Pakistan, ont des centrales nucl&eacute;aires en service. Il y a
actuellement dans le monde plus de 430 r&eacute;acteurs en service qui produisent
&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s autant d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; que les centrales
hydro&eacute;lectriques.
<A NAME="greenhouse"><P>
<B><I>R&eacute;duction des &eacute;missions de gaz &agrave; effet de serre</I></B>
<P></A>
Le recours accru au nucl&eacute;aire depuis les ann&eacute;es 60, associ&eacute; &agrave;
l'augmentation constante de la production d'hydro&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, a
contribu&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions de dioxyde de carbone dans
le monde entier. Si l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; produite chaque ann&eacute;e dans le monde
par des centrales nucl&eacute;aires provenait de centrales au charbon, 1 600 millions de
tonnes suppl&eacute;mentaires de CO<SUB>2</SUB> seraient rejet&eacute;es dans
l'atmosph&egrave;re.
<P>
Autrement dit, si l'on n'avait pas recours au nucl&eacute;aire aujourd'hui, les
&eacute;missions de dioxyde de carbone augmenteraient chaque ann&eacute;e dans le monde
d'au moins 8 %.
<P>
Du point de vue de la gestion des d&eacute;chets, le nucl&eacute;aire est &eacute;galement
plus &eacute;cologique. Une centrale au charbon de 1 000 MWe non seulement &eacute;met
des gaz &agrave; effet de serre et de l'acide sulfurique en grande quantit&eacute;, mais elle
produit aussi chaque ann&eacute;e quelque 300 000 tonnes de cendres, qui contiennent
notamment des mati&egrave;res radioactives et des m&eacute;taux lourds, lesquels finissent
dans des d&eacute;charges ou dans l'atmosph&egrave;re. En revanche, une centrale
nucl&eacute;aire de m&ecirc;me capacit&eacute; ne produit annuellement que quelque 800
tonnes de d&eacute;chets de faible et moyenne activit&eacute; et environ 30 tonnes de
d&eacute;chets hautement radioactifs, qui peuvent &ecirc;tre isol&eacute;s de la
biosph&egrave;re.
<P>
Si les gouvernements se sont engag&eacute;s &agrave; r&eacute;duire globalement les
quantit&eacute;s de CO<SUB>2</SUB> produites par unit&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie
consomm&eacute;e, le nombre de pays qui sont parvenus &agrave; diminuer les
&eacute;missions de gaz &agrave; effet de serre en passant &agrave; des combustibles non
fossiles est relativement restreint. La Cor&eacute;e (R&eacute;publique de), la France, l'Inde,
le Japon et la Su&egrave;de ont tous r&eacute;duit sensiblement -- jusqu'&agrave;
30 % -- leurs &eacute;missions de CO<SUB>2</SUB> par unit&eacute;
d'&eacute;nergie produite au cours des 30 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es.
Dans les pays sans &eacute;lectronucl&eacute;aire (Danemark, Irlande et Italie), la
r&eacute;duction des &eacute;missions dues &agrave; la production d'&eacute;nergie n'a pas
d&eacute;pass&eacute; 10 %.
<A NAME="future"><P>
<B><I>L'avenir &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique: 
<BR></A>
un &eacute;quilibre &agrave; trouver</I></B>
<P>
Par suite des effets conjugu&eacute;s de la pouss&eacute;e d&eacute;mographique, du
d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et de l'industrialisation dans le monde,
l'accroissement de la consommation mondiale d'&eacute;nergie va se poursuivre. Comme, en
outre, les pays continueront de recourir aux combustibles fossiles pour l'&eacute;nergie
primaire, les &eacute;missions de gaz &agrave; effet de serre dans le monde ne vont pas
cesser d'augmenter. M&ecirc;me si des mesures &eacute;nergiques sont prises, les
pr&eacute;visions actuelles n'indiquent pas de stabilisation des &eacute;missions avant 2050
environ.
<P>
C'est dans ce contexte &eacute;cologique g&eacute;n&eacute;ral qu'un certain nombre de
gouvernements et de compagnies d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, notamment dans le monde en
d&eacute;veloppement, envisagent de recourir &agrave; l'&eacute;lectronucl&eacute;aire.
Dans le cadre de son programme <I>DECADES</I>, l'AIEA proc&egrave;de, avec un grand
nombre d'entre eux, &agrave; une planification &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique approfondie, en
effectuant une &eacute;valuation comparative des sources d'&eacute;nergie et de leurs impacts
respectifs sur la sant&eacute; et l'environnement.

<P>
Si l'option nucl&eacute;aire s'av&egrave;re viable, l'AIEA peut, &agrave; la demande des
Etats Membres, les aider &agrave; planifier soigneusement son introduction, et notamment
&agrave; cr&eacute;er des infrastructures industrielles et administratives appropri&eacute;es,
&agrave; former du personnel et &agrave; faire en sorte que les centrales nucl&eacute;aires
soient exploit&eacute;es et entretenues de mani&egrave;re efficace et s&ucirc;re.
<A NAME="air"><P>
<B><I>Assainir l'atmosph&egrave;re</I></B>
<P></A>
Dans de nombreux pays industrialis&eacute;s, une grande partie de l'opinion publique
demeure r&eacute;ticente devant un recours accru au nucl&eacute;aire ou y est
oppos&eacute;e, voire n'est pas d'accord pour qu'on continue de l'utiliser autant
qu'actuellement. Cette opposition tient &agrave; trois facteurs: crainte des accidents, crainte
devant les d&eacute;chets radioactifs &agrave; longue p&eacute;riode et crainte que le
recours au nucl&eacute;aire ne contribue &agrave; la prolif&eacute;ration des armes
nucl&eacute;aires.
<P>
Or, l'expansion du nucl&eacute;aire n'a pas conduit
&agrave; une prolif&eacute;ration des armes nucl&eacute;aires. Bien
au contraire, le nombre des pays qui ont pris
des engagements de non-prolif&eacute;ration n'a cess&eacute;
de cro&icirc;tre.
<P>
Alors que le public et les m&eacute;dias continuent de s'inqui&eacute;ter de la moindre
perturbation qui peut
se produire dans des installations nucl&eacute;aires, les centrales font preuve en fait dans
l'ensemble
de beaucoup de fiabilit&eacute; et d'une grande capacit&eacute; d'adaptation. Elles ont
accumul&eacute; une exp&eacute;rience d'exploitation de pr&egrave;s de 7 200
ann&eacute;es-r&eacute;acteur.
<P>
Les enseignements que l'on en a tir&eacute;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis &agrave; profit pour
modifier leur conception et leur technologie en vue d'accro&icirc;tre leur fiabilit&eacute; et
leur s&ucirc;ret&eacute; d'exploitation.
<P>

Comme toute autre source d'&eacute;nergie, le nucl&eacute;aire produit des d&eacute;chets
qui doivent &ecirc;tre g&eacute;r&eacute;s et stock&eacute;s correctement. Les technologies
qui permettent un stockage s&ucirc;r des d&eacute;chets
de moyenne et faible activit&eacute; sont &eacute;prouv&eacute;es et largement
utilis&eacute;es dans les Etats Membres de l'AIEA. Quant au stockage &agrave; long terme
des d&eacute;chets de haute activit&eacute;, tels que le combustible irradi&eacute;, il est
techniquement possible dans des conditions s&ucirc;res, mais il
se heurte &agrave; des obstacles d'ordre politique que les gouvernements doivent
surmonter.
<P>
De nombreux pays s'emploient activement &agrave; recenser des sites appropri&eacute;s ou
&agrave; construire des installations de stockage &agrave; long terme pour
les d&eacute;chets de haute activit&eacute;. Ces installations de stockage &agrave; grande
profondeur doivent satisfaire aux normes de s&ucirc;ret&eacute; les plus
&eacute;lev&eacute;es en ce qui concerne l'environnement, la g&eacute;ologie et la
protection des personnes. La communaut&eacute; nucl&eacute;aire
est consciente de ses responsabilit&eacute;s et, dans l'ensemble, l'industrie nucl&eacute;aire
investit plus que toute autre industrie comparable dans les mesures de s&ucirc;ret&eacute;.

<B><I>Energ&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica y progreso</I></B>
<P>
Consumo de electricidad y vida moderna son pr&aacute;cticamente sin&oacute;nimos en el
mundo industrializado. Nuestras comunicaciones, el transporte, el abastecimiento de
alimentos,
y la mayor parte de los agrados y servicios de los hogares, oficinas y f&aacute;bricas de
nuestros d&iacute;as dependen de un suministro fiable de energ&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica.
<P>
A medida que m&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses se industrializan se consumen cantidades de
energ&iacute;a cada vez mayores. El consumo mundial de energ&iacute;a se ha multiplicado
por 25 desde el siglo pasado. El promedio del consumo de electricidad per c&aacute;pita es
alrededor de diez veces mayor en los pa&iacute;ses industrializados que en el mundo en
desarrollo.
<P>
Pero como en la actualidad las econom&iacute;as de muchas naciones en desarrollo se
expanden r&aacute;pidamente, para los pr&oacute;ximos 15 a&ntilde;os se prev&eacute; un
crecimiento de m&aacute;s del 5% anual de la demanda de electricidad en el ``Sur''. Para
satisfacer esta demanda se necesitar&aacute; un aumento espectacular de la
producci&oacute;n
de electricidad.
<A NAME="price"><P>
<B><I>El precio de la energ&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica</I></B>
<P></A>
La generaci&oacute;n de energ&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica en el mundo entero sigue
dependiendo en gran parte de la quema de combustibles f&oacute;siles --petr&oacute;leo, gas
y carb&oacute;n-- que son sumamente contaminantes. Una de las amenazas m&aacute;s
graves para el medio ambiente mundial procede de esta contaminaci&oacute;n: las emisiones
en r&aacute;pido aumento de los denominados gases ``de invernadero'', en especial el
di&oacute;xido de carbono (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) considerado por muchos cient&iacute;ficos
como el principal responsable del recalentamiento de la Tierra.
<P>
De hecho, en el &uacute;ltimo informe del Grupo Intergubernamental sobre cambios
clim&aacute;ticos se advierte que a menos que la comunidad mundial adopte de inmediato
medidas dr&aacute;sticas para estabilizar y reducir las emisiones de gases de este tipo que
retienen el calor, las temperaturas mundiales podr&iacute;an aumentar como m&iacute;nimo
1,5 grados cent&iacute;grados de aqu&iacute; a mediados del pr&oacute;ximo siglo, una tasa
de incremento que ser&iacute;a comparable al calentamiento que puso fin al &uacute;ltimo
per&iacute;odo glaciar y que podr&iacute;a tener efectos igualmente marcados para el nivel
del mar y el clima. Entre las predicciones m&aacute;s alarmantes del informe est&aacute;n
las
siguientes: al cambiar los reg&iacute;menes pluviom&eacute;tricos y t&eacute;rmicos
podr&iacute;an desaparecer ecosistemas enteros; enormes franjas de tierras densamente
pobladas podr&iacute;an inundarse al subir el nivel de los mares; y las sequ&iacute;as,
inundaciones y tormentas podr&iacute;an volverse m&aacute;s graves.
<P>
Aunque tal vez el Grupo Intergubernamental sobre cambios clim&aacute;ticos quiera
presentar
esta situaci&oacute;n como la peor hip&oacute;tesis, entre los cient&iacute;ficos existe un
consenso generalizado de que los crecientes vol&uacute;menes de las emisiones de gases de
invernadero combinados con otras formas nocivas de contaminaci&oacute;n
atmosf&eacute;rica representan una amenaza considerable para la salud humana y la
estabilidad ecol&oacute;gica mundial.
<A NAME="done"><P>
<B><I>Se est&aacute; haciendo algo al respecto?</I></B>
<P></A>
Los representantes venidos del mundo entero que se reunieron en el Brasil para la
Conferencia
de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Medio Ambiente y el Desarrollo, celebrada en 1992,
convinieron en principio en un conjunto de propuestas para disminuir las emisiones de gases
de invernadero. Los pa&iacute;ses desarrollados m&aacute;s ricos se comprometieron a
mantener en el a&ntilde;o 2000 las emisiones atmosf&eacute;ricas en los niveles de 1990.
Pero los progresos realizados desde dicha Cumbre para la Tierra han sido desiguales y en
ciertos casos insignificantes. Las tasas de emisi&oacute;n de di&oacute;xido de carbono se
han reducido solo ligeramente en algunos pa&iacute;ses industrializados --principalmente
debido a la desaceleraci&oacute;n de sus econom&iacute;as-- y en la mayor&iacute;a de los
pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo han aumentado en forma considerable debido a la creciente
demanda energ&eacute;tica y a que se recurre a los combustibles f&oacute;siles
contaminantes.
<P>
Tambi&eacute;n es improbable que cambien las modalidades de consumo de los recursos por
el hecho de que los combustibles f&oacute;siles se vuelvan m&aacute;s escasos o m&aacute;s
caros. Seg&uacute;n el Instituto de los Recursos Mundiales, la producci&oacute;n y el
consumo de combustibles f&oacute;siles siguen en aumento en casi todas partes.
Adem&aacute;s, en la actualidad se estima que las reservas comprobadas de petr&oacute;leo,
gas natural y carb&oacute;n pueden satisfacer respectivamente la demanda de los
pr&oacute;ximos 40, 60 y 230 a&ntilde;os aproximadamente. En las dos pr&oacute;ximas
d&eacute;cadas, la India proyecta triplicar y China duplicar la utilizaci&oacute;n de
carb&oacute;n para consumo de electricidad.
<P>
En un esfuerzo para reducir las emisiones de gases de invernadero, algunos pa&iacute;ses
optan actualmente por el gas natural, que desde el punto de vista econ&oacute;mico es
competitivo con respecto al petr&oacute;leo y al carb&oacute;n. Pero el consumo de gas
natural produce tambi&eacute;n di&oacute;xido de carbono (aunque menos que el
carb&oacute;n o el petr&oacute;leo) y, por otra parte, los escapes de metano durante la
extracci&oacute;n, traslado y distribuci&oacute;n de gas natural representan en su conjunto
entre el 5 y el 10%, una magnitud que contrarresta con creces la ventaja de emisiones de
CO<SUB>2</SUB> m&aacute;s reducidas.
<P>
En vista de las perspectivas de un constante aumento del consumo de combustibles
f&oacute;siles para la producci&oacute;n de electricidad y de la amenaza creciente para el
medio ambiente mundial, la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica puede desempe&ntilde;ar
un papel importante para los pa&iacute;ses que necesitan crecientes suministros
energ&eacute;ticos sin que aumenten las emisiones de gases de invernadero.
<A NAME="option"><P>
<B><I>La opci&oacute;n nuclear</I></B>
<P></A>
Las centrales nucleares aportan ya alrededor del 17% del total de la electricidad en el mundo.
Pr&aacute;cticamente no producen emisiones de di&oacute;xido de carbono
(CO<SUB>2</SUB>), di&oacute;xido de azufre (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) ni &oacute;xido de
nitr&oacute;geno (NO<SUB>2</SUB>). Al menos cinco pa&iacute;ses, entre los que se
cuentan Francia, Suecia y B&eacute;lgica, obtienen m&aacute;s del 50% de sus suministros
totales de electricidad de la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica. Otros diez pa&iacute;ses,
incluidos Espa&ntilde;a, Finlandia, el Jap&oacute;n, la Rep&uacute;blica de Corea y Suiza,
producen en centrales nucleares el 30% o m&aacute;s de sus suministros totales.
Adem&aacute;s, un gran n&uacute;mero de naciones en desarrollo, incluidas la Argentina, el
Brasil, China, la India, M&eacute;xico y el Pakist&aacute;n, tienen centrales nucleares en
servicio. Actualmente hay en el mundo m&aacute;s de
430 reactores en funcionamiento que producen aproximadamente tanta electricidad como la
que proviene de la energ&iacute;a hidroel&eacute;ctrica.
<A NAME="greenhouse"><P>
<B><I>Evitar las emisiones de gases de invernadero</I></B>

<P></A>
La creciente utilizaci&oacute;n de energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica desde el decenio de
1960 sumada a los aumentos constantes del aprovechamiento de la energ&iacute;a
hidroel&eacute;ctrica han ayudado a frenar la producci&oacute;n mundial de di&oacute;xido
de carbono. Si la energ&iacute;a el&eacute;ctrica de origen nuclear generada anualmente
en el mundo fuese producida por centrales de carb&oacute;n, de emisiones adicionales se
originar&iacute;an 1600 millones de toneladas de CO<SUB>2</SUB>.
<P>
En otras palabras, si en la actualidad el mundo no utilizara energ&iacute;a
nucleoel&eacute;ctrica, las emisiones mundiales de di&oacute;xido de carbono
aumentar&iacute;an, como m&iacute;nimo, en un 8% cada a&ntilde;o.
<P>
La energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica es tambi&eacute;n m&aacute;s benigna para el
medio ambiente desde el punto de vista de la gesti&oacute;n de desechos. Adem&aacute;s de
las grandes cantidades de gases de invernadero y de &aacute;cido sulf&uacute;rico generadas,
una central de carb&oacute;n de 1000 MW(e) produce anualmente unas 300 000 toneladas de
cenizas que contienen, entre otras cosas, materiales radiactivos y metales pesados que
terminan en los vertederos y en la atm&oacute;sfera. En cambio, los desechos radiactivos
producidos por una central nuclear de la misma potencia ascienden solo a unas 800 toneladas
de desechos de actividad baja y media y a unas 30 toneladas de desechos de actividad
alta al a&ntilde;o, los cuales pueden aislarse de la biosfera.
<P>
Aunque los gobiernos se han comprometido con la tendencia mundial hacia una
reducci&oacute;n de las cantidades de CO<SUB>2</SUB> producidas por cada unidad de
energ&iacute;a consumida, relativamente pocos pa&iacute;ses han logrado reducir la
producci&oacute;n de gases de invernadero mediante el paso a los combustibles no
f&oacute;siles. Francia, el Jap&oacute;n, la India, la Rep&uacute;blica de Corea y Suecia han
reducido notablemente sus emisiones de CO<SUB>2</SUB> por unidad de
producci&oacute;n de energ&iacute;a en hasta un 30% a lo largo de los &uacute;ltimos 30
a&ntilde;os. En pa&iacute;ses que no emplean energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica
(como Irlanda, Italia y Dinamarca) las emisiones relacionadas con la energ&iacute;a han
disminuido en menos del 10%.
<A NAME="future"><P>
<B><I>El futuro energ&eacute;tico: lograr un equilibrio</I></B>
<P></A>
La combinaci&oacute;n de crecimiento demogr&aacute;fico, desarrollo econ&oacute;mico e
industrializaci&oacute;n en el mundo entero significa que el consumo mundial de
energ&iacute;a continuar&aacute; aumentando. Estas tendencias, sumadas al mantenimiento
del empleo de combustibles f&oacute;siles para producir energ&iacute;a primaria,
tambi&eacute;n significan que las emisiones de gases de invernadero continuar&aacute;n
aumentando en el mundo entero. Aun con medidas estrictas de reducci&oacute;n, las
proyecciones actuales no muestran una estabilizaci&oacute;n de las emisiones hasta
aproximadamente el a&ntilde;o 2050.
<P>
En este contexto ambiental m&aacute;s amplio, algunos gobiernos y empresas de electricidad
estudian actualmente el empleo de la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica, especialmente en
el mundo en desarrollo. Con su programa ``Decades'', el OIEA trabaja conjuntamente con
muchos de estos pa&iacute;ses para efectuar una planificaci&oacute;n energ&eacute;tica
amplia mediante la evaluaci&oacute;n comparada de las diversas fuentes de energ&iacute;a y
sus efectos respectivos en la salud y el medio ambiente.

<P>
Cuando la opci&oacute;n nuclear se considera viable, el OIEA puede, si as&iacute; se desea,
prestar asistencia a los Estados Miembros para una cuidadosa planificaci&oacute;n de su
aprovechamiento, e incluso prestar ayuda para la creaci&oacute;n de las infraestructuras
industriales y organizativas adecuadas y la capacitaci&oacute;n de personal, y para que se
garanticen la eficacia y la seguridad de la explotaci&oacute;n y el mantenimiento de las
instalaciones nucleoel&eacute;ctricas.
<A NAME="air"><P>
<B><I>Purificaci&oacute;n del aire</I></B>
<P></A>
En muchos pa&iacute;ses industrializados un amplio sector de la opini&oacute;n
p&uacute;blica sigue dudoso u opuesto con respecto a un aumento de la utilizaci&oacute;n de
la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica o incluso con respecto a que su empleo
contin&uacute;e en los niveles actuales. Dicha oposici&oacute;n gira en torno a tres factores:
el temor a los accidentes, el temor a los desechos radiactivos de actividad larga y el temor a
que la utilizaci&oacute;n de la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica contribuya a la
proliferaci&oacute;n de las armas nucleares.
<P>
Ahora bien, la expansi&oacute;n de la energ&iacute;a nucleoel&eacute;ctrica no se ha
traducido en absoluto en una proliferaci&oacute;n de las armas nucleares. Por el contrario, ha
aumentado constantemente el n&uacute;mero de pa&iacute;ses comprometidos con la no
proliferaci&oacute;n.
<P>
Mientras el p&uacute;blico y los medios de informaci&oacute;n siguen reaccionando
vivamente ante cualquier peque&ntilde;a perturbaci&oacute;n en una instalaci&oacute;n
nuclear, en los hechos las centrales nucleares generalmente dan muestras de ser muy fiables y
resistentes. Las centrales nucleares tienen una experiencia operacional acumulada de cerca de
7200 a&ntilde;os-reactor.
<P>
Las ense&ntilde;anzas acumuladas se han utilizado para hacer cambios en la
ingenier&iacute;a
y el dise&ntilde;o operacional a fin de lograr una mayor fiabilidad y seguridad.
<P>
Al igual que cualquier otra fuente de energ&iacute;a, la energ&iacute;a
nucleoel&eacute;ctrica
genera desechos que exigen una gesti&oacute;n y evacuaci&oacute;n apropiadas. Las
tecnolog&iacute;as para la seguridad de la evacuaci&oacute;n de desechos radiactivos
de actividad baja e intermedia son de una eficacia comprobada y se utilizan ampliamente en
los Estados Miembros del OIEA. El almacenamiento a largo plazo de desechos de actividad
alta, como es el caso del combustible gastado, en condiciones seguras es t&eacute;cnicamente
posible pero tropieza con obst&aacute;culos pol&iacute;ticos que los gobiernos deben superar.
<P>
Muchos pa&iacute;ses trabajan actualmente con apremio para seleccionar emplazamientos o
construir y acabar instalaciones para la evacuaci&oacute;n a largo plazo de desechos de
actividad alta. Las instalaciones subterr&aacute;neas profundas de esta &iacute;ndole
tendr&aacute;n que ajustarse a las normas m&aacute;s altas de seguridad ambiental,
geol&oacute;gica y humana. La comunidad nuclear tiene conciencia de sus responsabilidades
e invierte colectivamente m&aacute;s en medidas de seguridad que cualquier otra industria
que se le pueda comparar.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>L</B></FONT>'Agence internationale de l'&eacute;nergie atomique
(AIEA) et ses Etats Membres appuient des centaines de projets de d&eacute;veloppement
faisant appel &agrave; la science et &agrave; la technologie nucl&eacute;aires. Des
sp&eacute;cialistes techniques sont envoy&eacute;s dans des centres et des laboratoires de
recherche comme conseillers ou conf&eacute;renciers, des activit&eacute;s de formation
collective et individuelle sont organis&eacute;es conjointement avec des instituts d'accueil
nationaux et r&eacute;gionaux, et du mat&eacute;riel est fourni pour des travaux de recherche
ou des projets techniques ex&eacute;cut&eacute;s sur place.
<P>
C'est notamment gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cet appui que les moyens,
les qualifications et l'exp&eacute;rience essentiels au d&eacute;veloppement s&ucirc;r
de l'&eacute;nergie et de la science nucl&eacute;aires sont transf&eacute;r&eacute;s
l&agrave; o&ugrave; on en a besoin.
<P>
Utilisant l'AIEA comme cadre de coop&eacute;ration technique, de
nombreux pays tirent parti des avantages de l'&eacute;nergie nucl&eacute;aire pour leur
d&eacute;veloppement. L'Agence fournit une assistance dans de nombreux domaines
o&ugrave; les techniques nucl&eacute;aires s'av&egrave;rent plus int&eacute;ressantes que
d'autres ou peuvent les compl&eacute;ter utilement.
<P>
Certaines activit&eacute;s ont trait &agrave; la production
d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; au moyen de r&eacute;acteurs nucl&eacute;aires. Cependant, le
programme de coop&eacute;ration technique a une port&eacute;e bien plus vaste,
englobant des domaines tels que la sant&eacute;, l'agriculture, l'industrie,
l'hydrologie, la radioprotection, la surveillance de l'environnement et l'&eacute;nergie,
lesquels pr&eacute;sentent tous un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sp&eacute;cial
pour les pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
L'objectif principal du programme de coop&eacute;ration technique
de l'AIEA est d'aider les Etats Membres &agrave; devenir autonomes dans le
domaine de la science et de la technologie nucl&eacute;aires en renfor&ccedil;ant leurs
ressources humaines et leurs institutions.
<P>
L'imp&eacute;ratif majeur de nombreux Etats Membres de l'AIEA est
d'assurer un approvisionnement suffisant en denr&eacute;es alimentaires. Le
d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et social de ces pays impose une gestion
prudente de l'eau et du sol ainsi que le recours aux techniques les plus r&eacute;centes pour
exploiter au mieux les ressources naturelles tout en pr&eacute;servant l'environnement.
<P>
Les techniques nucl&eacute;aires pouvant aider &agrave;
r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ces
imp&eacute;ratifs, le programme de coop&eacute;ration technique
de l'AIEA a pour but de
faire en sorte que les Etats Membres de cette
derni&egrave;re y aient acc&egrave;s. Afin d'am&eacute;liorer la
production
v&eacute;g&eacute;tale
et animale, des techniques faisant appel aux rayonnements et aux
isotopes sont
utilis&eacute;es dans des domaines tels que la fertilit&eacute;
des sols, la s&eacute;lection
des
plantes, la sant&eacute; animale, la lutte contre les insectes et
les ravageurs, l'utilisation de
pesticides et la conservation des denr&eacute;es alimentaires.
<P>
L'Agence m&egrave;ne d'importants travaux conjointement avec
l'Organisation des Nations
Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) dans le cadre de
la Division mixte FAO/AIEA
des techniques nucl&eacute;aires dans l'alimentation et
l'agriculture. Cr&eacute;&eacute;e en
1964, cette Division s'emploie &agrave; r&eacute;soudre des
probl&egrave;mes concrets
li&eacute;s &agrave; la production agricole et &agrave; la
protection alimentaire dans les
pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
<A NAME="note_a"><P>
<B>Fertilit&eacute; des sols, irrigation et production
agricole</B>
<P></A>
Pour accro&icirc;tre la production agricole, on fait largement
appel aux engrais azot&eacute;s.
Nombre d'entre eux sont pr&eacute;judiciables &agrave;
l'environnement et polluent les
r&eacute;serves d'eau s'ils sont utilis&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on
excessive ou &agrave;
mauvais escient. 
Une technique nucl&eacute;aire consistant &agrave; se servir d'un
isotope d'azote stable
comme traceur permet de d&eacute;terminer sous quelle forme,
&agrave; quel endroit et
&agrave; quel moment il vaut mieux appliquer les engrais pour
&eacute;viter le gaspillage et
r&eacute;duire leur transfert dans l'environnement. D'autres
techniques sont utilis&eacute;es
pour d&eacute;tecter, mesurer et suivre dans
le sol et les v&eacute;g&eacute;taux les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs apport&eacute;s par
les engrais, d&eacute;terminer la disponibilit&eacute; de l'eau
du sol et &eacute;tudier le
processus naturel de fixation de l'azote par certains
v&eacute;g&eacute;taux, ce qui permet de
r&eacute;duire consid&eacute;rablement les d&eacute;penses
d'engrais tout en augmentant la
production de prot&eacute;ines v&eacute;g&eacute;tales.
<P>
Pour que la production agricole soit stable &agrave; long terme,
il faut que les sols
re&ccedil;oivent des quantit&eacute;s d'eau suffisantes. Les
travaux effectu&eacute;s dans ce
domaine aident notamment les sp&eacute;cialistes de l'irrigation
&agrave; choisir la meilleure
option pour utiliser les ressources en eau de fa&ccedil;on
optimale. Les r&eacute;sultats de
programmes de recherche coordonn&eacute;e dans le cadre desquels
des
humidim&egrave;tres
&agrave; neutrons sont largement utilis&eacute;s montrent que les
m&eacute;thodes
traditionnelles d'irrigation peuvent &ecirc;tre
am&eacute;lior&eacute;es, la consommation
totale
d'eau pouvant &ecirc;tre r&eacute;duite de 40%. L'eau ainsi
&eacute;conomis&eacute;e peut
&ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;e pour irriguer de nouvelles terres.
Diff&eacute;rentes pratiques
destin&eacute;es &agrave; &eacute;conomiser davantage l'eau dans
les zones de culture non
irrigu&eacute;e ont &eacute;t&eacute; essay&eacute;es et
imm&eacute;diatement mises en
pratique.
<A NAME="note_b"><P>
<B>S&eacute;lection des plantes et
phytog&eacute;n&eacute;tique</B>
<P></A>
Gr&acirc;ce aux techniques nucl&eacute;aires (associ&eacute;es
parfois &agrave; d'autres
biotechnologies), il est possible de mettre au point de nouvelles
souches de plantes
alimentaires importantes. Ces techniques ont permis d'obtenir de
nouvelles
vari&eacute;t&eacute;s de nombreuses esp&egrave;ces
v&eacute;g&eacute;tales
diff&eacute;rentes telles que le riz, le bl&eacute; et le soja.
Ces vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
peuvent pr&eacute;senter une r&eacute;sistance accrue aux
maladies et donner des produits de
qualit&eacute; sup&eacute;rieure ou un meilleur rendement. Dans
le monde entier, plus de
1500 cultivars de mutants de plantes agricoles et de
plantes d'ornement ont &eacute;t&eacute; distribu&eacute;s aux
agriculteurs au cours des 30
derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es. En Chine, par exemple, 8% des
terres agricoles sont
consacr&eacute;es &agrave; la culture de mutants de riz, de
bl&eacute;, de ma&iuml;s et de coton.
<P>
L'Agence aide les Etats Membres &agrave; utiliser de fa&ccedil;on
appropri&eacute;e les
techniques de s&eacute;lection par mutation dans le cadre de
programmes de s&eacute;lection
extr&ecirc;mement diversifi&eacute;s. Des contrats et 
des accords de recherche visent &agrave; promouvoir ces
techniques, en particulier pour
am&eacute;liorer les plantes cultiv&eacute;es pour leurs racines
ou leurs tubercules, les
ol&eacute;agineuses et les c&eacute;r&eacute;ales et
accro&icirc;tre la r&eacute;sistance aux
maladies.
<A NAME="note_c"><P>
<B>Production et sant&eacute; animales</B>
<P></A>
On a recours &agrave; des techniques pr&eacute;cises
fond&eacute;es sur l'emploi de
<L9>traceurs<L0> radioactifs pour &eacute;tudier des
m&eacute;thodes visant &agrave;
am&eacute;liorer la production et la sant&eacute; animales. Ces
techniques sont
utilis&eacute;es dans le cadre d'&eacute;tudes sur la
reproduction des bovins, des buffles, des
ovins et des caprins dans les pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Par
exemple, l'Agence
m&egrave;ne des travaux sur la productivit&eacute; du buffle
domestique en Asie ainsi que
sur les moutons et les ch&egrave;vres en Afrique et en Asie. Des
m&eacute;thodes
semblables servent &agrave; d&eacute;terminer si les animaux sont
infect&eacute;s par des
agents pathog&egrave;nes. Cette approche est aujourd'hui
largement utilis&eacute;e dans les
centres v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de nombreuses r&eacute;gions
du monde afin de
diagnostiquer des maladies d&eacute;bilitantes et de
contr&ocirc;ler les m&eacute;thodes de
lutte contre ces maladies.
<P>
Des programmes de recherche coordonn&eacute;e sont
consacr&eacute;s &agrave; la mise au
point de strat&eacute;gies d'alimentation du b&eacute;tail dans
les r&eacute;gions o&ugrave;
la quantit&eacute; et la qualit&eacute; des aliments varient
beaucoup selon la saison,
&agrave; l'utilisation des techniques nucl&eacute;aires pour
am&eacute;liorer la performance
de reproduction et le diagnostic des maladies du b&eacute;tail
asiatique, &agrave; la
surveillance s&eacute;rologique de la vaccination contre la peste
bovine en Afrique, &agrave;
l'am&eacute;lioration des m&eacute;thodes de diagnostic des
maladies animales en
Am&eacute;rique latine et &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des
m&eacute;thodes permettant de
diagnostiquer et de combattre la trypanosomiase chez les bovins
et les chameaux en Afrique.
<P>
Afin de faciliter l'utilisation de ces techniques sur le terrain,
l'Agence produit dans son
laboratoire de Seibersdorf des trousses normalis&eacute;es
qu'elle distribue dans le monde
entier. Ainsi, par exemple, des trousses appropri&eacute;es sont
envoy&eacute;es 
r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement &agrave; 17 pays d'Afrique dans le
cadre de la Campagne
panafricaine contre la peste bovine afin de permettre aux
v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de
surveiller de pr&egrave;s la progression de leurs programmes de
vaccination. En outre, plus
de 500 000 trousses pour le dosage de la progest&eacute;rone sont
envoy&eacute;es &agrave;
des instituts de recherche sur la production animale afin de les
aider &agrave;
d&eacute;terminer le stade reproductif chez diverses
esp&egrave;ces animales et
d'am&eacute;liorer ainsi les programmes d'&eacute;levage.
<A NAME="note_d"><P>
<B>Lutte contre
<BR>les insectes et les ravageurs</B>
<P></A>
Les rayonnements peuvent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;s pour rendre
des insectes st&eacute;riles.
Lorsque des insectes qui ont &eacute;t&eacute;
&eacute;lev&eacute;s en masse et
st&eacute;rilis&eacute;s en laboratoire sont l&acirc;ch&eacute;s
parmi la population naturelle,
les femelles des m&acirc;les st&eacute;rilis&eacute;s n'ont pas
de descendance. Cette
m&eacute;thode, appel&eacute;e technique de 
l'insecte st&eacute;rile, a &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e
avec succ&egrave;s pour
&eacute;liminer partiellement ou totalement des insectes et des
ravageurs dangereux
responsables de pertes importantes de produits alimentaires et
animaux.
<P>
Cette technique a &eacute;t&eacute; perfectionn&eacute;e dans les
laboratoires de l'AIEA &agrave; Seibersdorf. Des installations permettant
d'&eacute;lever en masse des mouches des fruits et des mouches ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; au
moyen de m&eacute;thodes mises au point dans les laboratoires de l'Agence ont
&eacute;t&eacute; construites dans un certain nombre de pays. Le plus grand succ&egrave;s
obtenu au moyen de la technique de l'insecte st&eacute;rile a consist&eacute; &agrave;
d&eacute;barrasser enti&egrave;rement de la lucilie bouch&egrave;re le sud des Etats-Unis, la
plus grande partie du Mexique ainsi que Porto Rico et Cura&ccedil;ao. Gr&acirc;ce au
succ&egrave;s de cette campagne, les &eacute;leveurs &eacute;conomisent plus de 378
millions de dollars  des Etats-Unis chaque ann&eacute;e rien qu'aux Etats-Unis. Cette
technique sera utilis&eacute;e dans le cadre du programme d'&eacute;radication
de la lucilie bouch&egrave;re en Afrique du Nord qui a &eacute;t&eacute;
lanc&eacute; r&eacute;cemment. Elle a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;galement
utilis&eacute;e dans le cadre de projets qui ont permis d'&eacute;liminer la mouche
m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne des fruits au Mexique ainsi que diverses esp&egrave;ces de
mouches ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; au Nigeria.
<A NAME="note_e"><P>
<B>Produits agrochimiques et r&eacute;sidus</B>
<P></A>
La lib&eacute;ration diff&eacute;r&eacute;e des principes actifs
des pesticides permet de
diminuer les quantit&eacute;s utilis&eacute;es par les
agriculteurs et de r&eacute;duire ainsi
au minimum les dommages &agrave; l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me. Les
techniques de
marquage au moyen d'atomes radioactifs jouent un r&ocirc;le
capital dans la recherche sur les
produits agrochimiques et les r&eacute;sidus. Ces techniques
permettent de suivre les
r&eacute;sidus des pesticides dans l'environnement et facilitent
consid&eacute;rablement les
&eacute;tudes sur la lib&eacute;ration diff&eacute;r&eacute;e des
pesticides. Les efforts
portent sur les &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes riz-poisson et la lutte
contre les mouches
ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; au moyen d'&eacute;crans et de cibles
impr&eacute;gn&eacute;s de
pesticides.
<A NAME="note_f"><P>
<B>Conservation des aliments</B>
<P></A>
Les Etats Membres continuent &agrave; manifester de
l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t pour l'irradiation
des aliments. Cette m&eacute;thode de conservation est de plus en
plus utilis&eacute;e
parall&egrave;lement aux m&eacute;thodes traditionnelles. Il
s'agit d'un moyen physique de
traitement comparable au traitement thermique ou &agrave; la
cong&eacute;lation. Les
denr&eacute;es sont expos&eacute;es &agrave; des doses de
rayonnement
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;es afin de prolonger leur dur&eacute;e de
conservation ou de tuer les
oeufs d'insectes ou les microorganismes qui les contaminent.
Aucune
radioactivit&eacute; n'est induite dans ces denr&eacute;es.
<P>
Les activit&eacute;s de l'Agence dans ce domaine ont surtout
consist&eacute; &agrave;
entreprendre des &eacute;tudes sur l'irradiation comme moyen de
garantir des ressources
vivri&egrave;res s&ucirc;res et suffisantes ainsi que comme
traitement quarantenaire des
v&eacute;g&eacute;taux afin de promouvoir le commerce
international des produits agricoles,
et &agrave; transf&eacute;rer cette technologie sous un
contr&ocirc;le strict. Les
r&eacute;sultats de plusieurs d&eacute;cennies de recherche
montrent de fa&ccedil;on
convaincante que la consommation d'aliments irradi&eacute;s n'a
aucun effet nocif et que
l'irradiation est une technique de conservation s&ucirc;re et
efficace lorsqu'elle est
utilis&eacute;e de
fa&ccedil;on contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e dans des installations
autoris&eacute;es. Au niveau
international, on s'est principalement attach&eacute; &agrave;
&eacute;tudier la
possibilit&eacute; d'une
r&eacute;glementation uniforme sur les aliments irradi&eacute;s
et &agrave; &eacute;laborer
une &eacute;tiquette internationale pour signaler les aliments
irradi&eacute;s.
<P>
A la fin de 1989, 37 pays avaient approuv&eacute; l'irradiation
d'un ou de plusieurs produits
alimentaires destin&eacute;s &agrave; la consommation humaine;
24 d'entre eux utilisent des irradiateurs industriels ou de
d&eacute;monstration pour traiter
plusieurs denr&eacute;es alimentaires destin&eacute;es &agrave;
la vente.
<A NAME="note_g"><P>
<B>M&eacute;decine nucl&eacute;aire</B>
<P></A>
Les techniques nucl&eacute;aires sont utilis&eacute;es de
diff&eacute;rentes fa&ccedil;ons en
m&eacute;decine. L'utilisation des rayons X &agrave; des fins
diagnostiques est bien connue
mais les m&eacute;decins disposent d'un large &eacute;ventail
d'autres techniques. On estime
qu'environ un quart de l'ensemble des patients
hospitalis&eacute;s dans les pays occidentaux
industrialis&eacute;s b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient de la
m&eacute;decine nucl&eacute;aire.
<P>
Les compos&eacute;s chimiques <I>marqu&eacute;s</I> par des
isotopes radioactifs
&agrave; courte p&eacute;riode sont particuli&egrave;rement
utiles pour le diagnostic. On
observe le cheminement de ces compos&eacute;s dans l'organe
&eacute;tudi&eacute; afin
d'&eacute;valuer le fonctionnement de ce dernier. Une autre
cat&eacute;gorie de techniques
diagnostiques consistant &agrave; &eacute;tudier en laboratoire
au moyen de produits
radiochimiques des &eacute;chantillons biologiques
pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s sur les patients
pr&eacute;sente un risque encore inf&eacute;rieur. Ces techniques
sont utilis&eacute;es pour
&eacute;tudier le fonctionnement des organes en mesurant les
niveaux hormonaux et certaines
prot&eacute;ines associ&eacute;es &agrave; des infections
virales, et pour &eacute;valuer les
effets des m&eacute;dicaments.
<P>
Dans le cadre de l'Accord de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale
pour l'Asie et le Pacifique
(RCA) de l'AIEA, un programme ayant pour objet d'encourager la
production et l'utilisation
de r&eacute;actifs en vrac pour le radio-immunodosage a permis de
r&eacute;duire
consid&eacute;rablement le co&ucirc;t des dosages d'hormones
thyro&iuml;diennes. Un programme 
semblable a &eacute;t&eacute; mis sur pied en Am&eacute;rique
latine.

<B>Radiobiologie et radioth&eacute;rapie</B>
<P></A>
Dans de nombreux pays, les m&eacute;decins utilisent des
fournitures m&eacute;dicales
st&eacute;riles telles que des aiguilles et des seringues
hypodermiques qui ne servent qu'une
seule fois. Cela est sans doute le r&eacute;sultat le plus
visible de l'utilisation croissante qui
est faite des effets microbicides des rayonnements pour
st&eacute;riliser des fournitures
m&eacute;dicales pr&eacute;emball&eacute;es. De nombreux autres
produits sont 
&eacute;galement st&eacute;rilis&eacute;s de cette fa&ccedil;on.
Pour am&eacute;liorer le
contr&ocirc;le de la qualit&eacute; de la
st&eacute;rilit&eacute;, des scientifiques collaborant
&agrave; un programme de recherche coordonn&eacute;e de l'AIEA
pour l'Asie et le
Pacifique ont mis au point un ensemble de proc&eacute;dures
techniques. L'Agence a
&eacute;labor&eacute; un code de bonne pratique pour la
radiost&eacute;rilisation des
fournitures m&eacute;dicales &agrave; usage unique.
<P>
Les rayonnements sont &eacute;galement utilis&eacute;s pour le
traitement des cancers. On a
mis au point diff&eacute;rentes techniques qui sont
particuli&egrave;rement
int&eacute;ressantes pour les pays en
d&eacute;veloppement o&ugrave; les moyens hospitaliers sont
souvent limit&eacute;s. Parmi
ces innovations, il convient de citer en particulier une
technique de traitement du cancer du
col 
de l'ut&eacute;rus, maladie qui est r&eacute;pandue dans de
nombreux pays en
d&eacute;veloppement. L'Agence, l'Organisation mondiale de la
sant&eacute; (OMS) et le
Gouvernement italien appuient des travaux men&eacute;s en Egypte
gr&acirc;ce auxquels des
centaines de vies sont sauv&eacute;es chaque ann&eacute;e.
<A NAME="note_i"><P>
<B>Dosim&eacute;trie</B>
<P></A>
Un canc&eacute;reux sur trois b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie des
services de radioth&eacute;rapie.
La dose de rayonnement qu'il re&ccedil;oit doit &ecirc;tre
pr&eacute;cise. La
pr&eacute;cision de la dosim&eacute;trie (la mesure des doses de
rayonnement) est une
pr&eacute;occupation essentielle de l'AIEA. L'Agence et les
&eacute;tablissements
participants des Etats Membres ont cr&eacute;&eacute; un
r&eacute;seau de laboratoires
secondaires d'&eacute;talonnage pour la dosim&eacute;trie (LSED)
afin d'augmenter le
nombre de laboratoires pouvant conserver des
appareils-&eacute;talons de mesure
pr&eacute;cis. Les laboratoires nationaux membres du
r&eacute;seau de LSED peuvent
d&eacute;terminer la pr&eacute;cision de leurs propres appareils
et v&eacute;rifier ceux qui
sont utilis&eacute;s sur le terrain. Le laboratoire de
dosim&eacute;trie de l'AIEA &agrave;
Seibersdorf fournit &agrave; leur demande des services
d'&eacute;talonnage aux pays qui
n'ont pas de LSED.
<P>
L'Agence et l'OMS assurent un service postal de comparaison de
doses pour aider les
utilisateurs de mat&eacute;riel de radioth&eacute;rapie. Les
h&ocirc;pitaux ayant recours
&agrave; ce service re&ccedil;oivent des dosim&egrave;tres dont
la pr&eacute;cision est
connue et qu'il leur est demand&eacute; d'exposer &agrave; une
dose de rayonnement
donn&eacute;e sur la base de ce que leurs appareils indiquent.
Les dosim&egrave;tres sont
renvoy&eacute;s &agrave; Vienne pour &ecirc;tre
v&eacute;rifi&eacute;s et les
r&eacute;sultats sont communiqu&eacute;s aux h&ocirc;pitaux afin
qu'ils puissent
contr&ocirc;ler leurs appareils. Quelque 340 h&ocirc;pitaux
utilisent ce service, de
fa&ccedil;on r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute;e pour la plupart
d'entre eux.
<A NAME="note_j"><P>
<B>Alimentation et sant&eacute;</B>
<P></A>
Les techniques nucl&eacute;aires sont tr&egrave;s largement
utilis&eacute;es pour
&eacute;tudier les besoins de l'organisme en
oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments et leur
assimilation
par ce dernier ainsi que pour d&eacute;terminer comment la
pollution nous atteint. Le
r&ocirc;le de l'Agence dans ce domaine consiste surtout &agrave;
coordonner les travaux sur
le terrain et &agrave; fournir des conseils et des services de
formation. L'Agence appuie &eacute;galement les travaux des Etats
Membres en fournissant
des mati&egrave;res de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence certifi&eacute;es
qui permettent aux
personnes se consacrant &agrave; l'&eacute;tude de la nutrition
humaine et de la pollution de
v&eacute;rifier leurs mesures. Elle ex&eacute;cute des programmes
dans le cadre desquels les
techniques nucl&eacute;aires sont utilis&eacute;es pour analyser
les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
toxiques dans les denr&eacute;es alimentaires et &eacute;tudier
la pollution due aux
d&eacute;chets solides.
<A NAME="note_k"><P>
<B>Appui aux r&eacute;acteurs de recherche</B>
<P></A>
Alors qu'il n'est fait appel &agrave; l'&eacute;nergie
nucl&eacute;aire pour produire de
l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; que dans certains pays seulement,
nombreux sont ceux qui utilisent
des r&eacute;acteurs de recherche pour des activit&eacute;s de
formation, de recherche pure
et d'analyse et pour produire des radio-isotopes destin&eacute;s
&agrave; des applications
industrielles, agricoles et m&eacute;dicales.
<P>
A l'heure actuelle, 325 r&eacute;acteurs de recherche sont en
service dans 54 Etats Membres,
dont 71 dans 34 pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Le programme de
l'Agence a pour objet de
convertir certains r&eacute;acteurs de recherche afin qu'ils
utilisent des combustibles
&agrave;
l'uranium faiblement enrichi au lieu de combustibles &agrave;
l'uranium fortement enrichi qui
ne sont disponibles qu'en quantit&eacute;s
limit&eacute;es. L'Agence s'efforce &eacute;galement d'optimiser
l'exploitation de ces
r&eacute;acteurs de mani&egrave;re &agrave; r&eacute;pondre
&agrave; des besoins
multiples dans le domaine de la recherche et des applications.
<A NAME="note_l"><P>
<B>Applications industrielles</B>
<P></A>
De nombreuses applications industrielles int&eacute;ressantes des
rayonnements et des
radio-isotopes sont d&eacute;sormais bien implant&eacute;es dans
les pays
industrialis&eacute;s. Les principaux domaines d'application 
sont notamment la radiographie, les essais non destructifs,
l'ing&eacute;nierie et la
technologie
des rayonnements, les syst&egrave;mes de contr&ocirc;le et les
traceurs radioactifs, les
techniques d'analyse et de contr&ocirc;le de la qualit&eacute;,
la diagraphie des sondages et
la
caract&eacute;risation des roches ainsi que la fabrication de
produits pharmaceutiques
radiomarqu&eacute;s, y compris les techniques et
proc&eacute;dures de
contr&ocirc;le de la qualit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaires pour
garantir leur utilisation
s&ucirc;re.
<P>
Par exemple, les utilisations des traceurs radioactifs dans les
secteurs de la chimie, de
l'extraction et du raffinage du p&eacute;trole, de la
sid&eacute;rurgie, du ciment, de l'automobile et des
constructions navales pr&eacute;sentent
des avantages &eacute;conomiques consid&eacute;rables et
fournissent des solutions &agrave;
des probl&egrave;mes qui ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solus
autrement.
<A NAME="note_m"><P>
<B>Mise en valeur des ressources
<BR>
hydrologiques et min&eacute;rales</B>
<P></A>
Les techniques mettant en <P7>uvre des isotopes de
l'environnement sont au nombre de celles
que les m&eacute;t&eacute;orologues, les hydrologues et les
hydrog&eacute;ologues utilisent
pour &eacute;tudier l'eau. L'&eacute;tude des isotopes de
l'oxyg&egrave;ne et de
l'hydrog&egrave;ne dans l'eau et d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments
contenus dans les sels dissous
ayant le m&ecirc;me comportement que l'eau permet d'enregistrer
avec pr&eacute;cision les
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes qui influent sur la pr&eacute;sence et
le mouvement de l'eau sous
toutes ses formes (solide, gazeuse ou liquide).
<P>
Dans le bassin de l'Amazonie, par exemple, ces techniques jouent
un r&ocirc;le essentiel dans
l'&eacute;tude des cons&eacute;quences environnementales du
d&eacute;frichement des
for&ecirc;ts tropicales humides. Certains isotopes stables
permettent de recueillir des
donn&eacute;es sur les mouvements de la vapeur d'eau, le
d&eacute;bit des cours d'eau, la
s&eacute;dimentation, la qualit&eacute; de l'eau, la protection
des v&eacute;g&eacute;taux et
les modifications du sol. A terme, ces &eacute;tudes devraient
avoir un impact d&eacute;cisif
sur la gestion &eacute;cologique de cette r&eacute;gion.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>E</B></FONT>l Organismo Internacional de Energ&iacute;a
At&oacute;mica (OIEA) y sus Estados Miembros prestan apoyo a cientos de proyectos de
desarrollo relacionados con la ciencia y la tecnolog&iacute;a nucleares. Como parte de estas
actividades, se env&iacute;an expertos t&eacute;cnicos como asesores o conferenciantes a
diversos centros de investigaci&oacute;n y laboratorios; en conjunto con institutos
hu&eacute;spedes de car&aacute;cter nacional y regional se imparte capacitaci&oacute;n
individual y de grupo; y se suministra equipo para proyectos t&eacute;cnicos y de
investigaci&oacute;n sobre el terreno.
<P>
A  trav&eacute;s de &eacute;stas y otras v&iacute;as transitan herramientas, conocimientos
especializados y experiencias que son vitales para un desarrollo seguro de la energ&iacute;a y
de la ciencia nucleares all&iacute; donde se las necesita.
<P>
Recurriendo al OIEA como base de cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica, muchos
pa&iacute;ses cosechan actualmente los frutos de la energ&iacute;a nuclear para su desarrollo.
El Organismo presta asistencia en muchos campos en que las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares
presentan ventajas o pueden desempe&ntilde;ar un papel complementario con respecto a otras
t&eacute;cnicas.
<P>
Algunas actividades se relacionan con la generaci&oacute;n de electricidad por medio de
reactores nucleares. Sin embargo, el &aacute;mbito del programa de cooperaci&oacute;n
t&eacute;cnica es mucho m&aacute;s amplio, abarcando campos como salud, agricultura,
industria, hidrolog&iacute;a, protecci&oacute;n radiol&oacute;gica, vigilancia ambiental y
energ&iacute;a, esferas todas de especial inter&eacute;s para los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo.
<P>
El objetivo primordial de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica del OIEA es prestar asistencia
a los Estados Miembros para alcanzar la autosuficiencia en los campos de la ciencia y la
tecnolog&iacute;a nucleares en virtud del perfeccionamiento de sus recursos humanos y de
sus instituciones.
<P>
El mayor desaf&iacute;o a que hacen frente muchos de los Estados Miembros del OIEA
consiste en c&oacute;mo lograr un abastecimiento suficiente de alimentos. Una cuidadosa
econom&iacute;a de agua y suelos, junto con el empleo de las t&eacute;cnicas m&aacute;s
modernas para obtener un m&aacute;ximo rendimiento de los recursos naturales manteniendo
un medio ambiente sano, resulta fundamental para el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico y social de
esos Estados.
<P>
Las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares se utilizan para ayudar a hacer frente a esos desaf&iacute;os,
por lo que el programa de cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica del OIEA tiene por objeto
conseguir que esas t&eacute;cnicas est&eacute;n a disposici&oacute;n de sus Estados
Miembros. Las t&eacute;cnicas que emplean radiaciones e is&oacute;topos se utilizan para
mejorar los cultivos y la producci&oacute;n animal en campos como fertilidad de suelos,
fitotecnia, sanidad animal, lucha contra insectos y plagas, empleo de plaguicidas y
conservaci&oacute;n de alimentos.
<P>
El Organismo, conjuntamente con la Organizaci&oacute;n de las Naciones Unidas para la
Agricultura y la Alimentaci&oacute;n (FAO), realiza una gran labor por intermedio de la
Divisi&oacute;n Mixta FAO/OIEA de T&eacute;cnicas Nucleares en la Agricultura y la
Alimentaci&oacute;n. Fundada en 1964, la Divisi&oacute;n se esfuerza en resolver los
problemas pr&aacute;cticos relativos a la producci&oacute;n agr&iacute;cola y a la
protecci&oacute;n de los alimentos en el mundo en desarrollo.
<A NAME="note_a"><P>
<B>Fertilidad de suelos, riego y cultivos agr&iacute;colas</B>
<P></A>
Los fertilizantes nitrogenados se utilizan ampliamente para aumentar la producci&oacute;n
agr&iacute;cola. Muchos fertilizantes ponen en peligro el medio ambiente y, utilizados en
exceso o 
inadecuadamente, originan la contaminaci&oacute;n del agua. Una t&eacute;cnica nuclear que
emplea un is&oacute;topo de nitr&oacute;geno estable como trazador contribuye a determinar
la mejor forma, oportunidad y ubicaci&oacute;n de los fertilizantes para evitar los desechos y
reducir su desplazamiento en el medio ambiente. Otras t&eacute;cnicas se emplean para
detectar, medir y rastrear en la tierra y las plantas los nutrientes proporcionados por los
fertilizantes, determinar la humedad de los suelos y estudiar el proceso natural de
fijaci&oacute;n del nitr&oacute;geno por ciertas plantas, lo que reduce considerablemente los
gastos en materia de fertilizantes y permite aumentar las prote&iacute;nas de las plantas.
<P>
La producci&oacute;n agr&iacute;cola sostenible requiere una cantidad suficiente de agua en
los suelos. La labor que se realiza en esta esfera ayuda a los especialistas en riego y a otros
expertos a elegir la opci&oacute;n m&aacute;s adecuada para aumentar o mejorar la forma en
que se emplean los recursos h&iacute;dricos. Los resultados de los programas coordinados de
investigaci&oacute;n en que se utilizan ampliamente las sondas neutr&oacute;nicas de
humedad indican que los m&eacute;todos tradicionales de riego pueden perfeccionarse para
reducir en un 40% el agua total empleada. De este modo el agua puede desviarse para regar
otras superficies. Se han ensayado diversos procedimientos para mejorar la
conservaci&oacute;n del agua en zonas de secano, lo que ha permitido la aplicaci&oacute;n
pr&aacute;ctica e inmediata de esos procedimientos.
<A NAME="note_b"><P>
<B>Fitotecnia y gen&eacute;tica</B>
<P></A>
Las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares  -- a veces en combinaci&oacute;n con otras
biotecnolog&iacute;as --  pueden emplearse para desarrollar nuevas variedades de cultivos
alimenticios importantes. Esas t&eacute;cnicas han originado nuevas variedades de muchas
especies como arroz, trigo y soja. Tales variedades pueden ser m&aacute;s resistentes a las
enfermedades, proporcionar productos de mejor calidad y tener un rendimiento mayor. En el
mundo entero, m&aacute;s de 1500 cultivares de mutantes de cultivos agr&iacute;colas y
plantas ornamentales se han entregado a los agricultores en los &uacute;ltimos 30
a&ntilde;os.
Por ejemplo, el 8% de la tierra agr&iacute;cola de China est&aacute; plantado con mutantes
de arroz, trigo, ma&iacute;z y algod&oacute;n.
<P>
El Organismo presta asistencia a los Estados Miembros para la adecuada aplicaci&oacute;n de
las t&eacute;cnicas de fitotecnia por mutaciones en programas de fitotecnia muy diversos. Los
contratos y acuerdos de investigaci&oacute;n est&aacute;n dedicados fundalmentalmente al
progreso de la tecnolog&iacute;a de la fitotecnia por mutaciones, especialmente para mejorar
los cultivos de ra&iacute;ces y tub&eacute;rculos, semillas oleaginosas y cereales, y al
objetivo de aumentar la resistencia de esos cultivos a las enfermedades.
<A NAME="note_c"><P>
<B>Producci&oacute;n y sanidad pecuarias</B>
<P></A>
A fin de estudiar m&eacute;todos para aumentar la producci&oacute;n animal y mejorar el
estado sanitario de los animales se utilizan t&eacute;cnicas sensibles basadas en el empleo de
``trazadores'' radiactivos. Esas t&eacute;cnicas se aplican en estudios de la
reproducci&oacute;n del ganado vacuno, ovejuno y caprino y de los b&uacute;falos en los
pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. Por ejemplo, el Organismo realiza trabajos sobre la productividad
del b&uacute;falo dom&eacute;stico en Asia y sobre las ovejas y cabras en Africa y Asia.
M&eacute;todos similares se emplean para determinar si los animales se encuentran
infectados
con agentes causantes de enfermedades, un enfoque que actualmente se utiliza ampliamente
en
los centros veterinarios de muchas partes del mundo para diagnosticar enfermedades
debilitantes y controlar los m&eacute;todos de lucha contra esas enfermedades.
<P>
Existen programas coordinados de investigaci&oacute;n en marcha sobre las siguientes
materias: desarrollo de estrategias de alimentaci&oacute;n para el ganado en zonas en que se
registran grandes fluctuaciones estacionales del abastecimiento y la calidad de los piensos;
empleo de t&eacute;cnicas nucleares para aumentar la eficiencia reproductiva y diagnosticar
enfermedades en el ganado de Asia; control serol&oacute;gico de la vacunaci&oacute;n contra
la peste bovina en Africa; mejoramiento de los m&eacute;todos de diagn&oacute;stico de las
enfermedades que afectan a los animales en Am&eacute;rica Latina; y mejoramiento de los
m&eacute;todos de diagn&oacute;stico de la tripanosomiasis en vacunos y camellos en Africa
y de los m&eacute;todos de lucha contra esa enfermedad.
<P>
Para que esas t&eacute;cnicas puedan utilizarse m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente sobre el
terreno, el Organismo produce juegos (kits) normalizados en su laboratorio de Seibersdorf y
los distribuye en todo el mundo. Por ejemplo, en el marco de la campa&ntilde;a panafricana
contra la peste bovina, los juegos correspondientes se env&iacute;an regularmente a 17
pa&iacute;ses africanos de manera que los veterinarios puedan controlar con exactitud el
progreso de sus programas de vacunaci&oacute;n. Por otra parte, m&aacute;s de 500 000
unidades de an&aacute;lisis para determinaci&oacute;n de progesterona se env&iacute;an a
los
institutos de investigaci&oacute;n de la producci&oacute;n animal para ayudarlos a evaluar la
situaci&oacute;n reproductiva de las especies de ganado y, en consecuencia, mejorar los
programas de cr&iacute;a.
<A NAME="note_d"><P>
<B>Lucha contra insectos y plagas</B>
<P></A>
Las radiaciones pueden usarse para esterilizar sexualmente a los insectos. Cuando los insectos
se cr&iacute;an en masa y se esterilizan en laboratorios, procedi&eacute;ndose luego a
liberarlos entre la poblaci&oacute;n silvestre, las hembras que se acoplen con machos
esterilizados no tendr&aacute;n descendencia. Este m&eacute;todo, llamado t&eacute;cnica de
los insectos est&eacute;riles (TIE), se ha empleado exitosamente para controlar o erradicar
plagas de insectos peligrosos que causan p&eacute;rdidas sustanciales de productos
alimenticios y de origen animal.
<P>
La t&eacute;cnica se ha seguido desarrollando en los laboratorios de Seibersdorf del OIEA.
En varios pa&iacute;ses se han construido instalaciones para la cr&iacute;a en masa de
moscas de la fruta y 
moscas ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; seg&uacute;n los m&eacute;todos desarrollados en esos
laboratorios. La campa&ntilde;a m&aacute;s exitosa de la TIE erradic&oacute; el gusano
barrenador del ganado del Nuevo Mundo en el sur de los Estados Unidos, en la mayor parte
del territorio de M&eacute;xico y en las islas de Puerto Rico y Curazao. Esa
erradicaci&oacute;n exitosa permite a los ganaderos, si se cuenta solo a los de los Estados
Unidos, un ahorro anual de 378 millones de d&oacute;lares de ese pa&iacute;s. La TIE
constituir&aacute; el componente de erradicaci&oacute;n del programa recientemente iniciado
para la erradicaci&oacute;n del gusano barrenador del Nuevo Mundo en Africa septentrional.
Esa t&eacute;cnica tambi&eacute;n se ha usado en proyectos para erradicar exitosamente la
mosca mediterr&aacute;nea de la fruta en M&eacute;xico y contra varias plagas de moscas
ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; en Nigeria.
<A NAME="note_e"><P>
<B>Productos agroqu&iacute;micos y residuos</B>
</A>
<P>
Una liberaci&oacute;n controlada y oportuna de los compuestos plaguicidas activos puede
permitir una reducci&oacute;n de las cantidades que usan los agricultores y minimizar de este
modo el da&ntilde;o al ecosistema. Las t&eacute;cnicas de marcado con empleo de
&aacute;tomos radiactivos constituyen una esfera decisiva de las investigaciones en materia
de
productos agroqu&iacute;micos y residuos. Esas t&eacute;cnicas permiten rastrear los
residuos
de plaguicidas en el medio ambiente y facilitan grandemente las investigaciones sobre la
liberaci&oacute;n controlada de plaguicidas. Esos estudios versan sobre los ecosistemas
arroz-pescado y la lucha contra la mosca ts&eacute;-ts&eacute; mediante la instalaci&oacute;n
de pantallas y blancos tratados con plaguicidas.
<A NAME="note_f"><P>
<B>Conservaci&oacute;n de alimentos</B>
<P></A>
Los Estados Miembros siguen mostrando inter&eacute;s  en la irradiaci&oacute;n de
alimentos, un m&eacute;todo de conservaci&oacute;n que se emplea cada vez m&aacute;s
junto con los m&eacute;todos tradicionales. Este m&eacute;todo es un medio f&iacute;sico de
tratamiento de los alimentos comparable al calentamiento o la congelaci&oacute;n. Los
productos alimenticios se exponen a cantidades controladas de radiaciones para retardar la
pudrici&oacute;n o matar los huevos de los insectos o microorganismos que los contaminan.
En los art&iacute;culos alimenticios no se induce radiactividad.
<P>
Las actividades del Organismo se han dedicado a investigar la aplicaci&oacute;n de la
irradiaci&oacute;n de alimentos como medio para garantizar el abastecimiento seguro y
suficiente de alimentos, y tambi&eacute;n para el tratamiento de cuarentena de plantas a fin
de promover el comercio internacional de productos agr&iacute;colas y transferir la
tecnolog&iacute;a bajo estricto control. Varias d&eacute;cadas de investigaci&oacute;n han
mostrado categ&oacute;ricamente que el consumo de alimentos irradiados no tiene
ning&uacute;n efecto nocivo y que la irradiaci&oacute;n de alimentos es una t&eacute;cnica
segura y eficaz de conservaci&oacute;n cuando se la emplea controladamente en instalaciones
autorizadas. Los esfuerzos internacionales se han centrado en la posibilidad de uniformar la
reglamentaci&oacute;n de los alimentos irradiados y establecer un r&oacute;tulo internacional
para identificar estos alimentos.
<P>
Al t&eacute;rmino de 1989, se hab&iacute;an aprobado para el consumo humano uno o
m&aacute;s productos irradiados en 37 pa&iacute;ses; 24 de estos pa&iacute;ses utilizan
irradiadores comerciales o de demostraci&oacute;n para tratar diversos productos alimenticios
con fines comerciales.
<A NAME="note_g"><P>
<B>Medicina nuclear</B>
<P></A>
Las t&eacute;nicas nucleares se emplean de m&uacute;ltiples maneras en el campo
m&eacute;dico. El uso de rayos X como medio de diagn&oacute;stico es suficientemente
conocido, pero los m&eacute;dicos disponen adem&aacute;s de otras muchas t&eacute;cnicas.
Se ha calculado que alrededor de una cuarta parte de los pacientes de los hospitales del
mundo recibe los beneficios de la medicina nuclear.
<P>

Los compuestos qu&iacute;micos ``marcados'' con is&oacute;topos radiactivos de actividad
baja son 
especialmente &uacute;tiles para fines de diagn&oacute;stico. Los compuestos son
``observados'' durante su desplazamiento en el &oacute;rgano estudiado para evaluar el
funcionamiento de &eacute;ste. Otras t&eacute;cnicas de diagn&oacute;stico, en que las
muestras biol&oacute;gicas tomadas del paciente se estudian con empleo de productos
radioqu&iacute;micos en el laboratorio, reducen a&uacute;n m&aacute;s los riesgos. Estas
t&eacute;cnicas se utilizan para estudiar el funcionamiento de los &oacute;rganos midiendo
las hormonas, y ciertas prote&iacute;nas relacionadas con las infecciones virales, y para
evaluar los efectos de los tratamientos con medicamentos.
<P>
En el marco del Acuerdo de Cooperaci&oacute;n Regional para Asia y el Pac&iacute;fico
(ACR) del OIEA, un programa para promover la producci&oacute;n y utilizaci&oacute;n de
reactivos a granel con fines de radio-inmunoan&aacute;lisis ha reducido significativamente el
costo de los an&aacute;lisis de hormonas relacionadas con el tiroides. En Am&eacute;rica
Latina se ha iniciado un programa similar.

En muchos pa&iacute;ses, los m&eacute;dicos emplean art&iacute;culos esterilizados, como
jeringas y agujas hipod&eacute;rmicas, que se desechan despu&eacute;s de un solo uso
cl&iacute;nico. Aqu&iacute; reside tal vez el resultado m&aacute;s visible de la creciente
utilizaci&oacute;n de los efectos microbicidas de las radiaciones en la esterilizaci&oacute;n de
art&iacute;culos m&eacute;dicos previamente empaquetados. Otros muy variados materiales
se esterilizan tambi&eacute;n de esta forma. Para mejorar el control de calidad de la
esterilidad, los cient&iacute;ficos que colaboran en un programa coordinado de
investigaci&oacute;n del OIEA en la regi&oacute;n de Asia y el Pac&iacute;fico han
desarrollado una serie de procedimientos t&eacute;cnicos. El Organismo ha elaborado un
c&oacute;digo de pr&aacute;ctica para la radioesterilizaci&oacute;n de art&iacute;culos
m&eacute;dicos desechables.
<P>
Las radiaciones tambi&eacute;n se emplean para el tratamiento del c&aacute;ncer. Se han
desarrollado diversas t&eacute;cnicas que se utilizan especialmente en los pa&iacute;ses en
desarrollo, donde los recursos hospitalarios suelen ser limitados. Una t&eacute;cnica
particularmente exitosa se relaciona con el tratamiento del c&aacute;ncer del cuello del
&uacute;tero, enfermedad muy extendida en muchos pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. El
Organismo y la Organizaci&oacute;n Mundial de la Salud (OMS), conjuntamente con el
Gobierno de Italia, prestan apoyo a las labores que a este respecto se realizan en Egipto y que
permiten salvar cientos de vida cada a&ntilde;o.
<A NAME="note_i"><P>
<B>Dosimetr&iacute;a de radiaciones</B>
<P></A>
Uno de cada tres pacientes de c&aacute;ncer recibe tratamiento radiol&oacute;gico. La dosis
de radiaciones que recibe cada paciente debe ser precisa. La exactitud de la dosimetr&iacute;a

-- medici&oacute;n de las dosis de radiaciones --  constituye una preocupaci&oacute;n del
OIEA. El Organismo y los institutos participantes de los Estados Miembros han creado una
red de laboratorios secundarios de calibraci&oacute;n dosim&eacute;trica (LSCD) a fin de
ampliar el n&uacute;mero de laboratorios que pueden encargarse del mantenimiento de
instrumentos para la realizaci&oacute;n de mediciones normalizadas exactas. Los laboratorios
nacionales que participan en la red de LSCD pueden determinar la exactitud de sus propios
instrumentos y controlar los instrumentos que se usan sobre el terreno. A los pa&iacute;ses
que no cuentan con un LSCD en funcionamiento, el Laboratorio de Dosimetr&iacute;a del
OIEA, de Seibersdorf, les ofrece servicios de calibraci&oacute;n seg&uacute;n lo soliciten.
<P>
A fin de ayudar a los usuarios de equipo de radioterapia, el Organismo y la OMS tienen en
funcionamiento un ``servicio postal de intercomparaci&oacute;n de dosis''. Los hospitales que
emplean este servicio reciben dos&iacute;metros de exactitud conocida con la solicitud de que
los expongan a una dosis determinada con arreglo a lo que indican sus instrumentos. Los
dos&iacute;metros se devuelven a Viena para control, y a los hospitales se les comunican los
resultados de manera que puedan controlar sus instrumentos. Unos 340 hospitales utilizan este
servicio, la mayor&iacute;a de ellos en forma reiterada.
<A NAME="note_j"><P>
<B>Nutrici&oacute;n y salud</B>
<P></A>
Las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares se emplean ampliamente para estudiar las necesidades del
cuerpo y el aprovechamiento que &eacute;ste hace de los oligoelementos; tambi&eacute;n se
estudian las formas en que nos afecta la contaminaci&oacute;n ambiental. La labor que el
Organismo
desarrolla en este campo consiste fundamentalmente en coordinar los trabajos sobre el terreno
y en prestar asesoramiento e impartir capacitaci&oacute;n. El Organismo tambi&eacute;n
apoya los trabajos que se realizan en los Estados Miembros proporcion&aacute;ndoles
 materiales de referencia certificados con los cuales los especialistas que estudian la
nutrici&oacute;n humana y la contaminaci&oacute;n ambiental pueden cotejar sus mediciones.
Se ejecutan programas en esferas en que las t&eacute;cnicas nucleares se emplean para
analizar los elementos t&oacute;xicos que pueden estar presentes en los productos
alimenticios
y para estudiar la contaminaci&oacute;n medioambiental relacionada con los desechos
s&oacute;lidos.
<A NAME="note_k"><P>
<B>Apoyo para reactores de investigaci&oacute;n</B>
<P></A>
Solo en algunos pa&iacute;ses la energ&iacute;a nuclear se emplea para generar electricidad;
en muchos otros los reactores de investigaci&oacute;n se utilizan como instrumento de
capacitaci&oacute;n, en la investigaci&oacute;n pura, para contribuir a las t&eacute;cnicas de
an&aacute;lisis y en la producci&oacute;n de los radis&oacute;topos que se utilizan en la
industria, agricultura y medicina.
<P>
Existen actualmente 325 reactores de investigaci&oacute;n en explotaciones en 54 Estados
Miembros, incluidos 71 reactores en 34 pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo. El programa del
Organismo tiene por objeto la conversi&oacute;n de algunos reactores de
investigaci&oacute;n
del actual empleo de combustible de uranio muy enriquecido, que existen en cantidad
limitada, a los combustibles poco enriquecidos. Tambi&eacute;n se propone ampliar el
aprovechamiento de esos reactores a m&uacute;ltiples finalidades en los campos de la
investigaci&oacute;n y las aplicaciones pr&aacute;cticas.
<A NAME="note_l"><P>
<B>Aplicaciones industriales</B>
<P></A>
En la industria de los pa&iacute;ses adelantados se hallan bien implantadas muchas
aplicaciones &uacute;tiles de las radiaciones y los radis&oacute;topos. Los campos principales
de aplicaci&oacute;n incluyen las actividades relativas a radiograf&iacute;a, ensayo no
destructivo, ingenier&iacute;a y tecnolog&iacute;a radiol&oacute;gicas, sistemas de control y
trazadores radiactivos, t&eacute;cnicas anal&iacute;ticas y control de calidad, perforaciones de
sondeo y determinaci&oacute;n de las caracter&iacute;sticas de las rocas, y
producci&oacute;n de art&iacute;culos farmac&eacute;uticos marcados con radiaciones,
incluidos los procedimientos y t&eacute;cnicas de control de calidad necesarios para su
utilizaci&oacute;n segura.
<P>
Por ejemplo, las aplicaciones de trazadores radiactivos en las industrias qu&iacute;mica, de
producci&oacute;n y refinaci&oacute;n del petr&oacute;leo, sider&uacute;rgica, del cemento,
autom&oacute;vil y mar&iacute;tima han arrojado beneficios econ&oacute;micos
considerables y han permitido solucionar problemas que no pod&iacute;an resolverse con
otras t&eacute;cnicas.
<A NAME="note_m"><P>
<B>Desarrollo de recursos h&iacute;dricos
<BR>
y minerales</B>
<P></A>
Las t&eacute;cnicas que emplean is&oacute;topos ``ambientales'' son utilizadas conjuntamente
con otras t&eacute;cnicas por los meteor&oacute;logos, hidr&oacute;logos e
hidroge&oacute;logos para estudiar el agua. El estudio de los is&oacute;topos de
ox&iacute;geno e hidr&oacute;geno presentes en el agua y de los elementos contenidos en
ciertas sales disueltas que tienen el mismo comportamiento que el agua, permite registrar con
exactitud los fen&oacute;menos que influyen en la existencia y movimiento del agua en todas
sus formas (hielo, gas o l&iacute;quido).
<P>
En la cuenca del Amazonas, por ejemplo, tales t&eacute;cnicas desempe&ntilde;an un papel
decisivo en la investigaci&oacute;n de las consecuencias medioambientales de la tala de las
selvas tropicales h&uacute;medas. Los is&oacute;topos estables suministran actualmente datos
en materia de movimientos del vapor, flujo de corrientes, sedimentaci&oacute;n, calidad del
agua, protecci&oacute;n de plantas y cambios del suelo. A la postre esos estudios han de
arrojar resultados decisivos para la gesti&oacute;n ecol&oacute;gica de la regi&oacute;n.

<H2>IAEA Laboratories at Seibersdorf</H2>
<hr>  
<P>
Established in 1962, the Agency's Seibersdorf Laboratories help implement the IAEA 's programmes in food and agriculture,
human health, environmental and earth sciences, radiation protection, and safeguards. They provide scientific services
including quality control and chemical and radiochemical analyses and conduct research and development related to
the IAEA's coordinated research programmes and technical cooperation activities. The Laboratories also train scientists
from developing countries with emphasis on transferring nuclear and related techniques necessary to carry out Agency projects
<P>
Activities at the Laboratories emphasize quality assurance procedures meant to instill confidence in the use of transferred technologies as well as 
to provide reliance on data generated by national and regional laboratories. Efforts are made to focus on techniques which contribute to environmental
monitoring and protection and lead to sustainable development practices. The Agency's laboratories cooperate and collaborate with
laboratories in developing countries which have been identified as focal points for the creation or strengthening
of national or regional infrastructures in nuclear energy fields. At its headquarters in Vienna, the IAEA also operates
an Isotope Hydrology Laboratory in support of its programs in areas of water resource management and development.
<br>
The IAEA Laboratories in Seibersdorf include the:
<P>
<H3>Agriculture Laboratory</H3>
<P>
The Agriculture Laboratory, operated jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations,
 provides technical and scientific support to joint programmes of the IAEA and FAO in soil fertility, 
irrigation and crop production, plant mutation breeding, animal production and disease diagnosis, insect and pest control and 
agrochemicals and residues. It places particular emphasis on developing appropriate nuclear and related
techniques that could be trasnferred to developing countries. The laboratory includes five branches:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Soil Science Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Plant Breeding Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Entomology Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Agrochemicals Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Animal Production Unit
</DL>
<H3>Physics, Chemistry, Instrumentation Laboratory</H3>
The Physics, Chemistry, Instrumentation (PCI) Laboratory provides technical and experimental support to IAEA 
programmes in physical and chemical sciences, industry and earth sciences and human helath. It also performs specialized tasks for the 
Departmnet of Nuclear Energy in the field of radiation safety and protection, for example, measuring radionuclides in food
and the environment. The PCI Laboratory also helps the Department of Safeguards in special analyses and mechanical and equipment construction.
The PCI laboratory has four branches:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Chemistry Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Instrumentation Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Dosimetry Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Isotope Hydrology Unit
</DL>
<H3>Safeguards Analytical Laboratory</H3>
The Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) analyzes samples taken from key measurement points of the fuel cycle
to meet the requirements of safeguards accounting verification. To accommodate the large number of samples to 
be analyzed, SAL works with a network of analytical laboratories that comply with IAEA quality assurance and are nominated
by Member States. In cooperation with the training section of the Department of Safeguards, SAL also conducts a
training programme for safeguards inspectors to demonstrate the requirements for acquiring and handling samples and for making on-site destructive analyses.
SAL is comprised of the:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Chemical Analysis Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Isotopic Analysis Unit
</DL>
<H3>Clean Laboratory</H3>
Construction has started on a Clean Laboratory in Seibersdorf which will serve as the focal point for environmental
monitoring for safeguards purposes. It will receive, analyze  and distribute to the network of analytical laboratories 
special samples taken during ad hoc safeguards inspections to confirm the absence of undeclared nuclear 
activities.

<H2>IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory</H2></a>
<hr>
<P>
The IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) in Monaco is the only marine laboratory within the United Nations
system. Besides carrying out IAEA core programmes, IAEA-MEL also responds to requests for technical and experimental assistance from
other UN agencies. The application of nuclear and isotopic techniques and the improved understanding of marine radioactivity continue to be central to the Laboratory's
work. The Laboratory has been engaged in studies assessing the impact of radioactive waste dumping in the 
Arctic Seas, marine effects from the Gulf war, the carbon cycle and greenhouse effect, Chernobyl radioactivity in the oceans, and pesticide run-off and toxicity to
coastal fisheries.<P>
<H3>Technical Co-operation</H3>
In co-operation with the IAEA Department of Research and Isotopes, IAEA-MEL organizes training courses on 
topics such as marine radioecology, marine pollutant monitoring.
The general aim is to increase the capacity of the international community to monitor and control pollution of the 
marine environment via a mixed programme of in-house and field training, equipment installation, and maintenance 
and laboratory visits.
<h3>Analytical Quality Assurance Service</h3>
The IAEA-MEL is a worldwide centre for data quality assurance for all kinds of chemical contaminants, both nuclear
and non-nuclear. It carries our regional exercises in the Mediterranean, the Gulf area, the western Pacific, west
and central Africa, and the Black Sea.
<h3>Method Development</h3>
IAEA-MEL continues to work on developing new, more efficient and more cost-effective laboratory methods for monitoring, studying
and controlling marine pollutants, both nuclear and non-nuclear. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is at the forefront of this
activity. It is also developing rapid mapping techniques for use in emergency response, as well as routine surveillance and mineralogical 
prospection.
<h3>Marine Processes</h3>
In order to obtain information on the behaviour and fate of radionuclides and other potential pollutants in the 
marine environment, scientists at IAEA-MEL participate in numerous scientific cruises in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic,
and the Black Sea region, sometimes under the aegis of IAEA co-ordinated research programmes. The Laboratory also participates in 
the "International Mussel Watch" experiment, which studies the global pattern of pesticide residue contamination by 
measuring concentrations of these substances in samples of the common mussels from countries throughout the world.
<h3> Nuclear Techniques in Studies of Non-Nuclear Contaminants</h3>
There is an increasing need in developing countries to gain knowledge in nuclear techniques for studying non-nuclear contaminants.
Among areas in which the Laboratory helps in this transition are in tracer studies using radiolabelled compounds, immunological
analyses and stable isotope techniques and multi-element analyses using mass spectrometry.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
States meeting at the IAEA General Conference have adopted resolutions to strengthen international safeguards and global 
co-operation in areas of nuclear safety and technical assistance.  Other adopted resolutions include those related to 
nuclear inspections in Iraq; safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); safeguards in the Middle East; 
and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  The Conference -- which concluded late today in Vienna, Austria -- is being 
attended by Ministers and high-level governmental delegates from the IAEA's 124 Member States.
<P>
Highlights of adopted resolutions follow.  <B><I>(Editor's note: The full texts, as well as related Conference documents 
and reports, are available on-line through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services at <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/">http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40</A>).</B></I>
<P>
<B>Strengthening the IAEA's Safeguards System</B>.  Convinced that IAEA safeguards can promote greater confidence among States and 
contribute to greater collective security, the Conference called upon the Agency to continue its implementation of 
previously approved ("Part 1") measures to strengthen the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its safeguards system, and 
it urged the States concerned to facilitate the process.  It further welcomed the IAEA Board of Governors' work begun in 
July 1996 to draft a model protocol to reinforce and improve the Agency's capacity to detect any undeclared nuclear 
activities.
<P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA Technical Co-operation Activities</B>.  Citing nuclear energy's existing and potential social, economic, and 
environmental benefits in many fields, the Conference requested the Agency to strengthen its technical co-operation 
activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities 
of developing countries in peaceful uses of nuclear energy for electricity production and other applications,  and at 
achieving sustainable development.  
<P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq</B>.  Reaffirming the need for full implementation by Iraq of Security Council resolutions 687, 707, and 715,
the Conference demanded that Iraq hand over to the IAEA's Action Team without further delay any currently undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material, and information. It 
further demanded that Iraq allow the Action Team immediate, unconditional and unrestricted rights of access in accordance 
with Security Council resolution 707.  It stressed that the Agency's Action Team will continue to exercise its right to 
investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards any further relevant 
information that Iraq may still be withholding from the Agency.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>. The Conference expressed its concern over the DPRK's continuing non-compliance with its IAEA 
safeguards agreement, and noted with regret the limited progress from IAEA-DPRK discussions of outstanding safeguards 
issues. It called upon the DPRK to comply fully with the safeguards agreement and to take all steps the Agency may deem 
necessary to preserve all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report 
on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with the agreement. 
The Conference further commended the Agency for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as 
requested by the United Nations Security Council.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the Middle East</B>.  The Conference requested the Agency's Director General to continue consultations with the 
States in the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope IAEA safeguards to all nuclear activities in 
the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) in the region. 
<P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ)</B>.  The Conference commended the African States for their concerted efforts on 
the establishment of an African NWFZ, and requested the IAEA Director General to continue to assist them in this regard.  
It  urged African States  to make every effort to ratify the Treaty so that it can enter into force without delay, and 
reaffirmed its convction that the establishment of other NWFZs, especially in the Middle East, would enhance the security 
of Africa and viability of the African NWFZ.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Materials</B>. Noting the programme for preventing and combatting illicit trafficking agreed 
upon at the Moscow Nuclear Summit in April 1996, the Conference welcomed the IAEA's activities in support of efforts 
against illicit trafficking, and invited the Agency to continue working in accordance with relevant conclusions of its 
Board of Governors.
<P>
<B>Nuclear, Radiation, and Waste Safety</B>.  The Conference adopted several resolutions.  One resolution, on the establishment 
of waste demonstration centres, invites the Agency to assist interested Member States in expanding the use of suitable 
existing training centres for practical training and demonstration of techniques for the processing and storage of 
radioactive waste from the application of nuclear techniques in medicine, research, and industry, so that a demonstration 
and training facility would be available in respective regions through greater co-operation and co-ordination of 
resources, including those available in developing countries. A second resolution, on the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
welcomed the fact that it will enter into force on 24 October 1996,  and expressed satisfaction that the Agency will 
convene a preparatory meeting of Contracting Parties no later than April 1997 on the Convention's implementation.  
A third resolution, on the safety of radioactive waste management, expressed appreciation for work done so far by the 
Open-ended Group of Legal and Technical Experts to draft a Convention on the subject, and hoped that progress at the 
Group's next meeting, to be hosted by South Africa, will allow timely completion of the preparatory work and adoption 
of a convention in the near future.
<P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically</B>.  Emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in many countries and 
noting the World Bank's call to hold a world water conference  in 1997, the Conference welcomed the Agency's work in 
this field to date, and requested the Director General to assign appropriate priority to the nuclear desalination of 
seawater in preparing the Agency's programme and budget, and invited him to establish an advisory body on nuclear 
desalination to take appropriate measures to assist Member States in the process of preparatory actions for demonstration 
projects.
<P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management</B>.  The Conference requested the Agency to identify and upgrade 
selected isotope hydrology laboratories in Member States so as to provide easy regional  access to analytical facilities 
for field hydrologists.  It further requested the Agency to work with other United Nations agencies to encourage the 
introduction of isotope hydrology and isotope geochemistry in university courses in Member States so as to provide a 
stronger foundation for future growth in the area of water resources management. 
<P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1997 and Target for Technical Co-operation Fund</B>.  The budget resolution approved expenditures in 
1997 of $222 million (at an exchange rate of 12.7 Austrian schillings to the US dollar).  The Conference further approved 
the target amount of US $68 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund in 1997.
<P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat</B>.  Two resolutions were adopted.  One requests the Agency to intensify its efforts 
to increase the number of staff members from developing countries, particularly at senior and policy-making levels, 
as well as from Member States that are not represented or are under-represented in the Secretariat.  The second resolution 
requests the Agency to pursue a target of equal representation of women at all levels of Agency employment, and it called 
upon the Director General to further integrate the Platform for Action developed at the United Nations Fourth World

<H3>IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL HANS BLIX CITES NEW RESPONSIBILITIES AHEAD</H3>
<P>
<I>Highlights of his Statement to the 39th regular session of the IAEA General Conference</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
Global nuclear developments are accelerating the evolution of IAEA roles and responsibilities to meet new needs of States in areas of nuclear verification, safety, and technology transfer, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said today in an opening statement to the Agency's General Conference. The Conference of the IAEA's 122 Member States, which sets the Agency's programmes and policies, is meeting this week in Vienna, Austria. 
<P>
"Credible IAEA verification that nuclear materials and related items remain in peaceful activities is an increasingly important factor in nuclear disarmament and global security planning," Dr. Blix said.  "At the same time, the magnitude and complexity of the safeguards task continues to increase."  In addition, he pointed out, "large increases in the verification effort may result if nuclear materials removed from the military sphere of nuclear-weapon States are placed under safeguards."  The Agency started verifying such material last year, he noted.
<P>
In reviewing the Agency's programmes and plans, Dr. Blix highlighted developments in a number of specific areas.  They included the IAEA's consideration of a request by France to conduct a radiological assessment of its current series of nuclear tests; the Agency's  ongoing verification in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; IAEA nuclear inspections in Iraq under the mandate of the UN  Security Council; measures to strengthen IAEA nuclear safeguards; possible new verification roles for the Agency; actions against the illicit trafficking in nuclear materials;  steps for greater global cooperation in nuclear safety and radioactive waste management; nuclear energy and the environment;  and initiatives to strengthen technical cooperation activities.
<P>
In many cases, he pointed out, measures being taken at the IAEA are moving forward in spite of continuing budget constraints, and he attributed progress to extrabudgetary resources provided by some Member States, ongoing improvements in programme management and implementation, and the efficiency and skills of IAEA staff. "The machinery of the IAEA has been working at full steam, even with some overpressure," he said, "and we can register considerable movement forward in many areas."
<P>
Selected highlights of the Director General's address follow.
<P>
<B>French nuclear tests</B>.  The Director General noted a recent letter he received from the French Foreign Minister, making reference to the irreversible commitment of France to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban in 1996 and its intention to undertake a final series of nuclear tests before that time, and inviting the Agency to conduct a radiological assessment of its series of nuclear tests. Dr. Blix said that the IAEA is considering the request.  Agency officials are now consulting French authorities, he said, on matters pertaining to the objectives, scope, modalities, and required expertise for such a scientific mission.  He pointed out that the Agency has some "first hand experience" in this field, in light of scientific studies it has previously done at the French Pacific test sites, as well as at sites connected with the former Soviet Union's military nuclear programme at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>.  The IAEA recently held technical discussions with authorities in the DPRK as part of  its ongoing verification efforts, he said.  "To come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement," Dr. Blix said, "the DPRK will have to do something it has not yet been willing to do, namely enable the Agency effectively to verify the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report of nuclear material subject to the agreement."  The recent discussions resulted in limited progress on some issues, Dr. Blix said.  A substantial paper of technical proposals transmitted by the Agency was accepted "only for study, not for discussion" he said.
<P>
<B>Nuclear inspections in Iraq</B>.  The Agency is verifying new information and data it has received concerning Iraq's thwarted plans in 1990-91 to develop a nuclear weapon, Dr. Blix said.  He said that  so far in its review of the new information, "nothing suggests that a change is warranted" in the Agency's conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme have been identified and destroyed, removed, or rendered harmless. He noted that the new Iraqi statements, and all the documents and materials that the Agency has received, will have to be carefully examined for new data.  "That they have been withheld for so long is clearly a breach of Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolutions," he said.
<P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA safeguards</B>.  Dr. Blix reviewed key components of Agency measures  -- some already being implemented and others remaining under consideration --  to develop and implement a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards system. He noted in particular steps to ensure increased access to information about nuclear programmes and broader inspector access to sites within a State.  "By making their nuclear activities as transparent as possible to the Agency," he said, "States can help provide the basis for more effective and efficient safeguards."   Regarding the costs of strengthening measures, he said they may be offset by efficiencies elsewhere in the safeguards systems. However, he added, "any significant increase in the number of countries accepting full-scope safeguards, or in the number of facilities and amount of material under safeguards, will inevitably involve additional costs."
<P>
<B>New and emerging verification roles</B>.  Citing developments in areas of nuclear non- proliferation, arms control, and disarmament, Dr. Blix said that  some possible new verification roles for the Agency are in sight.  "Far-reaching implications" for the IAEA's future work, he said, emanate from the outcome of the Review and Extension Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in May 1995.  Among other things, he noted that the Conference expressly recognized the IAEA as the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with safeguards agreements; recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under IAEA safeguards; envisaged the universal application of safeguards once the elimination of nuclear weapons had been achieved; set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; called for the early conclusion of a "cut-off"  agreement to end the production of nuclear material for use in weapons; and endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs). Dr. Blix pointed out that IAEA safeguards are being considered as an "essential element" of the verification mechanism for a cut-off agreement; that the Agency would have a verification role in any new NWFZ, given existing models; and that the IAEA already carries out safeguards tasks of relevance to verification of a test ban treaty, though its possible roles under a specific test ban treaty remain to be determined. 
<P>
<B>Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials</B>.  In reviewing key elements of the Agency's action programme against problems of illicit nuclear trafficking, Dr. Blix noted that the work is part of efforts by nuclear, customs, and enforcement authorities of many countries and a number of international organizations to strengthen and coordinate controls on radioactive materials.  "It is clear that more efforts are needed and that States must exercise greater prudence in the use and storage of all radioactive materials," he said.   He noted that the Agency's programme is largely directed to assisting States in areas related to the accounting and control of nuclear materials; physical protection methods and technology; and the establishment of a database to provide factual information about reported incidents of trafficking. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear safety and radioactive waste management</B>.  The Director General cited a number of developments.  He said that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, adopted in June 1994, could enter into force as early as next year, and that preparations for a Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety have been "encouraging", with a final draft possible by next year.  Work also is continuing, he noted, for a Diplomatic Conference in 1996 to revise the Vienna Convention on liability for nuclear damage. Regarding the Agency's work on the safety assessment of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, he said that an international consensus now exists that identifies the major safety issues and their significance for each of the various reactor types.  He further noted that Agency experts have been working closely with authorities in Armenia and Russia regarding safety issues at the Medzamor nuclear plant, which the Government of Armenia plans to restart. Separately, he noted, the Agency is working with Russian authorities on possible cooperative activities between Russia and other States in areas of radioactive waste management.  The Director General also pointed towards a major international conference being organized for April 1996 by the IAEA, World Health Organization, and European Union to sum up the accumulated knowledge about the nature and magnitude of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear energy and the environment</B>.  The Director General reviewed the Agency's programme on the comparative assessment of energy sources, which is providing documented data, methodologies, and analyses on the comparative economic social, health, and environmental aspects of different energy sources for electricity generation.  "Detailed studies on the emissions and residuals from nuclear, fossil, and renewable energy chains show that nuclear power in normal operation is one of the most environmentally friendly ways of generating electricity," he said.  He noted that the IAEA is convening an international symposium next month to review recent progress in the Agency's programme.
<P>
<B>Technical cooperation</B>.   The IAEA's technical cooperation programme delivery is the highest ever in the history of the Agency, the Director General noted.  He attributed the increase to improved management practices, better design and support of projects and other iniatives.  He further emphasized that the success of programmes depends on the availability of predictable resources, and appealed for full contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund.  In reviewing specific projects, Dr. Blix referred to special reports before the General Conference on isotope hydrology and the use of nuclear energy for potable water production.

<title>PR/10 - 2 May 1995 - 25 Years of the International Nuclear Information System</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<hr size=1 noshade>
2 May 1995 (PR 95/10)
<H3>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):
25 Years of the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)</H3>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
May 1995 marks the 25th anniversary of the International Nuclear Information System (INIS) of the IAEA which 
produced its first output products in both electronic and printed form in May
1970.
<P>
The INIS system, the very first in the world to enable the decentralized creation of an international database, 
covers all the world's literature on the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology.  Through INIS, 
Member States of the IAEA, international organizations, scientists, engineers, managers,
planners and policy-makers, members of academic and research institutes, students and users in industry 
throughout the world are able to benefit from the comprehensive services offered.
<P>
At the time of its establishment, the computer-based INIS system was deemed to be at the forefront of information 
technology; during the intervening 25 years it has steadily developed so
as to maintain its position in the vanguard of information transfer activities, while maintaining its non-commercial
character and facilitating the availability of nuclear information to users in all participating countries irrespective of
their levels of development.
<P>
While initially the information carried by INIS was made available in printed form and on magnetic tapes sent to 
participating Member States, subsequent developments in information technology have enabled the database to 
be made available also online from the computer at the IAEA and from other international
database hosts that have appropriate arrangements with the national INIS centres.  With the advent of international
networking, database hosts that offer the INIS database are accessible from essentially all corners of the globe. 
The total database is also available on a set of 6 CD-ROM disks requiring only a local personal computer with 
CD-ROM drive to enable full local searching of references from the database.  The system also assures the 
availability of the full text of those documents difficult to obtain through normal commercial channels 
(non-conventional literature) and makes them available from the Secretariat in Vienna.
<P>
The recent meeting of the Advisory Committee for INIS provided an outline of the strategy for INIS developments in
1995-2000 and beyond.  This strategy foresees that access to nuclear information would be ensured not only by 
producing the INIS database as it has been in the past, but that access to information available through other 
databases would become part of the overall INIS approach to the provision of nuclear information.  This approach 
of "partnerships" with other sources of information stresses the continued provision of comprehensive
nuclear information services to its users in the Member States by a combination of data ownership and access to 
data stored elsewhere.
<P>
INIS continues to play a key role in providing access to nuclear information to support world wide nuclear projects of all
types, not only in nuclear power but specifically also in nuclear safety and radiation protection, safeguards, 
verification, environmental effects of nuclear compared to other energy sources
and non-energy applications of nuclear techniques in areas such as food and agriculture, human health, industry and earth
sciences and physical and chemical sciences. Currently 90 IAEA Member States and 17 international organizations are cooperating
with the Secretariat in the creation of the INIS database that now has records referring to over 1.8 million items of nuclear
literature and is growing at the rate of about 85.000 records per year.  INIS is by far the largest of the electronic databases
created by the IAEA in cooperation with its Member States, and its continuing success reflects the active support 
and participation of IAEA Member States.

April 1995 (PR 95/9)
<H3>Nuclear Power Status in 1994</H3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<p>
A total of 480 nuclear power plants were operating or being built around the world in
1994, based on data reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Power
Reactor Information System (PRIS).  During 1994, four nuclear power plants with
altogether 3356 MW(e) were newly connected to electricity grids in China, Japan,
Republic of Korea and Mexico, bringing the world's total number of operating reactors
to 432 in 29 countries and Taiwan, China.  Additionally, a total of 48 reactors were
reported as being constructed in 15 countries.  
<P>
     Nuclear power's share of electricity production remained high in 1994, in seven
countries -- Lithuania, 76.4; France 75.3; Belgium, 55.8; Sweden, 51.1; Slovak Republic,
49.1; Bulgaria, 45.6, and Hungary, 43.7  -- representing close to half or more of their
total electricity use.  All in all, 18 countries (including Taiwan, China) relied upon
nuclear power plants to supply at least a quarter of their total electricity needs.  
<P>
     Worldwide in 1994, total nuclear power generation amounted to 2130.13 terawatt-
hours of electricity.  This is more than the world's total electricity generation -- 1912
terawatt-hours -- from all sources in 1958.  Overall nuclear power plants provided
approximately 17 percent of the world's electricity production in 1994.  Cumulative
worldwide operating experience from civil nuclear reactors at the end of 1994 was over
7200 years.

<H3>Chernobyl Radiation Consequences : The Facts International Conference Planned for April 1996 in Vienna</H3>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
</A>
The health and environmental effects attributed to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant in the Ukraine on 26 April 1986 have been subject to extensive scientific
examination;  however, there still remain widely differing perspectives of the radiological
consequences.  Ten years after the accident, the European Commission (EC), the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO)
will jointly sponsor, from 8 to 12 April 1996, an International Conference to seek a
common and conclusive understanding of the nature and magnitude of the accident's
consequences.  The Conference, "One Decade after Chernobyl:  Summing Up the
Radiological Consequences of the Accident", will be organized in co-operation with the
United Nations through the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA), as well as
with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and will take place in the Austria
Center Vienna, Austria.  A senior advisory committee of scientists from Belarus, Russia
and Ukraine will monitor the organization of the conference.
<P>
This Joint Conference will collate international findings on the consequences of the
accident, taking particular account of the outcome of two prior Conferences.  One will be
the WHO International Conference on the "Health Consequences of the Chernobyl and
other Radiological Accidents" to be held in Geneva, 20-23 November 1995, and the
second will be the "First International Conference of the European Union, Belarus,
Russian Federation and Ukraine on the Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident" to be
held in Minsk, 18-23 March 1996.  
<P>
The Joint Conference in Vienna will address the accident's health and
environmental effects as well as the social, economic and political impacts.  Important
objectives of the Conference will be to establish clearly the scientific facts of the
accident's consequences and to quantify its radiological and long term health effects as
well as to review its social, economic and political consequences.
<P>
Other international organizations and multilateral, bilateral and national projects are
expected to contribute to the programme of the Conference, which will be open to
representatives nominated by governments and accredited media.

Nuclear Community Successfully Meets Proliferation, Legal and
Pollution Challenges</title></head>

24 April 1995 (PR 95/7)
<H3>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Says
Nuclear Community Successfully Meets Proliferation, Legal and
Pollution Challenges</H3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<p>
IAEA Director Hans Blix today welcomed the success of efforts to
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and noted that,
contrary to predictions, the global expansion of nuclear power
has been accompanied by expanded commitments to non-
proliferation.
<P>     
     Speaking at the General Meeting of the World Association of
Nuclear Operators in Paris, Dr. Blix said "those who claimed that
nuclear power and nuclear weapons were like Siamese twins, and
that development of nuclear power must (hence) be stopped...have
been proved wrong".  It was not regarded unrealistic today, he
added, to aim at nearly full nuclear disarmament by the declared
nuclear weapon states and universal adherence to non-
proliferation commitments by all others.
<P>
     Turning to the importance of the necessary legal
infrastructure for use of nuclear energy, the Director General
observed that it was natural that societies require a strong
framework to limit the degree of risk, and govern liability in
case of damage to individuals or the environment.  In the nuclear
field, this encompassed extensive rules regarding the transport
of nuclear materials, the prohibition of waste dumping at sea,
strict conditions for any transboundary movement of waste, and
broad adherence to the international Conventions (Paris and
Vienna) on liability.  Revision of the Vienna Convention,
concluded under IAEA auspices in 1963, was currently underway. 
The aim is to draft modifications that will lead inter alia to
general adherence by states to the Convention, raise the ceilings
of compensation - for operators and for states - and provide
international supplementary financing.
<P>     
     On the safety front, the Director General noted the fact
that some 60 States had now  signed the Convention on Nuclear
Safety that was expected to enter into force within a year or so. 
Effective implementation would hinge to a large degree on the
requirement for states parties to submit national reports on
their nuclear power operations for "peer review".  A similar
Convention on the safety of radioactive waste management would
follow: a first group of technical and legal experts open to all
IAEA Member States was expected to initiate work in July.  The
intention of international experts appears so far to give the
convention broad scope, covering not only standards for national
management of nuclear waste but also transboundary movements and
possible regional and international repositories.
<P>
     Lastly, the Director General noted that CO2  emissions were
continuing to rise and that "carbon dioxide emitted anywhere is
CO2 emitted everywhere".  Also, were the energy generated by the
world's nuclear power plants replaced by burning coal, CO2
emissions would rise by 7 percent or 2000 million tonnes .  Given
the uncertainty of current climate models that could trigger huge
investments that might prove unnecessary, he advocated a "no
regret" policy - i.e. measures that help to reduce greenhouse
gases and are at the same time meaningful and economic even
without that additional benefit:  expanded use of nuclear power
would be one such "no  regret" response to global warming.

<title>PR/6 - 17 April 1995 - IAEA Director General Calls on States Belonging to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to Provide Firm, Uninterrupted Basis for the Agency's NPT-Related Services at the Treaty's Review and Extension Conference</title>

17 April 1995 (PR 95/6) 
<h3>IAEA Director General Calls on States Belonging to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to Provide Firm,
Uninterrupted Basis for the Agency's NPT-Related Services
at the Treaty's Review and Extension Conference</h3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<P>
The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Hans Blix, today
(17 April) called upon States attending the NPT Review and Extension Conference in New York
(17 April-12 May) to ensure that the various key services of the Agency provided under the NPT
can continue without interruption.
<p>         
Speaking at the opening session of the Conference at the United Nations in New York,
Dr. Blix said the IAEA has a central, statutory role both in promoting the peaceful applications
of nuclear energy and in helping to prevent its military use, thus serving as a vital instrument
for the implementation of the NPT.
<p>         
Dr. Blix said "the Agency must be enabled, through adequate resources, and
strengthened and streamlined safeguards, effectively to verify that non-proliferation pledges are
respected, and, thereby, to create confidence among the parties." He noted in this context that
the IAEA's Board of Governors had at its meeting last month endorsed the general direction of
recent proposals for a major safeguards development programme. These proposals, he said,
would -- if accepted -- significantly increase the level of assurance about the absence of undeclared
facilities although they would be less intrusive than the inspections mandated by the Security
Council in Iraq.
<p>         
The Director General suggested that the Agency's verification capacity could
also be employed in implementing such nuclear disarmament agreements as might be reached in
pursuance of Article VI of the NPT.
<p>         
The Agency would of course continue in parallel, he added, to serve as a principal
intergovernmental channel for the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology among NPT parties
and of assistance to developing nations.
<p>         
In the course of his speech, the Director General reviewed in particular the lessons learnt
in Iraq, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Africa for the evolution of the
safeguards system and its future strengthening, both in terms of methodology and technology:
access to information and access to sites remained, however, the crucial factors for the
effectiveness of the system.
<p>

liaison office or from the Division of Public Information in Vienna or on the <a href=/worldatom/inforesource/dgspeeches/>Internet</a></i>.

<title>PR/5 - 10 April 1995 - IAEA DG Sees International Stability Through
Support for Non-Proliferation, Continuing Contribution of
Nuclear Power in World Energy Mix</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<hr size=1 noshade>
10 April 1995 (PR 95/5)
<h3>IAEA DG Sees International Stability Through
Support for Non-Proliferation, Continuing Contribution of
Nuclear Power in World Energy Mix</h3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<P>
The global population, which will grow in this decade by one billion people, needs both
security and improved living conditions.  Meeting this challenge entails answers inter
alia to two questions:  whether we can eventually eliminate the threat of nuclear
weapons and attain international stability; and  whether we can use nuclear power as a
major part of a stable supply of environmentally benign energy.  International Atomic
Energy Agency  Director General Hans Blix suggests the answer to both questions
should be "yes".
<p>
     Speaking at the opening session of the Annual Conference of the Japan Atomic
Industrial Forum on 10 April, Dr. Blix noted that the superpowers are now dismantling
large numbers of their nuclear weapons and negotiations are underway both on a world-
wide ban on the further production of nuclear material for weapons use and on a
comprehensive ban on any further testing of nuclear weapons.  He further noted that in
one week's time a major conference would begin in New York to examine whether the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is to be extended for an unlimited or a specific period
of time.  There can be no doubt, he added, that this treaty and other treaties under
which States have renounced nuclear weapons are contributing to stability.  To proceed
with disarmament and remain committed to non-proliferation, States need to feel
confident that others are fully respecting their commitments.  The IAEA is strengthening
its own system for verifying nuclear non-proliferation commitments, and also has the
capacity to provide verification under other nuclear-related arms control agreements
and thereby contribute further to confidence and stability.
<p>
     Turning to nuclear  power, the Director General said it was indispensible for
stable and sustainable development, and it was high time that governments publicly
recognized this.  Greater efficiency in energy use would not offset the expanded demand
for energy, especially in the developing countries.  Alternatives to fossil fuels, other than
nuclear power, are not able economically to make a significant contribution to meeting
demand in the near term.  Increased global use of fossil fuels must be discouraged in
order to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.  Although nuclear power could produce
electricity at competitive prices,  it is not at present in many countries "politically
competitive": addressing concerns expressed about the nuclear option and more
education and public information about nuclear energy would encourage a more
constructive discussion.
<p>
     A major source of public concern about nuclear power, the Director General said,
relates to safety, in particular the fear of accidents involving radioactive releases,  but it
can be demonstrated that comprehensive national and international nuclear safety
infrastructures are in place.  The second public concern about nuclear power relates to
waste, but it should be pointed out that nuclear wastes are limited in volume and can be
isolated in their entirety from the environment.  The wastes from fossil fuels, by
contrast, cannot be handled in a manner that is responsible vis-a-vis future generations. 
A third concern has been that the development of nuclear power might risk increasing
the capacity of countries to make nuclear weapons.  However, contrary to President
Kennedy's pessimistic prediction years ago that there would be dozens of nuclear-
weapon States, the expansion of nuclear power in the world has gone hand in hand with
increased commitments to exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy.  Thus, he
concluded, it was not unreasonable to foresee that the tremendous force of the atom,
would come to be accepted as a sustainable, environmentally benign source of energy
contributing to and not disrupting the stability of international society.

<title>PR/4 - 31  March 1995 - IAEA Board of Governors Holds Spring Meeting, Considers Nuclear Safety Issues and Strengthening of Safeguards Verification System </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<hr size=1 noshade>
31 March 1995 (PR 95/4)
<H3>IAEA Board of Governors Holds Spring Meeting, Considers Nuclear Safety Issues and
Strengthening of Safeguards Verification System</H3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<p>
The Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) devoted its meeting 27-30 March to the 
consideration of safety-related issues, as well as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the safeguards system.
<p>
Reviewing the safety experience of 1994, the Board welcomed the absence of events impacting on public health
and also the very good safety record of nuclear installations overall. The ongoing efforts of the Agency and others
to improve the safety of Soviet-designed reactors were commended.
<p>
On illicit trafficking, many Governors reiterated the concern of the international community about such trafficking in
nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. Also, several stressed the need for high standards of radiation
protection in this context. The Board reiterated that the control and physical protection of nuclear material and
other radioactive sources is a national responsibility. In addition, the Board welcomed and gave guidance on the
activities of the Agency designed to assist Member States in strengthening their national systems of accounting and
control and also the provision of Agency assistance, on request, to Member States in analyzing confiscated nuclear
material. The Board endorsed the Secretariat's intention to establish a database on illicit trafficking which would meet
both the needs of the Secretariat in carrying out its responsibilities and the need of Member States for reliable
information on the extent of the problem.
<p>
The Board conducted an initial examination of measures developed under "programme 93+2" for a strengthened
cost-effective safeguards system. In this connection, the Board reiterated that the purpose of comprehensive
safeguards agreements, where safeguards are applied to all nuclear material in all nuclear activities within the
territory of a State party to such an agreement, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere, is to 
verify that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. To this end, the safeguards
system for implementing comprehensive safeguards agreements should be designed to provide for verification by the 
Agency of the correctness and completeness of States' declarations, so that there is credible assurance of the non-diversion
of nuclear material from declared activities and the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.
<p>
The Board recognized that under comprehensive safeguards agreements the State Parties and the Agency have the
obligation to co-operate fully to facilitate implementation of the agreements; furthermore, that a strengthened safeguards
system will benefit from technological developments and call for greater access to relevant information and greater
physical access to relevant sites for the Agency, either on the basis of existing authority provided for in comprehensive
safeguards agreements or on the basis of complementary authority to be conferred by the States involved. The Board
noted, however, that some Governors have reservations at this stage about the need for greater access to sites.
While not at this stage taking a decision on any of the specific measures proposed, or on their legal basis, the Board
endorsed the general direction of "programme 93+2" for a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards.
<p>
The Board requested the Secretariat, taking into account the comments made during the discussions and any comments
which may still be received from interested Member States, to submit for the Board's consideration at its next meeting 
in June specific proposals -- for a strengthened and cost-effective safeguards system. In doing so, the Board expressed
its understanding that the strengthened safeguards system will respect the principles enunciated in paragraph 4 of the
standard guidelines for comprehensive safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/153).*
<p>
* Footnote: Paragraph 4 reads as follows:<br>
"The agreement should provide that safeguards shall be implemented in a manner designed:
<OL>
<LI>To avoid hampering the economic and technological development of the State or international co-operation
in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including international exchange of nuclear material;
<LI>To avoid undue interference in the State's peaceful nuclear activities, and in particular in the operation of
facilities; and
<LI>To be consistent with prudent management practices required for the economic and safe conduct of nuclear
activities."

<title>PR/3 - 1 February 1995 - New Director and Deputy Director of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<hr size=1 noshade>
1 February 1995 (PR 95/3)
<h3>New Director and Deputy Director of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division</h3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<p>
Dr. James D. Dargie (UK) today assumed his duties as the new Director of the
Joint Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture of the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the IAEA. The new Director is a staff
member of FAO.
<P>
 Born in 1943, Dr. Dargie graduated in agricultural sciences in the United Kingdom,
obtaining a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Glasgow. Before
joining the Joint FAO/IAEA Division in 1982, Dr. Dargie worked as reader in veterinary
physiology at the University of Glasgow. From 1969 to 1971 he served as an FAO/IAEA
regional expert for East Africa and later carried out consultancies for FAO/IAEA, the
Rockefeller Foundation and the British Overseas Development Administration in various
African countries. In these assignments, he established radioisotope laboratories within
national veterinary and agricultural institutions, and research programmes involving
techniques to improve animal health. Since 1982, he has been the head of the Animal
Production and Health Section of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division.
<P>
Dr. Manase Peter Salema (Tanzania) has been appointed as Deputy Director of the
Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture.
<P> Born in 1952, Dr. Salema graduated in general agriculture from the University of
Dar-es-Salam, Tanzania, and obtained his PhD in Soil Sciences at the University of
Western Australia. After several assignments at the Sokoine University of Agriculture in
Morogoro, Tanzania, he worked in several IAEA technical co-operation projects in
biological nitrogen fixation in African States. Since 1991, he has been technical officer in
the Section for Soil Fertility, Irrigation and Crop Production of the Joint FAO/IAEA
Division.
<P>
Through projects and research oriented work, the Joint FAO/IAEA Division
attempts to solve practical problems related to agricultural production and food and animal
protection in the developing world. Its objectives are to exploit the potential of nuclear
techniques in research and development for increasing and stabilizing agricultural
production, reducing production costs, improving food quality, protecting agricultural
products from spoilage and losses and minimizing pollution of food and the agricultural
environment. Control of insects and pests meets several of these objectives. Much
attention is devoted to studies of the fate of fertilizers and their influence on the
environment.

<hr size=1 noshade>
13 January 1995 (PR 95/2)
<h3>Algeria Accedes to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</h3>
<hr noshade size=1>
<P>
The Algerian authorities have informed the IAEA that it has become a party to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by depositing its instrument of
accession yesterday in Washington, London and Moscow.
<P>
 In welcoming the announcement, IAEA Director General Hans Blix said this was a
further significant and positive development, coming shortly before the Conference that
will consider the Treaty's extension this spring. He added that it would also add impetus
to efforts to declare the whole of Africa as a nuclear weapon-free zone.
<P>
 Algeria's accession brings the current total of States party to the NPT to 168.
<P>
 Normal procedure foresees the conclusion by States joining the NPT of a
comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA permitting inspection of relevant
nuclear materials. IAEA inspectors have, however, already been able to inspect Algeria's
two nuclear research reactors under procedures agreed with Algerian authorities.

<H3>IAEA Member States Adopt Resolutions on Nuclear Safeguards, Safety, and Technical Cooperation</H3>
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Member States meeting at the IAEA General Conference have adopted resolutions in key areas of global nuclear development.  Resolutions addressed topics including the implementation of safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); IAEA nuclear inspections in Iraq; nuclear testing; application of safeguards in the Middle East; illicit trafficking in nuclear materials; and measures for strengthening  areas of safeguards, nuclear safety, and technical cooperation.  The Conference -- attended by delegations from 103 countries -- concluded today in Vienna, Austria.
<P>
The adopted resolutions include those related to:
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>.  The resolution commends the IAEA for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as requested by the UN Security Council, and to implement the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement.  In calling upon the DPRK to comply fully with the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement, the resolution urges the DPRK to take all steps the Agency may deem necessary to preserve, intact, all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with its safeguards agreement.
<P>
<B>Nuclear inspections in Iraq</B>.  The resolution condemns Iraq for having, since 1991, withheld from the Agency information about its nuclear weapon programme in violation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions, and it demands that Iraq hand over to the Agency without further delay any currently undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material or information, as called for in Security Council resolutions.   The resolution stresses that the Agency will continue to exercise its right to investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards the new information obtained by the Agency in August 1995 and any further relevant information that Iraq may still be withholding from the Agency.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Testing</B>. The resolution expresses grave concern at the resumption and the continuation of nuclear testing and calls upon those States which have active nuclear testing programmes in place to desist from testing until a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) enters into force.  In the resolution, the Conference states its expectation that the negotiations for a CTBT will be completed and the Treaty signed in 1996 as may be further specified by the Fiftieth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and it urges all participants in the negotiations to further intensify their efforts to this end. 
<P>
<B>Strengthening the Safeguards System</B>. Expressing the conviction that the Agency's safeguards can promote greater confidence among States and thus contribute to strengthening collective security, the resolution addresses measures proposed under the IAEA Programme 93+2 for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. The resolution requests the IAEA to continue to develop the measures proposed under Programme 93+2 in order to bring about a more effective and efficient system covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of a State which has concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement, and to make the necessary arrangements to implement at an early date the first part of the proposed measures after consulting individual States. It further requests the IAEA, taking account of views expressed in the Board of Governors and the General Conference and the outcome of consultations with Member States individually or collectively, to put before its Board of Governors as soon as possible clear proposals for the second part of the proposed measures.
<P>
<B>IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East</B>.   The resolution requests the IAEA's Director General to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking</B>.  The resolution welcomes the measures taken by the IAEA in support of efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, and invites the Agency to continue working in accordance with the conclusions of the its Board of Governors.  
<P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ)</B>.  Noting the adoption in June 1995 of the text of the Treaty on an African NWFZ, the resolution commends the African States for their united efforts toward the establishment of an NWFZ and requests the IAEA to continue to assist them in this regard. 
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>.  Noting that 61 States have signed and 12 have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the resolution expresses the hope for the widest possible adherence to the Convention.   It appeals to all Member States which have not yet done so to sign the Convention, and it appeals to signatory States which have not yet done so to ratify, accept or approve the Convention so that it may enter into force as soon as possible.  
<P>
<B>Technical Cooperation</B>.  The resolution requests the IAEA to pursue, in consultation with Member States, efforts to strengthen the Agency's technical cooperation activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing countries in fields of peaceful nuclear applications, and achieving sustainable development.  The resolution defined these fields as including both applications of nuclear methods and techniques and the production of electricity, and it noted that account should be taken of the infrastructure and the level of technology of the countries concerned. It further requests the IAEA to take account of the view of the General Conference on this question when requesting Member States to pledge their respective shares of the Technical Cooperation Fund targets and to make timely payments to the Fund. 
<P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically</B>.  In emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in Member States, the resolution stresses the vital importance of producing potable water and urges the IAEA to secure sufficient funding, through appeals to international organizations and prospective donor countries, to ensure completion in 1996 of the second phase of a programme in this area.  It further requests the IAEA to include the nuclear desalination of sea water in future programmes of the Agency, with appropriate priority.
<P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management</B>.  Citing the importance of clean drinking water to human health and the optimum use of economic resources, the resolution requests the IAEA to continue to integrate the available resources of the Agency and its Member States and to direct them towards concrete programmes for producing a visible impact by improving the quality and availability of water.
<P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1996 and Target for Technical Cooperation Fund</B>.  The adopted budget resolution allocates expenditures of US $219 million in 1996 (at an exchange rate of 12.70 Austrian schillings to the US dollar).  The Conference further approved the target amount of US $64.5 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Cooperation Fund in 1996.
<P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat</B>.  Two resolutions were adopted.  One resolution requests the IAEA to intensify efforts to increase, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, the number of staff members from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented.  The second resolution requests the IAEA to continue efforts to increase substantially, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, as well as for scientific and technical posts, the number of female staff members, particularly from developing countries and from those other Member States which are under-represented.  It further calls upon the IAEA to examine the Platform for Action developed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and to integrate, where applicable, the elements of this platform into the Agency's relevant policies and programmes.

<p><font size=4><strong>MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION</strong></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<hr>

<p><strong>Manuscript Preparation: </strong>Standard <em>NF </em>practice requires SI units, or common derived units such as the centimetre and the megampere. Incidental use of 
non-standard units plus a conversion factor is acceptable.</p>
<p>The names of authors should follow, if necessary, the standard IAEA transliteration guides, available on request. The full names of Chinese authors should be 
provided.</p>
<p>Abstracts should summarize the contents of the article in 300 words or less, and should contain the principal objectives, the methodology employed, 
the results, the new findings and the main conclusions. General, well known information, should be accommodated in the introduction.</p>
<p>If a reference has five authors or less, all the authors may be listed. If there are more than five, the first author followed by et al. should be given. (<em>NF</em> practice 
regarding the number of authors has varied over the years; the guidance given above reflects the IAEA standard.) Authors' names are printed in all capital letters, 
surname first. Journal references should use customary abbreviations, such as <em>Nucl. Fusion</em>, <em>Phys. Rev. Lett.</em>, plus volume number, year in parentheses and page 
number. Unpublished material -- laboratory reports, theses, papers not yet published -- should be cited with full titles, place and year. Citations of reports should 
also contain laboratory prefix and number, date of issue, etc. </p>
<p>References to books should contain authors' or editors' names, the full title, the name and location of the publisher, the year of publication and the page number (if 
appropriate). References to personal communications should be avoided.<br>
<br>
Terms and acronyms found in widely available text-books need not be explained.Less widely known terms should be explained.<br>
<br>
All figures should be camera-ready, labelled so as to be fully legible after reduction for the journal (usually to one column width (8 cm)), on separate sheets and 
numbered consecutively with arabic numerals in the order in which they are mentioned in the text. Tables must have a heading and be numbered consecutively with 
roman numerals.<br>
<br>
Footnotes to tables should be indicated by raised letters (not numbers or asterisks) and set immediately below the table itself. Footnotes to the text should be 
numbered consecutively with raised arabic numerals. </p>
<p><a href="math.htm"><strong>Guidelines for Mathematics</strong></a> </p>
<p><br>
<strong>Machine Readable Submission:</strong> <em>NF</em> encourages the submission of machine readable text, figures and tables after acceptance of a manuscript for publication. 
Our internal text processing uses LaTeX plus encapsulated PostScript or bitmap graphics for graphic material. We can handle other formats from the more common 
PC and MacIntosh programs, but at reduced efficiency. Submission on floppy disks, especially MS-DOS disks, or through ftp (file transfer protocol) is preferable 
to electronic mail, unless the files are smaller than approximately 100 kilobytes. <br>
<br>
Our LaTeX style files are available at our ftp site, or by e-mail, for authors interested in submitting preliminary or final manuscripts that are as close as possible to 
the published result. Please contact the <em>NF</em> office if you have questions about using our style files.
<p>
<strong>Proofs:</strong> The submitting author will receive proof of the typeset manuscript, including figures and tables. The proofs will have corrections marked, and often queries. Please respond to any queries, and add additional corrections if necessary, using a pen of distinguishing colour, usually red. Return the marked proofs by mail or 
express service. The use of colour precludes sending or receiving proofs by fax. Return with the proofs the billing information for page charges and the order for any extra reprints. <br>

<p><strong>WORLD SURVEY OF ACTIVITIES IN CONTROLLED FUSION RESEARCH, 1994 EDITION</strong><br>
Special Supplement to Nuclear Fusion, IAEA, Vienna 1994<br>
Editor: C. Bobeldijk (retired end of June 1996)<br>
STI/PUB/023/SPS/1994, &#160;ISBN 92-0-103594-2, ISSN 0029-5515, &#160;Price: 1280 Austrian Schillings.<br>
<br>
<strong>Foreword:</strong><br>
<br>
Up till 1991, six editions of the Nuclear Fusion Supplement 'World Survey of Activities in Controlled Fusion Research' were produced. The later editions 
contained, besides comprehensive information on institutes and personnel, tables with details of the experimental and theoretical activities in virtually all the world's 
institutes active in nuclear fusion research. These tables have now been replaced by short descriptions of the main activities complemented with references to the 
1991 tables where additional information can be found. <br>
<br>
The availability of separate files for each institute has led to a change of format of the World Survey from book to loose-leaf system. This has the advantage that 
information and last minute corrections can be induced and that updates of single institutes can be distributed and included during the time between the regular 
editions, even by the institutes themselves. The ultimate goal will be to make the World Survey available in electronic format. <br>
<br>
This edition of the World Survey consists mainly of two parts: 'Laboratories and Scientific Staff' ' and the 'Personnel Index'. The two parts are preceded by a short 
list of institutes ordered alphabetically according to country and city to simplify the search for these institutes, and followed by a list of table headings of the 1991 
tables referred to in the individual submissions. <br>
<br>
The responsible IAEA staff members were C. Bobeldijk, L. Dias-Noronha, M. Bergamini-R&ouml;edler and F. Hannak. </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The IAEA and the Argonne National Laboratory have a long tradition of collaboration.  Staff from Argonne have come to work in the Agency and many experts from Argonne have contributed to our programmes - in the areas of reactor systems development and research reactor fuel performance, to name just two.  The IAEA has also benefited greatly from Argonne's strengths in education and training.  There have been joint training courses in fields such as nuclear safety, energy planning and environmental monitoring.  I sincerely welcome this opportunity on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of one of the world's leading centres for nuclear research to bring you the congratulations and thanks of the IAEA.
<P>
	The subject of my talk is "Nuclear Power - Prospects for Revival".  This audience is so well versed in the subject that I propose to deal first somewhat summarily with the main familiar factors, e.g. nuclear power's economic competitiveness and environmental advantages, on the one hand, and perceptions about risk of accidents, of waste disposal and proliferation on the other.  I intend thereafter to focus on a few rather specific issues, which I believe are also of relevance for a nuclear revival, but which are not at the centre of the public debate.     
<P>
<B>The Case for a Revival of Nuclear Power</B>
<P>
	First, then, briefly on some of the general considerations.  The arguments for a revival of nuclear power are simple.  If the developing world is to achieve standards of living comparable to the levels which are common in industrialized countries, then there will need <I>inter alia</I> to be massive increases in energy use.  Fossil fuels account for 75% of present total energy use and an increased use of fossil fuels is the easiest way in which developing countries can increase their energy use.  This is the way they are now moving along.  However, if we are to limit the burden of energy use on the biosphere - in particular the emission of CO<SUB>2</SUB> - we need a different global balance in the energy mix than the one which is now so heavily dominated by coal, oil and gas.  Nuclear energy has proved that it can be a very substantial environmentally benign source of electricity and heat and that it can be produced at a cost that is roughly equal to that of coal-generated power.  Indeed, as we know, without the contribution of nuclear power over the last decades, the environmental problems, including the CO<SUB>2</SUB>  problem, would be even greater than they are today.  
<P>
	Decision makers are probably aware of these points.  But there is an apparent lack of will to draw one conclusion, namely that leadership is needed to bring about a revival of the nuclear power option.  The 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development and the Conferences of the Parties to the Climate Convention in Berlin in 1995 and in Geneva in 1996 were virtually silent on nuclear power.  These Conferences did not give guidance as to how CO<SUB>2</SUB> and other greenhouse gases are to be reduced - only that it should occur.  Meanwhile the reality is going in the opposite direction: CO<SUB>2</SUB>  emissions are increasing.  Why is it that with the tremendous governmental and public attention to the risk of global warming and talk - for instance, about taxes on CO<SUB>2</SUB>  emissions - the international governmental conferences do not zero in on nuclear power as an important remedy?  I think the answer is simple.  In many countries some votes can be lost but few can be gained by an explicit pro-nuclear stand.  In these circumstances pro-nuclear governments and politicians prefer to remain silent on the matter, hoping that the intellectual and emotional climate will change before the global climate changes ...
<P>
	But what about international, non-political, professional bodies?  The scientific body set up by the WMO and UNEP to examine the risk of climate change and possible response action to restrain greenhouse gas emissions is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC.  This Panel of climatologists has been progressively affirmative in its prediction that climate change will occur if present trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue.  When it comes to discuss possible responses, however, it prefers to treat all as <I>equally hypothetical</I>, whether they are highly speculative or rely on proven technologies.
<P>
	Let me be specific.  The IPCC discusses the separation of CO<SUB>2</SUB>  from flue gases and piping it into mines or saline aquifers or injecting it at 3000 meters depth in the ocean - an almost science fiction like approach - as if these were solutions on par with technically established conventional solutions, like switching from coal and oil to gas - which gives less CO<SUB>2</SUB>  per energy unit or building nuclear power plants - which do not emit CO<SUB>2</SUB>.  Again, the IPCC discusses solar power and biomass use as if these sources were options equal to nuclear power, when the reality is that nuclear power, as I mentioned, is roughly on par with coal power as regards cost, while photovoltaic cells and biomass generation of electricity are for the foreseeable future very far from competitive.  The Panel thus compares technically mature and available options for greenhouse gas abatement with hypothetical or speculative solutions.  It notes, however, that - I quote - "nuclear energy could replace baseload fossil fuel electricity generation if generally acceptable responses can be found to concerns such as reactor safety, radioactive waste transport and disposal, and nuclear proliferation."
   <P>
	This evaluation deserves some comment.  It would be far from me to disagree with the view that "concerns" - I take it by the public - relating to reactor safety, waste disposal and proliferation are obstacles to an expansion of nuclear power.  However, I think it must be noted that these are political-psychological obstacles - not problems to which adequate technical solutions are still missing.  Rather than summarily writing off nuclear power because of "concerns", a serious scientific discussion of the nuclear option should examine the <I>substance</I> of the safety issue, the waste disposal issue and the proliferation issue.  If these substantive issues - upon unbiased analysis - are found not to be very serious, then the conclusion should be that the concerns ought to be dispelled through more information to allow the option to be used.  As you all know, the risks to which these concerns relate will not be found to be zero, but very small.  Let me make brief comments on them.
<P>
	First, the risk of proliferation is real but it is doubtful that it would increase more than marginally if nuclear power expanded.  One hundred and eighty non-nuclear-weapon States have adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty which was extended for an indefinite time last year.  Moreover, today, nuclear weapons are being dismantled by nuclear-weapon States and we can, for the first time, begin to think of their total abolition some time in the future.  Second, nuclear safety, is becoming a universal culture - with conventions, standards and shop floor awareness that should ensure good practices worldwide.  We have learnt a lot since Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986.  There are currently 430 nuclear power plants in operation with an average lifetime approaching 20 years - almost 8000 years of operating experience from which we have learned.  Thirdly, we are now able to show in practice, not just in theory, that radioactive wastes can be managed for the longer term - the main problem we see is the essentially political-psychological issue of site acceptance.   
<P>
	In saying that we have answers to these three main issues I am not suggesting, of course, that there is nothing more to be done on them - but the issues are for the most part well defined and respectable answers exist.  Steps are being taken to further reduce the risk of proliferation - in the IAEA - by strengthening the system for verifying nuclear non-proliferation commitments; agreements are being concluded to provide peer review of national safety practices and to improve the system for compensation in the event of nuclear accidents; and practical systems are in place for providing assistance in upgrading safety.
<P>
	I shall soon comment in greater detail on the current negotiations to strengthen international safeguards and on the debate about sustainable energy policies.  At this point I would observe that the radical transformations of the international scene which have accompanied the end of the Cold War have had some significant impact on the issues we discuss.  The division of the world into two mightily armed opposing camps concentrated attention on the management of that conflict.  In that context preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries was seen as vital to avoid a further complication in the global strategic situation. Energy issues, too, were often seen in strategic terms - energy security and diversity of supply becoming as important, if not more so in many cases, as consideration of economy and environment.  With the passing of the Cold War other issues, especially those clustered around the idea of sustainable development, have surfaced.  Instead of containment we now can look to disarmament; where secrecy once reigned, we now talk of transparency; where economic development was once a supreme military consideration, we now talk of sustainable development; and when once we focused on survival for today we are now asked to think of future generations and the legacy we might leave, for example, through global warming.

<P>
	One basic issue that often influences views on nuclear power and the consequences of nuclear accidents is the assessment of radiation risk.
<P>
<B>Understanding Radiation Risk</B>
<P>
	Radiation risk is not a new issue, but one ripe for review.  If one could attain a better public understanding of radiation risk, perhaps an important barrier might be removed to the acceptance of nuclear applications, including nuclear power.
<P>
	There is solid knowledge about the health hazard caused by exposure to high levels of radiation.  Exposed persons show acute clinical effects and the severity of the effect is directly related to the radiation dose.  In general, however, the doses at which statistical links can be demonstrated in human populations are ten to a hundred times greater than the doses from which we now endeavour to protect people.  The question that is being asked increasingly often is whether there is in reality any increased risk associated with very small increases of radiation doses above the normal natural background levels.  Is the use of a linear, no-threshold model to extrapolate the risks of low dose exposure from the higher-dose observations appropriate?  Or does it lead us to take unnecessary but often expensive protection measures?
<P>
	Neither clinical observation nor epidemiological studies of exposed populations are currently able to answer the question of the effect, if any, of low doses of radiation.  There is a need to look further into the biological mechanisms of cancer induction and attempt to better understand the role of radiation damage in this process.  In the meantime, however, it is clearly prudent to assume that small increases can cause harm.  This, as we know, is the position adopted by the UN organization that assesses radiation effects, UNSCEAR, and followed by the major international body on radiation protection, the ICRP.  In its linear, no-threshold embodiment this attitude is also the basis for the system of radiation protection which underlies the recent international Basic Safety Standards sponsored <I>inter alia</I> by the Agency.
<P>

	However, while professionals in radiation protection understand that we are dealing with a hypothesis justified by prudence, this awareness is lost by the public and to a large extent by the politicians who will focus on the calculated but presumed risk and tend to disregard the low level and hypothetical nature of that risk.  We must note that this focus sometimes has damaging side-effects: the causing of stress and anxiety in people who have received low doses and see the risk as real, the channelling of resources to the prevention of very low doses rather than to other, perhaps much more significant safety areas, and the opposition to the use of many technologies which rely on radiation - including nuclear power and food irradiation.
<P>
	We certainly hope that scientific advances will eventually convincingly tell us what the facts about low-level radiation really are.  However, until then we need to examine carefully how we formulate our positions regarding low doses of radiation.  Although it should be recognized that the linear no-threshold hypothesis has merit as a basis for precautionary action, it should not lead us to absurdly expensive measures.  There is further no doubt that applying it as a predictive formula has given rise to misperceptions of the hazards of low level radiation.  We should therefore re-examine what measures we feel prompted to take as a result of application of the hypothesis and the manner in which it is translated into public information and into regulations.  If we were successful in explaining the appropriate use of the hypothesis, we might perhaps also bring about more reasonable public perceptions about the risks of nuclear power and of consequences of accidents.    

<P>
	In November 1997 the Agency and the WHO are is co-sponsoring a conference in Seville, Spain, on the topic of low level ionizing radiation - biological effects and regulatory control.  It is one in a series of meetings directed at improved understanding of radiation risk.  Two years ago in Paris a conference was held on Radiation and Society and this year a major meeting was convened to provide a better understanding of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident.  We hope these meetings will advance the conceptual thinking needed and thus help to de-demonize the nuclear option.   
<P>
<B>The Military Legacy: Weapon Test Sites, Waste and Safety </B>
<P>
	A second issue I would like to discuss is whether nuclear disarmament will reduce many people's reservations about nuclear power and thus remove some obstacles to a nuclear power revival.  There is no doubt that the large military nuclear activities and problems, e.g. regarding lost weapons, have had an impact on public attitudes.  However, as I mentioned earlier, a number of important changes are occurring in this sphere.  Will these impact on peoples' attitudes?  Let me discuss some of them.  A complete ending of all nuclear weapons testing - demanded by broad public opinions - now seems in sight and I can report to you that the IAEA has become increasingly engaged in assessing whether there are any significant hazardous effects remaining after the tests.
<P>
	It is not surprising that countries which are now independent and which have in their territory former nuclear weapon test sites, ask for an independent audit of the possible remaining radioactivity and for advice on any residual health hazards. Such IAEA assessments have been performed in the last few years in Kazakstan in relation to the Semipalatinsk site, and in the Marshall Islands in relation to the Bikini Atoll.
  <P>
	In the case of the Semipalatinsk test site the IAEA assessed the consequences of over forty years of nuclear weapon testing to determine the current hazards of living in the area.  Of particular concern were the residues of atmospheric and surface tests carried out before 1962.  Some of these tests had been unsuccessful and resulted in the dispersion of plutonium rather than a nuclear explosion.  The review concluded that there is no need for concern among those living in the settlements around the test sites - but  recommended measures to ensure restriction of access to areas with high dose rate, and further systematic studies on plutonium levels and radionuclides in drinking water resources.
<P>
	In the case of the Marshall Islands, the request to the Agency was on the advisability of a return to the Bikini Atoll of the Bikini people.  The Agency established an Advisory Group of experts drawn from a range of countries to review earlier findings about the radiological situation at the Atoll and to provide practical guidance in the event that it was decided to resettle it.  The finding was that if certain precautions were taken, namely reducing caesium uptake by use of potassium fertilizer and covering the surface of the main village area with uncontaminated soil, settlers would be exposed to radiation levels similar to naturally occurring background levels - albeit on the high side of the range.  The decision actually to resettle the Atoll of course remains with the people of the Marshall Islands.

<P>
	A study currently underway under Agency auspices in French Polynesia is different in that the invitation to make it was requested by the country that conducted the tests - France. It is also receiving support in terms of data and funding from the Government of France.  In these circumstances, it was all the more important for the IAEA to form a truly international scientific group under the leadership of former NRC Commissioner, Gail de Planque, to undertake the study.  It will conclude its work by the end of next year. It will be one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind, addressing not only the current radiological situation but reviewing also the long term potential for the release of radionuclides into the environment - an exercise involving assessment of the geological stability of the underground test sites and of the potential pathways and impacts in the event of leaks. Perhaps this openness to external scrutiny by France will be followed by others?  With the apparent end to the age of nuclear weapons testing, it seems appropriate to me that an impartial global organization is entrusted with the task of examining to what extent any hazards still remain.   
	<P>
There are other consequences of the military use of nuclear energy which give the public cause for concern.  As is now clear, the standards of waste management at many military installations have been much lower than those demanded of civil facilities.  You are familiar with the situation in the United States.  In Russia there are considerable problems related to the disposal of the nuclear components of surplus and obsolete submarines.  Some nuclear waste has even been disposed of at sea in breach of widely held standards.  The Agency is conducting studies, jointly with some countries directly interested, into the impacts of past disposal of military wastes in the Kara and Barents Seas, and into the Sea of Japan.  I am glad to tell you that the findings were so far not alarming.
<P>

	The cases which I have cited indicating a certain openness about past military nuclear activities do not, of course, suggest any general abandonment of secrecy in this area.  Security concerns, notably about the risk of proliferation, still keep most military nuclear facilities beyond the reach of international audit.  This seemed to be the reasoning behind confining the recently concluded safety convention to civil nuclear power plants.  The same issue has arisen in the current negotiations in Vienna of a convention on the safe management and disposal of radioactive waste.  Whatever the outcome of those particular negotiations, the public will demand the same health and environmental assurances concerning a facility regardless of whether it is civil or military and regardless of the origin of waste.  And the nuclear image will suffer when high standards are not demanded or followed in the military sphere.  A beginning has been made to satisfy the public's concerns.  However, a complete breaking of the mental link between nuclear power and nuclear weapons can be expected only when we feel that the nuclear weapons era is over.  
<P>
<B>Verification of Disarmament</B>
<P>
	Complete elimination of nuclear weapons is evidently still a distant goal, but so profound is the change in the global political climate that we have begun to think of this situation.  Today we are pleased to note that agreements between the super-powers have provided a framework for dismantling of vast numbers of strategic nuclear weapons and that dismantling nuclear weapons is taking place at high pace.  Future agreements will hopefully continue this process and broaden it to encompass other nuclear-weapon States. Two questions that arise are: first, how is this process of disarmament to be verified?  Second, what will be done with the materials and facilities no longer in military use?  I shall deal first with the verification of disarmament.         
<P>
	The current nuclear disarmament process rests on bilateral verification arrangements but both sides have indicated that they would invite international verification.  More than two years ago the US requested the IAEA to apply safeguards to a quantity of former military nuclear material.  The interest of both the US and Russia in having international verification of such material was confirmed in April this year at the Moscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security.  A further step was taken in a trilateral meeting between the Russian Minister for Atomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, the US Secretary for Energy, Hazel O'Leary and myself during the IAEA's annual General Conference this last September.  At that meeting, steps were agreed for considering the technical, legal and financial aspects of verification by the IAEA of the nuclear material released by disarmament measures.
<P>
  	Such verification is highly desirable.  It could - and should - provide assurance that irrevocable commitments made to dismantle weapons are respected and that none of the weapons plutonium or enriched uranium is going back to the military sector.  Such verification would be different from safeguards presently performed under the so-called voluntary offers made by nuclear-weapon States under the NPT.  Under those offers material submitted to safeguards can be withdrawn.  An arrangement of that kind would not be meaningful for nuclear material resulting from the dismantling of weapons.
 <P>
	Verification of nuclear material from dismantled weapons may be seen as an encouraging first step on a long road to a nuclear-weapon-free world.  As was argued in the recently published report of the so-called Canberra Commission - an Australian initiative involving a wide range of international experts - the road to, and the final achievement of, a nuclear-weapon-free world will require a high degree of confidence in international verification of the absence of and non acquisition of nuclear weapons.  
<P>
	This leads to my next point.  The IAEA is the logical organization to provide future verification services to assure non-military use of nuclear materials. It is a statutory function of the Agency and one in which we already have great experience.  However, we will require new tools and approaches well in time for the new measures.  The work now envisaged in relation to material being released from military use is the necessary starting point for developing these approaches.  
<P>
	While there has been much welcome progress and grounds for optimism in the area of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, there are some reasons for caution over the next steps.  It would be a big step if the apparent present de facto moratorium by the declared nuclear-weapon States on the production of new nuclear material for weapons could be extended and formalized to become a treaty commitment by all States to stop such production.  However, I have to note that at the moment multilateral talks on such a treaty have not begun.  There are also regions in which some States - Israel, India and Pakistan - are not ready to make non-proliferation commitments, because they do not see the degree of detente they consider necessary.  It is probable that the current type of comprehensive safeguards would not suffice in these regions.  A combination of bilateral and multilateral verification might be needed. 
<P>
	Thus, future international verification poses new technical, conceptual, legal and resource  issues.  For instance, the shape and quality of the nuclear material from dismantled weapons are considered sensitive.  How is the verification to be arranged if inspectors cannot check the quality?  Such technical questions are among the issues to be examined in the framework of trilateral discussions now starting between the Agency, Russia and the US.  Among other questions to be considered is that of the scope of the verification.  Is it meaningful to seek a reliable account of every kilo of plutonium declared transferred from the military sector, when a State is known still to have tons of Pu not transferred?  If not, what is the appropriate scope and level of ambition of the verification?  And if it were concluded that a somewhat more limited verification should be performed in order to reduce cost, what would be the reaction of other States which are obliged to have rigorous safeguards on Pu?
<P>
<B>Fuel Cycles of the future: Management of PU and HEU</B>
<P>
	Let me now turn to another area which is of significance to the profile of nuclear power and in which Argonne has played a unique role: that of developing advanced fuel cycle technologies - keeping in mind the issues of economy, safety and assurance against misuse.  This last aspect - assurance against misuse - was the major theme of the famous International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation - INFCE - conducted in the late 1970s.  I need only cite the term "plutonium economy" to show that the matter remains of interest.  While the Agency is confident that it can apply safeguards adequately to current and planned nuclear fuel cycles it is also true that some technologies require more safeguards work than others.  Fortunately this point is being increasingly understood and the Agency is now frequently consulted at an early stage of the design of nuclear installations so that safeguards requirements can be taken into account.
  <P>
	The development of lower enriched fuels which might replace HEU as the preferred fuel for reactors for  research and isotope production has been one practical challenge of the last decade.  We learnt last year that Iraq had plans to use the highly enriched research reactor fuel under safeguards for a crash weapons programme.  Evidently if the fuel had been low enriched, the temptation would not have existed.
<P>
	The concern about risks in using plutonium have led countries employing plutonium in their fuel cycle to work on ways in which they could at least enhance the transparency of that use.  How much can be done beyond comprehensive safeguards is yet unclear.  
<P>
	Safeguards may be said to constitute a confidence-creating openness to neighbours and to the world through verification performance by outsiders - the IAEA.  Such openness can also be achieved directly through the use of multinational fuel cycle facilities, multinational fuel cycles and bilateral co-operation in research and development.  There are well known examples in Eurodiff and Urenco.  Such approaches could be further developed in the future, and so could the idea of regional facilities.  In sensitive areas like the Middle East or East Asia this could offer sensible contributions to security and perhaps also to economy and safety.   
<P>
	An issue of great topicality is what to do with the quantities of HEU and plutonium which are becoming available from dismantled weapons.  How best to use these materials in ways that would eliminate the possibility of their re-use in weapons?  The options have been well canvassed and there will certainly be some turning of swords into ploughshares - or, in more modern parlance, some turning of Megatons into Megawatts.  As you know, the US is committed to blend down some 600 tons of HEU to the necessary level.  For plutonium several approaches are being considered.  For plutonium from dismantled weapons, the inter-governmental discussion of options is now taking place in the context of the declaration of the Moscow Summit - most recently just last week at a conference hosted by France and including IAEA participation.  The Agency for its part is to host a major symposium in June 1997 to assess the different fuel cycle strategies with particular reference to the production, use and disposal of plutonium.    
<P>
<B>The Immediate Task: Strengthening International Verification   </B>
<P>
	Let me now return to an issue which is of immediate interest for confidence that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful purposes:  the strengthening of the safeguards system of the IAEA.  Since the discovery of Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme the IAEA has been engaged in an effort to achieve this.  The system as it was operated since the early 1970's focussed on assurance that States are not diverting nuclear material in declared installations from civil to military use.  By the 1990 NPT Review Conference there were calls for some rethinking on the adequacy of this approach.  With the Iraq affair came the political will to ensure that the system could also provide assurance that States do not have any non-declared nuclear activities in contravention of their non-proliferation commitments.
<P>
	A first part of the IAEA programme for the strengthening of safeguards is now being implemented and for the most part this is proving to be without major difficulty.  One of the key measures being employed is the use of analysis of environmental samples to shed light on past nuclear activities so as to confirm - or not to confirm - the consistency between the activities reported by the State and the evidence so obtained.  It was indeed the results of sample analysis that led to questions being raised about the quantity of plutonium produced in the DPRK.
<P>
	The second part of the effort to strengthen safeguards is based on proposals expanding the legal basis under which safeguards are conducted.  It is now being discussed by a Committee of the Agency's Board of Governors - the aim is greater access to facilities by inspectors, access to more information on nuclear activities and use of modern techniques.  While all agree in principle to the effort of strengthening of safeguards, the devil sits in the details.  Despite extensive trials of the new approaches which suggested that they should not be unduly burdensome, the current negotiations have to deal with several concerns:  one is confidentiality - that is the extent to which the Agency can be relied on to protect the confidentiality of information provided to it under safeguards.  Another is so-called universality - the extent to which States which have not accepted comprehensive safeguards  - notably the P-5 and India, Pakistan and Israel - should accept the additional obligations now discussed.  Success in the present efforts will create greater confidence - albeit not 100% - that States stay away from the nuclear weapons which they have renounced.  Such success will also raise hopes that a high degree of effectiveness could be attained in the verification of nuclear disarmament.  This is not to profess belief in the prospect of any early elimination of nuclear weapons.  My personal view is that such elimination will require much more advanced international institutions than we now have in the UN System.  
<P>
	I conclude:  the revival of the nuclear power option is needed to help an energy hungry world to get electricity and heat without endangering environment and climate.  The cost of the nuclear option is such that it will not cause us to regret using it, even if global warming were to turn out not to be a risk.  Nuclear power is a "no-regret" solution.  However, many factors affect the acceptability of this option.  I have tried to touch today on some of these factors that, though important, are not so much in the limelight.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Mr. President,
<P>
	It is an honour for me, on the occasion of the submission of the Annual Report of the IAEA for 1995, to address the General Assembly and give an up-to-date account of the activities and concerns which engage the IAEA.
<P>
	One hundred years ago the French Professor, Henri Becquerel, discovered radioactivity.  Some fifty years later - at the end of the Second World War - two nuclear bombs were launched over Japan demonstrating the destructive power of nuclear energy.  Ten years later the peaceful potential of nuclear energy came to the fore at the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy at Geneva.  Much of the secrecy which had surrounded nuclear science during and after the War was lifted, which led to widespread optimism about the potential benefits of the various uses of nuclear energy.
<P>

	Since then a nervous world has watched the belligerent atom during some 2000 nuclear weapons' tests and a nuclear armaments race.  In the same period there has  been  rapid development and deployment of the beneficial uses of nuclear energy to generate electricity, to combat cancer and help diagnostics, to improve food production and to measure and reduce pollution - to mention but a few uses.
<P>
	Throughout this period the IAEA has served Member States by helping to compile nuclear-relevant data, to disseminate knowledge and know-how about peaceful uses of nuclear energy, to draft common radiation protection and other safety standards and to verify that nuclear material under international safeguards is used only for peaceful purposes.
<P>
	Over time the work of the Agency has both expanded and changed considerably.  Governmental involvement in the promotion of nuclear science has given way somewhat to emphasis on regulatory work in the fields of safe use of nuclear installations and safe disposal of nuclear waste.  A similar change of emphasis has occurred also in the IAEA.  While some of the provisions of the IAEA Statute concerning ownership and operation of nuclear installations, e.g. for the storage of plutonium, may have been overambitious and remain unused so far, the rule of the Non-Proliferation Treaty obliging parties to submit all their present and future nuclear activities to IAEA safeguards has resulted in a sizeable verification activity of growing importance.  Development co-operation, based both on the IAEA Statute and called for under the NPT, has similarly become a large activity.  However, UNDP financing which was once a large source of funding for the IAEA technical cooperation has now become a minor source.  Moreover, the orientation of programmes has shifted somewhat from basic nuclear science and technology to projects with more direct impact on sustainable development - increased food production, identification of water resources, eradication of insect pests, development of new plant mutants, etc.
<P>

	As the world changes and the problems facing governments change, intergovernmental organizations, which are their joint tools, must also change.  Moreover, unforeseen events influence the agendas of governments and this is reflected also in the agenda of the IAEA.  Suffice it to mention the names Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, Iraq and the DPRK, Semipalatinsk and Mururoa, to evoke the growing engagement of the IAEA in the fields of nuclear safety, safeguards verification and assessment of the radiological situation at nuclear weapons test sites.
<P>
	Change is occurring also in the methods and techniques used by the IAEA to fulfil its functions.  Information compiled by the Agency from Member States, e.g. on the operation of nuclear installations, is now processed electronically and often made available on line not only to Member Governments but to all interested parties.  To take an example, INIS, or the International Nuclear Information System, is a truly international bibliography of material published in the nuclear field.  It is available on line.  I might further mention that although meetings of the Agency's Board of Governors are closed and the records restricted, under a recent decision practically all Board documentation older than two years is declassified and will soon be available to all on line.  In addition, a home page on the Internet now offers a wealth of information about the Agency and its current work.  In the safeguards field, the control of nuclear material is being made more effective and efficient by the use of remote monitoring and automatic transmission of data.  Another innovation is a direct line between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and myself to ensure rapid communication in case of a crisis.  The Agency has also indicated its readiness to have a televised link to the Security Council to enable the Council to be briefed at any time without delay.  So far the need has not been felt for this but a practice of informal briefings for the Council is developing thus ensuring close liaison between the nuclear inspection arm of the UN System and the enforcement organ.
<P>
	It is possible that continuous change and adaptation have been made easier within the IAEA by the practice of the Agency of rotating most professional staff.  Long-term serving staff are most valuable for stability, experience and institutional memory, but for flexibility in programming, for awareness of current problems in the field and their possible solutions and for innovation, a steady inflow and outflow of professional staff has proved helpful in the case of the IAEA.
<P>
	There is no lack of new challenges in the nuclear sphere and Member Governments would want the organization to respond to many of these.  The problem is that the zero real growth policy, combined with the difficulty of abandoning existing essential programmes and of making sufficient resources available through economies, limits what can be tackled.  Many new tasks, e.g. measures countering illicit trafficking in nuclear materials or ad hoc projects concerning nuclear safety and waste are, in fact, handled in large measure on the basis of extrabudgetary voluntary contributions.  This is not satisfactory but far better than inaction.
<P>
	Let me now turn to some of the challenges currently facing the IAEA.
<P>

<B>Energy and the Environment</B>
<P>
	  With the nuclear arms race over, a number of nuclear arms control or disarmament treaties have been concluded or are in the making.  I shall soon address the verification tasks which this may place on the IAEA, but at this point I would like to pose the important question whether putting the evil genie of the belligerent atom back into the bottle will contribute to a more general acceptance of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in particular exploitation of the potential for the generation of electricity and heat.  It is too early to know the answer, but it is not too early to recognize its importance.
<P>
	Among the vital issues facing the world is the risk of global warming caused by excessive emissions of some gases, linked in large measure to energy use, notably carbon dioxide and methane.  The Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed at the Rio Conference in 1992,  did not specify how the risk is to be met.  While the UN System has at its disposal a    group of prominent scientific experts in climatology - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - which examines the problems, probability and causes of climate change, the system does not have any single organization providing impartial expert data and analysis of different sources of energy.  As a result some of the energy scenarios designed by the IPCC, in response to the risk of global warming, are questioned by outside energy experts.
<P>
	At the IAEA the goal of sustainable development is fully accepted and it has been considered important that <I>all</I> energy sources be impartially and scientifically analysed for their impact upon life, health and the environment, including climate.  For this reason co-operation has been sought with several other international organizations in a joint project - named DECADES - dealing with electricity generation.  The project develops methods and software through which individual countries are able to assess and compare the health and environmental impact - as well as cost - of different ways of generating electricity, taking into account the full cycle - e.g. from the extraction of fuel to the disposal of waste.  Not surprisingly, these analyses show that the fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas, in this order - are at the top of the scale of energy sources contributing greenhouse gases - particularly carbon dioxide - while nuclear power and renewable sources of energy contribute the least greenhouse gases emissions.  These findings are entirely consistent with the experience reported by Mr. Priddle, the Head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) of the OECD, at the Second Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Geneva last summer, namely that, I quote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

	"nuclear power accounted for the greater part of the lowering of the carbon intensity of the energy economies of the OECD countries."
</BLOCKQUOTE>


	There should now be a general awareness among governments that an expanded use of nuclear power and of renewable sources of energy together with conservation measures could significantly help to restrain greenhouse gas emissions.  Regrettably, this has not yet led to common conclusions at the global level.  A few governments - in Japan, the Republic of Korea, China and in Eastern Europe - expressly refer to environmental concerns in explaining their expanded use of nuclear power.  However, at present most countries are continuing to expand their use of fossil fuels and are failing to meet the targets which they have set for themselves to restrain their emissions of greenhouse gases.  There is a regrettable gap between the rhetoric of restraint and the reality of growing greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
	The reason why nuclear power expansion is not very actively discussed by most governments - despite its significant potential as a response to the risk of global warming - lies in the controversy which surrounds this source of energy in many industrial countries.  Although nuclear arms control and disarmament will eliminate one past common concern, others remain - notably regarding safety in nuclear power operation and safety in nuclear waste disposal and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  The IAEA is actively engaged in all these subjects.
<P>



<B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
	The accident at Chernobyl in 1986 had very serious consequences for human health and the environment and a major negative impact on the further expansion of nuclear power.  This makes it all the more important that all the lessons be drawn that can be drawn from this tragic event.  On the tenth anniversary of the accident the IAEA, the World Health Organization and the European Commission co-sponsored an international conference last April to "sum up" the results of the various assessments made and specialized meetings held on the consequences of the accident.  It attracted the participation of over eight hundred experts from 71 countries and concluded with a remarkable degree of consensus.  Among the conclusions was a confirmation of a significant increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer among children born before and within some months after the accident.  No increase in any other form of cancer has been identified.  The social and psychological consequences of the accident combined with the consequences of the political and economic changes have been severe.  At the technical level renewed attention must be paid to the "sarcophagus" around the destroyed reactor.  The question of the closure of the whole Chernobyl plant needs also to be conclusively settled.
<P>
<B>Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit</B>
<P>
	A Summit of eight States on Nuclear Safety and Security was held in Moscow on 19-20 April this year resulting <I>inter alia</I> in recognition of the importance of nuclear power as an energy source which is consistent with the goal of sustainable development and in commitments to an international nuclear safety culture as well as to strengthening the IAEA safeguards system.  Needless to say, this attention at the highest levels to nuclear matters is of great importance as guidance both to those working in the nuclear sphere and to the general public.
<P>
<B>Conventions Relevant to Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
	Last week on United Nations day, 24 October, the IAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety entered into force.  While recognizing that national authorities have the responsibility for supervising the safety of nuclear power plants, this Convention lays down a number of basic principles which must be respected.  It also provides a procedure under which the parties are obliged to submit reports on the safety of nuclear power plants on their territory and accept review of these reports by other States.
<P>
	In the coming year three new legal instruments relevant to safety are expected to be finalized.  A new convention will contain basic rules concerning the safe management, including disposal, of radioactive waste.  Like the Convention on Nuclear Safety it will oblige parties to submit periodic reports on implementation and to accept review of them by States parties.  Other instruments will bring about a revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and an arrangement for supplementary funding.
<P>
	The development of conventions and other legal instruments and standards, together with a variety of international services and assistance programmes and heightened national attention to nuclear safety, help to establish the international nuclear safety culture to which the participants in the Moscow Summit committed themselves.  Results of the efforts to strengthen nuclear safety can be seen in the reduced number of unplanned stoppages in nuclear power plants around the world.
<P>


<B>Non-Power Applications of Nuclear Techniques</B>
<P>
	Before I move on to discuss the IAEA's various tasks relating to the belligerent atom I must touch briefly on the Agency's work to disseminate nuclear techniques to developing countries.  I referred in my introduction to the changes that have occurred in the IAEA's programme of development co-operation and in particular the shift in emphasis from basic research to projects which promote sustainable development and benefit the end user - e.g. the cancer patient or the farmer.  I am pleased to report also that by raising the level of ambition and through better management it has been possible to reach record high levels of programme delivery.  Let me  give but two examples of projects, both in Africa.
<P>
	Water resources management is essential for sustainable development and isotope hydrology techniques have unique capabilities to trace and map water resources so that best use can be made of them.  Within a major regional project in Africa the IAEA is helping to apply these techniques.  For instance, the Moyale region in South Ethiopia, covering 45 000 km2, which has three million inhabitants and one of the largest cattle herds on the continent, depends entirely on scarce groundwater resources.  Isotopic data have now made it possible to distinguish between renewable and non-renewable water resources, leading to better estimates of the total sustainable capacity for meeting water requirements in this region.
<P>
	The other example which I want to mention relates to the use of radiation in the eradication of some insect pests that affect food production and health.  The sterilization of certain insects, like the Mediterranean fruit fly and the tse tse fly, and the release of large quantities of sterile males makes it possible, after campaigns with conventional means, to actually eradicate an insect pest.  Thus, through a major effort by the IAEA and the FAO a few years ago, the new world screwworm was eradicated in Libya.  Right now the focus is on a very promising project to eradicate the tse tse fly from Zanzibar in Tanzania, thereby permitting better cattle rearing on the island.  The aim is complete eradication before the end of 1997.  The expected successful outcome is likely to stimulate similar projects in some larger sites in Africa.
<P>
<B>IAEA Verification of Arms Control and Disarmament Agreements</B>
<P>
	I turn now to the growing role of the IAEA to help prevent a further spread of nuclear weapons and to verify nuclear arms control and disarmament agreements.
<P>
	The most important event in this field during the past year was undoubtedly the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the convention prohibiting all nuclear weapons tests.  Although there was considerable discussion during the negotiations in Geneva about the possible financial and other advantages of using the IAEA to run the verification activities under the CTBT and to provide the Secretariat, the solution eventually adopted was a small separate organization to be located in Vienna.  At this juncture it is difficult to know whether simple co-location, welcome as it is, will offer much by way of synergy.  While there is some uncertainty about the formal entry into force of the CTBT, it is worth noting that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT are already obliged under the NPT not only to refrain from nuclear weapons tests, but also from preparing for such tests and the IAEA has the duty to verify in these States that these obligations are respected.
<P>



<B>Comprehensive Safeguards</B>
<P>
	The dominant verification task of the IAEA consists in the operation of comprehensive safeguards under the NPT and nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties.  The 180 non-nuclear-weapon States now party to the NPT have committed themselves to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA.  I regret to report that, despite periodic reminders, over 50 of these States have yet to do so.
<P>
	Treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones are increasing in number and play an important role consolidating commitments to non-proliferation on a regional basis and providing specific supplementary arrangements and undertakings responding to needs of the particular region.  All rely on the IAEA for verification.  The Tlatelolco Treaty for the Latin American and Caribbean region will hopefully enter into force for its entire zone of application during the next year.
<P>
	The Pelindaba Treaty, signed in Cairo last April - and establishing a Nuclear-Weapon- Free-Zone for Africa - goes further than the NPT.  For example, it prohibits any armed attacks against nuclear installations.
<P>
	Similarly, the South East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty, signed in Bangkok last December, goes beyond non-proliferation and deals also with issues of nuclear trade, nuclear safety and radioactive waste.
<P>
	A nuclear-weapon-free zone for the Middle East has been on the agenda of the United Nations and of the IAEA for a number of years.  The General Conference of the IAEA has requested me to consult with countries in the region concerning the verification issues linked to such a zone.  From my many discussions in the region I conclude that existing comprehensive safeguards, alone, will not suffice as means of verification.  Most likely some combination of international and regional or bilateral arrangements will have to be worked out.  I have been requested to convene a second workshop on these verification issues in 1997 and I shall do so.
<P>
	The Agency's verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations under Security Council resolutions has, since August 1994, involved more than 600 inspections, the majority of which were conducted without prior notice.  These inspections, plus the analysis of the vast amount of documentation handed over to the IAEA and UNSCOM after the departure of the late Lt. General Hussein Kamel Hassan Al-Majid and the follow-up of procurement transactions, are part of the assessment of Iraq's re-issued "full, final and complete declaration" of its former nuclear weapons programme.  The carrying out of joint IAEA-UNSCOM multi-disciplinary inspections at weapons capable sites contributes to the effectiveness of the ongoing monitoring and verification programme for the detection of any attempt by Iraq to conduct activities proscribed by the Security Council resolutions.
<P>
	In the case of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the information and access provided to us have been and remain insufficient for a comprehensive picture of the nuclear programme and questions remain about the completeness of the initial declaration of nuclear activities.  Although present verification arrangements give confidence that nuclear installations subjected to a freeze under the Agreed Framework between the United States and the DPRK, are actually frozen, confidence about the DPRK's compliance with its non-proliferation commitments under the NPT can only come about through more information and full implementation of the safeguards agreement.
<P>
  	A considerable strengthening of NPT-type safeguards became acceptable and was, indeed, demanded by most governments after the discovery of clandestine nuclear weapons activities in Iraq.  In particular, greater assurance was sought about the absence of non-declared nuclear material and activities related to such material.  It was clear that such assurances could only be obtained by giving the IAEA access to more information, by allowing inspectors greater access to relevant sites and by the introduction of new techniques, such as the analysis of environmental samples.
<P>
	Many of the measures contemplated have been introduced under the authority given to the Agency under existing comprehensive safeguards agreements.  For the introduction of measures which may go beyond the authority given in these agreements, an additional draft protocol has been worked out by the Secretariat and is now the subject of discussion in a Committee under the Board of Governors.  Most of the measures now discussed have been tried out in several industrialized States without great problems for the Agency or the State concerned.  Although these measures will in the long run bring efficiency gains and be cost neutral, it is inevitable that they will also add some burden and inconvenience to the inspected party.  Regrettably, as we all know from our experience of controls at airports, security against possible violations by a few requires some inconveniencing of many.
<P>

	One of the objections currently raised to the proposed strengthened safeguards system is that it unfairly exempts nuclear-weapon States from measures which are seen as burdensome by some of the non-nuclear-weapon States required to accept them.  As disarmament progresses such inequality of burden should diminish.  Verification in States which still have nuclear weapons obviously cannot aim at establishing the absence of nuclear weapons - which is the purpose of the strengthened safeguards system!  However, verification in nuclear-weapon States could aim at providing assurance that fissionable material from dismantled weapons does not go into new weapons and that a "cut-off" agreement prohibiting the production of plutonium or highly enriched uranium for weapons use is respected.
<P>
	A "cut-off" agreement remains to be negotiated.  Meanwhile the United States and Russia are, in fact, dismantling nuclear weapons and the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit last April endorsed the idea of IAEA verification that material from dismantled weapons and other military stocks remain in peaceful storage or use.  The IAEA is, in fact, already safeguarding some such material in the United States and Russia appears willing to accept similar inspections in due course.  At a recent trilateral meeting of the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, the US Secretary of Energy and myself on the occasion of the IAEA General Conference, it was agreed jointly to explore technical, safeguards-related and financial issues which are connected with such verification.  It is my hope that we are here witnessing the first steps toward verification of nuclear disarmament.

<P>
	One final word of caution is needed after this optimistic note:  even with a keen eye on efficiency, the management of multilateral nuclear co-operation including verification of arms control and disarmament, requires resources - well-qualified personnel, state of the art equipment, etc.  Without adequate funding such personnel cannot be recruited or retained and the purchase of advanced cost-effective equipment would be curtailed.
<P>
	In concluding let me express appreciation to the Government of Austria for its continued support to UN system organizations in Vienna.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
	The title of this Conference - "Nuclear Future: Pacific Basin Challenges for Sustainable Development" - contains three terms which, I am sure, will become more and more important as we move into the 21st century:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	Pacific Basin;
<P>
<DD>-	Nuclear;
<P>
<DD>-	Sustainable Development.
</DL>
<P>
	First, the old eurocentric notion, "Far East", is fading and our minds are turning to the "Pacific Basin", connoting a vast area, rich and diverse in culture, endowed with large natural and human resources, and undergoing dynamic growth and change.  The automobile was invented and developed in the West but Asian cars now have one of the largest shares of the world market.  And while the United States and Europe once championed nuclear power, it is in the Western rim of the Pacific that nuclear power is now making great strides.
<P>
	Second, <I>nuclear power</I> is now generating about 17% of the world's electricity - a little less than all the world's hydropower.  It is helping several countries in this energy hungry region to avoid having all their energy eggs in the fossil basket.  The countries of North East Asia - Japan, Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan (China) - should be complimented for championing extremely forward-looking nuclear programmes, which are no doubt stimulating thinking in the region as a whole.  Let us hope that the rationality of this approach will be maintained and that the region's steadfast espousing of the latest nuclear power technology will provoke some fresh thinking in other regions of the world.
<P>
	Third, by <I>sustainable development</I> - now an internationally accepted goal - we understand a development which utilizes our natural resources to raise standards of living but which does not jeopardize the wellbeing and possibilities of future generations.  For instance, we should exploit the riches of the sea but not deplete fisheries.
<P>
	The call for "sustainable development" is a justified result of our increasing awareness  that in many fields of activity we have, in fact, pursued development which is anything but sustainable.  It is by now generally understood that current patterns and trends in the world's energy use are not sustainable.  The gigantic scale on which we use fossil fuels involves the burning up, at a very fast pace, of resources created during millions of years.  Moreover, in this process, through imprudence, we have caused much damage to forest, land and water and we are realizing that the release into the atmosphere of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and methane at current rates may change the world's climate.  Hence the call for restraint in the emissions particularly of CO<SUB>2</SUB> through restraint in the use of fossil fuels.
<P>

	While this conclusion is rather generally accepted, there is very little agreement on <I>how</I> the restraint is to be achieved.  Western industrialized States might perhaps suggest that all countries should freeze their CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions at current levels.  Populous developing countries might perhaps then counter by suggesting a licence for CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions per capita ...  The stage seems set for a global debate between those who already consume a lot of energy and those who expect to increase their use dramatically.  This is especially likely if recent estimates that CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, far from stagnating, can be expected to be 30% higher in 2010 than in 1990. (Trilateral commission, International Herald Tribune, 1996-09-13).
<P>
	There is an understanding that more efficient generation and use of energy is desirable and that solar and wind power and biomass energy should be further developed.  But this will not take us very far.  A big question which many recognize, but few if any governments publicly discuss, is whether a strong expansion of nuclear power should be part of a global sustainable energy policy.  At the second session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Mr. Priddle, Executive Director of the IEA in Paris, although not addressing the question directly, pointed to past experience and reminded participants that, I quote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
		"nuclear power accounted for the greater part of the lowering of carbon intensity of the energy economies of the OECD countries over the last 25 years."
</BLOCKQUOTE>


	This being the experience of the past, why are we not building on it for the future?  In this regard let me cite the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from its Second Assessment Report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
		"Nuclear energy could replace baseload fossil fuel electricity generation in many parts of the world if generally acceptable responses can be found to concerns such as reactor safety, radioactive waste transport and disposal, and nuclear proliferation."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is not apparent that this statement by an international panel of distinguished climatologists is based on any impartial study of the seriousness of the questions which are enumerated.  It is nevertheless clear that the matters they seem to accept as "problems" are, indeed, perceived as problems by a great many people and do prevent wider political acceptance of nuclear power in many countries.  Let me therefore briefly examine these matters and discuss whether they merit being viewed as obstacles to a greater use of nuclear power in a global sustainable energy use.  I shall begin with the concern over the risk of proliferation.
<P>
<B>Non-Proliferation</B>
<P>
	It is probably true that some people's attitude to nuclear power is negatively influenced by associations to nuclear bombs.  This association is understandable but not very rational.  Nuclear bombs and nuclear power are not Siamese twins.  There is no inescapable link between the two.  Gasoline can be used in napalm bombs but we do not refrain from using it for controlled explosions to power our cars.  Just because uranium and plutonium can be used in weapons we should not refrain from using these fuels for our benefit to generate electricity or heat.
<P>
	It speaks well for the rational long-term thinking of the host country of this Conference, Japan, that despite being subjected to nuclear attack and devastation, it has succeeded in being in the front line of the development and use of the peaceful atom.
 <P>
	As the world is now moving out of the nuclear weapons era I think associations to these weapons will have less and less influence on the public's attitude to nuclear power.  It remains important, however, both for our security and for our attitudes to the use of nuclear power that the dismantling of nuclear weapons is real and permanent and that all nuclear installations declared for peaceful use are kept that way.  Fortunately, with the end of the Cold War, the incentive for the development of nuclear weapons is decreasing almost everywhere and the incentive to nuclear disarmament is strong.

<P>
	The US and Russia are now dismantling nuclear weapons at a fast pace and they are ready to ask the IAEA to verify that the released nuclear material will not go into new weapons.  In 1995 the Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which some 170 countries in the world promise not to acquire nuclear weapons, was given an unlimited extension.  Recently a Complete Test Ban Treaty was voted into existence and, despite some impediments, negotiations are likely to start on a treaty prohibiting the production of Pu and HEU for weapons purposes - a cut-off treaty.  If we add to this list new treaties on nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa and South East Asia, we can conclude that the evil genie is moving back into the bottle.  This is good news for the world and good news for peaceful nuclear power.  However, to have confidence, we must feel sure that the agreed nuclear arms control and disarmament measures are really implemented.  For this there must be effective verification.
<P>
	After the discovery that Iraq, despite being a party to the NPT, was developing a capacity to enrich uranium and to build a nuclear weapon, and after the discovery through advanced IAEA safeguards techniques that the DPRK had not declared all its Pu, efforts have accelerated to strengthen the safeguards system of the IAEA.  The main new features, now being discussed between governments in Vienna, are requirements for more information and for providing inspectors greater access to installations. The aim of these measures is to make the nuclear activities in States more transparent and comprehensible to the IAEA inspectorate which has the responsibility to make evaluations about the States' activities from the non-proliferation point of view.
<P>

	The aim of these strengthening efforts have wide support.  However, some governments  - and industries - are concerned about the greater amount of data they will have to compile and present and about opening up to inspection installations which may have commercial or technical secrets.  We hope that these qualms will be overcome.  Some States, which accepted the proposed measures on a trial basis, did not find them unduly onerous or cumbersome.  The IAEA Secretariat certainly wants a strengthened system, but it, too, wants a system which is not too cumbersome to operate.  We are convinced that confidentiality, which has not been violated in the past, will not be compromised in the future.  We trust that the nuclear industry and research institutions will co-operate.  After all, without the confidence that can come from effective safeguards, nuclear trade and the transfer of nuclear technology will suffer.
<P>
	There are many more things that countries can do to ensure non-proliferation - apart from facilitating verification.  Export controls of sensitive equipment and technology is one.  Regional arrangements for some fuel cycle activities, notably enrichment and reprocessing, may be yet another.  Such arrangements might give States within a region assurances through mutual transparency.  The models of URENCO and Eurodiff come to mind.
<P>
	If regional fuel cycle activities might sometimes be of interest to achieve increased mutual confidence and, perhaps, economy, it is not invariably true that regional safeguards verification would offer advantages.  In those nuclear-weapon-free zones which have been agreed to until now - in Latin America, Africa as well as in South East Asia and the South Pacific - the parties have chosen to rely primarily on IAEA safeguards, which most of them have to accept anyway as parties to the NPT.  The cases of Euratom and ABACC (Argentina-Brazil) might seem to point in a different direction.  It must be remembered, however, that the regional safeguards system under those two arrangements came into being before comprehensive IAEA safeguards had been accepted.  The international community has not so far accepted regional safeguards as a substitute for international ones.  It is conceivable, however, that in some situations, e.g. the Middle East, internationally operated NPT safeguards might be <I>supplemented</I> by regional safeguards arrangements - perhaps allowing for challenge inspections.
<P>

	I turn now to <I>nuclear safety</I>.
<P>
	We know that the risk of death is much higher if you go by car than if you fly - whether you count the risk per kilometer travelled or per trip made.  Yet most people are more afraid of flying.  Similarly, an audience of nuclear experts knows that - even if the Chernobyl accident is taken into account - the number of fatalities resulting from accidents in the civilian use of nuclear power is low - say per gigawatt - compared to the deaths resulting from electricity generation by coal or gas.  Yet, the public at large is much more fearful of the small risk of a big nuclear accident than the risk of gas explosions.
<P>
	Factors such as the risk of radioactive contamination beyond a plant and the alien and invisible threat of radiation surely play a role in creating this attitude.  It is not likely to change except perhaps over time with schooling making radiation as familiar a phenomenon to the next generation as electronics are to our teenagers.
<P>
	The conclusion I draw is not that it is meaningless to try to explain risk to the public.  On the contrary this must be done much more than today to help create a psychological and political climate in which we spend resources to reduce risks that are significant realities rather than perceived fears.  Nevertheless, we must probably recognize that only prolonged civilian nuclear power operation without any accidents releasing radioactivity into the environment anywhere will dispel the resistance to the use of nuclear power that we find in some parts of the public all over the world.
<P>
	To achieve this, nuclear power simply has to set its safety goals much higher than any other technologies for energy generation do - and this on a global basis.  This is doable.  We may even claim today that a <I>global nuclear safety culture has come into existence</I> and is asserting itself.  The results can be seen in fewer unplanned stoppages at nuclear power plants, higher availability and lower radiation doses to plant personnel.
<P>
	In the sphere of nuclear safety, too, there is room for some useful efforts on a regional basis to address specific regional needs and circumstances.  Training, for example, might be undertaken regionally - perhaps with economic gains.  I note that the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) is working primarily on a regional basis - with great success.  Nevertheless, we must not lose the global perspective.  We know that "an accident anywhere is an accident everywhere" and there are still some shortcomings in the world in the field of nuclear safety resulting from the regional isolation of nuclear activities in the sphere of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
	The safety culture of nuclear power - like that of aviation - must be global.  Basic norms of this culture now exist, first of all in the shape of the IAEA Convention on Nuclear Safety, which will enter into force on 24 October and which will require of all parties that they observe certain basic standards, that they report on safety matters and that they submit to peer review.  There are, secondly, the non-binding but recommendatory IAEA <I>nuclear safety standards</I> (NUSS) which began to emerge many years ago.  These standards are kept up to date through the incorporation of the experience of the whole nuclear world.  While national authorities are solely responsible for the maintenance of nuclear safety, they can seek guidance and support in the standards to which all IAEA members using nuclear power have contributed their experience.
<P>
	A <I>third</I> element consists in <I>services</I> by international nuclear safety experts.  Certainly some such advisory services could be rendered on a regional - or even bilateral - basis.  Nevertheless the possibility of drawing on the expertise around the whole world remains valuable.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks on nuclear safety by reporting to you that after several years work an important element of the international legal infrastructure related to safety is expected to emerge in modernized shape in the coming year, namely the rules about responsibility in case of nuclear damage, i.e. rules about liability.  Victims of nuclear damage should be entitled to due compensation, wherever the accident.  This may now be ensured.
<P>
	Let me now comment on the subject of <I>nuclear waste</I>.  An article appeared recently in the International Herald Tribune (1996-09-17) where the columnist, having studied a report on the world's increasing reliance on fossil fuel, concluded that nuclear power should be "de-demonized" and that it could emerge as the cleanest and most efficient energy source of the 21st century, provided that, I quote, "the problem of radioactive waste can be solved".  It is common belief that we don't know what to do with nuclear waste and I suspect that revelations about the severe problems which exist regarding military nuclear waste add to peoples' scepticism.
<P>
	It is true, of course, that the issue of long lived radioactive waste is unsolved in the sense that we cannot concretely study the eventual results of our disposal measures.  That opportunity lies thousands of years down the road.  I think that the public, on reflection, will not fault the nuclear community for not doing this.  However, this community might be faulted for not having explained more effectively to the public the technical concepts and plans which do exist and which are fairly similar all over the world for the disposal of long lived waste.  It was several years ago that an inquiry made under the OECD concluded that such disposal could be safely achieved.
<P>
	It also needs to be brought home to the public that because the volume of nuclear high level waste is so small it can be taken care of in its entirety and be isolated deep down in the earth with minuscule risk compared to the risks we run with the huge amounts of fossil fuels wastes which are released into the atmosphere.
<P>
	The methods and concepts which exist today for nuclear waste disposal may be further developed and improved and we may even one day see innovative techniques like the transmutation of wastes.  There is no reason, however, to doubt the world's technical ability to take care already today of the nuclear waste which it generates.  Within the IAEA, governments are now engaged in drafting a convention on the basic safety requirements which must be placed on all such waste disposal.  The same basic norms must evidently be observed all over the world and we may wish to see countries reporting in an international forum on the measures they take  - with peer review, as in the field of nuclear safety.
  <P>
	Let me also say that it seems to be currently politically correct thinking to hold that each country must dispose of all its nuclear waste.  Such thinking is not based on any rational ground.  Of course, a country generating nuclear waste, whether in hospitals or in power plants, must responsibly take care of this waste if no other country would be willing - against payment - to arrange the disposal.  However, opponents of nuclear power seem to be succeeding in demonizing nuclear waste to such a degree that the very thought of receiving waste from another country would be sinful.  We should not allow ourselves to be snared by such thinking.  If a country has built good and safe facilities for the disposal of nuclear waste - whether low, medium or high level - and has the technical competence to manage such facilities, it is hard to see any rational reason why it should not earn some money on its investment and skill.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power Expansion as Part of a Sustainable Global Energy Mix</B>
<P>
	If the questions which have been raised regarding non-proliferation, nuclear safety and nuclear waste are found, upon analysis, not to be justified grounds for leaving nuclear power <I>outside</I> the discussion of a sustainable global energy policy - as regrettably is now largely the case - what would be the benefits of <I>including</I> consideration of an expanded use of nuclear power?
<P>
	The <I>first benefit</I> evidently is that nuclear power releases hardly any emissions to the world's atmosphere:  no CO<SUB>2</SUB>, no SO<SUB>2</SUB>and no NO<SUB>x</SUB>.  Hence, it does not contribute to acid rains or global warming, the very problems which result from the present accelerated use of fossil fuels and which make excessive reliance on them unsustainable.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> equivalent emission factors for the entire nuclear fuel chain - i.e. from uranium mining to waste disposal - range from 10-50 g/kWh or about the same as for energy generated by wind power.  The comparable factors for fossil fuel chains range from 450 to 1200 g/kWh.
<P>
	Within an IAEA programme called DECADES a number of case studies have been made, comparing <I>inter alia</I> carbon emissions of various electricity generation technologies.  A study made regarding Japan shows carbon emissions between 2.5 and 5 grams per kWh of electricity generated by nuclear power and 6 grams for hydro power - compared with 140 to 180 g for gas fired plants.
<P>
	The <I>second benefit</I> in an expanded reliance on nuclear power lies in the cost.  Fossil fuels overwhelmingly dominate in the global energy use, one obvious reason being that they are cheap and convenient.  For the foreseeable future it will not be economically feasible to substitute much fossil fuel with solar, or wind power or biomass.  These energy sources, which must be welcomed and developed as much as possible, may make valuable contributions in specific circumstances but will be marginal in relation to expanding baseload energy needs.  Nuclear generation of electricity has become more expensive and - depending upon discount rate and other factors - is not invariably the cheapest option.  Nevertheless, on the whole one can say that the cost of coal and nuclear generated electricity are of roughly the same order.  Certainly it would be justified to maintain that expanding nuclear power in order to restrain the reliance on fossil fuels would constitute a <I>no regret solution</I>, to counter the risk of global warming.  By this I mean that even if it were to turn out - contrary to present dominant expert opinion - that the threat of global warming was not real, we would have no reason to regret having expanded reliance on nuclear power rather than fossil fuel.  Since this source of power is economically competitive, we would not have lost any money on the investment.  Had we invested in solar or wind power to replace fossil fuels, we would have incurred a great additional expense which we would regret if the feared global warming turned out not to be real.
<P>
	The conclusion that is ever more visible to all those who are willing to look is that nuclear power has a greater potential to restrain greenhouse gas emissions than any other commercially proven generating technology.
<P>
	It is remarkable that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), although recognizing the past contributions of nuclear power and leaving open the option of a role for nuclear power to help reduce further increases in greenhouse gas emissions, focusses on other scenarios to respond to the threat of global warming.
<P>
	The potential use of nuclear energy is great and diversified.  At present, about 30% of the world's primary energy consumption is used for electricity generation, about 15% is used for transportation and the remaining 55% is converted into hot water, steam and heat.  The potential market for applications of nuclear energy in the non-electric energy sector may be quite large.  Such applications may include desalination of water for drinking, hot water for district heating and heat energy for petroleum refining.  An important milestone in the development of high-temperature nuclear process heat was reached in May 1991 with the start of construction of the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) at the Oarai Research Establishment of the Japanese Atomic Energy Institute.  This reactor will be the first nuclear reactor in the world to be connected to a high-temperature process heat utilization system.
<P>
	Russia has used nuclear propelled ice-breakers with excellent results over a long time in the most demanding Arctic conditions.  Why should it be out of the question to propel large cargo ships by nuclear power when ice-breakers, aircraft carriers and submarines rely on nuclear reactors?
<P>
	My conclusion is that it is important for future sustainable development that public opinion and governments realize that the nuclear contribution to the global energy mix need to be and can be vastly expanded.

</CENTER>

<OL>
<B><LI>
Introduction</B>
<P>
I am grateful for the opportunity to address this Conference on Emerging Nuclear
Energy Systems.
<P>
It is very fitting to discuss emerging nuclear energy systems here in Obninsk, where
the world's first nuclear power reactor was built and where so much research is
pursued.  I am often struck by the great versatility which has characterized and still
characterizes the Russian nuclear world.  Only Russia has built large nuclear reactors
for ice-breakers, for desalination of water and for district heating.  And it has built
so many different types of reactors - light water reactors, channel type reactors and
fast reactors, space nuclear reactors such as TOPAZ, heavy metal cooled reactors and
others.  There is a rich and varied experience in Russia from which new nuclear
energy systems may emerge.  The world at large should benefit from this experience,
just as Russia stands to benefit from the nuclear experience of other countries in the
new world without frontiers.
<P>
The IAEA is an important focal point where the experience of different countries is
reported and shared, and where solutions are sought to many common problems for
the current and the emerging nuclear energy systems of the world.  I shall try briefly
to describe both the problems facing nuclear power in today's world and the potential
expanded future use of nuclear power which I see as well as the role of the IAEA.
<P>
On the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, let me only make the
following comments:  With the end of the Cold War, rapid nuclear disarmament and
near universal adherence to non-proliferation, we can reasonably expect that nuclear
energy will be increasingly associated in the public's mind with beneficial uses rather
than with weapons.  A good deal of work remains, however, in this process.  Nuclear
disarmament must continue and accelerate.  Agreement on a complete ban on the
testing of nuclear weapons is expected this year.  It should be followed without delay
by negotiations of a prohibition of the production of fissionable material for weapons
- a cut-off.  Further nuclear disarmament will facilitate universal adherence to non-
proliferation.  And the cases of Iraq and DPRK have convinced governments that
they must strengthen the safeguards system of the IAEA to give it greater capacity
to detect - and deter - any secret nuclear development.  Confidence in the nuclear
sphere requires effective international verification.  It also requires joint efforts against
the trafficking in nuclear material, equipment and technology - to prevent any
possible nuclear terrorism and radiation hazards to the public.
<P>
I shall now discuss the future of nuclear power for peaceful uses.  I see it as mainly
influenced by the following factors:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>1.    The safety in the operation of nuclear power plants and in the disposal
of nuclear waste - and the public's perception of this safety;
<P>
<DD>2.    The future demand for energy, especially electricity;
<P>
<DD>3.    The economic competitiveness of nuclear power;
<P>
<DD>4.    The environmental competitiveness of nuclear power;
<P>
<DD>5.    The interest of countries to diversify their energy sources and to obtain
a measure of energy independence.
</DL>
<P>
The future demand for energy must be the starting point of any discussion of
emerging energy systems.  I shall therefore begin with some data on this matter.
<P>
<B><LI>Future Prospects for Energy and Electricity</B>
<P>
There is general agreement that energy use will increase very significantly,
especially in developing countries, where the population increase will be great and
present energy use is low.  Demand for electricity will grow particularly fast - again
with most of the growth taking place in the developing world.  Annual electricity use
in Bangladesh and Tanzania is less than 100 kWh/per person.   In Sweden it is about
15 000 kWh.  From 1960 to 1990, the share of electricity in the global energy
consumption has grown from 17 to 30% and the annual use of electricity per capita
has almost tripled - from 765 to 2225 kWh per person.  Even so two billion people
in the world still do not have access to electricity in their homes.  According to the
World Energy Council, the global use of electricity can be expected to increase by 50
to 75% by the year 2020.
<P>
Today, the burning of coal, oil and gas provides about 63% of the world's
electricity.  Hydro power follows with 19.5%, nuclear with about 17% and geothermal
with about 0.5%.  Contributions from other sources such as solar, wind and bio-mass
are not now significant  - less than 0.1% altogether.  Despite welcome improvements
in the economy of these renewable sources, they are not expected to become
economically competitive and capable of providing a significant part of the world's
energy and electricity needs within the next few decades.  An important factor today
and in the future is energy conservation.  Demand management and greater efficiency
in the generation and use of energy are employed as means to reduce the need for
new generating facilities.  Nevertheless, on a world-wide basis, construction of many
new power generating facilities will be needed.  What energy systems will emerge
and on what basis will the choices be made?
<P>
<B><LI>The IAEA DECADES Programme</B>
<P>
In the past the choice of energy option was easy:  the cheapest energy was the
best energy.  Today, comparisons between different options for energy and electricity
generation require the weighing of <I>all</I> costs, not only economic, but also
health and environmental impacts of energy production and use.  In addition, other
factors, like energy independence, capital intensity and public opinion, often must be
considered.  In many countries this choice is so politically difficult that governments
tend to avoid it or, at least, delay it.
<P>
The IAEA has a long tradition of analysing and planning energy and electricity
systems.  This analysis used to focus on the direct economic cost.  With more factors
now being relevant, the Agency has in recent years developed a full energy chain
analysis, that permits comparison of fuel and energy choices - their costs and their
impacts on health and environment - from resource extraction to final use.  In a field
that is sometimes emotionally charged it is important to be able to make such
objective comparisons between different options.  Our programme - DECADES -
which was developed in co-operation with several other international organizations,
provides Member States with a methodology - software, extensive databases and
guidance - to enable them to compare possible fuel and plant choices and their
impacts.  The users can see which energy options are most immune to fuel price
increases, taxes on CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions, etc.   
<P>
Applying this tool for objective comparisons, we find in many situations that
nuclear power is both an economically viable and environmentally friendly source
of energy.  This does not guarantee that it is selected, however.
<P>  
<B><LI>What is the Current Status of Nuclear Power Deployment in the
World?</B>
<P>
There was a rapid expansion of nuclear power through the 1970s.  With the
Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the less than expected increase in demand of
electricity in the 1980s and the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the expansion rate of
nuclear power has slowed markedly.  By the end of 1995, 437 nuclear power units
were in operation in 30 countries in the world and Taiwan (China).  Another 39 units
were under construction.
<P>

While nuclear power construction has been stagnating in the Western
industrialized world, the growth of nuclear power in East and South Asia has
continued.  China has brought three reactors in operation in the last four years and
initiated an ambitious nuclear program, which will increase the installed nuclear
capacity from 1% to 6% of the total installed capacity.  Japan has brought eight
nuclear reactors in operation since 1991.  In the Republic of Korea, the nuclear power
development programme accelerates - with five plants under construction.  According
to the long-term power plan of the Republic of Korea, another 18 nuclear units will
be added by 2006.  India s programme continues with ten operating nuclear power
plants and four units under construction.  Pakistan has one plant in operation and
started the construction of another plant in 1993.
<P>
These figures should not, however, conceal the reality that the use of fossil
fuelled energy - both for electricity generation and other purposes - has expanded
even more.  According to the International Energy Agency of the OECD, gas is the
fastest growing fossil fuel.  Its use is expected to increase by 55% in absolute terms
from 1992 to 2010.  In the same time period the annual coal production is also
expected to increase dramatically.
<P>
While some countries are thus expanding their nuclear power capacity rapidly,
a few governments are decided opponents of nuclear power.  Most have a wait-and-
see attitude.  Nuclear power has become more expensive due to many new safety
features that have been required and fossil fuels have remained inexpensive.  The
chief objections to its wider use are not economic, however.  The most important
factors are safety in reactor operation and waste disposal.  Nuclear power will not
become an important emerging energy system unless safety in operation and waste
disposal is convincing and the public perceives it to be so.
<P>
<B><LI>IAEA Activities in Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
The Summit held in Moscow last April expressed the determination of that
meeting to ensure nuclear safety everywhere - in power plants, in the storing and
transport of nuclear material and in the prevention of weapons proliferation and
trafficking in nuclear material.  The declaration of Moscow refers repeatedly to the
activities of the IAEA as the Agency is one of the most important mechanisms for co-
operation among the States of the world in the field of nuclear safety.  The Agency
may be said broadly to aim at creating a <I>global nuclear safety culture</I> through
the adoption of binding conventions, the elaboration of recommended standards, the
provision of advisory services and the exchange of experience and information.  It is
not alone in this endeavour.  Operators, collaborating within the World Association
of Nuclear Operators (WANO), and regulators pull in the same direction - toward a
global nuclear safety culture, which will ensure <I>inter alia</I> that there are no
significant radioactive releases into the environment from power reactors, waste
disposal installations or other nuclear facilities. 
<P>
<B>Legally Binding International Agreements</B>
<P>
A fundamental component of the emerging global nuclear safety culture is a
number of legally binding conventions concluded under IAEA auspices.  The Vienna
Convention on Civil Liability dates back to the 1960s.  A new convention on liability
has been under negotiation within the IAEA for several years and is expected to be
ready within a year.  The Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was
developed in the late 1970s.  It is still relevant - not least to the problem of
trafficking.  In 1986, in the months after the Chernobyl accident, the Convention on
Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the
Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency were drawn up in record
time.  The Convention on Nuclear Safety, the latest addition to this basic nuclear law
infrastructure, is expected to enter into force this year.  Twenty two States have now
ratified it.  Russia is in the process of doing so.  The adoption of this Convention in
1994 was an important event.  It requires States parties to fulfil a number of
obligations relating to regulation, management and operation of nuclear power.  A
central provision calls for peer review at meetings held at least every three years of
national reports demonstrating fulfilment of the various obligations.
<P>
A Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management is presently
under negotiation and a draft may be ready for adoption early in 1997.  As with the
Convention on Nuclear Safety, basic requirements are laid down and it is envisaged
that national reports will be submitted and be subject to international peer
examination; countries would also report on their inventories of radioactive waste
and undertake to deal with any existing unsatisfactory waste situations.  A question
that is still open is to what extent nuclear waste from the military sector is to be
covered by the Convention.
<P>  
<B>Non-binding Common Safety Standards</B>
<P>  
Even with several international conventions in operation, nuclear and radiation
safety remains first and foremost a national responsibility.  However, this does not
preclude the international formulation of <I>harmonized</I> safety approaches. Safety
standards, recommendatory in nature, have been a principal mechanism for achieving
the desired harmonization and they form an important second component of the
global nuclear safety culture.  Let me mention three examples.
<P>
At the end of 1994 the new International Basic Safety Standards (BSS) for
Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources were
adopted after many years work.  They form the basis for many national regulations. 
The IAEA's Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) programme has resulted in some 60
non-binding standards and supporting guides dealing with the principal aspects of
nuclear power safety - from the siting to the operation of plants.  The NUSS
documents are the basis for a number of national laws and regulations.
<P>
The first document in a comprehensive series of Radioactive Waste Safety
Standards (RADWASS) was issued late in 1995.  The series will address the important
question of radioactive residues from past activities.
<P>
<B>Review and Advisory Services</B>
<P>
The provision of peer review and advisory services by international experts -
the third component of the international nuclear safety culture - has proved
important to enable national operators and regulators to draw on the nuclear safety
experience available worldwide.  Among the services of the IAEA are missions by
Operational Safety Review Teams (OSART), providing plant operators with
recommendations and suggestions for strengthening safety performance but also
identifying good practices that might be usefully followed by others.  Teams for the
Assessment of Safety Significant Events (ASSET) have been much used for
comprehensive investigations of incidents in the operation of nuclear power plants.
<P>
I might mention that international expert review teams have visited all 15 sites
which have Soviet-designed nuclear power units in the countries of Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
<P>
<B>Sharing of Information on Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
The sharing of safety relevant information is the fourth component of a global
nuclear safety culture.  The correct understanding and assessment of nuclear
accidents and incidents is an important part of experience sharing and learning from
each other.  International meetings provide fora for such exchanges.
<P>
Let me mention in this context the large and important international
conference entitled <I><A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl/">"One decade after
Chernobyl:  summing up the consequences of the
accident"</A></I> that was held in April in Vienna.  It was co-sponsored by the IAEA,
the
World Health Organization and the European Commission.  It covered not only the
health consequences, but also the environmental, social, economic and political
impacts of the accident, the remedial measures taken after the accident and the safety
of the containment structure surrounding the destroyed reactor.  Against the
background of the public and political debate that still rages 10 years after the
accident and the widely diverging views expressed in that debate, it was gratifying
that this conference of over 1000 experts from many different specialities agreed on
so many things.  It was concluded that the most significant radiation-induced health
effect of the accident was an increase in thyroid cancer among children affected by
fallout from the initial radioactive cloud.  It was also concluded that there have been
no measurable increases so far in the incidence of leukaemia or other blood disorders
and that, except for significant stress-related symptoms, the primary indicators of
health are similar in contaminated and uncontaminated areas.
<P>
<B><LI>Safe Disposal of Nuclear Waste</B>
<P>
I turn now to nuclear waste.  That all nuclear waste - civilian and military -
is safely managed and disposed of and is so perceived by the public is the second
most important requirement for the future of nuclear power.  This, too, must form
part of a global nuclear safety culture.  As I have noted, an IAEA convention on the
safe management of nuclear waste and spent fuel is expected to be ready within a
year and many non-binding international standards already exist to guide national
authorities.  As to services and exchange of experience in this field, let me mention
an interesting scheme under which a number of countries - e.g. Norway, Sweden,
Finland, the US and Japan - now co-operate with Russia on the development of waste
disposal arrangements - with the IAEA providing secretariat and co-ordination
services.
<P>
For the future the concept of regional repositories for nuclear waste may be
useful to some countries with small nuclear programmes and limited waste
quantities.  Although at present governments and the public everywhere stress the
responsibility of each State itself to manage and dispose of all the nuclear waste it
generates, there is no good reason why States should not be free in the future to pool
some resources and establish regional repositories.  I find it gratifying that President
Yeltsin highlighted this idea in his speech at the Moscow Nuclear Summit on 20 April
this year.
<P>
<B><LI>Advanced Reactor Development</B>
<P>
The future of nuclear power will be positively affected by the development of
new, safer and more efficient types of reactors.  By the end of 1995, some 7700
reactor-years of operating experience had been accumulated with the current nuclear
energy systems.  New generations of nuclear power plants have been, or are being
developed, building upon this experience.  The advanced designs generally take full
account of all modern safety concepts.  They allow operators more time to perform
safety actions, and they will provide even more protection against any possible
releases of radioactivity to the environment.  Attention is also paid to making new
plants simpler to operate, inspect, maintain and repair.
<P>
I shall not describe the evolutionary and developmental designs which are or
will soon become available.  But let me say a few words about the fast reactors.
<P>
Liquid metal-cooled fast reactors (LMFRs) have been under development and
use for many years in a number of countries.  The successful design, construction and
operation of plants, such as the BN-600 in Russia, the 1200 MWe Superphenix in
France, the BN-350 reactor in Kazakhstan and the Monju reactor in Japan, have
provided a great deal of experience.
<P>
The fast breeder reactors can extract sixty times as much energy from uranium
as thermal reactors do.  This capability is not very important today, but may become
indispensable in the longer term, if the use of nuclear power were to  increase
substantially and uranium were to become more expensive.  Fast reactors could also
be used to burn plutonium and to reduce the time required for isolation of high-level
radioactive waste by burning long-lived transuranic radioisotopes.  The further
development of fast reactors presently focuses on improving plant safety and
economy, on improving fuel burnup and fuel recycling technology to reduce the
amounts of radioactive waste.
<P>
The IAEA pursues a number of international technical programmes and
projects in the field of advanced reactor development.  They focus on enhanced
safety, increased reliability, improved economic efficiency and public understanding. 
They are co-ordinated by three international working groups:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     one for Fast Reactors;   
<P>
<DD>-     one for Gas-Cooled Reactors; and             
<P>
<DD>-     one for Advanced Technologies for Water Cooled Reactors.
</DL>
<P>
The groups meet periodically to discuss and exchange experiences from the national
level and identify areas of possible co-operation.
<P>
<B><LI>The Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Management</B>
<P>
The future of nuclear power will be influenced by options chosen relating to
the fuel cycle.  Important circumstances have changed since the time when the
complete fuel cycle was the dominant choice.  For instance:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     The use of nuclear power having grown more slowly than expected, the
needs for uranium and for fuel cycle services are now less than
foreseen;
<P>
<DD>-     With the end of the cold war large amounts of fissile materials from
dismantled weapons and military stocks may be brought on the market;
<P>
<DD>-     Despite a stagnation in the number of nuclear power plants constructed
in most industrialized countries, the volume of spent fuel and the
volumes of accumulated plutonium are continuously growing.
</DL>
<P>
Apart from these factors, decommissioning of reactors and fuel cycle facilities will be
another major issue because many reactors will reach the end of their operating life
early in the next century.  New strategies have to be developed to face these new
realities. Many questions arise.  Is spent fuel to be reprocessed to recycle plutonium
and the remaining uranium, or not?  If so, in what types of reactors?  Is long-term
storage a viable strategy?  What actions may be taken to reduce plutonium
stockpiles?
<P>
The back-end of the fuel cycle is again becoming a major issue and the IAEA
serves as a forum in which Member States discuss the strategic options. A
symposium on "Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Reactor Strategy" will be held in June 1997.
The focus will be on plutonium and the objective is to provide decision makers with
a reliable presentation of the various possible medium- and long-term strategies. 
Other activities of the Agency in the field of spent fuel management relate to interim
storage.  One of the new realities is that interim storage will have to last longer than
originally anticipated practically whatever the selected option, resulting in problems
of storage space and of materials behaviour.  Through co-ordinated research
programmes the Agency receives results from the whole world on the behaviour of
such materials, in particular in terms of corrosion, in a variety of physical and
chemical conditions. 
<P>
<B><LI>The Versatility of Nuclear Power</B>
<P>
A general revival of nuclear power may occur if the public becomes convinced
that safety in power reactors and waste disposal installations are at high levels and
that an expansion of nuclear power is environmentally preferable to a further
expansion of the only realistic short and medium term alternative - the increased
burning of fossil fuels.  In such a situation it may be realized that more nuclear
generated electricity could provide power not only for domestic and industrial use
but may be used also for environmentally friendly transportation - electric trains,
subways, trolley-buses, perhaps cars and even large sea transports.  It is hard to see
why only submarines, aircraft carriers and ice-breakers should be nuclear propelled.
<P>
Nuclear power could also be of use to produce heat and steam for industry
and district heating.  Considering the severe shortages of fresh water that are
expected in many areas of the world - including coastal areas - nuclear power might
also become an important means for the desalination of sea water.  Among many
IAEA members there is a growing interest in this topic.  At present, only a few
nuclear plants are used for non-electric applications.  Yet, only about 30% of the
world's primary energy consumption is currently used for electricity generation,
about 15% is used for transportation and the remaining 55% is converted into hot
water, steam and heat.
<P>
The limited volume of fuel it uses and the wastes it leaves may also give
nuclear reactors an advantage in inaccessible locations, requiring energy.  Satellites
is only one example.
<P>
<B><LI>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The future role of nuclear power must be assessed in the context of the
expected growing electricity demand and the increasing awareness of globally
important environmental issues.  Ensuring a  sustainable electricity supply world-
wide will require the development of different energy systems adapted to the
resource base and the economic situation of various regions.  The cost of nuclear
power will differ from country to country and will be influenced by the price of fossil
fuels and by the cost of capital.  For nuclear power to be competitive, it is essential
that nuclear projects be well managed during construction and operation.  The
economics of nuclear power may be further improved by the design of nuclear power
plants that are simpler, easier and cheaper to construct.  Standardization and
modularization are means to achieve this.
<P>
An effective transfer of science and technology and international co-operation
are important to promote a further expansion of nuclear power.  International
organizations, scientific and engineering associations, universities and research centres
have an important role in these regards.
<P>
To conclude:  Nuclear power, which has demonstrated excellent technical and
economic performance in many countries, could play an important role in energy
policies aiming towards sustainability.  By being practically emission free, nuclear
power plants help to reduce the risk of global climate change and to alleviate many
other environmental burdens.  While nuclear power alone will not suffice to reconcile
the need for a growing energy supply and the need for environmental protection, it
is one of the most promising elements of sustainable development in the field of
energy.

Trypanosomosis

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Inauguration of Insectary III at the Tsetse and
Trypanosomosis
Research Institute, Tanga, Tanzania</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International
Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>1 May 1996</H4>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
It is a pleasure for me to participate with all of you today in
the
inauguration ceremony for
another insectary of the tsetse mass-rearing facility in Tanga,
the first of
this size in the
African continent.  One may wonder why we need to make such a big
effort to
increase the
population of tsetse flies as we all know that they are harmful
to cattle and
to human beings. 
In fact, only male tsetse flies are the produce of these
insectaries.  They
are then rendered
sterile, that is, unable to reproduce, using gamma radiation from
Cobalt 60 or
Caesium 137
sources, and released in areas infested by the wild male and
female tsetse
flies.  The
population of the pest will decrease after a while of releases,
until it is
extinguished if more
sterile insects are released in the infested areas.  This
technique to
suppress harmful flies is
what we call the Sterile Insect Technique or, in short, SIT.  In
principle, it
is an effective
<I>birth control of insect pests</I>.
<P>
     The technique depends on nuclear energy in two respects. 
Firstly, each
sterile male
released has been treated by gamma radiation.  Secondly, the
blood required in
the rearing
factories for feeding tsetse flies must be decontaminated by the
same gamma
radiation, but at
a different dose.  That is the reason why the International
Atomic Energy
Agency, through
the application of ionizing radiation, is involved, together with
FAO, in
projects in the
agricultural sector for pest control and eradication.
<P>
     Over the years, tsetse and trypanosomosis management has
depended on two
major
components:  trypanocidal drugs for treating livestock, and
conventional
tsetse control using
insecticide techniques.  However, all available conventional
methods have
their specific
deficiencies.    Trypanocidal drugs are very expensive and
increasing
resistance of the blood
parasite to the drugs is a major concern.  The aerial spraying of
insecticides
used in the early
days was very harmful to the environment and was replaced by a
combination of
insecticide
impregnated targets placed in the fields and pour-on insecticide
on livestock. 
These tsetse
control methods are largely based on rural community
participation.  However,
due to the
lack of adequate logistics, sufficient financial means, strong
support from
government
organizations, and continuous efforts by the community, the
problem quickly
reverts to its
old dimensions even if the fly population is reduced for a
certain time.
<P>
     We contend that in several areas in Africa, tsetse
eradication, through
the additional
use of SIT, is technically feasible, economically justifiable and
sustainable. 
In principle,
conventional methods are most efficient at very high insect pest
population
densities.  SIT is
most effective when tsetse populations are low because the
success of this
technique is
determined by the ratio of released sterile to native fertile
males.  If
conventional
community-based tsetse control methods are used first to
sufficiently reduce
the fly population in a region, and then SIT is applied, we can
guarantee high efficiency throughout
the entire suppression/eradication campaign.
<P>
     Over the past decade, the IAEA and FAO have substantially
contributed to successful pest insect control or eradication
campaigns in many developed and developing countries. 
Everybody here will still recall the eradication of the New World
Screwworm
fly from
Northern Africa.  I would also like to bring to your attention
that in
December last year, the
Chilean Government declared the country free from Mediterranean
Fruitfly (also
called
Medfly); the result of another IAEA/FAO supported SIT campaign.  
<P>
     Government agencies and the private sector are appreciating
more and more
the
environmental and economic advantages of using SIT for fruitfly
control or
eradication.  In
several areas of the world, grower associations are becoming
increasingly
interested in the
Sterile Insect Technique as it is less expensive than other
control methods
and it enables the
production of high quality fruit which is free of pesticide
residues.
<P>
     In response to the increased demand for sterile fruit flies
in SIT
campaigns, there are
already 13 fruitfly factories producing sterile males all over
the world.  A
factory in
Guatemala has been selling 200 million sterile flies per week for
releases in
the Los Angeles
basin in California, and has used some of the profit to erect
another and much
larger medfly
production factory.  As a result of the use of SIT packages
(sterile flies and
aerial releases),
no wild Medflies were detected throughout the release area in the
Los Angeles
basin during
the past two years.
<P>
     According to a recently published Environmental Monitoring
Handbook for
Tsetse
Control Operations, "The only tsetse control method known which
has no side
effects on
non-target organisms, is the SIT".  The environmental advantages
of the SIT
are accepted
worldwide. In fact, in the Los Angeles basin Medfly SIT campaign,
environmentalists
demonstrated in favour of expanding SIT releases to other areas
that were
still treated with
insecticides.  This has been one of the rare occasions where
environmentalists
have
demonstrated in favour of a nuclear technique!!
<P>
     The IAEA is a partner in the concerted international effort
to alleviate
one of the
major problems of sub-Saharan Africa, the tsetse transmitted
trypanosomosis. 
Tsetse quite
rightly has been called "Africa's bane".  Tsetse and
trypanosomosis are the
factors that
separate livestock keeping from farming in many areas with high
agricultural
potential in
sub-Saharan Africa. It seriously affects existing agricultural
systems and, in
spite of the
enormous demographic pressure to utilize arable land,
trypanosomosis prevents
the
establishment of sustainable mixed smallholder farming systems. 
The
elimination of this
pest would enable families to rear healthy cattle for producing
meat, milk,
manure and,
particularly, for draught power, with which a family could grow
food crops on
areas at least
20 times larger than the land farmed without cattle.
<P>  
     In order to efficiently use the Sterile Insect Technique
against tsetse,
we want to
make available all the expertise gained, and methods developed
during the past
decades,
from Screwworm and Medfly SIT operations.  The farmers in African
countries 
should also
benefit from the success of SIT packages.  Here at the Tsetse and
Trypanosomosis Research
Institute in Tanga (TTRI), using the refurbished insectaries and
new equipment
provided by
the IAEA through a Zanzibar Government IFAD loan and other
donors, the well
trained and
dedicated team of technicians and scientists has managed to
increase the
tsetse colony here to
a new world record level of more than 600,000 female flies.  I
have been
informed by our
experts that because the southern part of Unguja Island is being
flooded with
more than
50,000 sterile males per week reared in Tanga, the wild target
tsetse
population barely has a
chance to survive.
<P>
     The progress made at Tanga and on Unguja has received
considerable
attention by
other African countries.  IAEA has recently been approached by
three Member
States
inquiring about the possible use of the SIT package in their
national efforts
of tsetse and
trypanosomosis control.  For the future implementation of these
projects in
the sub-region,
TTRI may very well be one of the sterile male production
facilities to supply
the necessary
sterile flies.
<P>
     However, in order to be able to contribute to larger
projects on the
African continent,
many more flies need to be produced, and at a lower cost.  This
can be
achieved through
efforts undertaken in the field of tsetse rearing automation. The
aim is to
standardize quality
sensitive aspects of tsetse mass production and to establish
modular tsetse
factories
comparable to existing Medfly and Screwworm factories.  
<P>
     I would like to congratulate you for the outstanding
progress achieved so
far with the
Tsetse Eradication Project on Zanzibar.  Tanzanians are becoming
leaders in
Africa in SIT
for the eradication of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis.  The IAEA
is proud of
having
contributed to this centre of excellence for tsetse production,
particularly
as the TTRI is now
in a position to serve also as the major training site for tsetse
SIT in
Africa.  The IAEA
counts on the scientific staff of the Institute to assist the
FAO/IAEA
programme as experts
on tsetse rearing in other African countries.  I encourage the
Government to
ensure that this
facility is maintained in good operational condition and that the
staff are
able to assist other
possible projects in Mainland Tanzania and in other countries.  
<P>
     I want to encourage you to keep working hard to further
improve this
nuclear
technique and to make good use of it for the development of
sustainable
agricultural systems
for the people in Tanzania and for other tsetse affected
countries.
<P>
     The substantial improvements of agricultural systems in
Tanzania is
within your reach
and I wish you good luck for all the future tasks and challenges.

Energy</H3>

<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Kingston, Jamaica, 25 April 1996
<P>
<I>IAEA/OPANAL Seminar on IAEA Safeguards:  Verifying Compliance 
with Non-Proliferation Commitments</I>
</H4>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
Not all of you may be fully familiar with the International
Atomic Energy Agency, so let me begin with a quick sketch.  I
will then describe some of our activities in channeling technical
assistance to developing nations, particularly in this part of
the world.  Then, I intend to talk about the generation of
electricity by nuclear power, and I will conclude with an
overview of non-proliferation issues and the IAEA s safeguards
system before inviting your questions.
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency was created in the UN
family in
1957 with a dual mandate:  to promote the peaceful uses of
nuclear energy and
to verify States' undertakings not to divert nuclear materials
for military
purposes.  These remain the twin pillars of the Agency's
activities today,
although they have widened to encompass practically the full
spectrum of
nuclear issues, including nuclear safety. The Agency - a
Secretariat in Vienna
interacting with the 123 Member States - is at pains to ensure
nevertheless
that the necessary and appropriate balance is maintained.
<P>
For our developing Member States the ability to access nuclear
know-how,
training and equipment is an important reason for their
involvement with and
support for the Agency.  At the same time, preventing the spread
of nuclear
weapons has been and remains a very prominent item on the
international
political agenda and has confronted the IAEA with significant
challenges, some
of which I will touch on later.
<P>
Our role in non-proliferation is relatively high profile, and
will be the
dominant theme of this Seminar.  There has been less attention
paid in the
media or the world at large to our technical assistance
programmes.
<P>
Yet there are many development problems which can be - and are
being -
alleviated by nuclear means.  Let me name three:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- Food production and preservation.  Irradiation induced
mutants can
bring higher yields; irradiation of food could reduce spoilage;
<P>
<DD>- Human health.  Nuclear techniques can help both in
diagnosis and
treatment;
<P>
<DD>- Access to water.  Nuclear techniques can be used to find
and trace
it underground and to monitor pollution. 
<P>
It is issues like these that I want to discuss at the outset.
</DL>
<P><B>ARCAL</B>
<P>
Let me focus on activities in the Latin American/Caribbean
region.  Many
of the IAEA activities in this region are organized within the
framework of
the Regional Co-operative Arrangements for the Promotion of
Nuclear Science
and Technology in Latin America (ARCAL).  This programme
seeks to
promote regional co-operation and integration in the nuclear
field and to
solve common technological problems throughout Latin America and
the
Caribbean.  Many countries represented in this Seminar
participate actively in
the implementation of the ARCAL Programme, which is now entering
phase III. 
IAEA, in an advisory role, has worked with a number of your
countries in such
areas as radiation protection and application of nuclear
techniques in
medicine, agriculture, stock breeding, food, hydrology and the
study of
renewable energy sources.  Some of your co-operative
accomplishments include:  
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     Development of a scientific infrastructure for the
application of
nuclear and related  techniques in nutrition and health;
<P>
<DD>-     Introduction of methods for diagnosing animal diseases
as well as
          improvement in livestock management;
<P>
<DD>-     Introduction of radiation-induced plant mutation
breeding techniques
to produce more resistant types of rice, barley and wheat with
higher
yields;  
<P>
<DD>-     Initiation of a detection and diagnosis system for
newborn infants
which can determine hypothyroidism so that timely treatment may
be given;    
<P>
<DD>-     Training of thousands of professionals and technicians
who can
increase the effectiveness of many aspects of nuclear programmes;

and
<P>
<DD>-     Recycling, modification and modernization of old but
valuable
equipment like gamma cameras which are widely used in medical
diagnosis. 
Reconditioned cameras are donated to Latin American and Caribbean
countries.  New, they cost around $300,000 per camera.       
</DL>
<P>
<B>Nuclear Reactor - Jamaica</B>
<P>
Back in 1981, through an IAEA extrabudgetary contribution from
the USA,
the Centre for Nuclear Sciences here in Jamaica received funding
to establish
facilities for a 20 KW  Slowpoke  reactor which was commissioned
and tested at
the University of the West Indies. The Centre has been playing a
major role in
the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy ever since.  I
want to
extend my congratulations to the Centre for its selection as a
Centre of
Excellence in 1995.  This Centre has initiated a personnel
radiation
monitoring programme which is operating successfully, and is
providing a
dosimetry service to both public and private sectors. 
<P>
<B>Health & Industry</B>
<P>
In the health area let me mention a regional programme for the
diagnosis
of Hepatitis B infection by simple, inexpensive but reliable
nuclear detection
methods.         
<P>
The importance of this effort is reflected in the fact that 5% of
the world s
population is affected by this infection and it is the chief
cause of
cirrhosis and liver cancer.  In developing countries the
incidence of the
infection is as high as 30% with literally millions of affected
persons. 
Finding and using an inexpensive way of diagnosis is required to
prevent the
spread of the disease.
<P>
In <I>industry</I> there is an interesting project for the
application of
nuclear technology to make fine measurements and ensure process
control, so as
to increase quality and lower costs.
<P>
Evidence is conclusive that investment in <I>nutrition</I> is
fundamental
to improving human welfare.  Improvement in a country s
nutritional status
also helps reduce poverty through simply making workers more
productive.
<P>
Knowledge of the nutritional status of populations is the
foundation for
initiating improvements in a country s nutrition level and
prevention and
treatment programmes are now getting underway in many countries. 
However,
these programmes often lack adequate monitoring and evaluation
measures.  The
IAEA assists by providing nuclear techniques as tools for
assessing human
needs and the impact of remedial programmes. As an example, let
me describe
Peru's Model Nutrition Project.  The goal of the project is
improvement of
child health through combatting malnutrition.   
<P>
Peru decided to attack its nutritional problems.  During the
first phase
of the IAEA Model Project in Peru, the Government is providing
and delivering
540,000 breakfasts daily, over four years, to undernourished
school children
in six regions of Peru.  About the same number of lunches will be
served to
pre-school children.  The IAEA has provided equipment, supplies
and nuclear
techniques to assess the programme's impact. IAEA scientists will
then transfer resulting information to the Government of Peru,
the food industry and donor agencies so they can improve overall
strategies for alleviating malnutrition.
<P>
The nuclear technology involves use of tracer isotopes.  The
tracers used in nutrition are non-radioactive and can be
administered safely to humans, including women and children. 
They can be swallowed or injected.  Analysis is then done through
sampling of body fluids.  Such nuclear techniques enable precise
measurement of nutritional factors. The isotopes are amazing in
their ability to trace foods or nutrients in the body.  They can
also measure the body's reserves of nutrients and even the amount
of energy a person uses.
<P>
In a second phase of the Peru Model Project the Government of
Peru will provide nutritious food supplements, made from local
ingredients, to sustain the improvements made in the Phase I
feeding programmes. 
<P>
Other countries are closely watching this Model Project, and the
IAEA's  co-operative nutritional activities have gained
substantial positive attention and endorsement from expert
nutrition groups around the world.  The Pan American Health
Organization is already looking to the Peru Model Nutrition
Project as a prototype for use in other Latin American countries.
<P>
The IAEA is planning more such model projects for Latin American
and developing countries.  They will target the most vulnerable
populations.  From an economic standpoint, these model projects
can also help optimize use of a country's scarce resources.  
<P>
<B>Agriculture</B>
<P>
Next, I want to describe some of our programmes which have
brought great
economic benefit for agriculture in this region.
<P>
<B>Fruit Fly Eradication in Latin America</B>
<P>
Use of the so-called Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an
environmentally friendly method of pest control which can
dramatically increase income from agriculture products for
export.  It has proven effective against  major insect pests,
including several types of fruit flies, tsetse fly, and the New
World Screwworm.   It relies on releasing vast numbers of male
insects sterilized by low doses of radiation that mate without
producing offspring.
<P>
One recent successful SIT project is the Mediterranean fruit fly
eradication from Chile.  This pest destroys millions of
dollars in fruit per year in infested areas and impairs a
multi-billion dollar fresh fruit export industry.  In December
last year, Chile announced the eradication
of the pest from the country.  The fly-free status will give
Chile's fruit
industry access to many new markets previously closed to Chilean
fruit and
the economic impact on Chile's international trade is estimated
at an increase
of 500 million dollars annually over the next five years.  The
project was
truly one of regional co-operation: irradiated insects and the
expert support
first came from IAEA Sterile Insect projects in Guatemala and
Mexico. 
Subsequently, IAEA supported the construction of a mass-rearing
and
sterilization facility in Chile's Lluta Valley.  Joint
co-operative efforts
between Chilean and Peruvian authorities now continue in southern
Peru, where
the pest has already been suppressed in the Tacna valley.  Future
collaboration within an expanded IAEA project foresees expansion
of the
eradication activities to other fruit-producing valleys in
southern Peru. 
<P>
Moving to the South East, Argentina has a fruit export
programme worth 450 million dollars a year.  This programme could
be expanded
significantly in the absence of the Mediterranean fruit fly.  The
Eradication
Program in Argentina, sponsored by IAEA since 1991, is also based
on the
Sterile Insect Technique and is making rapid progress.  It has
already
achieved eradication of Medfly from the southern and central
valleys of
Mendoza Province.  This is one of the main fruit producing
regions in western
Argentina.  Based on the successes of the Chilean and Argentinian
projects,
there are now plans to expand Medfly control and eradication
activities to
other provinces in Argentina and Uruguay in the short-term and to
further
South American countries in the future.
<P>
<B>Screwworm eradication</B>
<P>
There is another very successful eradication programme targeting
the
screwworm in the Latin American region, again based on the
Sterile Insect
Technique.  This parasite causes losses of millions in dollars
each year to
cattle producers in areas which have not undergone eradication. 
<P>
Mexico was declared free of screwworm in 1991 and since then, the
successful eradication campaign has continued.  Guatemala,
Belize, Honduras,
El Salvador, and Nicaragua have been beneficiaries.  Eradication
activities
are presently in progress in Costa Rica.  The goal of this effort
is to free
the area of the screwworm down to the Isthmus of Panama by 1997. 
A production
plant, which can mass rear 500 million sterile flies per week,
began operating
in 1976 in the Chiapas Province of Mexico.  It has been
instrumental in
eradication programmes throughout the entire region and even in
North
Africa.
<P>
I understand that the programme I just described is of much
interest
to Jamaica. The Government and the Jamaican Livestock Association
have
expressed the intent to eradicate the screwworm from this
country.  Their goal
is to improve public health problems and stop economic losses to
the cattle
industry. These losses amount to 11.3 million Jamaican dollars
per year. 
<P>
I have been informed that the Government of Jamaica will prepare
a
request for a Technical Co-operation Project from FAO and IAEA to
prepare and
design an eradication strategy.  A special commission will
organize, implement
and operate the screwworm eradication campaign here.   Both the
Government of
Jamaica and the Jamaican Livestock Association will partially
fund the
eradication campaign.
<P>
The IAEA stands ready to advise and assist with FAO in a joint
project. Successful eradication from Jamaica, using the Sterile
Insect
Technique, would represent a potential benefit to Jamaica's
economy of 2.7
million Jamaican dollars per year. 
<P>
<B>Cuba Sugar Cane Borer</B>
<P>
A further pest which has continued to present problems in this
region
is the sugarcane borer in Cuba.   It causes annual losses
amounting to
over $40 million USD.  The IAEA has been collaborating with Cuba
to provide
support in developing a total biological control package.  Field
testing of
the control package is presently taking place.
<P>
<B>Water supply</B>
<P>
Another source of concern where nuclear techniques are being
applied
is to increase scarce water supplies.  In 1994, IAEA began an
important water
project in Venezuela. Caracas has experienced severe
problems in water
supply in recent years - about 40 % of the water in the delivery
system is
being wasted by leakage.
<P>
In  areas of Caracas, much of the water was contaminated and in
some
residential areas, water was simply not available for many hours
during the
day. 
<P>
To find a solution to this water supply problem, in-depth
knowledge
of the aquifer and of the ground water dynamics was crucial.   
In August of
1994, IAEA began a Model Project with the city of Caracas to
study the
potential of the Caracas aquifer for: supplying drinking water;
water for
industrial use; and for agricultural purposes.  Environmental
isotopes were
used to analyse the properties and potential of the Caracas
aquifer and to
identify the best areas in which to drill new wells.  The advice
given
helped:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    To improve and upgrade the Caracas Water Quality Control
Laboratory
         (which monitors all of Caracas's drinking water); 
<P>
<DD>-    To develop a mathematical model of the aquifer as a
water management
         tool; and
<P>
<DD>-    To advise on the actual parts of the aquifer to use for
different
qualities of
         water:  drinking, irrigation or industrial. 
</DL>
<P>
The benefit of the Caracas project to the population was very
great. 
Water will now be made available to the marginal or outlying
areas of the city
populated by people with very low incomes.
<P>
<B>Peru</B>
<P>
Two years ago the government of Peru and IAEA initiated another
interesting and unusual water project.  The coastal areas in
Southern Peru
have the driest climate in the world.  Yet, about half a million
people in
this area  must be provided with water. 
<P>
Coastal aquifers in Peru were found to have very poor potential
for
high quality water development and to be polluted with pesticides
or
agricultural wastes. The Peruvian Government, with assistance
from IAEA
scientists, decided to search for water at a higher elevation on
the
Altiplano, a high plateau between Peru and Bolivia. Isotope
techniques
are allowing scientists to assess the potential of these
Altiplano aquifers
and determine which sources are continuously replenished and
which are
non-renewable.
<P>
Scientists are advising on separation of different qualities of
water
and identifying the uses of each.  A water delivery system will
be developed
for each quality water: drinking;  industrial and agricultural.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power</B>
<P>
Let me now turn to the most spectacular, and controversial,
non-military
application of nuclear technology - the generation of
electricity.
<P>
Worldwide, over 30 countries today generate electricity in
nuclear
power stations. There are over 430 power reactors at 250 sites.
Their history
stretches back forty years, when the first such reactor, in
Russia, was
started up.  It is still working today.  The world gets about 17
percent of
its total electricity from nuclear power -- about the same amount
as it gets from hydropower. So it is a substantial contribution.
<P>
Nuclear is an environmentally benign form of electricity
generation,
in the sense that it produces none of the greenhouse gases that
burning fossil
fuels - coal, oil and gas - create in abundance.  Carbon dioxide
is one
notable example:  if the electricity that nuclear generates were
produced by
coal instead, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the world's
atmosphere
would rise by about 8% a year.
<P>
Out of concern for the risk of global warming, the world's
governments have
committed themselves to curbing CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels. 
Unfortunately, the
rhetoric and the reality seem to be going in opposite directions.

CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are
increasing and
there are other harmful emissions from the burning of fossil
fuels as well: 
sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide, as well as heavy metals that
remain toxic forever.
<P>
Nuclear power is not free of problems:  the initial investment
costs
are very substantial, and the time needed for construction is
also
considerable - typically 8 years or more.  Even more importantly,
there are
persistent public concerns over safety, triggered in no small
part by the
Chernobyl power plant accident that occurred in Ukraine exactly
ten years ago.  What are the answers to these problems?
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    Rationalization of construction techniques;
<DD>-    Safer operations; and
<DD>-    Decisions on waste disposal installations.
</DL>
<P>
Safety regulation is and remains a national responsibility. 
However,
the IAEA can and does help to strengthen nuclear safety in four
ways:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    By serving as a forum where States can formulate basic
standards;
<P>
<DD>-    By developing binding international conventions;
<P>
<DD>-    By performing safety "audits" on request, with
international teams
going to plants around the world to study safety-related issues
and offer
recommendations for improvements; and
<P>
<DD>-    Lastly, by serving as a clearing-house for the exchange
of
information on best international practices in the safety area,
thus fostering
a "safety culture"  mentality worldwide.
</DL>
<P>
As to the safe disposal of nuclear wastes and particularly of
spent
nuclear fuel, technological solutions for reliably isolating such
materials
from the biosphere do exist, but the political problem of
deciding on sites
for the long-term storage remains unsolved.
<P>
In this hemisphere the United States has 110 nuclear power
plants. 
Mexico, Argentina and Brazil have operating plants and Cuba is
building one. 
<P>
Mexico has two units at Laguna Verde; Argentina has the Atucha
and
Embalse plants; Brazil has Angra 1, with Angra 2 to come; and
Cuba is seeking
to revive construction of its Russian-designed reactors at
Juragua.  For a
variety of reasons, mostly of a financial nature, I do not see
nuclear
becoming a major source of electricity for Latin America in the
period
immediately up ahead.  As I indicated, the start-up costs are
substantial -
about two billion dollars per unit.  On the other hand, I cannot
help wondering how countries with huge and burgeoning urban
centres like
Mexico City, Rio or Sao Paulo are going to cope with electricity
demand in an
environmentally acceptable way, in the decades to come, without a
significant
nuclear component.  Yet let me be clear:  it is for each national
Government
and Parliament to consider and determine how best to provide
energy.
<P>
There are those who yearn for the day that soft, renewable
energies -
solar, wind, geothermal, biomass - can make a real and
economically viable
contribution to the total energy picture.  But let us note that
solar meets
less than one tenth of one percent of US energy needs today. 
Moving forward
on this will surely take us well into the next century at the
speed of the
state-of-the-art's progress right now. Until then, the stark
choice will be
between more burning of fossil fuels, with the inevitable
environmental
consequences, and nuclear, for baseload needs.  We clearly need
to have
coherent energy strategies to get from here to there.  Many
countries are
going to have to face up to this hard fact of life in the coming
years, and
that may well bring about a nuclear renaissance.
<P>
For the time being, it is the booming economies of Asia which are
seeing most nuclear power plant construction - in countries like
Japan and
South Korea. China too is adding to its nuclear component,
although it - like
India - will continue to depend predominantly on coal for its
energy supplies.
Other, smaller Asian countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are
currently giving
serious consideration to joining the "nuclear club" as well.
<P>
The IAEA is - let me stress - not an advertising agency for
nuclear
power.  Several of our Member States in Europe - like our host
country,
Austria - and elsewhere do not favour nuclear power generation
and many of our
smaller members have little interest. Nevertheless, the Agency
devotes a good
deal of time and energy to its safety-related programmes,
confident in the
knowledge that all States support maximizing safety and in the
belief that a
degree of collective scrutiny and co-operation helps to ensure
that safety
remains a paramount consideration everywhere.
<P>

<P>
<B>Non-Proliferation and Safeguards</B>
<P>
I turn last of all to the main thrust of this seminar, which is
the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the role of the IAEA
safeguards
system in verifying States' commitments in this regard.
<P>
Back in the 1960s, President Kennedy predicted that by now 20 to
30
States would have nuclear weapons.  This has simply not happened.
There are
still only five declared nuclear-weapon States - China, France,
Russia, the
United Kingdom and the United States  - and a handful of
so-called threshold
States, believed to have at least the capability to assemble such
weapons in
short order - notably India, Israel and Pakistan.  The reason for
this achievement is because a great deal of effort has been
invested in
curbing the spread of such fearsome weapons.  We may reasonably
hope, now that
the Cold War is behind us, that we are moving towards a world
where nuclear
weapons will become increasingly irrelevant to national security
perceptions
and policies.  But we are not there yet, not by a long way.
<P>
In the meantime, the job at hand - which the Agency has helped to
grapple with for over a quarter of a century - is to try to keep
as much of
the military nuclear "genie" in the bottle as possible. 
<P>
The cornerstones of this effort are State treaty commitments to
non-proliferation. The first was the Tlatelolco Treaty for Latin
America, the
global treaty is the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty which came
into force in
1970 and which was extended indefinitely last year in New York by
agreement
among the parties.
<P>
The NPT is the most durable and widely supported arms control
measure
in history and is subscribed to today by 180 States.
<P>
The Treaty in essence sets out and codifies the bargain
articulated
by President Eisenhower in a speech on "Atoms for Peace" before
the United
Nations General Assembly in 1953:  countries renouncing
acquisition or
manufacture of nuclear weapons are offered access to nuclear
know-how,
materials and technology for peaceful purposes.  The IAEA can be
said to
implement this policy:  it serves as an important mechanism for
the transfer
of peaceful nuclear technology and for the verification that
States keep their
promise not to go for nuclear weapons.  There are now a number of
treaties
containing commitments to non-proliferation - the Raratonga
Treaty covering
the South Pacific, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which I mentioned,
covering the
Latin American region, the Pelindaba Agreement, signed two weeks
ago,
establishing the African continent as a zone free of nuclear
weapons, and a
similar agreement in South-East Asia.  In this part of the
world, Argentina and Brazil have additionally worked out a
complementary
bilateral arrangement permitting mutual inspections of nuclear
facilities by
each side as well as by inspectors from the IAEA.
<P>
I shall return to the basic duties of the IAEA's inspectorate -
and
to some of the difficult challenges it has faced in recent years
- in a
moment.  But first let me underline that the legal commitments
made under the
NPT and our safeguards function are only two elements - albeit
key elements -
of the total worldwide effort to curb the spread of nuclear
weapons.  Other
elements that play an important role are both political and
technical in
nature.
<P>
On the political side, it is important to work towards detente
and
greater mutual confidence in regions where tensions exist.  It is
no
coincidence that the remaining high proliferation-risk areas are
the Middle
East, the Asian subcontinent or the Korean Peninsula  - areas of
tension.  To
the extent that tensions are eased, there is less incentive to
pursue the
nuclear weapon option.  In my view, this is the most important
element:  the
political motive, or rather lack of it, to want to "go nuclear". 
<P>
Secondly, nuclear proliferation is made more difficult by
restraint
on the part of States possessing sophisticated nuclear know-how
in their
export of nuclear equipment, material and know-how.  Some
co-ordination among
such exporters is achieved in two multinational fora known as the
Suppliers
Group and the so-called Zangger Committee - after the name of its
first
Chairman.  These barriers may not be foolproof, but they are
nonetheless very
real.
 <P>
I revert now to the basic features of the IAEA's safeguards
system.
<P>
<DL>
The fundamental objectives of the safeguards system are:
<P>
<DD>-    To assure the international community that states are
complying with
their non-proliferation and other "peaceful use of nuclear"
undertakings;
<P>
<DD>-    To deter the diversion of safeguarded materials to the
production of
nuclear explosives or for other military purposes; and
<P>
<DD>-    To inhibit the misuse of safeguarded facilities for
producing
unsafeguarded materials.
</DL>
<P>
States conclude safeguards agreements with the IAEA through
detailed
agreements of two basic types (known internally as 66 or 153-type
agreements,
the latter covering the full scope of States' declared nuclear
programmes, the
former being restricted to certain specified facilities only). 
These
agreements - about which you will hear more in the next few days
- set out the
rights and obligations of the IAEA as the verifier and of the
sovereign, inspected State. In contrast to the safety-related
services which
are rendered by the IAEA only upon invitation, under the
safeguards system the
Agency has defined statutory rights, duties and responsibilities,
including
the right - which it has used - to report violations directly to
the Security
Council.  The nuclear-weapon States are not subject to safeguards
in the same
way as non-nuclear-weapon States - after all they have weapons -
but they are
not entirely exempt either:  they are subject to what are known
as "voluntary
offer" safeguard inspections, which have regard to the peaceful
sector.
<P>
Since we have only 200 inspectors (men and women) to cover some
1000
installations in some 60 countries worldwide with a safeguards
budget of some
80 million dollars, we must constantly determine how best to
deploy our
resources.  However, to a considerable extent this is determined
for us by the
amount of nuclear material a State possesses. In other words,
safeguards is a
quantitatively based system.   All States having a certain amount
of, say,
highly enriched uranium or plutonium and the type of relevant
facilities
receive a number of inspections as a function of that.  We do not
-
and could not - concentrate only on what some people might
consider "high
risk" countries.  "No discrimination" is the watchword.  Just as
at an
airport, everyone - whether dressed in three-piece suit or with
long hair,
jeans and sneakers - goes through the same checks.
<P>
The techniques used are multiple in nature.  The basic element is
"nuclear accountancy and control" - checking the books and then
verifying that
the quantity and quality of materials in the inventory tally. 
Another element
is containment and surveillance - remote cameras track movements
at strategic
points at nuclear facilities and tamper-proof seals are placed at
key access
points and on other items so that we can be sure nothing happens
between
inspection visits.  During these periodic physical inspection
visits, samples
can be taken for analysis. 
<P>
Until the 1990s, this system worked to general satisfaction.  The
Agency has indeed been able each year to certify that it had not
detected any
event indicating the diversion of a significant amount of
material which was
placed under Agency safeguards.  (In our terminology, significant
quantity
means 8kg. of plutonium or 25 kg. of highly enriched uranium). 
Then at the
beginning of this decade came the case of Iraq.  After the Gulf
War, under a
special mandate given to the IAEA by the Security Council and
which
Iraq had to accept as part of the ceasefire, we obtained unique
and sweeping
rights to go anywhere, any time throughout Iraq to map and
neutralize what
turned out to be a substantial clandestine nuclear weapons
programme, about
which even intelligence services apparently knew little or
nothing.  It says
much about the closed nature of Iraqi society that they were able
to pursue a
secret effort over 10 years with some 10,000 people costing
billions of
dollars without this coming to the surface.  After the Gulf War,
and
through the work of IAEA inspectors, it was possible to identify
how the
Iraqis, <I>inter alia</I> using natural uranium mined in their
own country, had tried
to produce enough highly enriched uranium to make weapons and
then marry that
up with a delivery system.  By the most recent calculations, Iraq
may have
been less than two years away from its goal when the Gulf War
occurred, which
destroyed the bulk of their nuclear facilities. Any installations
of
weapons-related significance that escaped were demolished by
the Iraqis subsequently under our supervision, along with some
items of
equipment linked to a bomb-making effort.
<P>
Our inspectors, like those of the UN, are still in Iraq today and
will continue to monitor that there is no attempt to revive the
clandestine
programme. Although the case of Iraq demonstrated the need for
strengthening
the safeguards system to give it greater capability of
discovering any secret
installations, it is clear that such intrusive, investigative
powers as we
have in Iraq will not be acceptable by sovereign States in normal
circumstances.
<P>
Then I come to the case of North Korea - the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, to be more precise, or DPRK. The DPRK signed
the
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but waited a number of years
before they
concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement and gave us an
inventory of
nuclear materials.  It became apparent to the Agency fairly soon
that the DPRK
had produced more than the small amount of plutonium they claimed
they had -
but how much more we could not learn and still do not know.  At
about the same
time, the Agency became aware also of two locations at the main
nuclear
site, that appeared relevant to the storage of nuclear wastes
from which we
could derive additional knowledge.  However, the Agency was
denied access to
those.  After a prolonged period in which the IAEA was obliged to
report North
Korean violations to the Security Council, and the DPRK withdrew
from
membership of our Agency, a situation of relative deadlock
prevailed.  This
was unblocked, though not completely, by an "Agreed Framework", a
bilateral
instrument between the DPRK and the United States signed in
October 1994. 
Under the terms of this instrument the DPRK agreed to freeze its
graphite-
moderated reactors and related facilities and will be provided
with two large
nuclear power generating plants that are expected to become
operational some
time after the turn of the century.  The Security Council, which
considered
the "Agreed Framework", requested the IAEA to monitor the freeze.

This, we
are doing.  
<P>
We have two or three inspectors permanently on station in the
DPRK to
monitor the freeze and to ensure that the North Koreans live up
to their side
of the bargain.  However, there is little beyond that which our
inspectors are
currently able to do, and I cannot predict how or when the
situation will
evolve.
<P>
Looked at in a more positive light, I believe the Iraq and DPRK
episodes have provided a powerful additional stimulus to efforts
already
underway to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the
safeguards
regime.  We are in the process of submitting to our Board of
Governors a
package of measures which in essence seek more information from
states and
more access to sites.  They also involve the use of modern and
sophisticated
techniques, such as the analysis of samples taken at or near
nuclear
installations which permit us to verify, by the very faint
"signatures" which
nuclear activities leave in water, vegetation and soil, the
nature of the work
recently conducted and so compare that to what we know and have
been told, as
a cross-check.
<P>
We are already implementing a first part of this new programme,
about
which you will be hearing more later in the Seminar, and I am
hopeful that the
second and more ambitious part will be approved before the year
is out.  That
part will entail additional, specific authority, going beyond our
existing
safeguards mandate, whereas the part one measures focus on things
we can
implement within the scope of existing agreements.
<P>
<B>Trafficking</B>
<P>
There is one last point I would like to touch on before
concluding,
and that is the relatively new risk that has emerged of nuclear
or radioactive
materials being smuggled and illegally traded.  In today's world
of booming
international travel and easy border crossings, there have been a
number of
cases of radioactive materials appearing on the black market -
notably in
Western Europe.  The breakup of a nuclear superpower, the former
Soviet Union,
has added to fears - and perhaps to opportunities - in this
regard.
There is a dual risk here  - of sensitive, maybe even
weapons-grade, material
falling into the wrong hands;  and a danger to public health if
such materials
are transported without taking proper precautions. 
<P>
Police, customs officials, international bodies and governments
have
become increasingly alert in this regard.  The IAEA, for its
part, has
concentrated on helping with the hands-on training of those
responsible for
the physical protection of such materials in those of our Member
States - for
instance in republics of the former Soviet Union -asking for such
help. 
Training is carried out both in their own countries and in
Western nations,
where staff can benefit from the experience of others working in
the same
field.  The second area where we are active is in building up a
centralized
data base of such incidents, so that we can share information
with our Member
States and detect any patterns that may be emerging.  Let me
stress that, with
the exception of one or two well-publicized cases, especially in
Germany,
where the quality of the materials seized was high but the
quantities were
still very modest, there is, in my view, no cause at present for
widespread
alarm: some smoke, yes;  fire, no - or at least not yet.  But
there is
certainly no room for complacency in this field.
<P>
<B>Conclusion </B>
<P>
Permit me now to sum up. 
<P>
The IAEA spans a full spectrum of nuclear-related activities. 
Those
that usually come to public attention are those relating to
nuclear safety and
to our role in attempting to curb the spread of nuclear weapons. 
These areas
are of central importance, and have contributed to the relatively
strong
support the IAEA enjoys from its Member States of all
sizes, at a time when much of the UN system is under attack and
has to
retrench
financially and in staff numbers.  However, there is an important
balance to
be preserved
between these functions and the services the Agency provides to
its developing
Member
States who look to the IAEA to provide assistance in raising
their level of
technical
sophistication and thereby improving the quality of life for
their
populations.  Within the
constraints I have described, we will continue as best we can to
meet those
desired
objectives.
<P>
          Thank you.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Conference for the Signing of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free
Zone Treaty
<BR>
(the Pelindaba Treaty)
</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International
Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Cairo, 11 April 1996</H4>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
It is deeply gratifying to witness today the signing of the
African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty).  The
conclusion of
this Treaty bears testimony to the untiring efforts of the
countries of this
continent in nuclear arms control and disarmament. It is also the
fruit of a
fundamental change in the international political environment -
the movement
towards detente.
<P>
The vision of the African leaders and their commitment to spare
Africa
the nuclear arms race was expressed as early as 1964 at the first
Organization
of African Unity summit meeting in Cairo, in the Declaration on
the
Denuclearization of Africa. It took three decades, however, to
transform that
vision and commitment into a reality.  The transformation had to
await both
the end of the cold war, which had cast its shadow on the African
continent,
and the end of apartheid, which ushered in a new era in South
Africa.  Indeed, it was South Africa's decision in 1990 to rid
itself of
nuclear weapons, to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear
Weapons and to accept IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear
activities, that
removed the last barrier to African efforts to keep this
continent free from
nuclear weapons.
<P>
The commitment of African States to nuclear non-proliferation and
nuclear
disarmament is deep and long-standing.  Fifty-one States members
of the OAU
are already party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and have
thereby undertaken
to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes and to
accept IAEA
verification on all their nuclear activities.  The Pelindaba
Treaty, however,
goes further than the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unlike the NPT,
it prohibits
the stationing and testing of any nuclear explosive device in the
territories
of its parties; it also commits its parties to apply the highest
standards of
security and physical protection of nuclear material, facilities
and equipment
to prevent theft and unauthorized use;  it prohibits armed attack
against
nuclear installations in the zone; and it prohibits the dumping
of any
radioactive waste.  These are important undertakings
supplementary to those
already assumed by the parties under the NPT.  They will help to
advance the
cause of horizontal and vertical non-proliferation and to prevent
illegal
trafficking in or other unauthorized uses of nuclear material. 
They
will help to shield nuclear facilities from possible armed
attacks and
consequent radiological releases during conflicts; and they will
require
management of radioactive waste to be in accordance with accepted
international safety standards.
<P>
Under the Pelindaba Treaty the IAEA is entrusted with the
obligation of
verifying, through its safeguards system and in accordance with
the complaint
procedure provided for in the Treaty, compliance by the parties
with their
commitment to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful
purposes.  We are
grateful for the trust shown in the verification system of the
IAEA by the
Treaty's reliance on it.  I am confident that the Agency's
Policy-Making-Organs will authorize the Secretariat to undertake
these
responsibilities in the service of peace and prosperity.  The
IAEA currently
applies safeguards to twenty-six nuclear facilities in five
African States
party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, namely Egypt, Ghana,
Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, South Africa and Zaire, and in one State, Algeria,
pursuant to facility-specific agreements.  I should add that a
safeguards
agreement with Algeria linked to Algeria's adherence to the NPT
has recently
been signed and may be expected soon to come into force.
<P>
As you may be aware, the lessons learned in Iraq are leading the
IAEA to
strengthen its safeguards system with a view to improving its
capability to
verify the peaceful nature of declared nuclear activities and -
even more
importantly - to detect possible undeclared activities.  This
will be achieved
through increased access to information, including the use of new
verification
techniques such as environmental sampling, and increased physical
access to
sites and locations.  The IAEA Board of Governors has already
endorsed a first
set of measures to strengthen the safeguards system and is
currently
considering additional measures.  I am confident that, with a
strengthened safeguards system, the IAEA will be able to provide
a high degree
of assurance regarding both the non-diversion of declared nuclear
activities
to non-peaceful purposes and the absence of clandestine nuclear
activities.
<P>
<CENTER>
* * * * *
</CENTER>
<P>
I note that the Pelindaba Treaty is not limited to assuring the
exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy.  It demonstrates
confidence in the
potential use of nuclear energy for sustainable economic and
social
development.  The parties commit themselves "to promote
individually and
collectively the use of nuclear science and technology for
economic and social
development".  To this end, they will make use of the programme
of technical
assistance available through the IAEA and, in particular,
strengthen
co-operation under the African Regional Co-operation Agreement
for Research,
Training and Development related to Nuclear Science and
Technology (AFRA).
<P>
In this connection, let me point out that although the use of
nuclear
energy for power generation is perhaps the most widely known and
discussed
application of nuclear energy, it is by no means the only
application.  For
many developing countries the use of radioisotopes in
agriculture, medicine,
hydrology and industry is important. Nuclear power for the
desalination of
sea-water could become important in the future to provide clean
fresh drinking
water to several big African cities.  As the UN system
organization
entrusted with fostering international co-operation for the safe
and peaceful
use of nuclear energy for sustainable development, the IAEA
pursues a major
programme of technical assistance through which nuclear
technology for
peaceful applications is transferred to developing countries.
<P>
Let me report to you that the Agency's technical assistance
programme to
Africa is currently around US 20 million dollars per annum.  The
programme
contributes, for example, to increasing agricultural productivity
in many
African Member States; to developing genetically improved
varieties of seeds,
grains and l&eacute;gumes; to ensuring optimum use of soil, water
and
chemicals, and to improving farm animal reproduction and
nutrition.  In the
field of human health the Agency programme in Africa is focusing
on
the application of nuclear techniques, primarily for medical
diagnosis and the
treatment of cancer.  The programme also assists African Member
States in the
use of isotope techniques to assess ground water resources in
arid and
semi-arid zones.  The Agency has also been using a radioisotope
technique -
the so-called sterile insect technique - to control and possibly
eradicate
pests such as the tsetse fly and the Mediterranean fruit fly
which cause
severe economic losses in many African countries.
<P>
During the past decade, regional activities in the field of
nuclear
science and technology have assumed greater importance in Africa. 
Activities
being carried out through the regional co-operative agreement
AFRA cover areas
such as nuclear medicine, agriculture, maintenance of scientific
and medical
instruments, radiation protection and waste management.  This
inter-governmental arrangement has now a membership of 21
countries.  AFRA has
proved to be an important mechanism to promote regional
co-operation and to 
co-ordinate intellectual and physical resources.
<P>
In the quest for nuclear disarmament nuclear-weapon-free zones
are
important vehicles.  I note the recognition in the preamble to
the Pelindaba
Treaty that "the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free
zones, especially
in the Middle East, would enhance the security of States Party to
the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone". You may be aware that the IAEA General
Conference
has supported the concept of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the
Middle East
with full verification and requested me to consult States of the
region to
facilitate the early application of comprehensive Agency
safeguards to all
nuclear activities in the region.  For several years I have been
consulting
States of the Middle East on questions of verification which will
one day be
before them and in which they should be enabled to draw on the
advice and
experience of the IAEA.
<P>
Let me end by noting that, in addition to the establishment of
nuclear-weapon-free zones, other nuclear arms control measures
need to be
taken urgently to move the world progressively towards nuclear
disarmament. 
High on the list are the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear
test ban
treaty; a universal convention banning the production of fissile
material for
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and most
importantly, as
provided for in the consensus decision of the NPT Review and
Extension
Conference, "a determined pursuit by the Nuclear Weapon States of
systematic
and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally with
the ultimate
goal of eliminating those weapons".

<h3>Statement to the Thirty-Ninth Session of the General Conference<BR>
of the International Atomic Energy Agency</H3>
<P>
<H4>by Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
<P>
18 September 1995</H4>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
The machinery of the IAEA has been working at full steam - even with some
overpressure - since the General Conference met in 1994 and we can register considerable
movement forward in many areas.  I shall report to you about activities in the past year and
about plans for the future.
<P>
<B>The NPT Conference</B>
<P>
In May this year the Review and Extension Conference decided to extend the Non-
Proliferation Treaty indefinitely.  This decision, testifying to the solid and broad commitment
to nuclear non-proliferation, was greeted with relief and enthusiasm in many capitals.  We
should not close our eyes, however, to the reality that the decision was received with mixed
feelings in a number of other capitals, where it was a matter of concern that the extension
meant also an indefinite recognition of the nuclear-weapon status of five States parties.  I submit
that a forward-looking interpretation of the extension decision, and the principles and objectives
which were also adopted, would be that they constitute a collective commitment to bring us to
a world in which nuclear energy is used for positive, peaceful purposes and in which no single
nation possesses nuclear weapons; that is a commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States not to
acquire these weapons and a commitment by the five declared nuclear-weapon States to
effective and accelerated nuclear disarmament.   
<P>
The outcome of the NPT Conference has far-reaching implications for the future work
of the IAEA.  A continued role was envisaged for the Agency in the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy and an expanded role was foreseen for it in verification.  The IAEA was expressly
recognized as the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with
safeguards agreements.  The Conference further stated that parties to the NPT that have
concerns regarding non-compliance with the safeguards agreements should direct such concerns,
along with supporting evidence and information, to the IAEA for it to consider, investigate,
draw conclusions and decide on necessary actions in accordance with its mandate.  I read this
provision as an endorsement of the Agency's verification role as it has evolved in recent years. 
The Conference also called for support for the Agency's ongoing actions to strengthen
safeguards, and to increase its capability to detect any undeclared nuclear activities.  It was
further recommended that nuclear material released from military use should be placed under
IAEA safeguards as soon as practicable and the universal application of safeguards was
envisaged once the elimination of nuclear weapons had been achieved.  
<P>
The NPT Conference set 1996 as the target date for the conclusion of a comprehensive
test ban agreement - a step which is widely viewed as a vital complement to non-proliferation
and a symbol of progress towards nuclear disarmament.  It further called for the early
conclusion of an agreement to end the production of nuclear material for use in weapons - a cutoff agreement - and it endorsed the creation of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones.  The
assumption underlying current discussions on the cut-off agreement is that IAEA safeguards
would be an essential element of the verification mechanism.  It may also be assumed - if
existing models are an indication - that the Agency would have a verification role in any new
nuclear-weapon-free zone.  In relation to a comprehensive test ban it is relevant to note, as I
have done before, that such a ban in reality already exists for all the non-nuclear-weapon States
parties to the NPT and is verified under comprehensive IAEA safeguards agreements.  What
roles the Agency might be asked to assume under a specific comprehensive test ban treaty are
yet to be determined by the States negotiating this treaty.
<P>
<B>The French Nuclear Tests</B>
<P>
Before I leave the question of nuclear weapon testing, let me report to you, as I did to
the Board of Governors last week, that I have recently received a letter from the Foreign
Minister of France in which reference is made to the irreversible commitment of France to
conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in 1996 and its intention to undertake a final
series of nuclear tests before that time.  The Minister asked whether the IAEA would be willing
to conduct a scientific mission to assess the radiological impact of these tests.  Such assessment
would have to be complemented by an assessment of the geological situation of the test site. 
In reply I have indicated that for the Agency to take a decision on the matter, a number of
preliminary questions would need to be carefully considered - including the objective and the
scope of the mission, its modalities and the composition of a team.  I added that the Secretariat
wanted to consult with the French authorities as well as with others on these issues. 
Consultations with French experts are scheduled for this week.
<P>
As you are aware, the Agency provides numerous services to its Member States in the
field of nuclear safety and radiological protection and has established radiation safety standards. 
The French inquiry is being considered in that context.  You may also be aware that a mission
was sent by the Agency to Kazakhstan last year to assess the radiological situation at the
Semipalatinsk test site, and that a similar mission is being planned for the Marshall Islands. 
Also, our Monaco Laboratory has co-ordinated two inter-laboratory calibration exercises using
various samples taken in 1991 and 1994 from the area of the French Pacific test sites.  We
therefore have some first hand experience in this field.
<P>
<B>Strengthened IAEA Safeguards</B>
<P>
     Credible IAEA verification that nuclear materials and related items remain in peaceful
activities is an increasingly important factor in nuclear disarmament and global security
planning.  At the same time the magnitude and complexity of the safeguards task continues to
increase.  In 1994 the IAEA inspection effort rose by more than 12% over the previous year. 
The increasing importance and volume of the safeguards effort impels us to develop and
implement a strengthened and more cost-effective system.  A full report on the actions that have
been taken under the so-called Programme 93+2 is given in document <A HREF=/GC/gc3917.html>GC(39)/17</A> and
corrigendum.
 <P>
     Increased access to information about nuclear programmes and broader inspector access
to sites within the State are fundamental prerequisites for strengthened safeguards.  To obtain
this has been the main thrust of the 93+2 Programme which the Board of Governors is
considering.  While some of the desired measures will require additional authority which must
be sought, other measures can be implemented under the authority of existing comprehensive
safeguards agreements.  I welcome that the Board has taken note of the Secretariat's intention
to achieve such implementation at an early date, after consultations and clarifications to dispel
any remaining concerns of Member States.
<P>
     By making their nuclear activities as transparent as possible to the Agency, States can
help provide the basis for more effective and efficient safeguards.  They will have to decide
whether they are prepared - as I think is in their interest - to routinely provide greater access
to information and locations than is presently required under safeguards agreements.  Needless
to say, the new arrangements must be both practical and cost-effective and make use of state-of-
the-art verification techniques.  The experience gained in trial arrangements made with several
States suggests that in practice the cost to States of, say, granting multiple visas for inspectors
and wider access within installations, is not great.  It is really only a matter of a somewhat
more co-operative attitude to facilitate strengthened and more efficient inspection.   
<P>
We believe that after a start-up period they may be offset by efficiencies elsewhere in the safeguards system.
However, any significant increase in the number of countries accepting full-scope safeguards, or in the number
of facilities and amount of material under safeguards, will inevitably involve additional costs.
<P>
Large increases in the verification effort may result if nuclear materials removed from
the military sphere of nuclear-weapon States are placed under safeguards - as was urged by the
NPT Conference.  Verification of such material started just one year ago and the present
arrangements foresee funding through extrabudgetary contributions.  An expansion of the IAEA
verification that such nuclear material remains in the peaceful sphere to which it has been
transferred requires special arrangements which are reliable and cover the full costs of this
inspection effort.
<P>
<B>Safeguards Implementation in the DPRK</B>
<P>
Last year I reported that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was not in full
compliance with its safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT.  Document <A HREF=/GC/gc3918.html>GC(39)/18</A>
summarizes the many developments of the past year.  Important among these is the framework
which was agreed between the DPRK and the USA and which provides for a freeze and the
eventual dismantling of the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors and related facilities and states
the intention of the DPRK to come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement.  On 4
November last year, the Security Council confirmed that the safeguards agreement remained
in force and binding and requested the Agency to take the necessary steps to monitor the freeze. 
With the authorization of the Board, we have been doing this through the continuous presence
of inspectors in the DPRK and I can confirm that the freeze has been put into effect and is
maintained.
<P>
However, to come into full compliance with the safeguards agreement, the DPRK will
have to do something it has not yet been willing to do, namely enable the Agency effectively
to verify the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report of nuclear material subject
to the agreement.  In the absence of the required compliance, it is essential that all necessary
steps be taken to preserve any information that is relevant to this verification.
<P>
Technical discussions have been held with the DPRK with respect to the activities to be
carried out pursuant to the safeguards agreement at the DPRK's nuclear facilities, irrespective
of their status under the freeze.  Since the first of these discussions in November last year,
arrangements have been in place enabling the Agency to meet many of its objectives.  However,
a number of issues remain, including the verification of the spent fuel of the 5 MW(e) reactor, the
installation of monitoring equipment in the waste tanks of the reprocessing plant and the
preservation, intact, of information relevant to the verification of the accuracy and completeness
of the initial declaration. In the last few days, a new round of IAEA-DPRK discussions has taken
place at technical meetings in the DPRK. Limited progress was made on some issues. However, a substantial paper
of technical proposals transmitted by the Agency was accepted only for study -- not for discussion.
<P>
<B>Agency Verification in Iraq under Security Council Resolutions</B>
<P>
     As I reported to the UN General Assembly in October last year, it is the Secretariat's
conclusion that the essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme have
been identified and destroyed, removed or rendered harmless.  This assessment was not based
on faith in Iraqi statements, but on data gathered during inspections, on information provided
by suppliers and Member States and, to a great extent, on analysis of the large number of
original documents which were obtained in Iraq by the teams of the sixth and seventh IAEA
inspection missions.
<P>
     Since August 1994 IAEA inspectors are continuously present in Iraq to perform ongoing
monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions. 
This does not exclude renewed inspections for the purpose of investigations, if such should be
called for to verify any new information.
<P>
Recently the IAEA has received additional information on Iraq's former nuclear weapons
programme by way of new statements made and numerous documents and materials transmitted
to the IAEA and to UNSCOM by Iraq following the departure to Amman of General Hussein
Kamel, the former Iraqi Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization <A HREF=/GC/gc3910.html>(GC(39)/10, Add.1)</A>. 
Of the new information which has been reviewed to date nothing suggests that a change is
warranted in the Agency's conclusion which I have referred to.  What we have been told is that
as of August/September 1990, Iraqi authorities had the intention to take the safeguarded highly
enriched research reactor uranium fuel at Tuwaitha (the nuclear research centre), extract the
pure uranium by the spring of 1991, transform it into weapons-grade uranium metal and then
use it to make a nuclear weapon.  It is uncertain whether they would have been able to
overcome the considerable technical difficulties involved in this plan.  As it was, the plan was
made impossible by damage inflicted on Tuwaitha through bombings in January 1991.
<P>
     Let me note that the new Iraqi statements and all the documents and materials to which
I have referred will have to be carefully examined for any new data.  That they have been
withheld for so long is clearly a breach of Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolutions.
<P>
     What I further think should be noted in this affair is that prima facie it shows that the
Iraqi authorities would not have hesitated to take nuclear material under safeguards and to time
the operation in such a way as to make maximum use of the period before the next scheduled
IAEA inspection, at which time the violation of the safeguards agreement would have become
known.  While taking the fuel would not have needed much time, processing and transforming
it into bomb grade material would have taken more time.  As I said, the effort was thwarted
by bombing.
<P>
     Some other lessons may also be drawn from this affair.  One is that the replacement of
high enriched uranium fuel by low enriched fuel in research reactors can, indeed, reduce the
risk of proliferation.  A second is that the change introduced in the safeguards system post Iraq
in favour of more frequent inspections to ensure the timely detection of a diversion of a
significant quantity of safeguarded material is prudent.  A third is that real-time remote
transmission of data, when it becomes readily available, will provide a useful tool for achieving
immediate detection of diversion.
<P>
I turn now to developments in some regional arrangements.
<P>
<B>Tlatelolco Treaty</B>
<P>
     I am pleased to be able to report further positive developments in relation to the Treaty
of Tlatelolco.  Since the last General Conference two States have become Party to the Treaty,
two States have ratified it and one, Cuba, has signed it.  This brings us closer to the date when
the Treaty will enter into force for the entire zone of application and makes it essential that the
required safeguards agreements be in force with all the States parties to the Treaty.
<P>
     At its June meeting, the Board of Governors authorized the Secretariat to take action to
obtain the prompt conclusion of all safeguards agreements outstanding pursuant to the Tlatelolco
Treaty.  The Secretariat is very actively engaged in ensuring that the required safeguards
agreements are concluded.  I appeal to the States concerned to fulfil their obligation under the
Treaty to ensure that there is no delay in its entry into force for the entire zone of application.
<P>
<B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Africa</B>
<P>
     As requested by the General Conference last year, the Agency has continued to assist
the African States in their efforts to establish an African nuclear-weapon-free zone, in particular
in the elaboration of the verification regime.  A draft Treaty text which, inter alia, entrusts the
Agency with the task of verification, was considered and endorsed by the OAU Council of
Ministers and the African Heads of State in Addis Ababa last June and it is expected that the
draft Treaty will be considered by this year's General Assembly of the United Nations and that
Africa will soon become yet another nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>
<B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East</B>
<P>
In resolution <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/policy/gcres21.html>GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21</A>, the General Conference last year called upon all
parties directly concerned to consider taking the practical and appropriate steps required to
establish a mutually and effectively verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East
region.  The resolution also requested the Director General to continue consultations with the
States of the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to
all nuclear activities in the region and the preparation of model verification agreements as a step
towards the establishment of such a zone.  As I have reported to previous General Conferences,
model verification agreements cannot easily be prepared until the States concerned have
clarified their views on the main issues of substance.  This is not yet the case.  Meanwhile the
Agency is participating in some discussions on these issues within the peace process.  I intend
to continue my visits to and consultations with States in the region in order further to explore
the verification questions and the material obligations which may be agreed upon and may call
for verification.
<P>
<B>Trafficking</B>
<P>
A year ago, the international community expressed alarm at the number of incidents of
illicit trafficking in radioactive materials that had been reported in 1994 and the General
Conference invited me to take a number of actions to supplement the measures taken by
governments.  In 1995 there have been further seizures of illicitly held radioactive materials and
it is clear that more efforts are needed and that States must exercise greater prudence in the use
and storage of all radioactive materials.
<P>
In responding to the problems of nuclear trafficking, nuclear, customs and enforcement
authorities of many countries and a number of international organizations are seeking to
strengthen and co-ordinate their efforts to control and protect radioactive materials.  Only last
week the IAEA hosted a large interagency meeting which reached a number of useful joint
conclusions.  Within the IAEA, an Action Programme has been approved by the Board of
Governors.  We are already conducting training courses in the operation of State systems of
accounting for and controlling nuclear materials.  In addition, with the help of experts from
Member States, courses are being arranged on physical protection methods and technology. 
Activities are further underway to help States address the radiation hazards connected with illicit
trafficking.  For 1997 a conference is planned to further facilitate the exchange of information
and expertise on physical protection.  Meanwhile, the Agency is establishing a database of
trafficking incidents to provide factual information to member governments and the public.  In
July the UN Security Council expressed its full support to the Agency and other international
bodies for their work in this field.  A full report on the Agency's actions is before you
(document <A HREF=/GC/gc3919.html>GC(39)/19</A>).
<P>  
<B>Strengthening Technical Co-operation</B>
<P>
Let me turn now to the Technical Co-operation Programme of the Agency, and in
particular the initiatives taken to strengthen it and to improve delivery.  (Detailed information
on measures taken in the past year are set out in document <A HREF=/GC/gc3913.html>GC(39)/13</A>).
Our technical co-operation with Member States must reflect their priorities for scientific, technological as well
as economic and social development.  However, a careful study of the programmes actually
requested shows that they have often covered a wide range of areas, not all of them clearly
related to national development goals.
<P>
Several initiatives have been taken to make the technical co-operation programme more
effective and more relevant to the sustainable development of Member States.  In the latter
regard I commend to your attention a recent document (GOV/INF/773 of 8 September 1995)
describing the Agency's considerable contribution to "Agenda 21 on the Environment and
Sustainable Development".
<P>
     Following the recommendations of the Fourth Policy Review Seminar last year, the
Secretariat, working together with Member States, has started preparing "Country Programme
Frameworks" which will help focus the programmes on key areas of government priority to
maximize the impact.  Another initiative aims at having fewer but better focused projects.  I
urge governments to help by submitting somewhat fewer projects - and to ensure that they are
in line with their development needs and have the full backing of the national authorities.
<P>
     Another measure planned is the promotion of technical co-operation among developing
countries, or TCDC.  The idea is to subcontract institutions in developing countries which are
recognized as centres of excellence in a particular field to implement selected technical co-
operation projects for given countries.
<P>
I am pleased to inform the Conference that the technical co-operation programme delivery as of 30
August 1995 is the highest ever in the history of the Agency.  This is
largely due to improved management practices, better design and support of projects and a
careful overprogramming introduced this year with the Board's approval.  As a consequence,
not only will developing Member States receive more assistance in 1995, but also the carryover
of unused financial resources will be greatly reduced.  At the NPT Review and Extension
Conference all participants acknowledged the importance of the work of the Agency as the
principal agent for the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries and welcomed the
successful operation of the Agency's technical assistance and co-operation programmes.  It was
also recognized that the success of these programmes depends on the availability of predictable
resources.  I appeal, therefore, to all Member States to make full voluntary contributions to the
Technical Co-operation Fund.
<P>
<B>Technology Development and Transfer </B>
<P>
Successive General Conferences have drawn attention to various areas of nuclear
research and development of particular interest to developing countries.  In response to such
requests, you have before you special reports on isotope hydrology and the use of nuclear
energy for potable water production.  Let me briefly highlight one of those areas as well as
some other issues of particular interest at this time.
<P>
<B>Sea Water Desalination Using Nuclear Energy</B>
<P>
     The availability of potable water is a growing problem in many Member States. 
Considerable progress was made last year as regards the evaluation of the technical and
economic feasibility of seawater desalination using nuclear energy.  The North African regional
feasibility study has been completed, showing that the use of nuclear power plants for
desalination is technically feasible and the costs competitive with that of fossil plants in the
region.  A similar feasibility study for Saudi Arabia is still under way. 
<P>
     Studies have also continued on practical options for nuclear desalination demonstration
projects.  However, the success of this programme is very much dependent on the availability
of sufficient extrabudgetary contributions from interested Member States.   I appeal for further
support for it.
<P>
<B>Irradiated Sewage Sludge</B>
<P>
     The Agency's Programme and Budget for 1995-96 contains a new multi-disciplinary
project on the use of nuclear techniques for the management of liquid wastes - one of the major
environmental problems identified in Agenda 21 of the Rio Summit on Environment and
Development.    
<P>
     A new Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) was initiated on "The Use of Irradiated
Sewage Sludge to Increase Soil Fertility, Crop Yields and to Preserve the Environment".  The
aim is to find ways by which solid and liquid wastes from households and industry could be
utilized as a source of organic matter and nutrients for increasing crop production.  This would
reduce the needs for chemical fertilizers, and also the environmental pollution of other sewage
treatment processes.   The use of gamma and electron beam irradiators to eliminate disease-
producing microbial pathogens is a promising technique that would permit the safe utilization
of sludges as a biofertilizer.
<P>
<B>25 Years of the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)</B>
<P>
     In May of this year the International Nuclear Information System (INIS) celebrated its
25th anniversary.  INIS plays a key role in providing access to nuclear information to support
activities worldwide in many diverse areas, e.g. nuclear power,  safeguards, and nuclear
techniques in food and agriculture.  The INIS database now includes over 1.8 million references
of nuclear literature and is growing at the rate of about 85 000 records per year.  
<P>

     New areas are introduced in the database as new demands arise in Member States. 
Thus, in 1992 references on environmental, health and economic aspects of non-nuclear energy
sources were introduced in addition to those concerning nuclear energy.
<P>
     INIS is by far the largest of the electronic databases created by the IAEA in co-operation
with its Member States, and its continuing success reflects the active support and participation
of those Member States.  INIS maintains its non-commercial character and continues to
facilitate the availability of nuclear information to users in all participating countries irrespective
of their levels of development.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety and Safe Radioactive Waste Management</B>
<P>
     Document <A HREF=/GC/gc39inf8.html>(39)/INF/8</A> reports in a comprehensive manner the various measures
which have been taken by the Agency to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear safety,
radiological protection and radioactive waste management.  I will therefore limit my remarks
to some developments of particular importance.
<P>
<B>Agency Management of Safety Issues</B>
<P>
     With a view to consolidating all the Agency's safety-related activities into one
organizational structure, the Department of Nuclear Energy and Safety will be divided into two
distinct Departments - the Department of Nuclear Energy, and the Department of Nuclear
Safety.  The latter will cover the three major safety disciplines - nuclear safety, radiation safety
and radioactive waste safety.  One change connected with the division is the development of
a modified and streamlined process for the preparation of all Agency safety standards.  The
objective is to ensure uniformity and consistency in the preparation and review process of the
documents covering the three interrelated safety disciplines.
<P>
<B>Convention on Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
     A major accomplishment in the nuclear safety area was the adoption in June last year
of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  So far the Convention has been signed by 59 States and
ratified or accepted by nine.  A number of States are very close to ratification and I believe we
can look forward to the Convention entering into force next year.  Representatives of
signatories of the Convention and other interested States will meet for the second time in
November to continue discussions on the implementation process. The Agency is ready to assist
States in meeting their obligations through, for example, its wide range of safety services.
<P>
<B>Convention on Radioactive Waste Safety</B>
<P>
     The preamble of the Convention on Nuclear Safety urges the preparation of a
Convention on the safe management of radioactive waste.  In this regard significant progress
has been made.  At the end of its first meeting, in July, the open-ended group of legal and
technical experts entrusted its chairman, Professor Baer from Switzerland, with the preparation
of a draft of the Convention.  This draft will be considered at the second meeting of the group
in December.  The progress made so far is encouraging and if the pace is maintained a final
draft could perhaps be ready some time next year.
<P>
<B>Liability </B>
<P>
     Since the last session of the General Conference the Standing Committee on Liability
for Nuclear Damage has recommended, albeit with some reservations, that a diplomatic
conference be convened in 1996 to revise the Vienna Convention and to adopt a system of
supplementary funding.  However, some fundamental issues remain to be resolved.  As work
on revision of the Vienna Convention is nearing completion but cannot progress further without
concomitant results on the issue of supplementary funding, the Standing Committee has devoted
much effort to elaborate an instrument on supplementary funding.  There will be an informal
meeting next week and I hope that the efforts made will facilitate the emergence of a broadly
acceptable draft convention - and thereby provide the necessary basis for a successful
Diplomatic Conference and a viable international instrument on liability.
<P>
     While work continues on the strengthening of international nuclear liability
arrangements, I should like to mention that the number of States that have ratified the Vienna
Convention and Joint Protocol has grown, especially among States in Eastern and Central
Europe, and now stands at 26 and 20 respectively.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety in the Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe</B>
<P>
     The Agency's work on the safety assessment of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe
and countries of the former Soviet Union has continued and an international consensus now
exists, identifying the major safety issues and their significance for each of the various reactor
types.  The emphasis is now shifting to a review of the status of implementation of the proposed
safety improvements and to the collection of up-to-date information on the upgrading situation
at each of the reactors involved.  These results of our work provide input into bilateral and
multilateral assistance projects co-ordinated by the G-24 mechanism in Brussels.
<P>     
     Following the decision by the Armenian Government to restart Medzamor Unit 2
reactor, an Agency mission visited Armenia in April 1995.  Its report pointed to a difficult
safety situation, including a number of unresolved technical issues.  I conveyed these results
to the Armenian Government and stressed the need to solve the safety issues before plant
restart.  I also stressed the need for highly competent and well trained operating staff.  Armenia
has had considerable co-operation from Russia and the Agency has responded to requests for
assistance on several safety related issues, e.g. evaluation of the seismic situation and of the
condition of the pressure vessel as well as on emergency planning.  Responsibility for all steps
which are needed before start-up and for safety upgrades thereafter rests, of course, with the
Government.
<P>
     I must again draw your attention to the fact that we continue to rely on extrabudgetary
resources for the major part of our assistance efforts in the former Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
<P>
<B>Chernobyl Conference</B>
<P>
     The tenth anniversary of the tragic accident at the Chernobyl NPP, in April 1986, will
provide an occasion for different authorities and international organizations to arrange meetings
at which various consequences of this accident will be assessed.  These events will culminate
here in Vienna on 8-12 April 1996 in an international conference that will seek to sum up the
accumulated knowledge.  The Conference is jointly sponsored by the WHO, the EU and the
Agency and it is organized in co-operation with several other organizations.  It will consider
the findings of the prior meetings on the health consequences of the accident, its associated
environmental, social, economic and political impacts, the remedial measures taken to improve
the safety of Chernobyl-type reactors and the reliability of the containment structure
(sarcophagus) of the destroyed reactor.  The April Conference is intended to seek a common
and conclusive understanding of the nature and magnitude of the consequences of the accident. 
<P>
<B>Radioactive Waste Management in the Russian Federation</B>
<P>
     In the context of measures taken by the Agency to resolve international waste
management issues, the Agency organized in May this year, at the request of the Nordic
Council of Ministers and with the co-operation of the Russian Federation, a Seminar on
International Co-operation on Nuclear Waste Management in the Russian Federation.  A
comprehensive picture was provided of the present waste management programmes, structures
and problems in Russia and an overview was obtained of the co-operation with Russia in the
field of nuclear waste management.  A Contact Expert Group will be established under the
auspices of the IAEA for the purpose of organizing and following up co-operative activities
between Russia and other States.  A first meeting of this Group is being organized by the IAEA
in Stockholm later this week.
<P>
Nuclear Energy and the Environment: the DECADES (Databases and Methodologies for
Comparative Assessment of Different Energy Sources for Electricity Generation)
Programme
<P>
     One of the major future challenges in the energy field will be to ensure sustainability. 
This will require both enhanced management of natural resources and a reduction of emissions
which are dangerous to health and the environment.  Especially the threat of global climate
change due to such emissions is high on the agenda of governments.  However, the first
Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in
Berlin at the end of March, has shown that reaching an international consensus on these matters
will take some time.
<P>
     Three years after the Rio "Earth Summit" the progress made, for example in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, is extremely small.  Carbon dioxide emissions have slowed only
marginally in industrialized countries, and have continued to increase significantly in most
developing countries, owing to energy demand growth and increasing use of fossil fuels which
are the most readily available energy source.
<P>
     The medium-term outlook is not better and if measures are not taken soon to reduce the
share of fossil fuels, especially coal, in electricity generation  the substantial growth in energy
and electricity consumption in many developing countries will lead to a serious increase of
greenhouse gas emissions.  According to the findings of a number of recent studies, carbon
dioxide emissions will grow also in Western Europe after the turn of the century.  The
commissioning of new gas-fired or coal-fired power plants is the main cause of this trend.
<P>
     In Europe, the case of France, where more than 75% of electricity is produced by
nuclear power, clearly demonstrates that nuclear power can play a major role in reducing
carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulphur oxide emissions.  From this point of view it is to be
welcomed that in Asia, with its rapidly expanding economies, both Japan and the Republic of
Korea are pursuing their dynamic nuclear power programmes, and China is in the early phase
of a planned large nuclear power programme.  In Japan, a study commissioned by the Science
and Technology Agency has concluded that in order to curb carbon dioxide emissions to the
1990 levels, Japan will need about 80 GW(e) of nuclear power by the year 2020 and about 100
GW(e) by 2030.  At present, Japan has 39 GW(e) of nuclear power installed capacity.
<P>
     In this context, it is necessary to assess and compare all the available energy supply
options, taking into account their technical and economic performance as well as their potential
for alleviating damaging impacts on health and environments.  This is the focus of the Agency's
programme on the comparative assessment of energy sources.
<P>
     The findings from the so-called DECADES project, carried out by the IAEA in co-
operation with several other international organizations, already provide documented data,
methodologies and analyses on the comparative economic, social, health and environmental
aspects of different energy sources for electricity generation.  Let me mention that detailed
studies on the emissions and residuals from nuclear, fossil and renewable energy chains show
that nuclear power in normal operation is one of the most environment friendly ways of
generating electricity.  Some 20 case studies have been undertaken by national institutes in the
framework of a Co-ordinated Research Programme to assess and compare alternative electricity
system expansion strategies in different countries.  The preliminary results indicate that
incorporating health and environmental aspects in the comparison of alternative strategies point,
in a number of cases, to the introduction of nuclear power being the optimum strategy.  Such
findings must, of course, be supplemented by considerations concerning industrial
infrastructure, manpower, availability of capital, etc.
<P>
     The International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment, which will
be held next month in Vienna, will provide a forum for senior planners and analysts to review
recent progress in the comparative assessment of different energy sources.
<P>
     Nuclear power alone cannot solve all of the problems involved in achieving a secure and
sustainable energy supply worldwide but - together with renewable sources and energy
conservation - it could play a very significant role in stable and sustainable energy strategies
for the world.  The Agency must continue to make available the data that are relevant in this
regard and factual information about the central issues of nuclear safety, waste disposal and
non-proliferation, which are at the root of many people's concern about nuclear power.
<P>
<B>The Outlook for 1996 and Beyond</B>
<P>
     The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has encouraged wide public scrutiny of
the UN system.  It is to be welcomed that shortcomings are identified and  improvements and
reforms proposed.  Rejecting multilateralism, however, will only take us backward.  We must
recognize that multilateral organizations, for a variety of purposes, are indispensible and that
in the future ever more will be expected of them.
<P>
     For the Agency it is clear that co-ordination and co-operation amongst international
organizations remains one of the goals towards which we must all strive.  This was a major
theme of a meeting hosted by the IAEA here in Vienna last February of the UN Administrative
Committee on Co-ordination (ACC) chaired by the Secretary-General.
<P>
     The expanding responsibilities of the IAEA, and the legitimate expectation that we
identify priorities and limit costs, require that we continue a close critical scrutiny of
programmes and seek rationalization of work methods.  In this regard, let me note:
<P>
     First, that the rolling medium-term perspective that we have established - last year the
General Conference had before it a draft Medium Term Plan for 1995-2000 - is designed to
facilitate an orderly phasing out and phasing in  of programmes, in line with the changing needs
of Member States.  The abrupt termination of programmes is often difficult and costly.  Such
problems of change can be minimized through programmatic foresight.
<P>
     Second, that in a two-day meeting last June a number of senior officials from Member
States met with the Agency's senior management to look even beyond the year 2000.  There
was an understanding that the Agency's roles must continue to evolve in various areas: the
verification functions will grow; many of our activities in the area of nuclear safety and
technology transfer will remain essential and programmes in the field of nuclear waste may
expand.  Further, although the acquisition of nuclear technologies will increasingly become
commercial rather than governmental decisions, the Agency should be ready to provide
impartial advice on pros and cons of available nuclear and non-nuclear solutions to problems 
- in both power and non-power applications.  It was also stressed that the Secretariat must at
all times be alert to the emergence of new technologies, be they nuclear, information or
verification related.
<P>  
     Third, that we are introducing some changes to rationalize the programme and
organizational structure of the Agency.  As I have mentioned, as of the beginning of 1996, the
new Department of Nuclear Safety will be established, thereby bringing together in one
organizational unit the full range of Agency work related to nuclear safety.
<P>
     Fourth, as suggested at the General Conference over a number of years, we have now
introduced a new presentation and format of the Annual Report, and harmonized the
Programme and Budget document and the Performance Report, and improved our procedures
for formulating programme proposals.  We thereby hope to achieve increased transparency to
our Members and increase their ability to influence programme developments in accordance
with their priorities and interests.  Further, we are well underway for the shift to a programme-
based system of accounting and control beginning in 1997.  Improved management through
training and application of the Agency's Programme Performance and Assessment System
(PPAS) should also help to bring about more effective programme implementation and
rationalization.
<P>
We are also achieving efficiencies through the introduction or expanded use of new
technologies, especially in the area of communications.  Many printed products are being
replaced by electronic ones.  As word processing and electronic mail become the norm, support
staff are able to perform a wider range of duties.  These efficiencies continue to contribute to
our ability to improve programme delivery.  As the "Internet" becomes a tool for the public,
the media and decision-makers, we are ensuring that many Agency products are available on
it (address: <A HREF=http://www.iaea.or.at>http://www.iaea.or.at</A>).  I would expect that increasing use can be made of electronic communications for the
business of the governing bodies and for the work of the Agency generally.  As an example,
the Department of Technical Co-operation is planning to encourage Member States to submit
project proposals in electronically readable form.  This would greatly help to reduce paper work
and expedite the technical appraisal process.
<P>
     Lastly, in response to resolutions adopted by the General Conference, special efforts
have been made to increase the professional representation of women and staff from developing
countries in the Secretariat.  The results of these efforts are reflected in document
GOV/GC(39)/15.  When the number of staff is static - as ours has been  - change is not easy. 
Also, some of our activities require very specialized skills from a very limited labour market. 
We continue to look for ways to improve the situation.  Member States could sometimes do more to help identify and make available
well qualified candidates from the under-represented target groups.  On some occasions we have
been unable to obtain "government sponsorship" for appointments involving women and
candidates from developing countries.  
<P>
     In spite of the constraints on resources, I believe we have managed during the last ten
years to deliver an expanding programme and to respond to needs of Member States.  This
result certainly could not have been achieved without extrabudgetary contributions from several
governments.  It is also in large measure attributable to the efficiency, skill and loyalty of staff
who have responded positively and creatively to the challenges.  I regret that this effort has not
been matched by corresponding improvements in the conditions of employment of the
professional staff.  The current remuneration scheme of the Common System is outdated and
compares very unfavourably with those applied to comparable work in other intergovernmental
systems, such as the OECD, the World Bank and the European Community.
<P>
     It is a great relief that the Board of Governors last week reached a consensus on a
package comprising the financing of safeguards and targets for contributions to the Technical
Assistance and Co-operation Fund.  It remains a matter of concern, however, that a zero real
growth budget is being proposed for 1996 - the twelfth consecutive year - and that we have not
been able to incorporate into the regular budget several activities regarded as essential.  Let me
conclude by recalling that the NPT Conference urged that every effort be made to ensure that
the IAEA has the financial and human resources necessary to meet effectively its responsibilities
in the areas of technical co-operation, safeguards and nuclear safety.  I hope that all the
Governments which gave their full support to these conclusions in New York will be equally
supportive in Vienna in the coming year as we grapple with the resource questions which arise
from the expanding demands placed on the Agency.  
<P>
Finally, I should like to acknowledge with thanks the continuing support and co-operation which 
we and the other international agencies in Vienna have received from our host,
the Government of Austria and from the city of Vienna.  The facilities we are provided here
at the VIC remain amongst the best of their kind in the world and do much to help maintain
the efficiency of our activities.

<TITLE>  REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS</TITLE>                                      
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REVIEW AND EXTENSION CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STATEMENT BY <BR>DR. HANS BLIX, <BR>DIRECTOR GENERAL INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>17 April 1995</H4>
<HR>
<P>It is fifty years since the nuclear bombs exploded over cities in Japan and the world
concluded that such weapons must never be used again.  It is also fifty years since the United
Nations Organization was created inter alia to prevent and resolve conflicts and to promote
disarmament.  And it is 25 years since one vital building block was laid for a nuclear-
weapon-free world, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which most of the world s non-
nuclear-weapon States have committed themselves not to acquire such weapons, in which all
the declared nuclear-weapon States have committed themselves to negotiations for nuclear
and general disarmament and all parties have pledged to promote the transfer of peaceful
nuclear technology to other parties.
<P>The Treaty has been severely criticized by many for double standards - tolerating a
nuclear arms race for nuclear-weapon States and demanding renunciation of nuclear weapons
for others.  However, today, when nuclear disarmament is accelerating and when the transfer
of peaceful nuclear technology is growing, the Treaty is beginning to fulfil the hopes that
were attached to it.
<P>It is not difficult to see what is bringing this success.  Nor is it difficult to see what
is still missing.
<P>The primary incentive to the acquisition of nuclear weapons has always been States 
concerns about their national security.  As the Cold War has ended, the risk of war between
great powers is becoming remote and national stockpiles of nuclear weapons are being
drastically cut.  Perhaps they can be altogether eliminated some time in the future.  The
insecurity that States face today lies rather in the economic and environmental fields. 
Nuclear weapons are of no use against trade deficits, drought or global warming.
<P>Even though growing detente is generally reducing the relevance of nuclear weapons,
there is still justified concern about the threat they pose and there is a difficult distance to
go before nuclear disarmament is accomplished and non-proliferation commitments are
universal.  There is also increased concern about the reliability of certain commitments,
about the possible clandestine development or retention of a nuclear-weapon capacity.  Just
as a reliable renunciation of nuclear weapons is mutually reinforcing between neighbours and
within regions, doubts about the genuineness of such renunciations will mutually undermine
such commitments.  Continued international vigilance and efforts to maintain and expand
detente globally and regionally, strengthened international co-operation and effective
international verification are required to ensure reliability and confidence.
<P>The International Atomic Energy Agency, which I represent, is given an important
role in the implementation and fulfillment of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  First, it is
responsible under Article III of the Treaty to verify that non-nuclear-weapon States parties
to the Treaty are not diverting nuclear material from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices.  Second, under Article IV of the Treaty, the Agency
provides the main multilateral channel for expanding of the application of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes.  Further it is providing the verification systems for nuclear-weapon-free
zones envisaged in Article VII and is contributing also to the verification of activities relevant
to Article VI.
<P>During the preparatory phase of this Conference, the IAEA has submitted
comprehensive documentation about its work.  I shall offer some further comments on the
role of the Agency in the principal areas to which I have just referred.
<P><B>The IAEA Safeguards System</B>
<P>Acceptance of IAEA safeguards by non-nuclear-weapon States party to the NPT is
required under the Treaty because the parties need credible assurance that nuclear material
and installations are used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  To provide such assurance
safeguards must be effective.  Ineffective safeguards may be worse than none, because they
might inspire misplaced confidence -  with serious consequences.  However, we must
recognize that while States want the safeguards system to give a high degree of assurance,
they often want a minimum degree of intrusion when they themselves are subject to the
safeguards.  States are no different from individuals in this regard: we want the legal system
to give us maximum protection but we don t want to give the authorities unrestricted access
to our homes.
<P>When the NPT-type safeguards were first designed, there were many concerns in
governments and the nuclear industry that they might impede legitimate technical
developments or reveal commercial or industrial secrets.  These concerns proved unwarranted
and industry now accepts and supports safeguards and recognizes them as a prerequisite for
public acceptance and for international nuclear trade.  
<P>The number of States having safeguards agreements with the IAEA has gone up from
64 in 1975 to 118 in 1994.  Of the latter 102 were concluded pursuant to the NPT.  Even
so, as of April 1995, no less than 61 States for which the NPT is in force, have not yet
concluded the safeguards agreements which are required under the Treaty.  In many cases
the missing agreements have been outstanding for years despite repeated reminders from the
IAEA.  Even though most of these States have no items warranting safeguards, this state of
affairs is not acceptable.
<P>What is verified under these agreements?  By late 1994, 170 power reactors, 158
research reactors and critical assemblies, 196 other facilities and 334 locations outside
facilities were under safeguards.  Significant increases are foreseen, not least because of the
NPT accession of nearly all the newly independent States of the former Soviet Union,
including Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine. The quantity of nuclear material under
safeguards, particularly plutonium and highly enriched uranium, is also increasing rapidly. 
<P><B>Lessons from the Case of Iraq</B>
<P>I turn to the lessons learned in the field of safeguards since the NPT Conference in
1990 and I begin with the case of Iraq.  Under safeguards agreements concluded pursuant
to the NPT, all nuclear material and installations in a State are subject to safeguards. Yet,
the safeguards system was designed essentially to detect diversion of nuclear material in
declared installations.  It was not designed to detect nuclear installations which were not
declared, and material that might be contained in such installations.  Evidently the detection
of undeclared material and installations raises difficult problems.  Inspectors cannot go at
random in search of non-declared installations, nor do the safeguards agreements authorize
this.  Inspectors must have information to lead them to relevant questions and to relevant
sites.  In the case of Iraq before the Gulf War reliable information of this kind was
unavailable to the IAEA inspectorate - and apparently also to governments.  There was a
rude awakening after the war to the inability of the safeguards system as then practised to
detect undeclared nuclear installations.  Already the first several IAEA inspection missions
under the mandate of the Security Council resolution 687 (1991) revealed that, apart from
the previously declared and safeguarded quantities of nuclear material which had not been
diverted by Iraq, there existed large undeclared nuclear installations inter alia for the
enrichment of uranium.  What had not been possible to detect with the standard safeguards
measures practiced under the NPT, became possible to detect in the case of Iraq through the
additional information and inspection rights and techniques that became available to the IAEA
in the wake of the Gulf War. 
<P>The inspection system mandated by the Security Council in the case of Iraq and
explicitly accepted by Iraq as part of the cease-fire gave the IAEA inspectorate incomparably
wider powers than States have given the Agency under NPT-type safeguards agreements. 
By using these wide inspection rights and the information obtained from Member States and
with the strong support of the Security Council the Agency has now been able to draw a
coherent and consistent picture of the Iraqi nuclear programme and to remove or neutralize
items prohibited under the Security Council resolution.
<P>Some media and academic circles have criticized the IAEA for the failure to detect
the undeclared nuclear programme in Iraq and some have suggested that safeguards
inspections under the NPT, would also become more effective if they were performed by an
institution under the Security Council.  This, I submit, is a facile and erroneous view.
<P>Safeguards verification under the NPT, like verification in Iraq, is based on the
express agreement of States.  Although it is of course within the prerogative of the Security
Council, if need be, to induce NPT States to live up to their duties under the safeguards
agreements, it must be recognized that the States parties to NPT type safeguards agreements
have not accepted anything similar to the far-reaching  inspection regime which Iraq was
compelled to accept in connection with the cease fire.  Safeguards under the NPT need to be
made more effective, not through administration under the authority of the Security Council
but, in the first place, by agreement of States to accept measures which give the IAEA
greater access to information and to sites.  Proposals for such measures are now before the
IAEA which - if accepted by States - will significantly increase the level of assurance
regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear activities - without, however, being as intrusive
as the inspections mandated by the Security Council for Iraq.
<P>Having said this, I would like to underline that since 1990, fully in accordance with
the relationship agreement between the IAEA and the United Nations, a much closer
interaction has been established between the Agency and the Security Council including
several informal briefings of the Council by the IAEA.  In its summit statement of 1992 the
Council emphasized  the integral role in the implementation of the [Non-Proliferation] Treaty
of fully effective IAEA safeguards ...  and added that
<P>The Members of the Council will take appropriate measures in the case of any
     violation notified to them by the IAEA. 
<P>Since the adoption in 1992 of the summit statement,  secure communications links
have been established up between the Secretary-General and myself and I have offered to
brief the Council informally on Agency verification activities as often as it may be desired
and in any case once a year at the time when the Agency submits its annual report to the
General Assembly.
<P><B>The Lessons from the Case of South Africa</B>
<P>South Africa is the first country to have rolled back from a nuclear-weapon status. 
To demonstrate to the world that all the nuclear weapons which it had built before joining
the NPT were dismantled and that all the nuclear material in South Africa was accounted for. 
For this purpose, South Africa has co-operated fully with the Agency.  Several lessons have
been drawn from this co-operation.
<P>First, transparency regarding all nuclear related activities is important to build
confidence in the completeness and correctness of a State s declaration of nuclear material
and installations.
<P>Second, a voluntary offer to go beyond standard obligations and accept Agency
inspection "anywhere any time", on a case by case basis,  helps to inspire confidence.  It
goes without saying that in taking up such offers the Agency, while sometimes asking to see
sites that may be military, is prepared to make arrangements to protect legitimate military
secrets from being revealed during inspection.
<P>Third, it is important for the Agency to have inspectors who have some knowledge
and understanding of nuclear weapons design and production.
<P>Fourth, even in the case where the Agency has been shown the most extensive co-
operation and openness and has conducted the most extensive inspections, it cannot positively
affirm that a declaration presented is correct and complete.  It can only report that after very
thorough verification, nothing has been found suggesting the contrary.
<P><B>The Lessons from the Case of the DPRK</B>
<P>The case of the DPRK shows inter alia that, by 1992, some of the safeguards
strengthening measures put in place by the IAEA following Iraq were working.  It was the
use of advanced analytical techniques which helped to confirm the conclusion that there was
more plutonium in the DPRK than had been declared.   Regrettably the techniques which led
to this conclusion do not tell us anything about the quantity of the undeclared material and
through the manner in which the DPRK authorities chose to discharge the fuel from its 5
MW experimental power reactor last spring, they have deliberately raised impediments to the
reaching of conclusions in this regard.  I want to stress at this point that the Agency has
never asserted that the DPRK has diverted nuclear material to a clandestine nuclear weapons
development.  It has no evidence to that effect.  It has had reasons, however, to report to the
Security Council that the DPRK is in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, that
nuclear material could have been diverted and that the DPRK was rejecting an Agency
request for a special inspection.  This, in turn, has led the Council and its Members to take
steps, which I hope will lead eventually to full verification in accordance with the safeguards
agreement.  It is important that until such time all evidence relevant to verification be kept
intact by the DPRK.
<P><B>Several lessons of general interest can be learned from the case of the DPRK.</B>
<P>First, that sampling and advanced analytical techniques are powerful tools of
verification not only with respect to present but also regarding past nuclear activities -
without really being  intrusive.
<P>Second, that satellite imagery can be very helpful to inform inspectors where there
is reason to look for evidence.  Although the DPRK has protested about the Agency s
reliance on such imagery it does not seem reasonable that the Agency should refrain from
utilizing a type of information that is available to the whole world even commercially - and
that has long been used for confidence building in the field of arms control.  I would add that
it would be preferable for an international organization to obtain such imagery from several
sources or from an international satellite agency.
<P>Third, that the Security Council determines on the merits of each case how it will
seek to bring about compliance with the safeguards agreements and respect for NPT
obligations.  The case of DPRK is very different from that of Iraq.  The agreed framework
reached by the United States and the DPRK and reported to the Security Council involves
a freeze of a number of nuclear installations in the DPRK.
<P>While the Agency is now enabled, with a degree of co-operation from the DPRK, to
continue to perform safeguards inspections which also comprise the monitoring of the freeze,
the DPRK does not consider itself bound by the safeguards agreement and holds that it will
come into full compliance with that agreement only in connection with certain specific future
events related to the progress in implementation of the Agreed Framework.
<P>For the general respect of safeguards and NPT obligations, it must be hoped that the
DPRK will offer a new declaration of nuclear material and installations for verification by
the Agency and that this will be done sooner rather than later.
<P><B>Strengthening of Safeguards</B>
<P>The current efforts to strengthen safeguards aim at providing more credible assurance
regarding the correctness and completeness of States' declarations of items subject to
safeguards and thus about the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.  They also aim at
making the implementation of safeguards more cost-efficient.   Measures already adopted,
such as the Board of Governors' affirmation of the Agency's right to conduct special
inspections, the early provision to the Agency of design concerning nuclear facilities, the
initiation of a reporting scheme for exports and imports of nuclear material and specified
non-nuclear material and equipment and measures to expand the Agency's information base
and analytical capability, all of which focus on increased access to information and to sites. 
 So does the major safeguards development programme (93+2) which started in 1993 and
which has now resulted in concrete proposals, the general direction of which was endorsed
by the IAEA Board of Governors in March.  
<P>Many of the measures identified in the new programme have been extensively tested
with the help of Member States.  They aim at obtaining information through such means as
a States' Expanded Declaration regarding its nuclear activities and through new safeguards
techniques, such as environmental sampling - which have proved to be effective in detecting
undeclared activities.  Other measures would aim at securing for Agency inspectors, physical
access beyond the "strategic points" specified in the safeguards agreements.
<P>The additional cost of some new activities may be offset by reductions in certain
routine inspections which are currently carried out.  What is certain is that more co-operation
will be required.  Increased Agency access to nuclear and nuclear-related sites, sometimes
on a "short-notice" or a "no-notice" basis, will be asked.  This should not be difficult to
accept if safeguards are seen by States not as an imposition but as an opportunity to
demonstrate non-proliferation bona-fides.  Moreover, if, as parties to the Chemical Weapons
Convention, States can commit themselves to the issuing of multiple entry visas for
designated inspectors, to a simplified system of inspector designation and to prompt access
to facilities, it is hard to understand why similar arrangements should not be possible in the
context of safeguards.
<P>Past NPT Conferences have stressed that the Agency requires adequate financial and
human resources to meet its safeguards responsibilities effectively.  However, a zero-real
growth policy has been applied to the Agency's budget since 1985 and, in addition, we have
had several years of forced reductions as a result of late payment of contributions.  The
financial constraints have disrupted planning and procurement of equipment, hampered the
attainment of certain inspection goals, and caused delay in the recruitment of safeguards
inspectors.  It is clearly necessary that the verification function of the Agency be securely,
and sufficiently funded. 
<P>To conclude - the verification system of the IAEA is a key component of the non-
proliferation rgime and the Agency is making substantial efforts to strengthen it.  The
success of these efforts depends ultimately on the extent to which parties are willing to give
the Agency the political support, authority and resources it needs to cope with the
expectations now placed upon it.
<P>Let me now refer to some matters that do not relate to NPT type safeguards but which
are germane to the broader question of non-proliferation.
<P><B>Trafficking</B>
<P>A problem that has raised increasing concern over the last few years has been the
illegal trafficking in nuclear materials.  Unauthorized and uncontrolled movement of nuclear
material can lead to radiation hazards and - in some cases - proliferation risks, depending
upon the quantity and kind of material.  However, in these cases it is not a government
which is diverting nuclear material but individuals violating the legal order enacted by a
government.  The first line of defense against such diversion is evidently by national
governments themselves acting individually or collectively to strengthen police and customs
surveillance. However, some other types of measures are taken by the IAEA to assist States. 
These measures include establishing a data bank, and advising on state systems of nuclear
material accountancy and control. 
<P><B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones</B>
<P>In several parts of the world regional non-proliferation treaties are in force or in the
making.  In some cases States which are not party to the NPT have made similar non-
proliferation commitments under regional treaties, such as the Tlatelolco Treaty, the
Rarotonga Treaty and the treaty which will create an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. 
In all these cases comprehensive IAEA safeguards of substantially the same kind as under
the NPT are required.
<P>The IAEA is also actively engaged in an examination of what safeguards arrangements
would be appropriate in a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Given the conflict-
ridden history of this region and the deep distrust existing among some of the prospective
parties it is clear that verification would have to be particularly thorough - perhaps embracing
a combination of bilateral, regional and multilateral measures.
<P><B>Other Reliance on the IAEA Verification Capacity</B>
<P>Article VI of the NPT calls upon the parties  to pursue negotiations in good faith on
effective measures relating to the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament .  One of the fortunate results of the end of the Cold War is that there are now
several agreements to demonstrate progress under this Article and a hope for even more to
come.
<P>IAEA safeguards are directly relevant in the implementation of some of these
agreements.  As a result of the dismantling of nuclear weapons under disarmament
agreements between the United States and Russia considerable quantities of nuclear material
arise in excess of defence needs.  For its part the United States has placed some quantities
of such material under safeguards in pursuance of its voluntary offer agreement with the
Agency.  Although the submission has not yet been made firmly irrevocable this appears to
be the intention.  The Agency is ready to provide similar verification to material which
Russia or other nuclear-weapon States may place under safeguards.
<P>Let me also mention that a non-discriminatory ban on the production of fissile
material - a so-called cut-off agreement - as called for by the General Assembly, is a measure
which might well be subject to IAEA verification.  The Agency s verification capabilities are
sufficiently versatile to be tailored to the functional needs of different arms control and
disarmament agreements.  Indeed under the NPT the Agency is already applying safeguards
to the kind of installations that would have to be subject to verification under a cut-off
agreement embracing nuclear-weapon States and the so-called threshold States.
<P>There are ongoing negotiations in Geneva regarding a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
Such a treaty will involve several types of verification different from those of which the
IAEA has experience.  Let me point out, however, that there will be considerable overlap
between obligations under such a ban and under the NPT.  The 173 non-nuclear-weapon
States parties to the NPT are bound not to use any nuclear material for the testing of nuclear
weapons or other nuclear explosives and the IAEA is expected inter alia to verify their
compliance with this obligation - to detect any violation and report it to the Security Council. 
It is only with respect to the five nuclear-weapon States and States outside IAEA
comprehensive safeguards that the Agency does not have this task.
<P>Apparently various options are now being considered for the verification system to
be attached to a comprehensive test ban.  
<P>Let me respectfully submit that it would not appear to be necessary and practical to
create a new international organization for each arms control and disarmament agreement. 
It would seem more practical to place  clusters  of agreements under different organizations,
the most obvious being to charge the IAEA with verification of the cluster of nuclear related
agreements and to charge the Chemical Weapons Organization with a cluster comprising
verification of the ban on biological weapons.  There is no doubt in my mind that such
arrangements would be less costly and more effective than other options.
<P><B>Co-operation to Further the Use of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes</B>
<P>The NPT places an obligation in Article IV on all Parties to the Treaty to facilitate
and promote peaceful nuclear activities.  This obligation mirrors the main objective contained
in the IAEA Statute, and the Agency has, in fact, been the principal multilateral instrument
for promoting nuclear co-operation and the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology to
developing countries and also for facilitating bilateral and regional arrangements.
<P>A precondition for a responsible transfer of nuclear techniques, equipment and
technology is the existence in the recipient countries of adequate rules and structures for
radiation protection. Building up and strengthening such structures in developing countries
has therefore been and remains a priority activity for the IAEA. The development of an
international framework of norms and legal instruments relating to safety, waste management
and transboundary movements of nuclear materials is also an important way in which the
IAEA is promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
<P>The IAEA also promotes peaceful nuclear activities through a very wide information
exchange.  Scientists, engineers and policy-makers from developing countries participate in
hundreds of meetings organized by the IAEA every year:  symposia, seminars, conferences, 
 co-ordinated research programmes, etc.  They also benefit from the Agency's computerized
bibliographic database - the International Nuclear Information System (INIS) - which contains
nearly 1.8 million records and is growing at a rate of almost 90,000 records per year. 
Moreover, hundreds of physicists from developing and industrialized countries come every
year to the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. 
<P>Previous Review Conferences have expressed support for the Agency's technical co-
operation activities and have made specific suggestions which have subsequently been taken
up by the Agency.  Since 1990 we have been further strengthening our technical co-operation
programme.  The introduction of the "Model Project" concept is designed to maximize the
impact of our activities on the end-users of nuclear techniques.  For 1995, the Technical Co-
operation Programme of the IAEA comprises nearly 1400 projects in about 90 developing
countries, using an estimated $50 million of new resources.   In addition to this, the Agency
receives supplementary contributions from Member States for other projects approved by the
Agency but not covered by existing resources.  The overall programme involves support for
national development efforts utilizing nuclear technology, as well as support for activities
under regional co-operation arrangements for Asia and the Pacific (RCA), Africa (AFRA)
and Latin America (ARCAL).  The Agency also pursues projects in collaboration with other
international organizations such as FAO and WHO.  With a determined effort, we have been
able to increase the programme implementation rate to the level of about 70% of resources
allocated for 1994.  This, I am informed, is among the highest implementation rates in the
UN system. 
<P>IAEA technical co-operation activities to promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy are
described in documentation submitted to this Conference.  However, I should like to offer
you a few examples. 
<P>Emphasis is placed on nuclear techniques that can lead to improvements in the
production and preservation of food, in health care, in industrial production and in the
provision of fresh water supplies.  Such non-power applications of nuclear energy are the
types of technology transfer of greatest interest for a large number of IAEA Member States. 
<P>Environmentally sustainable food production is often effectively assisted through the
application of nuclear techniques, e.g. by mutation breeding of food crops.  As a result of
Agency programmes three mutant varieties of rape seed have been released to farmers in
Bangladesh and China and 19 mutant varieties of sesame have been released in Egypt and
the Republic of Korea.  In addition mutants of sorghum and rice are now being tested in the
field in Mali.  Other examples of projects supporting food production are several insect
control programmes which use the Sterile Insect Technique, e.g. eradication of the Fruit-Fly
in various regions of the world and of the Tsetse fly in Tanzania and other parts of Africa.
<P>Examples of health-related projects are national programmes using radioimmunoassay
(RIA) diagnostic techniques to screen newborn infants in Tunisia and Uruguay for neonatal
hypothyroidism and other congenital diseases.  
<P>Fresh water supply is an increasing problem and the IAEA is pursuing activities to
apply isotope techniques for the sustainable exploitation of water resources.  With some
Member States in North Africa and the Middle East, the Agency is also reviewing various
options - including one using nuclear reactors  -  for sea water desalination. 
<P>Some nuclear techniques, involving accelerators, can be used to reduce emissions
from the burning of coal and oil.  An IAEA project in Poland helps to develop and
demonstrate the economic viability of a process using an electron beam to transform into
fertilizer the sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contained in flue gases from fossil-fuel
burning plants.
<P>The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 advanced the concept of sustainable
development and adopted Agenda 21.  A very large part of the Agency's activities are
supportive of the objectives of Agenda 21, and of other U.N. System wide objectives,
including that of ensuring that special attention  is given to the needs of least developed
countries.
<P>Sustainable development offering better living conditions to a growing world
population will require greater use of energy, particularly electricity, in the years ahead.  But
what energy sources are to be used?  Fossil fuels today dominate and they will continue to
do so for a long time.  Yet, in particular oil and gas are finite and all fossil fuels raise
environmental problems.  Extensive analysis of energy options will be required.  The IAEA
and several other international organizations will stimulate and assist in the assessment of the
benefits and problems of different power options, including nuclear energy.  The Agency will
also continue to be a forum for exchange of information and expertise for countries which
choose the nuclear power option.    If an expanded use of fossil fuels proves increasingly
problematic due to the increase it will cause in emission of CO2 and some other greenhouse
gases, a greater global reliance on nuclear power may become a necessity.  Greater energy
efficiency and greater use of commercial renewable resources are not expected to go very
far to meet future energy demands.
<P>The co-operation activities of the IAEA depend upon financing through the Agency's
Technical Co-operation Fund (TCF), which receives voluntary contributions, and extra-
budgetary resources, from Member States.  The target contribution for the Technical Co-
operation Fund has not yet reached US$60 million, which is a modest sum compared to the
needs of a growing number of recipient countries for assistance in using nuclear techniques
for their development. 
<P>The IAEA provides a unique mechanism for the furtherance of the utilization of
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as envisaged by Article IV of the NPT - in medicine,
agriculture and industry as well as power generation.  Regrettably, since 1984, pledges and
payments against the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund target have shown a downward
trend - down to 72% of the target in 1994. I regret to note that some industrialized Member
States made no pledge whatsoever.  Much more could be accomplished if greater resources
were available.
<P>To sum up:     the IAEA, which has a statutory duty to promote the peaceful
applications of nuclear energy and to help prevent its military use, serves as a vital
instrument for the implementation of the NPT.
<P>The Agency must be enabled, through adequate resources, and strengthened and
streamlined safeguards,  effectively to verify that non-proliferation pledges are respected and,
thereby, to create confidence among the parties.
<P>The Agency's verification capacity can be employed in the implementation of nuclear
disarmament agreements which are to be reached in pursuance of Article VI of the  NPT.    
<P>The Agency can serve as a principal intergovernmental channel for the transfer of
peaceful nuclear technology among NPT parties and of assistance to developing countries.  
<P>I trust this Conference will ensure that there is no interruption in these services of the
IAEA under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

<H3>Statement by Director  General Hans Blix at the Opening of the<BR>
Seminar on International Co-operation on Nuclear Waste<BR>
Management in the Russian Federation</H3>
<P>
<H4>Vienna, 15 May 1995</H4>
</center>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
     On behalf of the IAEA I welcome you to this meeting.  We are pleased that the Nordic
countries have taken the initiative to the meeting and that Sweden and Norway have been
willing to fund it.  We are pleased that the Government and authorities of the Russian
Federation have responded so positively and are ready to share their experience and their
problems.  We are pleased that several other interested governments are participating.
<P>
     For the next two and a half days you will study a vast material presented by our Russian
colleagues and try to develop a clear and comprehensive picture of the radioactive waste
management situation in Russia, of the environmental implications and of political-economic-
legal factors that are relevant.
<P>
     It is not an academic study.  The goal is to try to lay a basis for an increased and
productive co-operation between the Russian Federation and several other Members of the
IAEA.  It will call for a clear identification of waste management programmes in Russia and
of the various institutions who carry responsibility.  It calls for an identification of specific
areas in which increased co-operation is desired and can be useful.
<P>
     The IAEA is pleased to serve as the forum and host for the seminar and to assist with
secretariat functions and, if possible, as a catalyser.  The Agency has a general responsibility
in the field of waste management and waste disposal.  In the last decade it has considerably
strengthened its activities in these areas.
<P>
     The starting point is that our generation has the responsibility to safely manage the waste
which it generates and must not leave the problem to our children.  We cannot harvest the
energy and leave the waste to our successors.  We are aware that the cold war and the nuclear
arms race lead to practices which are unacceptable - in several countries.  Large land areas
were contaminated and must be cleaned up - if this is possible.  To the public and to succeeding
generations it does not really make any difference if contamination has a military or non-
military background.  We need to come to grips - and help each other to come to grips - with
any radioactive contamination.
<P>
     As a general background to your discussions, let me point to some activities of the IAEA
in the fields of management and disposal of radioactive waste.
<P>
     As a parallel to its nuclear safety standards (NUSS) the Agency is working out a series
of safety documents called radioactive waste management safety standards (RADWASS) to give
guidance to Member States in the field of radioactive waste management.
<P>
     In March of this year the Board of Governors of the IAEA approved two documents of
great importance:
<P>

          "The safety fundamentals" (SS.111-F): "The principles of radioactive waste
          management"; and
<P>
          "The safety standards" (S-1): "Establishing a national system for radioactive
          waste management:.
<P>
     Like the NUSS documents these documents, hopefully will guide governments in their
policies and practices - but they will not legally bind them.  Binding international rules
concerning Radioactive Waste Management will come with the Convention that we expect to
be worked out during the next two years.  The work will start this summer.
<P>
     In two specific areas there exist international rules which are generally accepted.  The
first is the London Dumping Convention which regulated the dumping of LLW in the marine
environment.  Although no negative effects had been identified from this dumping, the parties
decided not long ago to prohibit all sea dumping of radioactive waste.  This decision evidently
closes one of the disposal options which was earlier available.
<P>
     The second area I have in mind is export of nuclear waste.  Guidelines have also been
worked out - within the IAEA - concerning such export.  The purpose is to prevent that nuclear
waste be irresponsibly dumped in poor countries.  It is possible that these guidelines may be
transformed into a Convention.
<P>
     The IAEA is not only engaged in norm-making but also in providing for the exchange
of experience and services and assistance to Member States in the field of nuclear waste.  The
disposal arrangements are often unsatisfactory in developing countries and some of the IAEA
technical assistance is directed to improving these conditions.  However, the Agency's services
in this field are by no means limited to developing countries.
<P>
     Upon request of any Member State the Agency will provide international independent
peer review of their arrangements in the field of waste management and disposal (WATRAP). 
This service is directed especially to large established national radioactive waste management
programmes or to specific aspects of such programmes.  It provides a means to compare such
programmes with international standards.
<P>
<center>                                  
***************
</center>
<P>
     This is the general background.  Let me now turn to the specific area which today is the
subject of our attention and for which you all have come here.
<P>
     It has become evident that nuclear activities within the former Soviet Union have left
a legacy which raises difficult questions regarding treatment, storage and disposal of radioactive
waste as well as environmental restoration.  These matters, to be sure, are part of a broader
legacy which must be tackled concerning the economy and the environment.  Our Russian
colleagues are facing formidable tasks and it is quite appropriate that the IAEA and its Members
provide them with co-operation and assistance.  The more so as some of the problems cause
direct concern also outside the borders of Russia.
<P>
     When we meet here today we have already a good deal of positive experience of such
co-operation in specific areas.
<P>
     One set of activities of broad geographical scope is a series of workshops sponsored by
the Agency concerning "Environmental Restoration in Central and Eastern Europe".  These
workshops focus especially on the radioactive contamination which has resulted from mining
and milling of uranium ores and which now calls for restoration.
<P>
     Another set of activities which has recently begun and which has also a broad
geographical scope relates to the Planning and Management of Decommissioning WWER-type
Nuclear Power Plants.  Some of the 27 WWER-440 type reactors are ageing and will soon be
decommissioned.  However, the project embraces problems connected with all WWER reactors
including the WWER 1000 type - regardless of when in the future the decommissioning is
envisaged.
<P>
<center>                           
***************
</center>
<P>
     The questions linked to the disposal of radioactive wastes and equipment in the Barents
Sea have been the subject of information exchanges between Russia and other countries for
several years and the IAEA has been involved as well.  Co-operation - especially exchange of
information - has centered in the Rovaniemi Process for countries with territory north of the
Arctic Circle and in the Barents Region Nuclear Working Group regarding nuclear activities
in the Euro-Arctic Barents Sea Region.
<P>
     The IAEA has been specifically engaged through a Co-ordination Research Programme
on modelling the radiological impact of radioactive waste dumping in the Arctic Seas.  The
Agency has also initiated the International Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP).  This
project will examine risk to human health by radioactive waste dumped in the Kara and Barents
Seas.<BR>
     The Arctic area and Murmansk region which I had occasion personally to visit a little
over a year ago is faced with many problems of radioactive waste management and disposal. 
One of them we know concerns the decommissioning of nuclear-powered submarines in very
large numbers.  This activity presents a challenge in terms of logistics, quantity of materials
to be handled, what materials must be treated as radioactive waste and what can be recycled. 
Not least problematic are the economic aspects.
<P>
     The procedure of nuclear fuel production and reprocessing in the former Soviet Union
has been the subject of changes, which in turn have led to an accumulation of spent fuel as well
as wastes at several locations.  The expansion and construction of new storage facilities will
have to be considered in the Russian Federation to maintain the production in a safe way.
<P>
     I hope that meeting under IAEA auspices and drawing on the Agency's limited but
independent resources and its rather large experience will facilitate for the States represented
here to organize co-operation in which their own large resources and experience can come to
play for the benefit of all.
<P>
     In a recent very specific case it seems to me this is exactly what is happening.  I have
in mind the case of Paldiski in Estonia where two naval nuclear reactors used for training in
the Soviet period are now being decommissioned.  In an agreement between the Russian
Federation and Estonia regarding Paldiski, provisions are made for an international expert
reference group to assist the parties in various ways.  This group is operational and had a useful
meeting here at the Agency two weeks ago, offering advice, recommending procedures and
work in conformity with good international practice.
<P>
     The present meeting has a broad scope and it offers an opportunity for a wide group of
experts to examine nuclear waste and fuel management issues in Russia in an international
setting.  I trust you will make use of the days here first, to gain a clear view of the nuclear
waste management and environmental problems that have arisen and continue to arise from a
wide spectrum of activities; second, to discuss how these problems can be practically addressed
and resolved in a systematic manner.  It is a heavy task for the many Russian authorities
represented here.  It would be good if constructive ways could be found in which the other
States represented here and the IAEA could help in the process.  It could even mark the
beginning of greatly enhanced international co-operation in the area of nuclear waste
management.

<H3>Director General's Speech to the 23rd Consultative Meeting<BR>
of INIS Liaison Officers</H3>
<P>
<H4>Tuesday, 23 May 1995</H4>
</center>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
     I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this Consultative Meeting of INIS
Liaison Officers on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the founding of the International
Nuclear Information System.
<P>
     In the middle 1960 s a number of IAEA Member States suggested that it would be
in the interest of all countries to establish an international system to provide information on
all peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology.
<P>     
     The efforts of many experts from Member States and the IAEA Secretariat resulted
in the design of a system with the mission of  ... producing and disseminating in a
decentralized manner a computer-based bibliographic database on all the peaceful applications
of nuclear science and technology and to collect and make available the full-text of those
items not readily available through normal commercial channels .
<P>
     In May 1970 the first electronic and printed products of this system were distributed
to Member States of the Agency.  INIS, as a co-operative programme between the Secretariat
at the IAEA and the participating Member States, was established.  It has proved through the
years to be one of the most effective tools for the exchange of information relating to the
peaceful uses of atomic energy.
<P>
     The novel feature of INIS was its system for the collection and distribution of data. 
All participating centres, including those of industrialized countries, have been benefiting
from the co-operation since they could stop processing literature published outside their
national boundaries (thus eliminating costs involved).  Developing countries in particular
have been encouraged by their participation in INIS to enhance their national infrastructures
for the collection and handling of domestic nuclear literature
<P>
     Because of the nature of INIS, a close co-operation was maintained between the
national centres and INIS headquarters at the IAEA through the efforts of the government-
appointed INIS Liaison Officers.  Over the past 25 years, INIS operations have depended on
the contributions from participating Member States and international organizations, not only
in the expansion of the database, but in ensuring that the system remained responsive to the
changing needs for nuclear information as well as to the changing technologies for
information dissemination.
<P>
     At the time of its establishment, the INIS system was deemed to be at the forefront
of the then existing information technology; during the intervening 25 years it has steadily
developed so as to maintain its position in the vanguard of information systems, while
maintaining its non-commercial character and facilitating the availability of nuclear
information to users in all participating countries irrespective of their levels of development.
<P>
     In recalling some of the major milestones in the development of INIS, let me just
mention the adoption of controlled terminology for identifying the subject content of
documents in 1971, the introduction of abstracts in machine-readable form in 1975, the
availability of the database online from the Agency s computer - on an experimental basis
in 1977 and on a regular basis in 1985, the availability of the database on CD-ROM in 1991,
the expansion of the scope of the system to cover, for comparison purposes, the environmen-
tal and economic aspects of non-nuclear energy sources in 1992, and, most recently, the
routine receipt of input to the system by electronic mail in 1993.
<P>
     INIS covers all peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology.  This means
that INIS continues to play a key role in providing access to nuclear information to support
nuclear projects worldwide.  It covers specifically nuclear safety and radiation protection,
safeguards, environmental effects of nuclear compared to other energy sources, and applica-
tions of nuclear techniques in areas such as food preservation and agriculture, human health,
industry and earth sciences, and physical and chemical sciences.
<P>
     The number of IAEA Member States participating in INIS has grown to 90 together
with 17 international organizations, and the database they have created now has records
referring to over 1.8 million items of nuclear literature and is growing at the rate of about
85 thousand records per year.  This makes it by far the largest electronic database of the
IAEA designed for Member State use.
<P>
     You are all aware of the fact that, besides creating an international database for
nuclear science and technology, INIS has played an important role as a model for other
international systems - such as the AGRIS system of FAO.  Many of its formats, standards,
rules, guidelines, and recently some of the software it has developed, have been adapted or
have formed the basis for similar entities in other systems or information services.
<P>

     The Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was concluded in New York only last week.  In my
address to the Review Conference, I stressed that the Non-Proliferation Treaty, through its
Article IV, places an obligation on all Parties to the Treaty to facilitate the fullest possible
exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information.  The Agency
has been the principal multilateral instrument for giving effect to this commitment.  An
important part of these activities occur within the framework of the Agency s Technical Co-
operation Programmes.  The transfer of nuclear information has been based in a large
measure on INIS services which, in turn, have been supported by a number of national and
regional co-operative arrangements.
<P>
     The world of nuclear information exchange has undergone substantial changes since
INIS was founded.  Financial constraints have become more severe in recent years both for
the IAEA and for many of the national organizations responsible for INIS activities.  This
has led to efforts aimed at identifying priorities for collecting and disseminating information,
optimizing operations and seeking more cost-effective methods for providing nuclear
information.  Parallel with this, there have been the explosive developments of Information
Technology and the resulting search for ways to use these developments to achieve effective
distribution of information at lower costs.
<P>
     During the past three years a number of tasks have been implemented by the INIS
Secretariat in co-operation with the Member States:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>an extensive study on User Needs was conducted in 57 Member States and 6
     international organizations - a report on this study is being made available at this
     meeting;
<LI>    a PC software package called FIBRE was developed and has become the basic tool
     for input preparation in 53 countries;
<LI>    optical disk technology for the storage and dissemination of full text of non-
     conventional literature is in the implementation process;
<LI>    a PC-based training package is under development to increase the efficiency of the
     INIS training programme, in particular to enhance staff skills at national centres in
     developing Member States;
<LI>    a detailed review of current trends in Information Technology and the assessment of
     their implications on INIS operations has been undertaken.
</UL>
<P>
     For the future, INIS will need to continue to upgrade its technical capacities.  It will
also need to ensure that it meets the priority information needs of Member States irrespective
of their level of development.  To these ends the INIS Secretariat together with its co-
operating Member States has launched an action plan for strategic developments of the
system for the years 1995 to 2000 and beyond.  I understand that the discussion of this action
plan is an important item on the agenda of the present meeting and urge that you give it
serious attention.  The INIS service costs some $5 million per year and it is vital that all
Member States can make good use of it.
<P>     
     On this occasion it is essential to recognize that what has been achieved over the past
25 years is due to the active participation of IAEA Member States, the participating
International Organizations and the INIS Secretariat.
<P>
     The presence here today of delegates from 68 countries is an indication of the
importance of the INIS programme to the respective Member Sates.  A number of keynote
speakers invited on this occasion will also highlight some of the past milestones of INIS, as
well as providing insights into some national plans for nuclear information programmes and
the opportunities offered by recent developments in information technology.
<P>
     I wish to assure the national INIS Liaison Officers of the importance that the IAEA
attaches to the information exchange on the peaceful applications of nuclear science and
technology.  Let us work together to ensure that INIS will continue to be an effective tool
for this information exchange and that users of nuclear information throughout the world will
find easy access to it through the products and services offered by the system.  Our efforts
in this co-operative endeavour surely bring us closer to the realization of the basic objective
of the IAEA as defined in Article II of its Statute: "To seek to accelerate and enlarge the
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world".

<TITLE>Inauguration of Ghana Research Reactor 1, Accra, Ghana,  8 March 1995</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Inauguration of Ghana Research Reactor 1, Accra, Ghana,  8 March 1995</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement by the Director General of the IAEA, Dr. Hans Blix,<BR>
on the Occasion of the Inauguration of Ghana Research Reactor 1</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Accra, Ghana</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>8 March 1995</H4>
<P><HR>It gives me great pleasure to participate, together with my Deputy Director-General
and Head of the Department of Technical Co-operation, Dr. Qian Jihui, in the ceremony for
the inauguration of the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor in Ghana.  My first visit to Ghana
was already in August 1960, but I have not been here since 1967.  Let me congratulate the
State of Ghana and its scientific community for the acquisition of this important research
tool.  In particular let me congratulate the staff of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission,
under the able and dedicated chairmanship of Professor Allotey, for having spared no efforts
in their co-operation with the IAEA, and with China as the supplier and helper in this
tripartite project,  to bring this important endeavour to a successful completion.
<P>I should like to make a few comments on the longstanding co-operation between
Ghana and the IAEA.  Let me first, however,  say a few words about the IAEA, which may
not be known to everybody here.   The Agency is a member of the U.N. family - like
UNESCO and WHO and FAO.  It is dedicated to developing the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy, and to preventing their misuse for military purposes.  We have 122 Member States
of which 26 are in Africa.   We have some 2000 staff in Vienna and an annual budget of
some US $250 million plus some US $50 million for technical assistance.
<P>Media mostly pay attention to the IAEA roles in helping to strengthen safety in
nuclear power plants and verifying the commitments that most countries have made, under
the Non-Proliferation Treaty and safeguards agreements, to use nuclear energy only for
peaceful purposes, i.e. not to develop nuclear weapons.  We have mapped and neutralized
the Iraqi programme to develop nuclear weapons and we have been heavily involved in
verifying through inspection that South Africa's nuclear programme is now exclusively
directed to peaceful purposes and that the bombs they had are dismantled.  Through our
safeguards system we are also involved in inspection of the nuclear programme of the DPRK. 
With growing nuclear disarmament we are also asked to verify that nuclear material for
dismantled weapons is not going into new weapons.  Thus we already safeguard some
nuclear weapons material - HEU and PU - which was earlier in weapons in the United
States.  In these ways we are contributing to peace and security both regionally and globally. 
<P>Another major task of the IAEA relates to nuclear power safety.  Through the IAEA
the states of the world develop nuclear safety standards and even legally binding conventions
relevant to safety.  The Agency is also providing services, at the request of Member States,
to examine operational safety, to provide expert advice, and to analyse accidents and
incidents from which lessons should be learned.  It has played and continues to play a central
role in the analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl accident.
<P>The Statute of the IAEA also gives the Agency an important role in promoting the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy for the benefit of mankind.   We have many programmes to
promote the use of nuclear techniques and technology for sustainable development.  Some 
- mostly industrialized - countries find nuclear generated electricity - nuclear power - a
competitive and environmentally advantageous option.  Some 17% of the world's electricity
is provided by nuclear power plants.  This is about as much as all hydropower provides. 
However, nuclear power is a demanding and capital intensive technology which so far has
made it less attractive to developing countries.  In the longer run this may change, if the
concerns about H-CO2 emissions from fossil fuels increase.  In many industrialized countries
the expansion of nuclear power has stagnated because of public opinion and limited electricity
demand during the past recession.   In others, and in particular in east Asia, the role of
nuclear power is growing strongly, for example China, Japan and Republic of Korea.   Many
countries have a greater interest in the applications of nuclear science in non-power fields -
in the fields of water resources, medicine, agriculture, industry and environmental
monitoring.  Much of IAEA's work, and co-operation with developing countries is directed
at providing training and facilitating the exchange of technology in these fields.   Our
collaboration with developing countries typically involves fellowship training, research
contracts, expert assistance and the provision of laboratory equipment and infrastructure.
<P>The efforts of the IAEA are of course determined by the funds available, but success
ultimately depends on the commitment of our partners in our member countries.
<P>Continuous national commitment to nuclear techniques and technology has made the
Agency's technical co-operation programme in Ghana one of the most successful in Africa. 
Since Ghana became a Member State of the Agency on 28 September 1960, its nuclear
programme has spanned a wide spectrum of activities, which in turn has brought the country
to the forefront in many areas of the applications of nuclear techniques.   This is a tribute
to the vision of Ghana's leaders since the early days of independence,  and to the efforts of
all those who have provided encouragement to the development of Ghana's national nuclear
science capacity.  The IAEA has been a helping hand but has also itself benefited from your
commitment by drawing on your pool of expertise for our own international staff and for
providing advice and expertise to other countries.  Over the years from 1968 the IAEA has
provided support amounting to some US $ 8 million to nuclear development in Ghana - of
this about 36% has gone to nuclear techniques in agriculture, 16% in medicine, 14% in
industry and hydrology and 9% in nuclear engineering and technology.
<P>Let me now highlight some of the important achievements resulting from the
collaboration between the Agency and Ghana.  Our programmes are designed to meet priority
needs of our Member States and accordingly agriculture and health are major target areas.
<P>First, let me start with an example which has a special connection with Ghana.  We
all know that cocoa is a cash crop of great economic importance for Ghana.  However, its
production has been seriously hampered over several years by the prevalence of a disease
known as the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV).   I am glad to tell you that an Agency-
supported technical co-operation project at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana in Tafo,
initiated in 1988 and completed last year, has culminated in the production of CSSV disease
resistant mutants.  The release of this mutant is expected to have a very positive impact on
cocoa production. 
<P>The University of Science and Technology in Kumasi has been engaged in a Joint
FAO/IAEA/Italy Coordinated Research Programme on the improvement of basic food crops
in Africa.  Through the application of ionizing radiation five cassava mutants which combine
high yield, disease resistance and improved cooking quality, have been developed.  At least
one of these varieties is ready for large-scale field testing, multiplication, and release to
farmers.  I am glad to report that the Agency is presently considering the possibility of
extending its support for this area to the next stage of demonstrating the field performance
of these promising cassava varieties. 
<P>The collaboration between the Agency and Ghana has been equally successful in the
human health sector.  This collaboration which started as far back as 1974, led to the
establishment of nuclear medicine services, including imaging facilities, at the Korle Bu
Hospital.  More recently, a radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility has been set up, and
low cost radiopharmaceuticals for clinical practice are now being produced on a routine
basis.
<P>The successful implementation of earlier technical cooperation projects in the medical
field, led the Agency in January 1994, to initiate a Model Project aimed at the establishment
of radiotherapy facilities in Accra and Kumasi.  Our 'Model Projects' are intended to
demonstrate the practical impact that nuclear technology can have on the community as a
whole.  There is no doubt that, through the implementation of this particular model project,
Accra and Kumasi will evolve as major referral centres for cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
We were honoured in November last year by a visit to the Agency headquarters in Vienna
by Ghana's First Lady, Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings who has taken a particular interest
in this project which has a special potential to bring benefits by way of cancer treatment to
the women of Ghana. 
<P>An essential pre-requisite to the successful implementation of nuclear-related projects
is adequate supporting services especially with regard to radiation safety and to instrument
maintenance and repair.  Here again, I note with much satisfaction the excellent facilities for
personnel and environmental monitoring that exist at the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission. 
Ghana is endowed with possibly the best equipped Secondary Standards Dosimetry
Laboratory in Sub-Saharan Africa, and could offer its services on a sub-regional or regional
basis, not only for training but also for calibration purposes.  I understand that the radiation
protection legislation, promulgated in 1993, is being enforced effectively by the newly-
created Radiation Protection Board.  However, the recent establishment of the gamma
irradiation facility and the research reactor necessitates the consolidation of the radiation
protection infrastructure.   In this connection, I am pleased to note that Ghana has become
one of the first four countries to participate in the Agency's inter-regional project for
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure.  The objective of this project is to assist a
number of selected countries to strengthen their radiation infrastructure in order to comply
with the international standards established by the Agency for protection against ionizing
radiation and for the safety of radiations sources.  We look forward to the active participation
of Ghana in this important project.
<P>I should also refer to two other significant developments.  The nuclear instrumentation
laboratory, which is presently being developed through a technical cooperation project with
the Agency, could subsequently be used for the benefit of the West Africa sub-region to back
the efforts which are deployed by the Agency's own Instrumentation Laboratory.  Also, it
is important to note that the recent commissioning of the multi-purpose gamma irradiation
facility has been accompanied by a technical cooperation project supported by the Agency
to utilize this facility for food preservation.   I understand that the Ghanaian authorities have
also taken the excellent initiative to use the facility for tests with regard to the sterilization
of medical supplies.
<P>Let me now, Ladies and Gentlemen, return to the very reason for our gathering here
this morning, namely, the inauguration of the Ghana Research Reactor 1 or GHARR-1. As
I said, this project has been completed thanks to the active and effective commitment of the
national authorities and the scientific community.   I am glad that the IAEA has been able
to be of assistance and that China has been such a competent supplier and participant. 
<P>With the inauguration of this reactor, Ghana is now one of the three Sub-Saharan
African countries endowed with a research reactor.    The main objectives of this project are
very practical:  to make possible improved analysis of mineral ores; production of short-lived
radioisotopes for agricultural and medical use; and enhanced training in the nuclear sciences. 
In support of this facility a  new technical co-operation project between the Agency and
Ghana initiated this year will focus primarily on activation analysis, experimental reactor
physics and radioisotope production.   Further training for scientists, engineers and
technicians is also envisaged, with a view to increasing your capabilities for the optimal
utilization of the reactor facility.
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, there is no doubt that Ghana meets the requirements in terms
of organization, national commitment, and availability of infrastructure and trained manpower
to make optimal use of collaboration with the Agency.  I can assure you that, from our side,
we shall make every effort to consolidate and strengthen this collaboration to promote the
peaceful use of atomic energy to contribute to the health and prosperity of the people of
Ghana.<HR>

<TITLE>"THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR NUCLEAR POWER:RECENT DEVELOPMENTS"</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR NUCLEAR POWER:RECENT DEVELOPMENTS"</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Opening Session, Fourth Biennial General Meeting of WANO<BR>Paris</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>24 April 1995</H4>
<P><HR>I am very pleased to have the opportunity personally to address this General Meeting of
WANO and not merely be a message on your big screen.
<P>The IAEA is an intergovernmental organization and WANO is an association of operators
of nuclear power plants.
<P>If you sometimes feel that the government is your adversary meddling in your business,
then I feel doubly grateful for your invitation because I represent not one but some 120
governments!
<P>However, I feel sure that members of WANO, although perhaps from time to time
irritated at government actions, know that a big modern industry can only exist within a social-
legal-economic framework that is provided by public institutions: concessions to operate, safety
regulations  and supervision, arrangement for waste, transport, etc.
<P>It is evident that the national state remains the key mechanism through which the public
sets the conditions for industrial activities, even where these activities may have transnational
effects.  There is no supranational government, legislating or supervising.  Yet, in many different
fields rules are needed governing relations between states, and there may be a need for the same
rules to apply in many or all states.  The field of communications is the most obvious example. 
We need common international rules concerning safety and supervision of air traffic.  We create
such international rules and supervision by agreements between states  -  by conventions and
other instruments.
<P>In WANO you have created a mechanism through which nuclear operators in different
countries can co-operate to learn from each other, and assist each other to function with ever
greater safety and efficiency.  This is to be welcomed and I should like warmly to congratulate
you on great achievements in a relatively short period of time.  Although there are some things
WANO can do which the IAEA can also do, I have never thought of WANO as a competing
organization.  I would rather say that any task that can be appropriately and conveniently
undertaken by WANO, should not be pursued by the IAEA.  Neither governmental nor
intergovernmental institutions should be made any larger than they have to be.
<P>Having said this I should like to discuss matters relating to nuclear power which do call
for international rules and supervision  -  an international framework. 
<P>Governments focussed early both on the peaceful and the military potentials of nuclear
energy.  The most immediate concern of the technology holders, notably the USA, was the
prospect that many countries might develop nuclear weapons.  This was the first, and remains
a dominant, concern - which can only be tackled by intergovernmental action.  As we all know,
the approach taken in the Atoms for Peace Programme, in the Statute of the IAEA, and in the
Non-Proliferation Treaty is to offer the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology, while demanding
a verified commitment to the exclusively peaceful use of equipment or technology so transferred. 
Much of the technology transfer today takes place through commercial channels, but a fair
amount is transferred through bilateral intergovernmental means and some 50-60 million dollars
worth of transfers occurs through IAEA technical assistance and co-operation programmes.
<P>The peaceful use commitments are all made at the intergovernmental level, through
bilateral or multilateral agreements, such as the NPT.  Verification, too, is exclusively
intergovernmental, mostly IAEA safeguards, but also under two regional arrangements, Euratom
and ABACC for Argentina and Brazil.
<P>On a number of points regarding the peaceful use of the atom and verification reality has
turned out  differently - mostly better - than was feared some 25 years ago when the NPT came
into force.  First, the famous pessimistic prediction of President Kennedy that there might be
dozens of future nuclear weapon states has proved wrong.  The declared ones are still the five
permanent members of the Security Council.  One - South Africa - has rolled back from nuclear
weapon status and three, Israel, India and Pakistan, are so-called threshold states.
<P>While no one can be complacent about the risk of a further spread of nuclear weapons,
it is fair to recognize that the efforts to prevent further proliferation have been highly successful. 
Those who claimed that nuclear power and nuclear weapons were like Siamese twins, and that
the development of nuclear power must be stopped because it would inevitably lead to
development of nuclear weapons, have been proved wrong.  The reality is rather that the global
expansion of nuclear power has been accompanied by expanded commitments to non-
proliferation.  It is not regarded as unrealistic today to aim at nearly full nuclear disarmament
by the declared nuclear weapon states and at universal adherence to non-proliferation
commitments by all others.  When this is attained we may hope and expect that nuclear power
will at last be freed from the evil shadow which nuclear weapons have always cast on it.
<P>Another fear dispelled has been that the safeguards verification of the IAEA would
impede technical development or risk revealing commercial or technological secrets.  Today,
nuclear industry tends to regard international safeguards verification as something as natural and
inevitable as national safety supervision - necessary for public confidence.  
<P>Our experience in the case of Iraq has shown us that to give the world a high degree of
confidence that no secret nuclear development is taking place anywhere, the safeguards system
must be strengthened.  This process is underway and we trust that the nuclear industry will
support the proposals which will give the IAEA access to more information and greater access
to sites as well as allowing the Agency to use new techniques.  I can assure you that the Agency
has no wish to be more intrusive than is needed to make the safeguards system credible - but
credible it must be.  The strengthened system will call for more information from, and co-
operation with, nuclear operators.  In return we expect that, if fully implemented, it will not only
provide greater assurance but will also considerably reduce the need for inspection of power
reactors.
<P><B>I turn now to Nuclear Safety.</B>
<P>Unlike airplanes nuclear power plants remain firmly parked within the national
jurisdiction of one state.  Nevertheless the safe operation of such plants early became an
international interest, inscribed in the Statute of the IAEA.  Here, however, inspection rights
were not created.  While one could not assume that a state would consistently consider it to be
in its own interest to refrain from developing nuclear weapons and therefore created safeguards,
one did assume that nuclear operators and the state in which plants operate would invariably
consider it to be in their own interest to be free of nuclear accidents and therefore did not see
a need for international safety inspection but relied on national operators and governmental
safety authorities.
<P>The international dimension of nuclear power safety, both at the operator and
governmental level first evolved through the interest in an exchange of experience.  It was good
to learn from each other.  The Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) are formally non-binding
standards building upon the common experience of many countries and encouraging best
practices.  They have served as inspiration and models for the national standards of a number
of states.  
<P>As governments have gradually felt the need for binding international instruments - an
international legal framework - IAEA guidelines and standards have also served as the points
of departure.  This is true of the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which
establishes binding rules mainly regarding nuclear material in international transfer.  When the
Chernobyl accident occurred, Members of the IAEA promptly made use of existing guidelines
to draft the so-called Chernobyl Conventions on Early Notification of an Accident and on
Assistance in the Case of an Accident.   Both Conventions have since been utilized - fortunately
mostly in arranged exercises.
<P>For a long time the Members of the IAEA were disinclined to go beyond
recommendatory standards and optional safety services like OSARTs and ASSETs and work out
a binding convention on nuclear safety.  However, in September 1994 such a Convention was
ready and opened for signature.  Its aim is to legally commit all states operating nuclear power
plants to maintain a high level of safety.  It does not make the IAEA a supervisory body but
states squarely "that responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the state having jurisdiction over
a nuclear installation".  This international responsibility of the state of course in no way negates
the premise of WANO that nuclear operators carry prime responsibility for the safe operation
of power plants.
<P>The Safety Convention emerged from the awareness which also lies at the root of
WANO, that nuclear safety must be at a high level everywhere, that basic safety rules should
be respected by all.  Effective implementation of the rules is sought by requiring contracting
parties to submit national reports on their nuclear power operation and by 'peer review' of such
reports.  The successful use, inter-alia, by WANO of the 'peer review' mechanism I am sure
contributed to the adoption of this model.   Some 60 states have now signed the Convention
which is expected to enter into force within a year or so.  Preparatory discussions have begun
on matrixes for reports and the organization of the peer review.  The IAEA Secretariat is now
considering how it might adapt its various nuclear safety review services to respond to possible
requests by states for international reviews which could serve as partial input to their national
reports.  WANO, for its part, might want to consider how its activities could be used for similar
purposes.
<P><B>Liability</B>
<P>All societies require that individuals and corporations be responsible for damage that they
may cause by negligence and, in particular activities, like nuclear power operation, also when
no negligence can be shown.  The need for clarity and predictability in the sphere of liability
for damages led to the Paris Convention concluded between OECD countries in 1960 and the
Vienna Convention concluded under IAEA auspices in 1963.  They are also part of the
international legal infrastructure relating to nuclear activities. The Chernobyl case demonstrated
that for transfrontier damages caused by an accident in a state not party to any liability
convention there was no specific mechanism for redress.  Nor, indeed, was there at any time any
ready procedure for individuals living in the state of that accident and sustaining injury to
property or health.  In recent years the absence of liability regulations in the states of the former
Soviet Union has deterred foreign nuclear industry from engaging themselves in these countries
for fear that any accident might result in claims against them under unpredictable legal
conditions.
<P>In view of this unsatisfactory situation governments within the IAEA have for several
years been working on a revision of the Vienna Convention.  The aim is to draft modifications
which will lead to a general adherence by states to the Convention, to raise the ceilings of
compensation, for operators and states, to provide for international supplementary financing etc.
<P>I do not propose to go into the many legal and technical aspects which are of great
importance to you as nuclear operators.  I would like to mention, however, that some time back
in the negotiations a proposal was discussed regarding collective contributions by operators to
a supplementary fund for the compensation of damages caused by nuclear accidents.  Although
in the end the proposal was not taken up in the context of the drafts now on the table, a
collective scheme by operators in the compensation of nuclear damage might still be adopted at
the national or regional level.  Such schemes might help to respond to the criticism which is
common that nuclear power is only shouldering a small part of the risks which it poses.  I might
add that compensation schemes operating in other fields do provide for substantial participation
of the relevant industries.
<P><B>Nuclear Waste</B>
<P>A great many of the pollution problems in our modern societies are caused by the wastes
from the burning of fossil fuels in cars, trucks and buses, in plants for electricity generation, for
heating and industry.  Acid rains, smog and global warming are linked to our use of fossil fuels
and are prompting governments to act at both the national and international level.  It is
paradoxical that waste from civilian nuclear activities, which in most cases has been handled
with great prudence and has rarely caused any environmental or health hazards, evokes as much,
if not more, concern in the public as does the waste of the fossil fuels.  However, as we all
know that is the case.  In the national sphere this is leading to justified strict regulation about
the manner of disposing radioactive wastes.  If the disposal of the waste from fossil fuels had
been subjected to equally stringent rules, the world would have been a lot less polluted and
damaged.
<P>Although the disposal of nuclear waste is mostly a national question, subjected to national
rules, here, too, international standards based on common knowledge and experience have
gradually emerged.  Since a number of years the Members of the IAEA have been adopting the
RADWASS - Radiation Waste Safety Standards - as guidelines and I should like to report to you
that recently the decision has been taken to work out a binding convention on the safety of
radioactive waste management.   A working group of technical and legal experts open to all
Member States is expected to initiate work in July.  So far experts appear intent to give the
convention a broad scope, covering not only standards for national management of nuclear
waste, but also transboundary movements and possible regional and international repositories.
<P>The rationale behind the proposed convention is similar to that behind the Nuclear Safety
Convention, namely, to ensure globally, through legally binding obligations, a responsible
handling of all radioactive waste, thereby also helping to allay public concerns.   I think one
might expect implementation procedures similar to those adopted in the Convention on Nuclear
Safety, i.e. national reports and peer review.
<P>The transboundary movements of nuclear waste is already the subject of some
international regulation contained in rules concerning transportation.  I should add that in
response to concerns - which fortunately have proved unfounded - about the dumping of nuclear
waste in developing countries, stringent international guidelines have been adopted which
prohibit any irresponsible practices.  I should also mention that through the so-called London
Dumping Convention, and the latest amendment under it, all sea dumping of low and medium
level radioactive waste, which was earlier permitted under certain conditions, is now banned.
<P>The new international ban on sea dumping responds to the wish of the public to protect
the so-called global commons - the high seas, the atmosphere, the global climate.  This brings
me to my last point, namely, the actual and potential role of nuclear power to reduce the use of
fossil fuels which cause emissions of greenhouse gases into our common atmosphere.  CO2
emitted anywhere is CO2 emitted everywhere. We know that if the energy generated by the
world's some 420 nuclear power plants were instead generated by the burning of coal, the CO2
emissions would increase by some 2000 million tonnes or 7%.  It is not difficult to understand
that more CO2 emission could be avoided if obsolete fossil fuel based plants were replaced by
nuclear plants and if additionally needed energy were sought in  nuclear power.  This, however,
is not yet what is happening.  Indeed, more and more CO2 emitting fossil fuels are consumed
and global CO2 emissions are increasing - not decreasing.  The rhetoric and the reality go in
different directions.  The use of natural gas in combined cycle is recommended by many and is
expanding fast as economic and as causing 40% less  CO2  emissions per energy unit than coal. 
It is often overlooked, however, that any given quantity of gas used gives rise to 5 - 10%
leakage of methane at extraction points and from pipelines.  Methane is a much more powerful
greenhouse gas than CO2.
<P>There is at present increasing concern in the public and particularly among
environmentally oriented groups about global warming and its possible cataclysmic consequences
in rising sea levels and climate changes.  Whatever the reality of the threat, at least the political
atmosphere is warming!  However, this common concern is not yet leading to concerted
intergovernmental action.  The only remedies which have general support seem to be greater
efficiency to restrain the burning of fossil fuels and greater use of renewable sources, like
hydropower, biomass, solar and wind power.  Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (the IPCC), which is to provide the world's government with scientific data about global
climate change issues, including possible responses, offers as a main scenario the development
of a world energy mix which by the year 2100 would consist of more than 80% biomass!  60%
of the world's electricity would be generated by biomass under this scenario.  Authoritative
energy institutions like the IEA of the OECD and the World Energy Council predict - I believe
realistically - a rather modest future role for the renewable sources and one must ask oneself
whether these green scenarios are not dream scenarios.
<P>In contrast, the nuclear option consistently appears highly effective to respond to the
expected increased global energy use - without adding greenhouse gases.  However, I must note
that in the climate change discussions the nuclear option is usually brushed aside with references
to operational safety, waste disposal and proliferation.
<P>This may change, if the concerns about climate change and demand for effective action
to reduce greenhouse gases increase.  We do not seem to be there yet.  At the recent Berlin
Conference on Climate Change, the Head of the IEA appears to have been the only speaker to
have referred to nuclear power, when he said that there had been an annual average improvement 
- i.e. reduction - in carbon intensity per unit of energy of about 0.4% between 1971 and 1992
and commented that it was attributable to the substantial growth in nuclear power over that
period.  However, he added that as nuclear power's share in the world's fuel mix is expected
to decrease, the CO2 emissions can be expected again to follow energy demand growth.  Was
this sustainable, he asked.
<P>It is not sure that the public in Western industrialized countries can be brought to
appreciate that nuclear power offers an economically competitive, environmentally benign and
independence creating source of energy.  It seems to take an ample energy supply simply for
granted, in a way that people do not do in the booming East Asia, where energy shortage is seen
as an unwelcome brake on development and all energy sources are looked upon as precious.
<P>It is easy to see that if rationality is to prevail much information is needed comparing the
economy and the health and environmental aspects of different sources of energy.  The IAEA
co-operates with several other international organizations in preparing and presenting studies on
these subjects.  Efforts must obviously also continue to further improve the good nuclear safety
record, to which WANO eminently contributes, to come to decisions on waste sites,  and to
accelerate nuclear disarmament and gain universal adherence to non-proliferation.
<P>Let me conclude: even though the nuclear power option should be and is viable
regardless of environmental considerations, these considerations are a very significant reasons
for an expanded use of nuclear power.  It is not claimed that nuclear power alone can be the
response to possible global warming, but it can be claimed that it is capable of being an
important part of the response - and governments ought to discover this.
<P>Lastly, there are those who stress the uncertainty of the climate models, which point to
global warming and who warn that we should not invest huge sums in action which might turn
out not to have been needed.  They do not suggest we should remain passive.  They rather
advocate action which we would not later regret, i.e. measures which would help to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and which would be meaningful and economic even without that
effect.  Examples are the planting of trees absorbing CO2, and investment in energy efficiency,
reducing the burning of fossil fuels.  I would submit that an expanded use of nuclear power,
which can be perfectly economically competitive, is a no regret response to global warming. 
The sooner economists and ecologists and governments discover this, the better.  I hope WANO Members will help them to do so.<HR>

<TITLE>"NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR A STABLE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY"</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>"NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR A STABLE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY"</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Opening Session, Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum<BR>Tokyo, Japan</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>10 April 1995</H4>
<P><HR>In this last decade of the 20th century our global population will grow from 4 to 5
billion people, most of them needing drastic improvement in their living conditions, inter alia
through greater use of energy, particularly electricity.  During this decade the world will
shrink further and we shall all get even more dependent on each other.  We shall be in great
need of international stability to avoid death and destruction through armed conflicts, to free
scarce resources through disarmament and to promote trade and development.  Two of the
most important questions we must ask are:
<P>Can we contain and eventually eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons?  and
<P>Can we use nuclear power as a major part in responding to our growing energy
needs?
<P>I can think of no place more appropriate to discuss and reach a hopeful conclusion
to these questions than Japan, a great power that has been uniquely successful in rapidly
raising the living conditions of its population, that has categorically renounced nuclear
weapons and that is rapidly developing nuclear power as a major economic, safe and
environmentally benign source of energy.
<P>But the questions must be examined not only with Japan but the whole world in view. 
I shall begin with the nuclear weapons.
<P>At the terrible dawn of the nuclear era, fifty years ago, there was only one nuclear-
weapon State.  It did not take many years before there were five declared nuclear-weapon
States and a few more having or being close to having these weapons.  The stockpiles of
warheads in the superpowers grew to many tens of thousands, sufficient to wipe out
civilization.
<P>It is claimed that the possibility of mutually assured destruction brought stability and
that the greatest danger to the world lay and still lies in a spread of nuclear weapons, to
further countries.  There would be fingers on more nuclear triggers.  While it is easy to see
the danger of proliferation, we would certainly wish our confidence in international stability
to be based on something less threatening than nuclear deterrence.
<P>Fortunately today the ideological and power struggle that dominated most of the past
fifty years has come to an end.  All great powers and most other States, too, seem ready to
accept that boundaries shall no more be changed by force.  This shift in attitude, which we
hope is permanent, and which is certainly linked to the awareness of our modern potential
for destruction, is leading to increased confidence in the stability of peace and international
borders in most parts of the world and particularly between great powers.  It is also rapidly
leading to accelerating disarmament.
<P>The superpowers are now dismantling their nuclear weapons so fast that there is a
major problem of what to do with all the excess fissile material and how to provide assurance
that its removal from military inventories is irreversible.  We are also hopeful that a world
wide ban can be reached on the further production of nuclear material for weapons use and
that a comprehensive ban on any further testing of nuclear weapons can be agreed.  Can we
thus begin seriously to hope for fulfilment of the double aim of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty - disarmament by the declared nuclear-weapon States and renunciation of nuclear
weapons by all others?  If so, it would mean that the States of the world eventually
abandoned the option of war in international relations and turned to settle conflicts by other
means.  If so, vast resources now devoted to armed forces could be released for
development.  Some hard-headed statesmen are, indeed, beginning to think of a world in
which the only remaining nuclear weapons would be controlled by some international security
body.  Evidently such a state of affairs is far away, however, and we must now focus on
maintaining stability and balance during the first steps in the march away from the nuclear
brink.  Effective verification will be an indispensible element in all measures leading to
nuclear disarmament.  The IAEA, which has a long experience in this field, is ready to
provide verification services.  It is building on its experience and seeking to strengthen and
develop the effectiveness of its verification.
<P>The production of nuclear material for weapons and the construction of weapons will
be within the ability of an ever growing number of States in a technologically advancing
world.  It remains important to avoid any incentives to such weapons production by creating
or maintaining detente globally and regionally.  Another matter of importance will be to
demonstrate that any departure from nuclear disarmament or arms control agreements would
be dealt with decisively.  A third requirement will be for effective international verification.
<P>In one week s time a conference begins in New York to examine whether the Non-
Proliferation Treaty is to be extended for an unlimited or a specific period of time.  There
can be no doubt that this treaty and the other treaties under which States have renounced
nuclear weapons, the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Rarotonga Treaty, are contributing to
stability.  With Cuba recently signing the Tlatelolco Treaty we can expect that this treaty will
soon enter into force fully and make Latin America and the Caribbean a nuclear-weapon-free
zone.  With South Africa and Algeria having joined the NPT and a treaty for an African
nuclear-weapon-free zone already drafted, we may also soon see such a zone become a
reality.
<P>Some outstanding areas remain.  In the Middle East one may hope and expect that a
continued peace process will lead to agreement on a zone free of weapons of mass
destruction.  On the Indian subcontinent the renunciation of the nuclear weapon option would
become less difficult if the global disarmament process continued further and if regional
detente were brought about.  It may be hoped, lastly, that continued stable great power
relations in East Asia and enlightened self-interest of all parties concerned will bring
arrangements, particularly regarding the Korean peninsula, guaranteeing an exclusively
peaceful use of nuclear energy .
<P>To proceed with disarmament and remain committed to non-proliferation States need
to feel confident that others are fully respecting their commitments.  In no area is verification
of implementation more important than in nuclear commitments.  After the discovery that
Iraq, a party to the NPT, had secretly developed the ability to enrich uranium and begun to
design a nuclear weapon, the world is looking to the IAEA to supplement its effective
verification of nuclear material in declared installations by verification that there are also no
clandestine nuclear installations.  Proposals to respond to this concern, and to make a
successful hiding of nuclear activities much more difficult, were endorsed in a general way
in March by the IAEA Board of Governors.  While these proposals will considerably
strengthen the effectiveness of safeguards, they are really not very onerous and the increased
cost for some of the new measures are likely to be offset by savings through the elimination
of certain routine inspections.  Implementation of the proposed measures will, however, call
for the exercise of good will and full co-operation with the IAEA.  In return the new
measures will provide a higher level of confidence that non-proliferation commitments are
respected and thus contribute to international stability.
<P>I turn now to the question whether nuclear power can contribute to greater stability
in the international society.
<P>Let me first note that experience has shown us that nuclear power and nuclear
weapons are not, as alleged by some, inseparable Siamese twins.  A large number of States,
including Japan, are using nuclear power without having nuclear weapons and one may even
be hopeful, as I have explained, that the process of nuclear disarmament will eventually
result in no single nation possessing such weapons.  As we proceed in this direction,
reducing the nuclear weapon arsenals and their role, we may hope that people s perception
of nuclear energy will shift from its destructive to its productive capacity - that is its capacity
to contribute to our welfare by generating heat and electricity. I submit that this contribution
is indispensible for stable and sustainable development and that it is high time that
governments publicly recognize it.  Let me explain.
<P>An increasing world population demanding more food and better living conditions will
need more energy.  Greater efficiency in energy use will not by far offset the expanded need,
which naturally will be the greatest in the developing countries.  Today a Swede uses some
17 000 kWh/year and a citizen of Bangladesh uses 80.  Where is the added supply of
electricity to come from?
<P>The dominant sources of energy today are fossil fuels - oil, coal and gas.  They will
remain dominant for a long time still, but oil and gas reserves are expected to be exhausted
within less than a century at the current rate of consumption.
<P>We are much aware that nuclear energy in military use may threaten peace and
stability, we should remember that fossil fuels, too, sometimes pose a threat to peace and
stability.  Indeed, the interest to control oil resources and oil supply has led to great
international political and economic convulsions and even to armed conflicts.  While it is true
that nuclear energy can provide horrendous means of warfare, and that nuclear installations
could be the subject of attack in armed conflicts, wars are not fought over power reactors or
uranium resources.  On the contrary reliance on nuclear power plants reduce our dependence
on fossil fuels and give a measure of energy independence, as uranium fuel can be stored for
several years  operation.  Countries like Sweden and France with much nuclear power use
little or no fossil fuel for electricity generation.  In Japan some 30% of the electricity is
nuclear generated.  It is true, of course, that the world s uranium resources, though ample
today, are also finite.  However, reliance on breeder reactors could give an almost limitless
supply of fuel for nuclear power if, in a future, uranium resources should become scarce.
<P>Other alternatives to fossil fuels than nuclear power and hydro - solar power, wind
power, geothermal power, biomass - today provide only a fraction of a percent of the world s
commercial energy.  Although the share of these sources can and should increase, they are
not expected by authoritative energy institutions like the International Energy Agency of the
OECD or the World Energy Conference to be able economically to provide even as much
as 10 percent of the world s needs for commercial energy by 2020.  This assessment, I must
add, is not accepted by those who do not want to be driven to the conclusion that nuclear
power is indispensible, because they are opponents of nuclear power or because - without
being opponents - they despair about public acceptance of nuclear power.
<P>An important issue is now the concern that increased global use of fossil fuels must
be avoided, indeed that the use should be reduced, in order to limit emissions of greenhouse
gases, notably CO2, which inevitably occurs in all combustion of coal, oil and gas.  There
is a similar concern about the leakage of methane - another  greenhouse gas - from extraction
sites and gas pipelines.  This leakage is estimated to be anything between 5-12% of the world
wide natural gas production.
<P>The global warming issue contains a considerable amount of political and economic
dynamite and it is fast moving up on the world agenda.  The fear stirs us all that we may be
significantly affecting the world s climate and living conditions - making the atmosphere
warmer, perhaps making the weather more volatile and perhaps even causing a rise in sea
levels.  If sustained by further data this fear will prompt even stronger demand for stabilizing
action.
<P><B>But what action?</B>
<P>Some developing countries are already rightly pointing out that it is the industrialized
countries  burning of enormous amounts of fossil fuels that has led the world to this threat. 
At a recent Asia-Pacific Leaders Conference in Manila it was argued that the industrialized
countries should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by the year 2005.  It was not
fair to demand that developing countries that emit little CO2 per capita should hamper their
development by abstaining from using more fossil fuels, like coal, particularly if these
sources exist domestically.  While this argument is not rejected by industrialized countries,
they have yet to present and implement concrete policies to reduce CO2 emissions.  Some
experts and policy-makers point out that, although the rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere
is already a measurable fact, the climate models pointing to a further warming contain many
uncertainties and warn against very expensive policies which might later turn out to have
been unnecessary.  They do not advocate that we should remain passive and they realize that
our grandchildren might regret it if we did not take the threat seriously.  They rather
advocate that we should pursue policies which would help counter global warming, if one is
occurring, but which we would not later regret as wasteful if the threat of global warming
turned out to be a mirage.  They urge a so-called no-regret policy.
<P>Stimulating the efficient use of energy is often described as a no-regret policy, because
it would generally help to reduce energy use and restrain CO2 emissions and if the
investments were profitable no resources would be wasted.
<P>Shifting from coal to natural gas may also be a policy one would not regret, because
combined cycle gas use is at present very economic and gas emits about 40% less CO2 per
energy unit as does coal.  However, the security of supply could be somewhat uncertain at
the end of a pipeline and the stability of future gas prices is uncertain.  Nevertheless an
increased use of natural gas seems at present to be a preferred option in many places,
because it is less environmentally objectionable than coal and it is less politically
objectionable than nuclear.
<P>Shifting from fossil fuels to renewables like solar, wind and biomass cannot be
advocated as no-regret policies at present since these sources, in particular solar generated
electricity, are more expensive.  Research and development is recommended and large sums
are in fact used for this purpose.
<P>It would seem evident that a greater use of nuclear power would be a no-regret
policy.  It results in practically no CO2 emissions, nor in any emissions of SO2 and NOX. 
It is competitive even with coal and it provides energy independence.  It can be used to
generate electricity for which the demand is increasing the fastest.  It could also be used for
generating industrial heat, for district heating or for water desalination.  As large numbers
of warships and some ice-breakers are propelled by nuclear power, we know that nuclear
power has a potential - not much exploited - use for commercial ship propulsion.  It cannot,
however, be used as an energy source for automobiles, trucks or aeroplane - which do
consume vast quantities of oil-based fuel.  However, greater future reliance on electric trains,
subways, trams, trolleybuses, could reduce or at least restrain the consumption of fossil
fuels, especially oil-based ones for transportation purposes.  Should we succeed in making
electricity-driven automobiles economic and practical, a huge reduction in oil consumption -
 and pollution - would become possible.  Also, in the long term, there is even a possibility
to produce hydrogen from water using high temperature heat from nuclear energy.  The
hydrogen can propel automobiles.  In Japan a high temperature gas cooled reactor to provide
high temperature nuclear heat is under construction and hydrogen-propelled automobiles are
also under successful development. 
<P>The threat of global warming has elicited different response scenarios described by
the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which was set up by the World
Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Programme and which is the
most authoritative international body dealing with these matters.  These scenarios show that
an option known as the  High Nuclear Variant  and relying on greater use of nuclear power,
has considerable CO2 abatement capacity.  However, the Panel s latest draft report underlines
various concerns about nuclear power, such as safety, waste and proliferation.  Also it
highlights a  Low Nuclear Variant  scenario under which by the year 2100 renewable
sources, including biomass and hydro, would provide some 83% of the world s total
commercial energy supply and more than 90% of its electricity.  While this  low energy
scenario  may appeal to specific environmental constituencies around the world, it is
questionable how credible and how useful it can be as an answer today to the problem of
increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  Nor can we see evidence that governments,
authoritative energy organizations or utilities place much faith in it.  The needs for energy
are immediate but the technologies envisaged in this scenario are not mature, and not
economically competitive.
<P>It is undeniable that nuclear power, whose share in the world s electricity generation
increased rapidly from 5% in 1975 to 15% in 1985, has since then stagnated everywhere
except in East Asia, where it is providing a large part of the electricity needed for rapid
economic growth.  It is also undeniable that while, earlier, recession was responsible for
nuclear power s stagnation in many Western industrialized countries, today a main reason
for the stagnation is rather that many political parties and governments without necessarily
being negative to nuclear power, know that they can win some votes by staying away from
more nuclear power but are not likely to win many votes by advocating its use.  This
situation could change if the fear of global warming increases and sharper demands are raised
for effective action to restrain CO2 emissions.  While it would not be argued that a much
increased reliance on nuclear power, alone, would allow a sufficient restraint on fossil fuel
use and CO2 and methane emissions, such restraint is unlikely to be achieved without a much
increased reliance on nuclear power.  In a speech before the recent Berlin Conference on
Climate Change, a representative of the International Energy Agency of the OECD pointed
out that there had been an annual average improvement - i.e. reduction - in carbon intensity
per unit of energy of about 0.4 percent between 1971 and 1992 and that it was attributable
to the substantial growth in nuclear power over that period.  He was apparently the only
speaker referring to nuclear power at the Conference and remarking that nuclear power s
share in the world s fuel mix is expected to decrease, the CO2 emissions can be expected
again to follow energy demand growth.  Was this sustainable, he asked.
<P>As a result of the dilemma that improvements in energy efficiency will not offset
increased energy needs, that renewable sources of energy - apart from hydro - are not
economically competitive and that nuclear power in many countries is not at present, shall
I say,  politically competitive , there is in fact a continued global increase in the use of
fossil fuels and consequent emissions of CO2 from their burning and an increase in methane
leakage from natural gas production and transportation.
<P>What actions can we recommend to promote the role of nuclear power as an
economically viable major source of energy in today s world and as a no-regret choice to
help meet the concern about global warming?  I am relatively optimistic.  Someone said he
had great confidence in governments:  when all other options have been exhausted, they will
choose the rational course.  Let us hope so.
<P>The attitude of the public seems decisive to influence the governments - even though,
to be sure, the latter can influence the views of the public.  Even though governments can
influence the views of the public and should have a moral-political duty to provide
leadership, it seems that in the question of nuclear power it is at present mostly the public s
attitudes that influence government action.  A simple conclusion is that one must listen to the
concerns which lead the voters to be unconvinced about the merits of nuclear power and
either persuade the voter that their concerns are unfounded or take action to reduce concerns
that may be understandable.
<P>A first answer must be to promote more education and public information about
nuclear energy - through schools, utilities, media.  The most dedicated opponents of nuclear
power may not listen to such information, but many will.  The information must, of course,
show not only what benefits but also what problems are connected with the use of nuclear
power and how these are met.  It must remind the public that no energy generation is without
some risk to health and the environment and that the only rational approach - if we want
energy - is to compare not only the economic costs and reliability of different sources of
energy but also the risks to life, health and environment which they pose.  Such studies are
in fact carried out by a number of international organizations, including the OECD, the
European Union and the IAEA and a conference next year will highlight the results.
<P>Clearly a major source of public concern about nuclear power relates to safety, in
particular the fear of accidents involving radioactive releases.  In response it is not enough
to refer to more than 7000 reactor years of safe operation with Chernobyl as the only case
leading to significant radioactive releases into the environment.  It must be shown that
through international co-operation and assistance safety upgrading is speeded up wherever
needed, in particular in plants in the former Soviet Union.  Much has been attained already
but some further efforts do remain to be made.  We should also show that new nuclear power
reactors designs lead to continuously increased safety.  Indeed we might seek agreement on
safety criteria for future power reactors, e.g. a requirement that their safety level shall be
such that no plans need be made for measures to be taken outside the plants in the case of
an accident.  Such a requirement is already written into new German law.
<P>We must also demonstrate that, in addition to the national legal and supervisory
systems which have the direct responsibility for nuclear safety, an international infrastructure
relating to nuclear safety is put in place, creating international standards to which all are
committed and supplemented by services and co-operation to maintain a safety culture that
is, I think, unmatched by any other industry, except possibly aviation.  The latest addition
to this infrastructure is the International Safety Convention which was signed under IAEA
auspices in Vienna last September.  In the next few years we can expect the conclusion of
conventions on safety in the disposal of radioactive wastes and about liability for any
damages caused by nuclear accidents.  Perhaps utilities operating nuclear power plants should
also contemplate contributing to a joint international fund that could be used for
compensation and clear-up if any radioactive releases were to occur from nuclear plants.
<P>The second most important public concern about nuclear power relates to wastes,
which may remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years.  It must be pointed out, of
course, that the limited volumes of these wastes make it possible to isolate them in their
entirety and put them deep down in stable geological formations - something that is simply
not possible to do with the wastes of fossil fuels because of their enormous volume.  The
stark reality today is that the wastes from fossil fuels cannot be handled in a manner that is
responsible vis-a-vis future generations.  The world s atmosphere or the surface of the earth
are the final disposal sites of the heavy metals that are toxic forever and the CO2, SO2 and
the NOx that are released in the combustion.
<P>Action to build intermediate storages for high level nuclear waste and repositories for
low and medium level radioactive wastes must be speeded up.  There is nothing to prevent
us in the meantime from exploring whether economically viable methods can be developed
that would drastically shorten the time during which presently long lived nuclear waste
remains radioactive.
<P>A third concern of the public has been that the development of nuclear power might
risk to increase the capacity of countries to make nuclear weapons.  It is true, of course, that
the large cadres of nuclear scientists and engineers which are needed for a nuclear power
programme can also provide the talent needed for the production of fissile material for
weapons.  However, it must be pointed out that, contrary to President Kennedy s pessimistic
prediction years ago that there would be dozens of nuclear-weapon States, the expansion of
nuclear power in the world has gone hand in hand with increased commitments to an
exclusively peaceful use.  I am not suggesting that there is ground for complacency.  The
case of Iraq has demonstrated that there can be clandestine programmes and that vigilance
is necessary to remove incentives to weapons developments and to sharpen verification. 
Nevertheless the world as a whole is turning its back to the nuclear weapons era.  It is no
longer unrealistic to raise the double aim that those who do not now have nuclear weapons
should commit themselves not to acquire them and that those who have the weapons should
rapidly move to nuclear disarmament.  Freed form the evil shadows of the nuclear weapons,
the tremendous force of the atom might be welcomed as naturally as the force of gravity and
be accepted as a sustainable, environmentally benign source of energy contributing to and not
disrupting stability in our international society.<HR>

<TITLE>Remarks at the Welcoming Reception of the 10th KAIF/KNS Annual Conference</TITLE>
</BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Remarks at the Welcoming Reception of the 10th KAIF/KNS Annual Conference</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Director General's Remarks at the Welcoming Reception of<BR>the 10th KAIF/KNS Annual Conference</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Seoul, Republic of Korea</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER> 6 April 1995</H4>
<P><HR>It is for me a great pleasure to be present with you at this
reception of the 10th Korean Atomic Industrial Forum and Korean Nuclear
Society Annual Conference.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for me to
arrive in time for the opening session of the Conference.  But I am sure
it must have been very  interesting to lern about the important subjects
of the Conference.
<P>Many sessions deal with topics which are of prime relevance, not
only to the Republic of Korea but also to other countries around the
world.  I am tempted to make some brief remarks on these issues,
because the IAEA's programme contains several projects relating to
Nuclear Power, Advanced Reactor Development and Safety carried out by
the Department of Nuclear Energy and Safety.
<P>There are 432 nuclear power plants in operation and 51 under
construction worldwide in 32 countries as of the end of 1994.  Even
though nuclear power has a rather short history, it has accumulated
some 7200 reactor years of operating experience and supplies about 17%
of the world s electricity.  In current environmental terms, this has
resulted in avoiding the release of more than 2000 million tons of carbon
dioxide emission into the atmosphere, which would have occurred in
1994, had that electricity been produced in coal fired plants.
<P>The nuclear power programme of the Republic of Korea is a success
story and I would like to congratulate you on all of the achievements: 
ten nuclear power plants in operation, six under construction and eleven
other units to be commissioned by the year 2006.  Your programme is an
impressive example to other developing countries.
<P>Electricity supply strategies apart from seeking low costs give
increasing attention to minimizing the impacts of power generation on
human health and the environment.
<P>The most obvious environmental advantage of nuclear power is its
limited quantity of waste and the absence of SO2, NOx and CO2 emissions. 
If the electric energy generated from nuclear power each year in the
world were produced instead by coal-fired plants, there would be
additional annual emissions of CO2 of about 1600 million tonnes.  This
figure is significant compared with the 4000 million tonnes which the
Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere recommended as a
target for reductions in annual emissions by 2005.
<P>It is sometimes alleged that we don t know how to handle
radioactive waste.  This is misleading.  The technology for nuclear waste
management has been developed and in many cases it is already in use. 
However, the identification and acceptance of sites, especially for long-
term high level waste disposal are questions of growing urgency.  Waste
created by the nuclear power industry can and must be well managed or
it will become a limiting factor to further deployment of nuclear power. 
Examples of practices successfully adopted in some countries indicate
solutions which could serve for all.  The safe management of waste
requires appropriate political decisions concerning the location of
disposal sites and problems of a legal, administrative and technical
nature.  Every country using nuclear power must have a strategy to
ensure permanent isolation from the environment of all wastes.  It must
include effective long-term funding.
<P>Advanced nuclear power systems are currently under development
in several countries with a range of objectives, including improved
economics and reliability and enhanced safety.  Most of the new
concepts are evolutionary, but some incorporate varying degrees of
innovation.  Increased emphasis on passive protection, natural convective
cooling, improved inherent safety and stability in the event of severe
accidents, modularization, filtered double containment, increased
automation and digitization of control systems, and improved control
room design are some examples of new design approaches.
<P>I understand that ROK established special long-term nuclear R&D
funds a few years ago and has already started to design its own advanced
nuclear power reactor aiming to operate around 2007.  The high risk and
cost of developing advanced reactors, especially those based on
innovative concepts, make international co-operation desirable.  A
pooling of resources and expertise can be organized in areas of common
interest.
<P>Much of the IAEA activities concerning the development of water-
cooled, liquid-metal-cooled and gas-cooled reactors takes place in three
International Working Groups (IWGs) which bring together high-level
experts dealing with national programmes in these technologies.  Each
IWG meets periodically to serve as a global forum for information
exchange and progress reports on national programmes, to identify areas
of common interest for collaboration and to advice the Agency on its
technical programmes and activities.
<P>Small Specialists  Meetings are convened to review progress in
selected technology areas in which there is a mutual interest.  For more
general participation, larger Technical Committee Meetings, Symposia or
Workshops are held, often with co-sponsorship of an interested Member
State.  The  International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Power
Systems , which was held in Seoul in October 1993 and was jointly
organized by the IAEA and the Korea Electric Power Corporation is a good
example.
<P>I was told that the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute
suggested to organize, jointly with the IAEA, an  International Symposium
on Trends in Design and Technology Development for Evolutionary Water
Cooled Reactors , to be held in Korea in 1998.  This suggestion will be
taken up during the preparation of the Agency s programme and budget
for 1997-98.  I welcome this proposal.
<P>The shortage of potable water from available natural resources is
already evident in many areas of the world and will become more acute
in the future.  I understand ROK has also experienced a shortage of
potable water since the second half of last year.  Let me report to you
that in response to the renewed interest in the use of nuclear energy for
seawater desalination, the IAEA conducted an up-to-date review of the
subject since 1992.  Particularly in response to the resolution of the
General Conference of the IAEA last September in Vienna, the IAEA
initiated the Options Identification Programme, which can narrow down
a broad range of possibilities of seawater desalination using nuclear
energy to a limited set of practical demonstration projects.  This
programme could be carried out initially over a period of about two
years if extrabudgetary contributions were offered by interested
Member States.  I would like to welcome the participation of the Republic
of Korea in this programme.
<P>Tomorrow I shall participate in the inauguration of the Korea Multi-
Purpose Research Reactor, HANARO, at the Korea Atomic Energy Research
Institute (KAERI) site in Taejon.  The reactor design construction and
commissioning represents a great achievement of which the Republic of
Korea can be justly proud.  It is a demonstration of how the nuclear
technology has progressed in your country.
<P>With all the advancements made in the peaceful uses of atomic
energy in the Republic of Korea, the IAEA is now in a position to set up
technical co-operation projects to use the excellent training and research
facilities you have for the benefit of many developing countries,
especially in the Asia and Pacific region.<HR>

<TITLE>Inauguration of  the Korea Multi-Purpose Research Reactor</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Inauguration of  the Korea Multi-Purpose Research Reactor</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Director General s Remarks at Inauguration of the Korea<BR>Multi-Purpose Research Reactor</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Daeduk, Republic of Korea</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>7 April 1995</H4> <HR>
<P>Mr. President, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen ...
<P>is a pleasure for me to once again visit Korea, particularly on this happy occasion. 
The inauguration of the Korea Multi-Purpose Research Reactor, HANARO, represents a
significant step forward in the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Korea. 
This reactor will be the centrepiece of a nuclear research programme which will support your
ambitious development of nuclear power.  It will also provide significant radioisotope
production capacity for medical and industrial applications for years to come and it will
expand the research capability of KAERI.
<P>In the six years from the beginning of construction in February, 1989 until first
criticality in February of this year you have demonstrated the extent to which your technology
has progressed.  Overall management of this project has been Korean with construction and
much of the equipment supplied by Korean companies.  This is an achievement of which you
can be justly proud.
<P>The IAEA has assisted the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), an
active participant in the technical co-operation programme of the Agency, in developing
capabilities used in the design of this research reactor.  Presently, there is an ongoing
technical co-operation project intended to help KAERI to acquire detailed design capabilities
and up-to-date information on instruments for materials characterization and testing.  This
project covers the acquisition of advanced techniques such as high resolution neutron
diffraction, small angle neutron spectrometry, low-temperature irradiation and neutron
radiography.
<P>The expansion of Korea s nuclear power generating capacity has been impressive. 
With ten operating power reactors meeting more than one third of your electricity needs you
have reduced your dependence on fossil fuels and have avoided significant emission of
greenhouse gases that these fossil fuels would generate.  The Korean Atomic Industrial Forum
(KAIF) calculates that over the 17-year period since your first nuclear power plant, KORI-I,
went into commercial operation in 1978, there has been a cumulative production exceeding
500 billion kilowatt hours of electrical energy generated by Korean nuclear power plants,
more than 36% of the electrical energy generated in Korea over the 17-year period.  KAIF
estimates that CO2 emissions of more than 450 million metric tonnes have been thus avoided.
<P>The six nuclear power plants that are now under construction and those planned into
the next century will not only contribute to Korean prosperity, but will contribute further to
global environmental stability.  The testing made possible by the HANARO reactor will help
KAERI and Korean industry build reliable reactor components and fuel.
<P>The technical co-operation programme between the Agency and the Republic of Korea
encompasses a project on Strengthening National Safety Standards development and
implementation capabilities.  Under this project, the Agency is planning to send a Design
Safety Review Mission to the Korean-designed Nuclear Power Plants Ulchin 3 and 4 during
the month of May 1995.  Several international experts, together with Agency staff, will
conduct the review.  Other missions on nuclear power plants safety aspects are also planned
in the course of this year.
<P>The IAEA is dedicated to enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health
and prosperity throughout the world.  In this regard, we will be co-sponsoring the Fifth
International Symposium on Asian Research Reactors here at Daeduk in October next year,
one step in the pursuit of this objective.
<P>The Agency is indeed actively supporting co-operation among the East Asia and
Pacific countries in the field of nuclear power.  The Republic of Korea will be hosting the
first regional meeting set up by the Agency on  Operational and Safety Issues in Nuclear
Power Plants  scheduled from 10-14 April 1995 at KEPCO training centre near Pusan.  Plant
managers and superintendents from five countries in the region will attend the meeting.
<P>As a result of all the advancements made in the field of Nuclear Power Technology
by the Republic of Korea, you are now in a position to organize training programmes and
scientific visits for fellows sponsored by the IAEA in the excellent training institutions you
have.  We are pleased to note that the Republic of Korea has evolved from a primary
technical assistance  user  country into a potential technical co-operation  supplier  country. 
We encourage the Republic of Korea, with its large research and industrial base in the
peaceful uses of atomic energy, to share the technology acquired, in part through the Agency s
programmes.  Many countries, especially in the Asia and Pacific region, look forward to such
co-operation with the Republic of Korea.
<P>One area of IAEA activity which has attracted considerable interest is the use of
nuclear energy for the desalination of seawater.  This is of particular interest to coastal States
that, like the Republic of Korea, have limited potable water resources.  I am told that the
Republic of Korea, too, has shown interest in this technology.  The 38th General Conference
(1994) of the IAEA passed a resolution which has led to a programme of desalination
demonstration projects - the Options Identification Programme.  This programme will rely on
extrabudgetary contributions from interested States.
<P>Finally, Mr. President, I congratulate you and the dedicated staff of KAERI and the
companies participating in this project on this success.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>STATEMENT TO THE FORTY-NINTH SESSION OF THE
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY</H3>
<p>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, <BR>17 October 1994</H4>
<P>
<HR>
<p>
<B>Introduction</B>

<p>

     In 1995 it will be fifty years since the founding of the United Nations and twenty five
years since the Non-Proliferation Treaty entered into force.  For the International Atomic Energy
Agency these anniversaries provide occasions to review its role in the UN system and under the
NPT and to identify new needs and challenges.

<p>
     Although it is an independent intergovernmental organization, now with 121 members,
the Agency s Statute enjoins it to conduct its activities in accordance with the purposes and
principles of the United Nations, and the Agency looks to the UN for policy guidance in the
fields of arms control and disarmament and development and in acute political issues relevant to
the UN family of organizations.


<p>
     It is striking that the first resolution ever adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
in 1946 dealt with  the problems raised by the discovery of atomic energy .  Already at that time,
the tasks ahead were identified as the elimination of nuclear weapons and control of atomic
energy to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes.  Also mentioned - at that early stage - was
the need for effective safeguards through inspection and for exchange of scientific information.

<p>
     Despite the constraints of the Cold War, the IAEA was successful in pursuing some of
the aims expressed in this resolution and in the subsequently proclaimed policy of  Atoms for
Peace .  The Agency developed the safeguards system and it helped transfer nuclear science and
technology relevant to agriculture, medicine, industry and electricity generation.

<p>
     Since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, a major challenge for the IAEA has been to
develop and consolidate international rules and measures relating to nuclear safety and radiation
protection into a global nuclear safety regime.  And after the discovery of clandestine nuclear
activities in Iraq in 1991, another great challenge has been to strengthen the safeguards system
so as to reduce the risk that any nuclear activity which should have been declared, remains
undetected.

<p>
     With the end of the Cold War new opportunities for nuclear disarmament and arms control
have opened up.  As a result there are new expectations and demands on the IAEA in the area
of verification.  Similarly, the goals of sustainable development and protection of the global
environment mean new tasks and challenges for the IAEA.  I shall now develop these themes
beginning with the issue of non-proliferation.



<p>
Non-Proliferation

<p>
     The seriousness with which the Security Council of the United Nations looks at the
question of nuclear proliferation is reflected in the summit declaration of 31 January 1992, where
it was squarely stated, inter alia, that
<PRE>
      the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace
     and security .
</PRE>


<p>
Pointing to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Members of the Council stressed  the integral role
in the implementation of that Treaty of fully effective safeguards  and committed themselves to
taking  appropriate measures in the case of any violation notified to them by the IAEA.

<p>
     The Security Council thus made clear that it regards the IAEA as instrumental to the
fulfilment of its own task of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the cases of
Iraq and the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) demonstrated how the Council
relies on the IAEA as the nuclear inspection arm of the United Nations system.  For its part, the
Agency naturally has looked to the Council as the political organ responsible for handling any
violations of nuclear arms control agreements.  It would be wise to build on this experience in
the future.  In these days of electronic communications, close and continuous liaison between
Vienna and New York is not difficult.  Between the Director General of the IAEA and the
Secretary-General of the United Nations there is already a secure and direct communications link
and if the Security Council so wished I am sure informal briefings by the IAEA by closed circuit
television could be arranged.

<p>
     As the non-proliferation regime moves further towards universality and as nuclear
disarmament results in reductions in nuclear arsenals, it becomes increasingly important that
commitments made under the NPT and other nuclear-related agreements be fully respected.  The
1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, which will meet in New York next year, will have
before it detailed reports from the IAEA about the way in which the Agency is strengthening the
safeguards system in order to increase its detection capacity and, thereby, the level of assurance
it can give about compliance by States with their international commitments.  The Agency is also
reporting to the NPT Conference on its activities in support of the transfer of nuclear science and
technology for peaceful uses.

<p>
     I shall now discuss IAEA verification activities in specific areas.

<p>
Iraq<BR>
     Since May 1991, the IAEA has carried out 26 inspection missions in Iraq under the
mandate of Security Council resolution 687 (1991).  Based on these inspections and the analysis
of documents, samples, procurement data and other information, the course of Iraq s clandestine
nuclear weapons programme has been thoroughly investigated and charted.  As also required by
resolution 687, the IAEA has completed the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of Iraq s
weapons-useable materials, facilities and equipment. We are confident that, as a result of these
activities, no practical capability for the production of nuclear weapons remains in Iraq.
Nevertheless the IAEA retains the right to investigate any further aspects of Iraq s former
programme if new information should warrant such action.

<p>
     Concurrently with these mapping and dismantling activities, the IAEA has been phasing
in elements of its plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq s compliance with
resolutions 687 and 707.  All the elements of the IAEA s plan, which was approved by the
Security Council in Resolution 715 (1991) and accepted by Iraq, are now in place and a
continuing presence of IAEA inspectors in Iraq has been established at the Baghdad Monitoring
and Verification Centre (BMVC), with the assistance of the UN Special Commission.  Monitoring
and verification measures will continue to evolve as technical needs arise and advanced
technologies become available.

<p>
     A mechanism for monitoring future sales and supplies of designated items to Iraq has been
jointly developed with the UN Special Commission in consultation with the Security Council s
committee on sanctions against Iraq.  Once approved by the Council, this mechanism will form
an integral part of the ongoing monitoring and verification system.

<p>
Implementation of Safeguards in the DPRK

<p>
     In the DPRK, the IAEA has found evidence suggesting the existence of some nuclear
material - plutonium - which has not been reported by the DPRK to the Agency.  No progress
has been made in the Agency s consequent effort to secure access to additional information and
locations, as requested by the Agency in 1993.  Further, the problem has been aggravated by the
discharge of spent fuel from the 5 megawatt Experimental Nuclear Power Reactor without the
appropriate safeguards measures requested by the Agency.  Valuable information about the history
of the spent fuel was thereby irretrievably lost.

<p>
     In June 1994 the DPRK withdrew from IAEA membership.  However, this does not affect
its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and under the Safeguards Agreement with the
IAEA.  Although access for certain periodic safeguards verification activities in the declared
facilities was denied to the Agency s inspectors during July and August, most of these activities
are currently not subject to restrictions and the Agency has been enabled to maintain inspection
coverage of the discharged spent fuel at the 5 megawatt reactor on a continuous basis - in
keeping, inter alia, with a statement by the President of the Security Council on 30 May this year.

<p>
     So long as the DPRK is not providing full nuclear transparency through full acceptance
of safeguards, it will not be possible to verify the completeness of the nuclear inventory which
it declared in 1992.  To the extent that effective safeguards on declared installations are accepted
by the DPRK, the Agency can verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material from these
installations.

<p>
Safeguards in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS)

<p>
     An important development of the past year was the successful negotiation of
comprehensive safeguards agreements with Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union
having significant nuclear facilities.  NPT-type safeguards agreements have been approved with
eight of those States.  Ukraine, although not yet an NPT party, has also signed a comprehensive
safeguards agreement with the Agency, pledging that all nuclear material under its control will
be used only for peaceful purposes.

<p>
Safeguards in Latin America

<p>
     In Latin America, Argentina, Brazil and Chile have ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty for the
denuclearization of Latin America and Cuba has recently declared that it intends to adhere to the
Treaty.  We can therefore expect that the Treaty will soon enter into force and that the IAEA will
apply comprehensive safeguards in the entire region.

<p>
Safeguards in Africa

<p>
     South Africa's roll-back from the possession of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon
status and its accession to the NPT constitute a major development.  The IAEA has carried out
a great number of safeguards missions to South Africa under the NPT Safeguards Agreement
since October 1991.  After thorough investigation the Agency has found no reason to doubt the
veracity of South Africa s initial declaration of nuclear material.  Full membership rights in the
IAEA have now been restored to South Africa.

<p>
     Another recent positive development in Africa is the declaration by Algeria of its intention
to accede to the NPT.

<p>
     The creation of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone should now be at hand.  The
IAEA has continued to assist the African States in their efforts towards this end.  The text of a
treaty for an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which has been submitted to the current session
of the General Assembly for consideration, entrusts the IAEA with the responsibility for
safeguards verification under the treaty.

<p>
Safeguards in the Middle East

<p>
     At the request of its General Conference the IAEA has been engaged in activities to
promote the role of safeguards in the Middle East.  I have personally pursued consultations with
a number of States in the Middle East about the early application of Agency safeguards to all
relevant activities in the region.  Further, in the context of the Middle East peace negotiations,
the Agency has provided expert assistance to the participants in the Multilateral Working Group
on Arms Control and Regional Security.  Lastly, the Agency organized in 1993 a workshop for
experts from Middle East countries on the modalities for the application of safeguards in the
Middle East region.  As a follow up, and in the context of the Multilateral Working Group, a
visit by representatives of Middle East States was arranged to a nuclear power plant in Western
Europe.  The purpose of this visit was to demonstrate how regional verification activities can
complement international verification efforts.  In the coming year I propose to continue my
consultations with countries in the Middle East.

<p>
Strengthening Safeguards

<p>
     Following the discovery in Iraq of undeclared nuclear material, installations and activities,
considerable efforts have been made in the IAEA to strengthen the Agency's detection capability.
Some measures have already been introduced, such as the request for the early provision of
design information on nuclear installations and for reporting on the export and import of nuclear
material and specified equipment and non-nuclear material over and above the reporting
requirements of safeguards agreements.  Furthermore, a comprehensive programme to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the safeguards system is being developed for submission to
the Board of Governors in March 1995.  It is designed to strengthen the Agency s access to
information and access to sites for inspection.  It will include innovations in detection techniques
and technologies such as environmental monitoring as well as recommendations to remove
various restrictions imposed by States on inspections.  It is paradoxical, for instance, that States
which have accepted international inspection in order to demonstrate their openness and
compliance with non-proliferation commitments, still demand that inspectors apply for visas
before coming!


<p>
     Safeguards are not a form of intrusion on States  sovereignty but rather an opportunity
for States to demonstrate their compliance with international obligations.  Safeguards are an
institutionalized means of nuclear transparency to create confidence.

<p>
     Let me now briefly describe the IAEA's recent engagement in some verification issues
which go beyond our traditional safeguards activities.

<p>
Verification of Nuclear Material from Weapons

<p>
     As a result of the current dismantling of nuclear weapons by the United States and Russia
and the ongoing reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in several countries, substantial quantities of
plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) are recovered.  On the issue of fissionable
material from dismantled weapons, President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed in January
1994 to establish a joint working group to consider, inter alia:

<PRE>
          "steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reduction of
          nuclear weapons, including the possibility of putting a portion of the fissionable
          material under IAEA safeguards".
</PRE>


<p>
I can report to you that for its part the United States has begun a process for the eventual
submission to IAEA inspection of all US fissile material no longer needed for defence purposes.
Storage locations for such material have been identified and the legal, technical and financial
aspects of safeguards are being considered.  A first inspection has already taken place.

<p>
     Further, there seems to be broad agreement that plutonium and highly enriched uranium
from the civilian sector should be stored under conditions of greater transparency, adequate
physical security and nuclear safety and with a high degree of assurance against possible
diversion for weapons purposes.  The Agency can assist in building further on existing measures
if requested by the relevant States and if adequate resources are made available.

<p>
Cut-Off of Production of Fissionable Material for Weapons Use

<p>
     Last year the General Assembly adopted, without a vote, a resolution which recommended
the negotiation of a verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons or other explosive devices.  Also, the Assembly requested the IAEA "to provide
assistance for examination of verification arrangements for such a treaty as required".  In
compliance with this request I have established a working group within the IAEA Secretariat to
examine the verification problem and to prepare background papers which may be of use in the
negotiations between States.

<p>
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty

<p>
     Negotiations are well under way at the Conference on Disarmament on a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  Although the scope of the treaty and the modalities for its verification
are not yet agreed, a number of States seem to support a significant role for the Agency, having
in mind the cost-effectiveness of using an existing organization with relevant experience and
infrastructure, and also the mutually reinforcing nature of verifying non-proliferation and CTBT
pledges.  Violation of a commitment not to test would simultaneously constitute a violation of
a non-proliferation commitment to use nuclear material only for peaceful purposes.



<p>
Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Material

<p>
     The recently reported increase in illicit trafficking in nuclear materials is a matter of
concern.  During the past year the IAEA has recorded many cases which have warranted followup.  
Fortunately each of these cases has turned out to involve only small quantities of nuclear
material, and in no instance does this material appear to have come from a nuclear weapons
stockpile.  However, the uncontrolled movement of fissionable material involves both radiation
and proliferation risks, and it suggests that control and supervision at some installations
authorized to possess and use such material are currently inadequate.

<p>
     These problems have been the subject of much discussion between governments lately and
several measures are being taken.  A primary condition to prevent trafficking is that institutions
handling nuclear material should have adequate systems of accountancy and control and of
physical protection.  In these regards the IAEA can step up advice and technical assistance - if
resources are made available.  Further, although activities such as the conduct of police
investigations are beyond the IAEA s competence, the Agency could significantly improve its
continuous collection, verification and analysis of information obtained from the media and from
Member States, to separate fact from fiction and report the real extent of the problem.  The IAEA
General Conference last month invited me to convene a group of experts designated by Member
States and competent international organizations to examine the options available for a
strengthened Agency role in that area.  This will take place in November and the Board of
Governors of the IAEA will take up the issue again in December.

Nuclear Power

<p>
     I now turn to the IAEA s work on the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, both
nuclear power generation of electricity and other applications.

<p>
     Nuclear power has been stagnating in the Western industrialized countries, partly as a
result of a comfortable electricity supply situation in several of these countries, and partly as a
result of public opposition - especially after the Chernobyl accident.  A major growth area is now
in East Asia, where a number of countries are moving ahead with vigorous construction
programmes.

<p>
     As demand for electricity begins to accelerate worldwide, a continued stagnation of
nuclear power could be problematic.  Ambitious energy saving and the greater use of renewable
sources of energy - like solar and wind power and biomass - will not be enough to meet the
demand for increased base load electricity which everyone predicts.  In some places more hydro
power may be developed but generally the easiest way to meet the increased demand dictated by
population increase and economic expansion will be through the burning of more fossil fuels -
notably coal and gas.  However, as this is bound to add to the pollution of the world s
atmosphere, such a choice would present policy-makers with a serious dilemma.  At a cost,
sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides may be removed from flue gases, but governments are
committed also to reducing, or at least stabilizing, the level of carbon dioxide emissions in order
to try to ward off global warming.  In this regard a shift from coal to gas may be welcome as
gas gives rise to less carbon dioxide per energy unit produced.  However, the current trend is
toward a global increase not only in the use of gas but in use of all fossil fuels and consequently
a global increase in CO2 emissions.

<p>
     Although nuclear power is essentially emission-free, and although uranium resources and
existing industrial capacity would allow a vast expansion of nuclear generating capacity, it is not
suggested that nuclear power, alone, can be the solution to this dilemma.  It is very difficult on
the other hand to see that there can be a solution to the dilemma without a substantial nuclear
component in the world energy mix.

<p>
     Governments are beginning to grapple with this problem as a part of the implementation
of the Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted at the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, set up by UNEP and WMO, is examining response scenarios to the threat of
global climate change.  From these scenarios it can be seen that future energy mixes with a
substantial nuclear power component offer a chance for restraining carbon dioxide emissions.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the World Energy Council stated in 1993 that  there is a need
to continue to seek a way of exploiting the immense energy reserves of nuclear power [in a way]
which is publicly acceptable across the whole fuel cycle from procurement and processing
through disposal.

<p>
     The obstacles to general public acceptance of nuclear power relate to three major issues:
the proliferation risk, safety and waste.

<p>
     I have already described the proliferation situation, which is moving in a positive
direction.  With accelerated nuclear disarmament and the prospect of non-proliferation
approaching universality, one might hope that the peaceful use of nuclear power may at long last
be decoupled in people s minds from the anxiety they have felt about the threat of nuclear
weapons.

<p>
     On safety, governments are not only focussing on the weaknesses of some reactors of
Soviet design.  They are also making broad efforts to develop an international safety culture.  In
this regard a major element was completed this year with the conclusion of the International
Convention on Nuclear Safety.  The Convention covers power reactors and establishes binding
general rules, and the implementation of these rules will be promoted by a peer review process.
The Convention has already been signed by 47 States.  Other elements in the international safety
culture are the Paris and Vienna Conventions on liability in the event of a nuclear accident, the
IAEA s safety-related  audits  at individual nuclear plants and agreed International Basic
Radiation Safety Standards developed by six organizations, including WHO, ILO and IAEA.  I
should mention, lastly, that an International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) has been established and
adopted by most States operating nuclear power to help define the severity of incidents in an
easily understandable way.

<p>
     Thus, just as safety in the air and safety at sea have long been legitimate international
concerns regulated by international instruments, safety in the operation of nuclear power plants
the world over is increasingly subject to international rules, guidelines and advice.  We know that
an accident anywhere can result in radioactive fallout across borders and even when this is not
the case, the psychological fall-out is instantaneous - hence the efforts to ensure that nuclear
power plants everywhere in the world are operated at a high level of safety.  The IAEA is at the
centre of the emerging international legal infrastructure surrounding the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy.  The Agency is also expanding its range of international services designed to strengthen
safety. Nevertheless, supervision and enforcement of nuclear safety rules remain the prerogative
of national governments.


<p>
     The results of the intensified work - national and international - on nuclear safety are
positive.  The number of unplanned stoppages in nuclear power plants is going down generally
and the trend is toward lower doses of radiation for workers in nuclear power plants.
Nevertheless, probably only years of nuclear operations without serious accidents will reduce the
concern of a public which is prepared to accept much less risk in the nuclear area than in many
others.  To give only one example let me mention that a report of the ILO last April estimating
that 3.5 to 5 million persons per year are poisoned by pesticides, of whom 40 000 die, does not
appear to have aroused the public.

<p>
     A third concern affecting public acceptance of nuclear power, relates to nuclear waste.
The concern is not only about highly radioactive waste resulting from power plants but even
about low- or medium-level radioactive waste, sometimes raising problems for further use of
modern nuclear techniques in medicine!  It is probable that these concerns will be allayed only
when governments and industry have actually established repositories for wastes of different
levels of radioactivity.  From the scientific and technical standpoint there are no serious obstacles
to the building of such repositories, and several countries have done so or are preparing to do so.
Nor are there usually any financial problems connected with the disposal of radioactive waste
from civilian activities, as these are accustomed to carry the cost of disposal.  However, as the
selection of disposal sites often meets opposition, a very open dialogue with the public is needed.
Experience in several countries shows that this is possible.

<p>
     Although the disposal of radioactive waste is clearly a local matter, the extremely long
periods during which some waste remains active creates a common international interest that
radioactive waste anywhere on the planet be responsibly handled.  This is also the reason why
there is not only an increasing international exchange of experience in this field, but also a
development of internationally agreed legal rules and guidelines.  We expect that work will soon
commence in the IAEA on a binding Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste
Management.

<p>
Non-Power Applications of Nuclear Energy

<p>
     So far only a few developing countries have a technological level and infrastructure that
would allow them to make use of the present types of nuclear power reactors.  For their
electricity generation they will have to rely on technologically less demanding solutions, mostly
involving the burning of fossil fuels, which in turn will make it desirable that technologically
advanced nations make greater use of nuclear power.  For the future it may be hoped that
simpler-to- operate, smaller and less costly nuclear reactors will become available for wider use
by developing countries in the generation of electricity for their fast growing urban centres, and
also perhaps in the desalination of water to compensate for scarce fresh water resources.
Developing country members of the IAEA are keenly interested in these questions.

<p>
     Meanwhile the IAEA is intensely and successfully engaged in the transfer of many nonpower 
nuclear techniques to developing countries.  Emphasis is being placed on techniques which
will contribute to sustainable development - food production and preservation, the harnessing of
fresh water resources, industrial uses and the promotion of human health.  Let me give you just
a few examples of what the Agency is engaged in.

<p>
     In the field of food production, the Agency is promoting the use of the so-called sterile
insect technique, which relies on the release of large numbers of radiation-sterilized male insects
to mate with fertile females, thereby gradually reducing the population of, for instance, tsetse flies
and Mediterranean fruit flies.  Interest in this technique, which has long been used in North and
South America, is now growing in many countries, and the IAEA - together with the FAO - is
trying to respond to it.

<p>
     Still in the field of food production, much use is being made of radiation to induce
mutants of crops such as rice, grain and bananas and to create strains which may be more
resistant to pests or adverse climatic conditions.

<p>
     The use of tracer radioisotopes for the mapping of exploitable water resources is another
technique promoted by the IAEA s technical co-operation programme, especially in arid and
semi-arid areas.

<p>
     In the field of medicine, the use of radiation is a principal method of combatting cancer,
and the IAEA is much involved, inter alia, in the transfer of such techniques and in assisting
recipient States in the field of dosimetry to ensure that the radiation doses delivered are
appropriate.  A very common use of radiation for medical purposes is the sterilization of surgical
instruments and of skin grafts and here, too, the Agency is providing assistance.

<p>
Concluding Remarks

<p>
     Let me conclude with some remarks about the prospects for and constraints on the ability
of the IAEA to play its full role in meeting the growing demands on the international system.

<p>
     The United Nations has an overall responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security
and for the promotion of development.  As the  Agenda for Peace  and the  Agenda for
Development  show, there is an obvious link between peace and development.  Such a link is
also at the heart of the mandate of the IAEA, which is to be the nuclear verification arm of the
UN system and at the same time an agency for the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful
development.  Both tasks are likely to increase in importance as nuclear disarmament accelerates
and as emphasis is placed on sustainable development.

<p>
     Despite the constraints of the zero-real-growth budgeting over many years, the IAEA has
been able to deliver an expanding programme and to respond promptly to new challenges.  This
is due partly to the strong support - including extrabudgetary support - from Member States and
partly to the enthusiasm, dynamism and versatility of the Agency s staff.  I would be less than
frank, however, if I did not admit that we are now facing serious problems in both respects.
While we need to attract the best nuclear specialists in the world to remain on top of the
problems referred to us, the pay and conditions of service offered by the United Nations Common
System have deteriorated.  The loss of competitiveness is creating a recruitment problem for the
IAEA and for the Common System.  As regards financial resources, a decade of severe budgetary
constraint combined with delays in governments  payments of contributions is perpetuating the
sense of financial crisis.

<p>
     This problem is of course not unique to the IAEA.  But it is clear that for the IAEA a
more adequate, timely and predictable resource base is necessary to meet expanding obligations
in the area of nuclear verification and to undertake tasks requested to ensure the safe use of
nuclear power and the transfer of nuclear technology in support of development.  As we approach
the fiftieth anniversary of the first, and we trust last, use of nuclear weapons in war, and with at
last the prospect of major steps towards reducing and perhaps eliminating nuclear arsenals, it is
all the more vital that effective verification mechanisms are in place.  It would be deplorable if
short-term concerns over resources reduced the opportunity to secure the major advances in the
field of nuclear arms control which now seem to exist.  Arms control and disarmament
undoubtedly yield a peace dividend in terms of reduced military spending. However,
disarmament, like development, must be sustainable and reliable verification is indispensible.  A
small part of the peace dividend must be invested in such verification.

<p>
     Let me, in closing, record the thanks of the IAEA to the Government of Austria for
maintaining its tradition as an excellent host to all the international organizations which are
located in Vienna.
