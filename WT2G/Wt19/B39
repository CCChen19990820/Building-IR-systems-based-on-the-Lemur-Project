                              Director General</H4>

<p>
     In the year ahead of us two anniversaries of particular importance to the IAEA will occur.  It will be 50 years since the founding of the United Nations and it will be 25 years since the Non-Proliferation Treaty entered into force.  The stock-taking at these anniversaries is a good starting point for thinking about future directions.  We must ask how we can best cope with today's and tomorrow's issues and how we can make optimal use of the IAEA in all areas of its mandate.

<p>
The IAEA and the UN System

<p>
     Let me begin with some comments on the IAEA as a part of the UN family.  There is frequent criticism of a lack of cohesion and co-ordination in the UN System - not least in analyses made in connection with the UN's 50th anniversary.  I submit that this criticism is not valid for the IAEA's relations with the UN and UN organizations.  This Conference and the Agency's Board of Governors have a practice of following the UN lead in political matters, e.g. on representation issues.  The Agency also seeks to fully play its role in system-wide efforts declared by the UN, such as the current work to promote sustainable development by implementing Agenda 21.  Above all, the cases of Iraq and DPRK have demonstrated the close, prompt and effective liaison and interaction which exist between the IAEA and the UN in accordance with the IAEA Statute and the relationship agreement with the UN.  The Security Council has looked to the IAEA as the nuclear inspection arm of the UN system and the Agency has looked to the Council as the body politically responsible for the implementation of nuclear arms control measures.  As attention to nuclear non-proliferation increases and more nuclear arms control measures requiring verification  are adopted it would be reasonable and cost- effective to continue building on this distribution of functions and to avoid any duplication.

<p>
     In welcoming the personal representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, I would ask him to convey to the Secretary-General our appreciation for the excellent and close liaison that is maintained with him and, through him, with the United Nations, in particular the Security Council.  I am pleased that we have recently established a secure phone and fax line between the Secretary-General s office and my office.  I hope, however, that we shall not need to use it very often.

<p>
     The IAEA's co-operation with other organizations in the UN system is extensive.  On this occasion there is a special reason to single out the Agency s co-operation with the FAO and UNESCO.  This year we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the division which we operate jointly with the FAO and whose very successful activities testify to the increasing relevance of nuclear techniques for food production and preservation.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome to our Conference the Director-General of the FAO, Dr. Jacques Diouf.  I am glad that he will address our Conference.


<p>
     There is also special reason to mention our close co-operation with UNESCO in jointly administering the International Centre of Theoretical Physics at Trieste.  After 30 years, during which the IAEA has had operational responsibility for the Centre, this role is expected soon to be transferred to our co-administrator, UNESCO.  Since its creation in 1964, the Centre has grown rapidly.  I want to acknowledge our great indebtedness to Professor Abdus Salam, who has been the dynamic leader of the Institute and who has now left that post.  I also want to thank the Italian Government for its great generosity in supporting the Centre.  We are confident that the Centre will continue to be an important meeting place for physicists from industrially advanced and developing countries and a place of intellectual excellence.

<p>
The IAEA and the NPT

<p>
     As I said in my opening sentences, it will next year be 25 years since the Non- Proliferation Treaty entered into force.  The more than 160 parties to the Treaty will review the past experience of the Treaty, consider its future and decide on its extension.  The cases of Iraq and DPRK have raised questions about the reliability of commitments made under the Treaty and pointed to the need for strengthening verification under the Treaty.  These questions will undoubtedly be discussed.  At the same time the parties to the Treaty can take encouragement in the continued increased adherence to the Treaty.  The IAEA is contributing substantial background material in support of the Conference, particularly concerning safeguards implementation and the transfer of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes.  We look forward to the guidance of the Conference in these tasks.



<p>
The functions of the IAEA

<p>
     Let me now continue with some comments on the overall function of the Agency in today s and tomorrow s world.  It has been customary to refer to the Agency s functions as being dual - promoting the use of nuclear energy on the one hand and providing verification of its peaceful use on the other.  However, a simple distinction between a  promotional  and  regulatory  function does not do justice to the full range of functions and activities envisaged by our Statute.  Where, for instance, does the Agency s normative work in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection fit?  The Statute provides the Agency with a number of broad functions and activities and Member States have an interest in the effective pursuit of all these functions and activities and I take it that this is the thrust of the resolution entitled  Strengthening of the Agency s Main Activities  which was adopted by consensus last year.  I also take it that the right response to this interest consists not only in the transfer of more nuclear technology and in updating and strengthening the Agency s safeguards system but also in the development of international rules and services in the field of nuclear safety, and even the performance of verification tasks requested by the Security Council or under bilateral or multilateral agreements in the field of nuclear arms control and disarmament.  All these activities are clearly within the mandate of the Agency. I would suggest that the demand for  balance  between them should mean that none of them should be neglected.

<p>
     The real constraint to the  strengthening  of the various parts of our mandate and activities does not, I submit, lie in any statutory restraints but in the zero real growth straitjacket and in the non-payment and late payment of contributions.



<p>
The nuclear power option

<p>
     I turn now to report on Agency activities relating to nuclear power.  The Agency s Conference two weeks ago on the Nuclear Power Option showed that it is relatively easy to describe the current status of nuclear power, but hard to predict its future role.  Some Member States are fast expanding their nuclear power capacity, a few are decided opponents of nuclear power and several have a wait and see attitude.  What factors may be important for the future?

<p>
     The first important factor is the very general prediction that even with ambitious conservation efforts the world will greatly increase its use of electricity in the decades before us.  There is an understanding that such an increase is of vital importance for economic development and for improvements in standards of living.  As the viable sources of large scale electricity generation are limited at least for the next few decades, to the burning of fossil fuels, to hydropower and to nuclear power, it ought to be in the interest of governments to stimulate a discussion of the rational merits and demerits of the different options.  The Agency has a long tradition of comparing the economic and other viability of nuclear power and other electricity sources in different countries.  Together with a number of other organizations it is now pursuing the so-called DECADES project, with the aim of responding to the growing interest in the comparative assessment of different electricity generation options, from the viewpoints of environment, reliability and economy.

<p>
     Such assessments are of interest, not least in connection with the search for scenarios to counter the emission of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, to reduce the risk of global warming.  It is striking, but not surprising, that the scenarios which achieve the most effective reduction in CO2 emissions have a strong component of nuclear power.  Indeed, each terawatt hour of electricity produced by coal produces about one million tons of CO2.  The 2000 terawatt hours produced annually by nuclear power avoids 2000 million tons of CO2 emission as compared with an alternative of burning coal.  The Agency has continued to participate in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in particular by contributing to the chapter dealing with  Energy Supply Mitigation Options  in its report.  This participation has enabled us to highlight the fact that realistic, sustainable electricity supply strategies will require a balanced mix of energy sources in the world, including a significant volume of nuclear power.

<p>
     In view of the uncertainties which are connected with the projections of global warming, some critics have warned against expensive - and perhaps ultimately unnecessary - changes in the pattern of energy use.  However, because nuclear power is generally competitive with fossil fuelled electricity generation there should be no economic objection to meeting additional electricity demand and to replacing obsolete fossil generated electricity by nuclear power.  As before, the objections remain chiefly in the areas of safety and proliferation.  I shall come back to them.

<p>
     The future of nuclear power may also be influenced by its versatility.  Our common focusing on the large-scale base load electricity generating nuclear plants should not lead us to ignore the role that nuclear reactors could play in providing electricity for smaller electric grids, as would be required in many developing countries, or to supply district heating, to desalinate water and to produce process heat for industry.  In all these areas, which are not much in focus at present, it is desirable that exchange of information and experience continue in the IAEA so that maximum knowledge will be available whenever the political interest in these options emerges - as it may well do.  The same applies to breeder reactors and to all the various advanced reactors, which are being developed.


<p>
Nuclear Safety

<p>
     I spoke initially of the need for international organizations to adapt to meet new needs.  One of the areas in which the IAEA has drastically expanded its activities to respond to the new needs  is nuclear safety.  In document GC(XXXVIII)/INF/6 the General Conference is informed for the first time in a comprehensive manner of the various measures taken by the Agency to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear safety and radiological protection.

<p>
     The Chernobyl disaster triggered the prompt elaboration of binding IAEA conventions on early notification and emergency assistance.  These conventions now form part of the international legal infrastructure of nuclear power and periodic exercises test their readiness.  While an updated convention on liability is still sorely needed in this legal infrastructure, a convention on the safety of nuclear power was adopted last June and there is a consensus that a convention should be worked out on the safe management and disposal of nuclear waste.

<p>
     Such legal instruments, building on the still developing array of detailed but non-binding standards and guides, respond to new expectations in the international community.  National authorities retain the full responsibility and control of the safety of nuclear operations and waste handling.  Yet, they wish to have an insight - notably through internationally organized peer reviews - into how this responsibility is exercised in other countries and to have also a possibility to urge compliance with common standards.

<p>
     The many Agency services which have emerged in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection - OSARTs, ASSETs, RAPATs, etc. - also constitute a response to the new needs of Member States.  No supranational supervision is involved in these services which are performed only on request and, indeed, in many cases only against full or partial payment.  Yet, their general impact is undoubtedly one of inducing national adherence to internationally acceptable standards.

<p>
Nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe

<p>
     The Agency's assessment activities related to the safety of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union have continued.  Significant progress has been made to establish a consensus on priorities for safety improvements pertaining to the different generations of WWER and RBMK reactors. This consensus provides guidance both for national programmes to improve safety, and for the international assistance efforts co-ordinated by the G-24 mechanism.  It also offers information of relevance for the practical and useful work that is performed by the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), whose President, Mr. R‚my Carle, I am happy to welcome.

<p>
     Experts visiting many plants report that safety is improving, though not at the same pace in all plants and in all countries.  It is clear that significant efforts will still be necessary for years to come and that the main burden for updating or phasing out reactors will be carried by the countries concerned.

<p>
     Special attention was given to the nuclear plant at Chernobyl after the Ukraine government s decision, in 1993, to continue operating it.  Following examination of the plant by an Agency team of safety experts, a meeting was convened in Vienna in April this year to consider possible measures to deal with the safety situation which had been identified.  Future Agency engagement in this work will depend on the decisions which the Government of Ukraine will take in the light of all the circumstances before it and following its contacts with the G-7 and the G-24.

<p>
     As indicated in the IAEA s programme and budget for the period 1995 and 1996, extrabudgetary funding will continue to be required to carry out the Agency s programme on safety of WWER and RBMK reactors.  I take this opportunity to thank governments - in particular the Government of Japan - for their past contributions and to remind them of the further need for financial and expert support to continue this programme.

<p>
Basic Radiation Safety Standards

<p>
     Let me now mention another important development in the area of radiation safety - the agreement on International Basic Radiation Safety Standards sponsored by six international organizations, including the IAEA.  The new Standards, which were adopted by the Board of Governors last week contain important guidelines on the responsibilities for the control and safety of radiation sources as well as for the protection of workers, the general public and medical patients. The importance of this guidance is realized when we remember that medical uses of radiation are by far the greatest man-made contributor to general radiation exposure. The Standards also contain guidelines for intervention levels in emergency situations.  These could help to avoid the kind of confusion which we witnessed after the Chernobyl accident and which resulted from countries adopting widely differing intervention levels - many of which lower than was radiologically justified.

<p>
     It will take some time for the new Standards to be formally adopted by all the Sponsoring Organizations. When this has been done the standards are published in final form.  We believe they will have a major impact on the improvement of radiation safety worldwide.



<p>
 Spent nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes

<p>
     In the area of management of spent nuclear fuel and the disposal of radioactive wastes, States make increasing use of the IAEA as a channel for the exchange of experience, as a means for elaborating joint norms and as a mechanism for securing services.  Considering that long- lived nuclear waste will be a global heritage it is reasonable that international consensus is sought on how we deal with it.

<p>
     I am pleased to report to you that in the area of the safe interim storage of spent fuel, three guides reflecting best international practice have reached their final stage of preparation.  They cover the design of spent fuel storage facilities,  the preparation of safety analysis reports and  the safe operation of spent fuel storage facilities.

<p>
     Spent fuel from research reactors poses a different set of issues.  The life span of a large number of research reactors is being extended and this is leading to a need to expand spent fuel interim storage capacities.  As a first step to help address the present problems the IAEA has established a data base on  research reactor spent fuel inventories and has registered the problems of individual facilities.  As a second step the Agency has been convening regional workshops to share experience and expertise in this particular field.

<PRE>
     International normative work regarding radioactive waste continues to progress under the Agency's Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) programme.  In December the Board of Governors is expected to approve two documents, the Safety Fundamentals for Radioactive Waste, and a Safety Standards document on Planning.  These documents should provide a basis for commencing work towards a Convention on Waste Management.  At the practical level there has been an increased number of international peer review services of national waste management programmes, through the Waste Management Assessment and Technical Review Programme (WATRP).
     The concept of regional solutions for the safe storage and disposal of radioactive wastes  remains rational but is not easy to realize.  Of course, countries that embark on nuclear energy programmes must be ready to safely manage and dispose of the radioactive wastes that result from these programmes.  Yet, considering that some nuclear wastes will remain radioactive for thousands of years, I think we would act more responsibly vis-…-vis the future inhabitants of planet earth if we could agree on fewer, well selected and well built waste repositories than if we obliged each country to use some piece of its own crust of the earth for disposal purposes.  Perhaps a rational discussion about this subject could be revived one day.  What can be discussed already now, however, is that in certain regions, where technical and economic resources as well as the scope of nuclear activities are limited, regional solutions will offer a practical alternative to the national storage and disposal of certain types of radioactive wastes.  The Secretariat has begun to assess the feasibility of applying a regional solution to the problem of spent radium sources in Africa.  Discussions with African Member States interested in co- operating in this programme will be conducted within the framework of the African Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology (AFRA).

     Our experience from Radiation Protection Advisory Team (RAPAT) missions to 63 countries and Waste Management Advisory Programme (WAMAP) missions to 40 countries has shown that radiation protection and waste management infrastructures are weak in many countries - and non existent in some.  As the Agency's Safety Standards and Measures must be applied to all Agency Technical Co-operation projects, we have developed a systematic approach to help strengthen radiation protection and waste management infrastructures.

     A particular aspect of radioactive waste disposal, sea dumping, has attracted much attention in the past year.   At the 16th meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention 1972) held in London in November 1993, a decision was taken totally to prohibit the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea.  When the ban became operative on 20 February 1994, Russia declared that it was not able to comply with it.  We understand, however, that the Russian Federation is presently working together with other countries to find technical solutions which would remove its need to dispose of low level wastes at sea.  It should be noted that the decision to renounce all disposal of low level radioactive wastes at sea was taken on the basis of social, legal and political considerations.  No credible evidence has been presented to suggest that such disposal, when performed in accordance with IAEA recommendations, had caused or would cause harm to human health.

     Let me note finally in this section that the Government of Russia has provided much information about past large-scale dumping of radioactive waste and equipment in the Kara Sea in the Arctic, and in the Eastern Seas and about the Soviet nuclear submarine  Komsomolets  which sank in the Sea of Norway containing two nuclear warheads and a nuclear reactor.  In all three cases the Agency s Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco has been invited to participate in scientific missions.  In the case of the submarine the warheads were successfully sealed last summer to prevent leakages of plutonium into the ocean.  The results of the examinations undertaken so far in the three cases show either zero or completely negligible leakage of radioactivity.  Nevertheless the environments must continue to be monitored.

<p>
The transfer of nuclear technology and nuclear applications

<p>
     In most countries the desire to acquire new nuclear techniques led early to the establishment of special atomic energy commissions with budgets of their own and mandates to promote the peaceful use of these new techniques under radiologically safe conditions.  The Agency has a long record of successful co-operation with such institutions, both on the transfer of nuclear science and technology and in safety matters.  However, the greater the practical use being made of these technologies the more the transfers tend to be handled through commercial channels or by specialized departments within institutions for agriculture, hydrology, medicine or industry.  The IAEA must and does adapt its role in the transfer of nuclear technology and nuclear applications to this new situation.

<p>
     One change introduced in 1984 was from a one-year to a two-year programming cycle for the Agency s technical co-operation.  It is now regarded as an improvement which has increased both flexibility and effectiveness.  There have also been significant changes in the orientation of the Agency s efforts to transfer nuclear science and technology, many of which result from system-wide recommendations within the UN family.  One such recommendation is to seek increased assurance that the TC programme for each country is in line with national development priorities - to ensure that there will be a continuing national commitment to the programme.  Another recommendation is to place emphasis on the transfer of science and technology that will help to increase food supplies and improve health.  A third recommendation is to stress sustainable development and the protection of the environment in line with Agenda 21.  A fourth emphasis emerging from our own consideration is to ensure radiation protection.  All the transfer of nuclear science and technology that we could help to achieve would be discredited if it were not matched by steps to ensure safety.

<p>
     Last year the ambition to reach excellence in the orientation and execution of TC supported activities was manifested in the concept of the TC model project.  Member States have reacted very positively to this idea, which requires that projects should respond to real needs in a country, generally have an impact on end users; make important and necessary use of a proven nuclear technique; and should be strongly supported by the recipient country, thereby ensuring sustained application after the completion of the TC project.  While these criteria have been used as a basis initially to select a limited number of projects, they are meant in the future to inspire the whole TC programme.  This redirection will need much dedicated work not only by the Agency but also by recipient organizations and governments.

<p>
     Now let me give you some examples of the work that is going on:

<p>
     A very successful project designed to increase the supply of food was the vaccination campaign in Africa against the virus-borne rinderpest.  The Agency s limited but vital contribution was a nuclear based test technology and a programme for quality control amongst the institutes which carried out the actual testing.

<p>
     Projects involving the sterile insect technique (SIT) are also designed to increase food supply by protecting crops and livestock.  I am glad to report to you that our staff at the Seibersdorf Laboratory have achieved a new breakthrough in the application of the SIT relating to Mediterranean fruit fly.  By using nuclear techniques they have developed a new strain of this fly which, when treated with hot water, leaves only male survivors.  This makes it possible to limit the release of the flies to sterile males, thereby allowing considerable economic gains and avoiding damage to fruit.  The new development has led to much interest in using this Agency championed technique in countries of the Eastern Mediterranean - Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, the territory under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian authorities, and Egypt.  It may be that through the use of this nuclear based technology, all Mediterranean countries will become a medfly-free zone.

<p>
     Before leaving the SIT I must mention that programmes involving this technique are also being developed to eradicate some other species of insects in many other countries.  Presently SIT is being used to eradicate the tse tse fly from the island of Zanzibar to secure large new areas for food production.

<p>
Food Irradiation

<p>
     Food irradiation has been thoroughly tested, has been internationally approved by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and has considerable potential to prevent spoilage through insect and bacterial infestations as well as sprouting.  I am pleased to report to you that practical utilization of food irradiation has gained momentum both in advanced and developing countries.  A pilot project on "Improving safety and quality of food and food ingredients by irradiation" is being planned with initial emphasis on expanding trade in irradiated spices from developing countries.  It is also to be noted that international trade in irradiated food is likely to increase following the entry into force next year of an Agreement under the Uruguay Round of GATT facilitating trade in food, including irradiated food, which has been processed according to international standards or recommendations.  Importantly, the media seem to have become increasingly objective in informing the public about the safety and benefits of food irradiation.  This could lead to wider acceptance of irradiated food in both advanced and developing countries - benefitting health and reducing spoilage.



<p>
Hydrology

<p>
     Without water there is no food production. The Agency has worked for more than three decades in isotope-based hydrology methodologies which have proved to be very powerful and often indispensible tools in developing and managing water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.  The Agency is continuing and intensifying these activities in which the Board of Governors is taking a particular interest.  I may mention as an example that a regional project using isotope techniques for water resources development and management in some North African countries is now being finalized for consideration by the Board.

<p>
Nutritional Studies

<p>
     A second main orientation of the IAEA s transfer of nuclear techniques seeks - in accordance with UN system-wide priorities - to preserve and improve human health.  Let me give just one example of these efforts - the development and transfer of nuclear technologies to monitor applied nutritional intervention programmes. This programme is prompted by goals identified by the FAO and the WHO and involves projects in some 30 countries.  A key to solving nutrition problems is the ability to make accurate nutritional assessments and to recommend foods which improve nutrition while making efficient use of scarce resources.  Isotope techniques have proven to be powerful tools for improving nutrition in developed countries.  Therefore, the IAEA has started programmes to make nuclear technologies more accessible to health and nutrition specialists in developing countries, and to identify local foods which most efficiently meet requirements for essential nutrients.



<p>
Environmental protection

<p>
     A significant number of the Agency s technical programmes and TC projects have relevance for environmental protection, sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21.  Let me mention two current projects.

<p>
     In Poland a very large model project involving an  Industrial Demonstration Plant for Electron Beam Purification of Flue Gases , with a cost estimate of over $18 million is being implemented.  In this project electron beams from an accelerator are used to help transform flue gases containing sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from coal burning plants into fertilizer.  The technology has been applied successfully on a pilot scale.  The major part of the cost of the project is covered by Poland, but we hope that significant voluntary contributions will cover the rest of this important project.

<p>
     The second project is still under study.  Together with several other international organizations, the IAEA would participate with radioisotope techniques in an effort to assist the States around the Caspian Sea to investigate the causes of the dramatic rise in the level and the pollution of that Sea.

<p>
Resources

<p>
     The task of transferring nuclear techniques and technology poses major challenges to the IAEA and particularly to its TC programme.  It also poses a challenge to the recipient States whose commitment and co-operation are required.  Finally it challenges donor States both as contributors to the Technical Assistance Fund and to other funding mechanisms.  In this regard I admit considerable concern.  Although the agreed target for the fund has been steadily increasing and stands at US $58.5 million for 1994, pledges for this year were only 66.6% of the target as of 1 September and of those pledges only 33.2% had actually been paid.  I earnestly appeal to Member States to pledge according to targets and to pay their pledges so as not to jeopardize the Agency s programme.  I also urge them to examine whether they can, in some cases, support projects in particular countries with resources from the bilateral aid programmes which they may already have with these countries.  Regrettably we must register that the UNDP which used to be an important source of funding now finances only a few projects and that we have so far not been successful in getting any funds from a new source to which we had attached some hope, namely the Global Environment Facility.

<p>
     In these circumstances we can only place our expectations in the direct contributions of IAEA Member States which are politically committed, under our Statute and under the NPT, to facilitate the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology.

<p>
Safeguards Verification, Non-Proliferation, Nuclear Arms Control

<p>
     One of the most important functions of the IAEA has been and remains to verify the peaceful nature of nuclear activities through safeguards.  The Agency s experience is unparalleled in the UN system and could be made use of in verifying future nuclear arms control and disarmament arrangements.

<p>
     The discovery by the IAEA after the Gulf War that Iraq, despite full-scope safeguards, had been able secretly to develop a substantial programme for uranium enrichment and for weaponization accelerated the efforts to strengthen the safeguards system and to reduce the risk that material or installations which should have been subjected to safeguards could remain undeclared and undetected.  It was realized that for this purpose the IAEA needed above all increased access to information and easier access to relevant sites and installations.

<p>
     Some proposals have already been endorsed by the Board of Governors, e.g. regarding the early provision of design information and the reporting on the export and import of nuclear material and specified equipment.  Further proposals for a strengthened and more cost effective safeguards system are being considered in  Programme 93+2" to be presented to the Board of Governors in March 1995.  Key proposals relate to increased access to information about a State s nuclear programme and increased physical access to sites.  These are complementary features leading to increased nuclear transparency and increased assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.  They can be seen as a natural extension of actions already adopted by the Board of Governors.  The programme also includes the study of a number of technical and administrative efficiency measures that could become part of a streamlined and fully rationalised safeguards system.  Thanks to the co-operation of a large number of Member States, many new concepts are undergoing field tests and a  clean laboratory  facility is being established at Seibersdorf for the receipt and handling of safeguards samples.

<p>
     There is no doubt that the credibility of non-proliferation commitments will become increasingly important as the number of nuclear weapons in the world is reduced.  Safeguards have a vital role to enhance this credibility and should not be viewed by States as intrusions into their sovereignty but as opportunities to demonstrate compliance with important international obligations.  This is also how governments generally view safeguards.  Similarly, the increasing number of invitations to the Agency to  visit any place any time  are means by which States, in their enlightened self-interest, can increase their transparency and, at the very least, dispel specific unfounded alllegations or suspicions which may have been advanced.  I trust more such invitations will be issued.  I also trust governments will eliminate a number of restrictions which still reduce the effectiveness of safeguards and lead to unnecessary cost.  Many governments continue to insist on restrictions, based on nationality, regarding the designation of international inspectors. Visas for each visit are required by some States and the inspectors  freedom of access to facilities and communications with headquarters are sometimes limited.  Why can such barriers not be removed?  Are not the interest of all States best served by competent and independent inspectors operating with minimal restrictions?  Special arrangements should really only be needed to protect sensitive military or industrial secrets.

<p>
     If there is considerable scope for strengthening the safeguards system and reducing some costs in it, there is at the same time a vital need to maintain a stable and adequate financial basis for it.  The number of safeguards agreements continues to grow - several new agreements were endorsed at the most recent meeting of the Board.  More than 800 facilities and other sites are under Agency safeguards.  It is of great importance that during the next year member governments reach agreement on reliable and equitable arrangements for the financing of safeguards.  They may also need to consider arrangements for the funding of new verification activities.

<p>
Safeguards Implementation in DPRK

<p>
     The report contained in document GC(XXXVIII)/19 summarizes the safeguards implementation in the DPRK.  As of the time in 1993 when the DPRK declared its withdrawal from the NPT and then suspended  the effectuation  of its withdrawal, it appears not to have recognized any legal obligation to accept safeguards inspection under its agreement with the IAEA.  Rather it has followed - and it still continues to follow - an … la carte approach, in which the extent of access for safeguards inspection varies depending inter alia upon developments in its negotiations with a third party.  From the Agency perspective the situation is different.  Both the IAEA and the United Nations have concluded that the safeguards agreement remains valid and that the Agency is under an obligation to seek to implement it fully.  This, indeed, is what the Agency has consistently tried to do and is still trying to do.  By the time when the Board of Governors met in June this year the Agency, after a long interval, had been enabled to inspect all declared nuclear installations as required by the safeguards agreement.  However, the refusal of the DPRK to co-operate in providing access to additional sites and information and the loss of data which resulted from the method of fuel core discharge that the operator chose for the 5 MW Experimental Reactor last spring prevented the assessment of  the nuclear material inventory declared by the DPRK.  It also prevented a resolution of the inconsistency between this declaration and findings of the Agency.

<p>
     Although the DPRK appeared immediately after its withdrawal from membership in the IAEA last June to reject all safeguards inspection, this position was somewhat modified following the meeting between the late President of the DPRK and former US President Carter and the Agency has been enabled to maintain the continuous inspector presence basis at Nyongbyon which began in May.  During the summer inspectors were enabled to monitor some of the activities at the 5 MW plant.  This was in line with the request directed to the Agency by the Security Council in late May.  Maintenance of surveillance and seals at the reprocessing plant also continued.  However, the Agency s requests for access to the fuel fabrication plant, fresh fuel storage facilities and the new reprocessing line under construction were denied during the summer.

<p>
     On 5 September representatives of DPRK indicated to IAEA inspectors on site that following recent progress in the bilateral talks with the United States the DPRK was ready to enlarge the scope of inspections and inspections have now in fact been completed at the fuel fabrication plant and at the fresh fuel storage facility.  Access to the reprocessing line under construction, however, has not been granted.  I should add that the results of the inspections which took place in March and May this year have not provided any indication of reprocessing of recently irradiated fuel or of loading of fresh fuel into the reactor.

<p>
     I certainly hope that all declared facilities will soon again be fully subjected to safeguards.  I also hope that additional information and visits to additional sites will be forthcoming.

<p>
Verification under Security Council Resolution Mandate in Iraq

<p>
     Under the mandate of the Security Council the IAEA has, to date, carried out 26 inspection missions in Iraq and has completed the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all known nuclear weapons usable materials, facilities and equipment.    In particular the IAEA has arranged for and supervised the removal, from Iraq, of all highly enriched uranium and the demolition of all facilities and the removal or destruction of non-nuclear materials and equipment, which could be used for the production of nuclear weapons. The IAEA is satisfied that the scope of Iraq s former nuclear weapons programme is well understood and that, as a result of the destruction, removal and rendering harmless activities, no capability for the production of nuclear weapons exists in Iraq.

<p>
     Progress towards this conclusion was facilitated by a series of high-level technical talks begun in July 1993, in the course of which Iraq provided additional information regarding its former nuclear weapons programme with respect to supply and procurement channels and sources of external technical support with particular regard to their centrifuge enrichment programme.    The significant aspects of these disclosures have been satisfactorily verified.

<p>
     Since its acknowledgement, in November 1993, of Security Council resolution 715(1991), Iraq has provided to the IAEA the reports, required under that resolution to enable the IAEA to complete the preparations for the implementation of the ongoing monitoring and verification plan.  With the establishment, at the end of August, of its continuous presence in Iraq, the IAEA is in a position to implement its ongoing monitoring and verification plan.  Monitoring and verification measures will be subject to modification as technical needs arise or as advanced technologies become available.

<p>
     As required by Security Council resolution 715, the IAEA, the UN Special Commission, and the Sanctions Committee, have developed a mechanism for monitoring future sales or supplies by other countries to Iraq.  It is expected that the Security Council will, in the near future, approve this jointly-developed mechanism, which will form part of the IAEA s ongoing monitoring and verification activities in Iraq.

<p>
     The implementation of the ongoing monitoring and verification plan does not foreclose the exercise, by the IAEA, of its right to investigate any aspect of Iraq s former nuclear weapons capability, in particular, the right to follow-up on any new information obtained by the IAEA and assessed as warranting further investigation.

<p>
     As is well known, the IAEA s current activities in Iraq are not based upon the safeguards agreement with Iraq but on the mandate given by the Security Council and consequently verification activities in Iraq go considerably beyond those which are required under an NPT- type safeguards agreement.  Nevertheless, our experience in Iraq has proved useful in the development of safeguards measures which will provide greater assurance of the non-existence of clandestine nuclear activities.

<p>
Safeguards in Different Regions:  The Middle East

<p>
     The General Conference last year requested me to continue consultations with States of the Middle East region to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all activities in the region.  In pursuance of this mandate and as reported in a document before you (GC(XXXVIII)/18), I have had further contacts with States in the region and the Agency has continued to participate in the Multilateral Working Group on Arms Control and Regional Security.  Additional views regarding verification modalities and national objectives relevant to Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zones were obtained during my visits to Iran, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.   I intend in the coming year to continue my consultations in capitals. The meetings of the Multilateral Working Group have taken place against the backdrop of important developments in the bilateral peace process.  As a follow up to the Seminar on the Modalities for the Application of Safeguards in the Middle East which we organized last year in Vienna, arrangements are being made within the framework of the Working Group to enable representatives of Middle East States to see a demonstration of verification techniques and to become acquainted with ways in which regional verification in Europe complements the IAEA s international verification.

<p>
Safeguards Implementation under the Tlatelolco Treaty

<p>
     Argentina, Brazil and Chile have now ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement between Argentina, Brazil, ABACC and the IAEA entered into force in March this year.  As Cuba has declared that it intends soon to adhere to the Tlatelolco Treaty, we can expect that this Treaty will enter into force, formalizing the Latin American and Caribbean region status as a nuclear-weapon-free region.  This is to be much welcomed.

<p>
Safeguards in Africa

<p>
     South Africa s adherence to the NPT and Algeria s indicated intention to do the same raise the expectation that Africa, too, will soon become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

<p>
     The General Conference last year requested the Director General  to continue to assist the African States in their efforts towards establishing an African nuclear-weapon-free-zone. Such assistance has been given and I am glad to tell you that in May the UN/OAU Group of Experts reached agreement on the draft text of a Treaty establishing such a zone.  This text entrusts the Agency with the task of verification.

<p>
Safeguards in the Newly Independent States (NIS)

<p>
     Another area of increasing IAEA safeguards activity is the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union.   All these countries - with the exception, of course, of the Russian Federation - have declared their intention either to become or to remain non-nuclear-weapon States.  So far, nine - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Uzbekistan - have acceded to the NPT.  As of now three safeguards agreements pursuant to the NPT are in force in the NIS (with Armenia, Latvia and Lithuania) and the Board has approved four further agreements (with Belarus, Estonia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan).  To date one of these agreements (with Kazakstan) has been signed.  Also, the Board last week approved the text of a safeguards agreement with Ukraine, which includes provisions for the application of safeguards by the IAEA to all nuclear material  under the jurisdiction or control of the Ukraine.


<p>
     In preparing for full implementation of safeguards in the NIS, the Agency has provided advice on the legal framework for control of nuclear activities in these countries.  Furthermore, in collaboration with a number of Member States, the Agency has provided assistance in establishing state systems of accounting for and control of nuclear material, advice on physical protection and on mechanisms for reporting of imports and exports relevant to safeguards. To date nearly 30 fact-finding missions and technical visits have been carried out for these purposes.

<p>
Dismantling Nuclear Weapons

<PRE>
     At the United Nations General Assembly in September 1993, President Clinton stated that the US would  pursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear weapons" and during their meeting in Moscow in January 1994 President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed on the establishment of a joint working group to consider, inter alia,:
     "steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of the process of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of putting a portion of the fissionable material under IAEA safeguards".
          Against this background, the United States has begun a process aimed at the eventual submission to IAEA inspection of all US fissile material no longer needed for defence requirements.  Locations where such material is to be stored and presented for Agency inspection over the next few years have already been identified.  Discussions have taken place between the Agency and the United States on legal, technical and financial aspects of the safeguards which are to be applied within the framework of the safeguards agreement between the Agency and the United States (document INFCIRC/288) and an exchange of letters to take account of particular aspects of the arrangement.  In the exchange of letters the US has confirmed its intention not to withdraw such material for any nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive purpose.

     A first inspection has recently been carried out at a storage site in Oak Ridge.  The Agency is also preparing a plan to bring additional highly enriched uranium and plutonium under safeguards in step with the rate at which such materials are declared excess to defence requirements.  The initiation of this process is a positive and encouraging development.  At the same time it calls for long-term solutions of issues concerning the management and financing of such arrangements.
</PRE>

<p>
A Cut-Off Agreement

<p>
     While safeguards verification of nuclear material recovered from dismantled weapons will foster confidence that none of this material will be used to produce new weapons, the objective of verifying compliance with an agreement to prohibit the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes would be to create confidence that nuclear weapons arsenals could not be increased on the basis of newly produced nuclear material.

<p>
     In December last year, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, without a vote, a resolution which recommended  the negotiation in the most appropriate international forum, of a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices" and which further requested the Agency  to provide assistance for examination of verification arrangements for such a treaty as required .  To ensure that the IAEA Secretariat will be able to provide prompt and sound advice, I have established a working group within the Secretariat which is examining relevant issues and preparing background papers.  We thus stand ready to assist governments as requested by the General Assembly.


<p>
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

<p>
     During the past year the Agency has been invited by the Ad Hoc Committee on a CTB of the Conference on Disarmament to provide information about the Agency's infrastructure and technical expertise in connection with the discussion of verification of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Presentations have been made on the Agency s experience in radionuclide monitoring and on-site inspections as relevant to a CTBT.

<p>
     In the view of the Agency Secretariat a verification role under a CTBT would be consistent with the Agency's mandate and would fit well with the Agency s current activities in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.  Indeed, there is an obvious overlap between the commitment by a State not to test a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device and a non- proliferation commitment by the same State not to use nuclear material for weapons or explosive purposes.  Thus Agency verification under comprehensive safeguards agreements is directly relevant to verification of compliance with a test ban agreement.  Any non compliance with a CTBT would also be non-compliance with a comprehensive safeguards agreement - and both violations would be reported to the Security Council.  Thus, setting up a new organization to verify obligations under a CTBT, the objective of which is in part identical to that of non- proliferation treaties, could lead to complications and would undoubtedly prove more costly than using the Agency for both regimes.

<p>
Management of Plutonium and HEU

<p>
     Last year, I noted that the current process of nuclear disarmament in the US and Russia and ongoing reprocessing of spent civilian nuclear fuel would lead to substantial quantities of plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) which needed to be stored before use or disposal. I also drew attention to the international interest in the storage of such materials taking place under conditions of adequate physical security, nuclear safety and - not least - under conditions providing a high degree of assurance that the material will not be used for weapons or explosives.  Also, informal discussions have focussed on possible additional confidence-building measures.  There seems to be broad agreement that the peaceful storage or use of plutonium and HEU should be highly transparent.  One possible step is the regular publication of information on stocks of separated civil plutonium. It has also been proposed that the IAEA might be asked to attest the consistency of information thus made public with information available to it under the safeguards system.

<p>
Trafficking in Nuclear Material

<p>
     The international community has been much alarmed by recent cases of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  Over the last year the Secretariat has recorded many incidents which warranted follow up.  Fortunately information received indicates that only small quantities have been involved and in no case does the material appear to have come from a nuclear weapons stockpile.  This does not mean that there is not a serious problem.  Uncontrolled movement of nuclear material clearly involves both radiation safety and proliferation risks.

<p>
     There have been extensive discussions between States in recent weeks in search of remedies to the trafficking problem.  The IAEA Secretariat has also consulted many Member States exposed to trafficking to identify ways in which the Agency might help mitigate the problem, and areas of the work, like police investigation, in which as a rule the Agency has no role to play.  It seems widely agreed that preventing diversion at the sources is crucial and nuclear material accounting and control together with physical protection systems are central to such prevention.  The Agency has been active for many years in arranging for training, in providing expert advice and in co-ordinating the elaboration of guidelines in these two areas.  With adequate resources these efforts could be expanded without delay.  Further, the current Agency system of collecting and analysing open information obtained from the media and Member States could be improved significantly.  An improved system would allow systematic reporting to Member States, helping them to separate fact from fiction and providing a basis for assessing the real extent of the problem.

<p>
     In order more systematically to consider ideas from Member States about increased Agency activities to assist in the combatting of trafficking, I am ready to convene a  Round Table  of government experts that could recommend specific action which could be taken promptly.

<p>
     Finally on this issue, one could ask whether it is not time for all Member States with nuclear material under their control voluntarily to commit themselves to protect such material, at a minimum, at the levels given in the Agency s Guidelines for the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material contained in INFCIRC/225/Rev.3.

<p>
Concluding Remarks

<p>
     My comments today, I trust, demonstrate the continuing importance of the Agency s existing programmes and the certainty that some new responsibilities will have to be assumed to meet emerging new requirements of Member States.

<p>
     It is entirely appropriate to insist that existing resources be used well and only for activities to which governments accord high priority before additional resources are requested.  I think governments would agree that the IAEA has a good record in this regard.  We have sharpened our budget and programme setting process with a view to redirecting resources to higher priority activities.  We are strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of our programmes to ensure efficient delivery and to better assess their impact.  We are moving to a programme based accounting system which will also help us focus on programme delivery.  We have mastered a long cash crisis and have been able to progressively implement activities which had to be deferred as a result of late payment of contributions.  Starting in 1995, we will return to implementing close to the full approved programme and budget for that year.  These developments all contribute to strengthening our main activities and they create a good basis for the Agency to assume new responsibilities if governments so decide.

<p>
     However, for the Agency to successfully meet the current and expected demands for Agency activities, more adequate, orderly and predictable financing is needed.  Many important activities are now only possible because of the extrabudgetary support from some Member States.  This is not a desirable long-term solution. A new understanding amongst governments is needed to secure adequate and timely funding for the full range of present and new activities which the Agency is called on to undertake.

<p>
     My last comments relate to our staff and to our host country.

<p>
     Reports submitted to the Conference on the Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat demonstrate that gradually we are attaining greater diversity in staff recruitment - proportionally more professional staff from developing countries and proportionally more professional staff who are women.  This is positive and the process must continue.  It will.

<p>
     I want to acknowledge my  indebtedness to the staff of the Agency.  I am glad to head a team - both professional and general service staff - which has proved capable of successfully meeting the many challenges of the past year.  Through dedicated hard work and with minimal increase in numbers this team has managed to respond to the increasing demands which Member States place on the IAEA.

<p>
     In closing, I want to thank our host Government and host City for their continued efforts to facilitate our working conditions and to make the life of our many visitors as well as our resident international civil servants safe, comfortable and enjoyable.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NUCLEAR ENERGY, NUCLEAR DISARMEMENT AND THE UNITED NATIONS AFTER THE COLD WAR</H3>
<P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by  Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
International Atomic Energy Agency<BR></H4>
<P>

<P>
15 December 1994</H4>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Some fifty years ago the Cold War began. Today it is over and the old adversaries work together. Fifty years ago the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki started the nuclear arms race. Today we are witnessing a nuclear arms race in reserve and the nuclear weapons are increasingly irrelevant. By contrast the first controlled nuclear chain reaction under Enrico Fermi a little over fifty years ago in Chicago has led to a worldwide nuclear power industry which today generates almost as much electricity  as all the world's hydropower. About fifty years ago the United Nations was established to be handicapped 
most of this time by the deadlock of the Cold War. Today this crippling effect is over and more problems are placed on the tables of the UN family of organizations than they have the capacity to handle.
<P>
Thus, five years before the end of the century we live in a world that is radically different from the one which existed five years before the middle of the 20th century. I shall try to discuss the three important developments which I have mentioned: The coming of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy - for electricity generation, for medicine, for agriculture; the end of the era of nuclear weapons and the challenges of the United Nations after the Cold War.
<P>
<B>Energy and the Environment</B>
<P>
     Energy is the lifeblood of modern society - essential for industry, transport, heating,
welfare, but also the source of pollution and environmental threats.  A high standard of living is
invariably linked to a high energy consumption.
<P>
     The average North American now uses some  7200 kg of oil equivalent per year, while
the average Indian makes do with 280 kg.  If we look at the use of electricity, the picture is
similar.  Norway has the highest annual per capita consumption in the world - some 25 000 kWh- almost all of it hydro generated; Bangladesh has among the lowest - less than
100 kWh/capita/year.  In Chile it is about 1600, in Argentina and Uruguay it is about 1700.
<P>
     Although they have some 75% of the world s population, the developing countries
currently use only some 30% of the primary energy and some 25% of the electricity produced in the world.  It is therefore not surprising that these countries plan to increase their energy and electricity production to improve their standards of living and to meet the needs of growing
populations. 
<P>
     Conservation - meaning either a  more efficient or a more selective use of energy - is
important to offset some of the increasing demand for energy, including electricity.  But it is
unrealistic to hold that conservation measures can completely offset new demand or even
reduce the total energy consumption.
<P>
     While the drive for expanded production, more transport and higher standards of living
are essential reasons for the ever growing demand for energy, population increase, especially
in the developing world, is another crucial factor.  Indeed, if the size of the world s population is not stabilized, it is hard to see how energy provision and environmental protection could be
managed.  Let me give you some figures.  At the time of the birth of Christ, the world population is estimated to have been around 350 million.  By the year 1900, it had increased to 1.5 billion. In 1990, the population of our globe was about 5 billion and in the year 2000 we expect it to be 6 billion.  Thus, in the last ten years of this century we expect to increase by as much as we did during the first 1900 years after the birth of Christ.  There will be formidable problems to supply these growing numbers of people with enough energy.  
<P>
     In its last report (1992) the World Energy Council estimated that between 1990 and
2020, world energy demand might increase by 98% in the "enhanced economic development"
case, by 53% in the "reference/business as usual" case and by 29% in the "ecologically driven" case which assumes drastic measures for efficiency improvement and energy savings.  We must ask ourselves:  "Where will this energy come from?"  We cannot change our energy
systems overnight.  In the foreseeable future, there will be an energy mix, as there is today. 
Fossil fuels now cover nearly 90% of the world s total energy use.  Regrettably there is no
economically viable way in which the CO2 from the burning of fossil fuel can be removed or
neutralized.  The Rio Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 devoted much
attention to the need to stabilize CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to reduce the risk of global warming.  The Conference refrained from telling us, however, how this was to be achieved.
<P>
     Many governments in Western industrialized countries today either postpone decisions
on additional power generation or opt for a greater use of natural gas, which produces about
half as much CO2 per energy unit as does coal.  There is an increasing general awareness
among governments, however, that, although expansion of CO2-free nuclear power alone cannot solve the problem of CO2 emissions and global warming, nuclear power must be part of the solution.  The awareness is also increasing that renewable sources of energy apart from hydro power - I have in mind solar, wind, geothermal - which today constitute less than 0.3% of the world s energy - cannot realistically be expected to reach more than a few percent in the next decades.  Fusion energy is many decades away - if it can at all be harnessed.  Fast breeder reactors, on the other hand, are an available technology which would make the world s uranium resources an almost limitless energy basis.  However, with the present low uranium prices, breeder reactors are not needed.  Light water reactors  produce electricity more cheaply at the present time.
<P>
     If we are driven to the conclusion that an expanded use of nuclear power must be an
important part of the future global energy mix, we are obliged to tackle the problems which
make many people sceptical of nuclear power, namely:  (a) the fear of another Chernobyl; and
(b) the fear of radioactive wastes.
<P>
     There is, first of all, a tremendous need for a better understanding of nuclear matters. 
They need to be demystified.  If we use gravity to our benefit, why should we not also use
radiation for our benefit?  It is true that radiation must be handled with respect and that the
public is less tolerant of accidents in nuclear power plants than of accidents in, say, hydro dams or chemical industries.  We must therefore ensure a very high level of radiation protection and nuclear safety everywhere in the world.  The risk for accidents can hardly be reduced to zero, but improved practices and improved technology can minimize risks and limit the consequences of such accidents as do occur.
<P>
     Turning to the issue of nuclear waste, it is a common - and erroneous - perception that
satisfactory methods to safely dispose of the long-lived nuclear wastes do not yet exist.  A
nuclear plant of 1000 MW(e) will produce 30 tons of highly radioactive waste per year and the
methods which have been worked out for disposing of this waste in metal containers deposited deep down in stable geological formations are designed to ensure isolation for tens of thousands of years.  These methods would seem to pose much smaller risks to us than the
methods we use for disposing of the waste resulting from the burning of fossil fuels, namely to
emit them into the atmosphere and to dump them on the surface of the world.  This is not to
ignore that the methods of handling, transporting and disposing of nuclear waste and of
plutonium - including the shipment of plutonium - can and should be further improved.
<P>
     My conclusion is that the need for more energy, in particular electricity, combined with
the environmental problems already linked with the present level of use of fossil fuels, will make it necessary to expand the global use of nuclear power.  Ongoing work to further reduce the risk of nuclear accidents and their consequences through improved technology and high
international safety standards, as well as further development of nuclear waste disposal
techniques, will gradually, I believe, reduce the public scepticism.  I am thinking primarily of the technologically advanced countries.  In developing countries the introduction of nuclear power will be slow.  However, the transfer to those countries of nuclear techniques in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry is fast increasing.  Let me describe, by way of example, the technical co-operation between the IAEA and Chile.
<P>
<B>Transfer of Nuclear Technology - Technical Co-operation</B>
<P>
     The range of activities carried out under the IAEA technical co-operation programme -
including ARCAL (Agreement on Regional Co-operation in Latin America) - covers many areas:  food and agriculture, industry, human health, radiation protection, nuclear power and its fuel cycle, safety of nuclear installations and radioactive waste management.  About 2000 experts are sent every year to assist our Member States and about 3400 nationals receive training each year under the Fellowship and Training Course Programme.  For 1995 the technical co-operation programme of the IAEA amounts to some 70 million dollars.
<P>
     I am pleased to say that Chile is one of our best-organized counterparts and a country
which has made excellent use of technical co-operation programmes.  Over the years Chile has received more than 9 million dollars in direct assistance.  At present there are 15 projects under implementation, to which five new projects approved for 1995-96 and amounting roughly to 1 million dollars should be added.
<P>
     Let me give only two examples of achievements in the technical co-operation between
Chile and the IAEA:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> As a result of an Agency-assisted project in the field of mineral exploration, a
     phosphorite deposit was found which, I understand, is now being exploited by a private
     enterprise on a commercial basis;

<LI> A project on soil fertility and plant nutrition using the phosphorus-32 and nitrogen-15
     techniques, was instrumental in optimizating the use of fertilizer in wheat crops and fruit
     production.
</UL>
     The future TC Programme for Chile reflects a major effort to develop some highly
innovative technology projects.  To take an example, the "Development of Lithium Ceramic
Materials" makes use of the considerable lithium resources of Chile (about 40% of the world
reserves) and of the Nuclear Energy Commission s research reactor.  Another example:  a
pre-feasibility study will assess electron beam treatment of high-sulphur content effluents from
copper smelter plants.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Disarmament and Arms Control, IAEA Inspection</B>
<P>
     The publicity and attention devoted to the nuclear arms race and the threat of nuclear
war long overshadowed the attention devoted to the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
Let us hope that with accelerating arms control and disarmament the public will discover the
benefits of the peaceful applications.  The nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia will be cut
from some 65 000 warheads to a few thousand.
<P>
     There are some very specific questions that I should like to focus on in the exciting
process of nuclear disarmament and arms control.  
<P>
     A first question is what will happen to the quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium
that will be recovered as the warheads are dismantled?  The answer is that the enriched
uranium can be diluted and used as fuel in nuclear power reactors to produce electricity.  The
plutonium can also be turned into fuel for ordinary light-water reactors or be burnt in reactors
specifically built for the purpose - or be disposed of as waste.  At present large quantities of
plutonium from the US weapons programme have been placed by the US under IAEA control.
<P>
     Another question relates to the existing capacity in some States, including the five
declared nuclear-weapon States, to produce nuclear material for weapons use.  If more nuclear material is no longer needed for weapons, it should not be difficult for nuclear-weapon States to agree to stop producing such material for weapons use.   Such a "cut-off agreement"  is in fact under discussion and it would be of direct relevance for those States which have a capacity to produce weapons-useable material and which have not already renounced nuclear weapons, i.e. the five declared nuclear-weapon States and Israel, India and Pakistan.  The problems of effectively verifying such a cut-off agreement would be substantial.  It would require a lot of inspection.
<P>
     A third question - of great current interest - is whether a <I>complete ban on the testing
of nuclear weapons </I> might be within reach.  Recently only China has been testing.  The US, UK, France and Russia are presently observing declared moratoria.  In a world of drastically shrinking nuclear arsenals and growing detente it is likely to appear incongruous to continue any nuclear testing.  Although a few still urge some continued testing to check the safety and reliability of existing weapons, who can be sure such tests would not in reality be to try out new types of weapons?
<P>
     A fourth question - and one of most direct relevance to the IAEA - relates to the effect of
the present international climate on the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to
further countries - what is generally termed the non-proliferation regime, formalized above all in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty of Tlatelolco.
<P>
     There are some who seem to think that the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons is
increasing with the disappearance of the Cold War and of clear and disciplined military blocks. 
Certainly the Security Council shows an increasing determination to prevent a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  In the statement made at the summit-level meeting of the Security Council on 31 January 1992, the members declared that, I quote:  "The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security ...".
<P>
     Given that Article 39 of the UN Charter enables the Council to decide on enforcement
action when it identifies a threat to peace, the statement quoted seems to be a stern warning
that the Council will feel free to take severe action to prevent proliferation.
<P>
     It is true that some new risks of a further spread of nuclear weapons have arisen.  The
disintegration of the Soviet Union gave rise to three new independent States with nuclear
weapons on their territory:  Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan.  However, today all the three are
non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and all the nuclear weapons
on their territory have either been sent to Russia or are to be sent there.  With diplomacy,
security guarantees and some funds the risk of proliferation seems to have been averted.
<P>
     Evidence of another risk arising in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has been
seen in the increased incidence of trafficking in nuclear materials.  Steps are now taken to
strengthen the co-operation between European customs and police authorities to stop this trade which is linked to widespread criminality.  The IAEA is actively helping the countries in question strengthen their control over facilities which are authorized to have nuclear material and thereby to prevent any such material coming adrift illegally.  Until now, as far as we know, no weapon grade highly enriched uranium or plutonium have been diverted through the black market.  Most cases investigated by the IAEA have turned out to involve natural uranium, depleted uranium or low enriched uranium and the plutonium cases have mostly had regard to minuscule quantities.
<P>
     A more serious risk of nuclear proliferation was identified with the discovery after the
Gulf War that Iraq, a party to the NPT and a State accepting IAEA safeguards, had a secret
programme aimed at the production of highly enriched uranium and nuclear weapons. 
Fortunately, despite a billion-dollar effort, some years of work would have remained before Iraq could have made a bomb.  However, the case raised several disturbing questions.  When the NPT was concluded, the proliferation concern was chiefly about advanced countries - like
Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Japan - going for nuclear weapons.  These countries
seem later to have securely settled for a non-nuclear-weapon status.  However, the case of Iraq showed that a growing number of developing countries might be attaining a technological level at which nuclear weapons might - with money and time - be within reach.  Were there more Iraqs?  The other disturbing matter was that Iraq had been able to hide its large programme to the IAEA, to satellite observation and to intelligence.  Were the safeguards toothless?  How can the risk of nuclear proliferation be countered in today s world?
<P>
     The case of Iraq led to a great deal of soul searching and innovative thinking.  It has
always been understood that the incentive to go for nuclear weapons lies in security problems
and that the<I> first barrier</I> to nuclear proliferation lies in adequate national security.  Hence detente, security guarantees and assurance that neighbours do not develop nuclear weapons are the best measures.  For the Middle East, to take an example, a well verified nuclear-weapon-free zone, including Israel, Iraq, Egypt, Iran and many others, as a part of a peace settlement is the obvious most important strategy.
<P>
     A<I> second barrier</I> to nuclear proliferation lies in export restrictions applied by
States which are able to supply nuclear material and equipment and so-called dual-use
equipment.  Following the case of Iraq a tightening in these restrictions has taken place,
measures sometimes criticized by developing countries which claim that import for legitimate
peaceful uses is hampered.
<P>
     A <I>third barrier</I> to nuclear proliferation lies in the awareness that a discovery
through the IAEA safeguards system of a secret nuclear programme will lead to severe
reactions by the UN and governments.  Indeed, even a lack of co-operation with the IAEA might lead to suspicions and reactions.  To function effectively this deterrent presupposes that the IAEA safeguards system has a high capacity to detect any hidden nuclear programmes.  After the discoveries in Iraq a number of measures have been taken to strengthen the safeguards system and additional measures are being developed.  It was, indeed, through new improved safeguards analysis that the conclusion was reached in 1992 that the DPRK has more plutonium than what it declared to the Agency.
<P>
     After numerous trials in several countries which have volunteered co-operation, I am
confident that with a moderate increase in general openness about nuclear programmes and
increased access for IAEA inspectors, the governments of the world can have a safeguards
system that will very much reduce the risk of any significant secret nuclear programme going
undetected.  Another matter is how the international community and the Security Council will
react to discoveries or refused co-operation to clarify a situation.  The case of Iraq was one
model.  The case of the DPRK a totally different one.
<P>
     If there is some room for concern about the continued risk of nuclear proliferation, we
should also note some highly positive developments.  The Treaty of Tlatelolco will enter into
force when all signatories have ratified it, and the prospects are that this will happen soon. 
Argentina and Brazil have opened up their nuclear installations to each other and to
comprehensive international safeguards and Cuba has declared its readiness to join the Treaty. 
I note with appreciation the leading role of Chile in proposing the amendments that are making
the Treaty generally acceptable.
<P>
     For many years there was concern that South Africa might be developing nuclear
weapons. However, in August 1991 South Africa adhered to the NPT and the country became
the first to roll back from a nuclear-weapon status.  By now a number of other African States,
hitherto outside the NPT, have joined the Treaty and Algeria has declared that its ratification is
imminent.  The prospect of Africa becoming a nuclear-weapon-free continent has therefore
increased considerably.
<P>
     While France and China adhered to the NPT IN 1992 and thereby brought all the
declared nuclear-weapon States into the Treaty, there does not seem to be any early prospect
of India and Pakistan divesting themselves of the capacity they have to produce weapons
useable nuclear material.  With over 160 parties the Non-Proliferation Treaty is nevertheless an extremely successful arms control treaty, which has been of the greatest importance to prevent a general quantum leap in the megakilling capacity of States.  The ambition should be to make it universal and of unlimited duration.  The ambition should further be to reduce to a minimum the nuclear weapons in the hands of individual States and to transfer them to an international institution at some time in the future.
<P>
     In 1995, a conference will take place to decide whether the NPT should be extended for
an unlimited period of time or for specific periods.  The most serious criticism that has been
directed at the Treaty in the past has been that while it demands of non-nuclear-weapon States the very concrete and substantial commitment to renouncing nuclear weapons, it only commits nuclear-weapon States parties to make their best efforts to agree on disarmament.  With drastic reductions in the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, and with a general trend towards disarmament, the aims of the NPT to stem both vertical and horizontal proliferation are now in better harmony.  However, in the absence so far of a fully negotiated complete test ban treaty and an agreement on a cut-off of production of nuclear material for weapons, there is at present uncertainty as to how the conference will go.
<P>
<B>The United Nations - Life After 50</B>
<P>
For the United Nations the end of the Cold War, of the ideological struggle and of the various
local conflicts linked to that struggle whether in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia or
Nicaragua, mean that many new windows of opportunity open in the disarmament and security fields:  the Security Council s ability to act effectively against Iraq s aggression and occupation of Kuwait marked a high point and led to statements about a "new international order" under which aggression would be repelled.  Today, the pendulum has swung to moral indignation over the lack of effective action in former Yugoslavia, in Somalia and in Rwanda.
<P>
However, we need to nuance our judgements both about the past and present performance of
the United Nations.  The past fifty years have not been without some progress.  Although
effective security-related action through the UN was mostly impossible during the Cold War,
there was not complete paralysis.  The practice of peace-keeping developed and was very
valuable in some situations; the great process of decolonialization took place in this period; the universal recognition - but not universal respect - of human rights was achieved; central areas of international law were developed and codified - on diplomatic and consular relations, on the law of the sea, on the law of treaties; the North/South dialogue started in this period, creating an awareness of the danger and inequity of a division of the world into rich and poor and of the need for action to speed up development; some disarmamen t and arms control was also achieved - the partial nuclear test ban treaty, NPT, ABM and START I; and last, but not least, a strong beginning was made to identify and analyse the growing environmental problems and to take action on some of them.
<P>
     But much in the United Nations during the Cold War was rhetoric.
<P>
     In today s radically changed world the fear of mutual extinction by nuclear weapons and
war between great powers is disappearing.  The Warsaw Pact no longer exists and NATO,
having lost the enemy for which the alliance was created, is groping to redefine its role.  Today
the great powers do not try any longer to exploit local conflicts and inflame them.  Rather, they
seem reluctant to be drawn into such conflicts and to insist that any action should be under
UN authorization!
<P>
     Regrettably, while many local conflicts which were fuelled from the outside have died out
- Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Salvador - others burn bright without outside incitement - Yugoslavia,
Somalia, Rwanda, Afghanistan.  Yet other conflicts, like Cambodia and Angola, remain glowing embers threatening to re-ignite.  It is fashionable these days to pour scorn on the United Nations for its patent inability to protect the Bosnian Muslim population and to protect civilians in Rwanda and Somalia.  The Bosnian situation is compared to the appeasement of Hitler at Munich.  The UN - and to a lesser extent NATO - is held guilty.  It does not take much effort, however, to discover that the lack of effective action by the Security Council in these cases is not due to any significant statutory or organizational weakness in the UN or NATO, but to the clear unwillingness of States members to commit, perhaps long term, the considerable military and economic resources that would be needed for effective action.  Peace-keeping - essentially the use of military forces to oversee the peace - is much less costly and thus more attractive, but regrettably it only works well when all conflicting parties want it and are prepared to respect it.
<P>
     Before we rush to condemn the reluctant governments in the Security Council and in
NATO for their lack of moral fibre, perhaps we should ask ourselves if we as parents would be
willing to send our sons into battle to help solve the conflicts we are talking about.  We might
further ask ourselves as taxpayers how much money we are willing to contribute to required
UN operations.  I suspect we shall find that most people would be prepared to sacrifice a lot
when they feel that the freedom or vital security interests of their own country are at stake. 
They are unwilling, however, to make big sacrifices when the vital interests of their own
countries are not at stake.  We should not be surprised then that their governments are not
ready to contribute sufficient resources to ensure effective action by the UN or NATO, where
they rightly or wrongly do not perceive their own vital interests to be threatened.
<P>
     One measure that could help to bring about effective armed action by the UN in some
small-scale conflicts would be the establishment of a few fully internationally integrated UN
legions.  It would cost money and such legions would hardly be adequate to perform effectively in a rather large conflict like Yugoslavia, but such a scheme would somewhat isolate an intervention undertaken by the UN from a national public opinion in individual States.
<P>
     Let me conclude with some reflections on the situation of the principal organs of the
United Nations and on some non-security related challenges before the system in the decade to come.
<P>
     The intensified discussion about an expansion of the Security Council is further evidence
of the changes that have occurred in the world.  During the Cold War it would have been
perceived as a joke to propose that Germany and Japan should become permanent members. Permanent members were the victors of the Second World War, five military great powers possessing nuclear weapons.  Today, the military power of the United States, Russia and others is becoming less relevant.  They cannot bring themselves to use it in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda.  Today, economic power is often more relevant than military power and Germany and Japan are asking to sit where their power is needed.  It is clear, moreover, that the weight and influence of the developing countries is now such that even with limited economic power they will demand greater representation in the Security Council. This is certainly needed - for the most powerful international organ should not act without the effective participation of governments that represent the greater part of humanity.
<P>
     There is, at present, a great deal of resentment in the General Assembly about the
exclusiveness of the Security Council and the lack of transparency in its working.  For the
General Assembly, in which Andorra like China has one vote, it is difficult to envisage any other role than that of being a world forum in which all States have the right to voice their views. However, the vast majority of developing States might feel that their interests were better taken care of if the role of the South in the Security Council was strengthened.
<P>
     What is the role of the Secretary-General of the UN in the years to come?  The great
powers may often be inclined to limit his or her role to quiet diplomacy, to the considerable job
of managing the UN and to accepting and carrying out the mandates handed down by the
Security Council.  Other Member States and public opinion are likely to want a Secretary-
General able to initiate and lead, as an impartial voice and as a conscience of the world.  To
combine the role of an impartial political leader, a diplomat and conciliator and a mega-manager will not be easy for anyone.
<P>
     Let me end by listing some of the key non-security related problems which I think the UN
will have to face in the next decade.  First, the promotion of decent standards of living is the
greatest need of the large majority of humanity.  This will require enlightened policies by all,
including the rich countries which have the major influences on the world economy, on the
World Bank and the IMF.
<P>
     Secondly, it is possible that the environmental threats to our planet and our well being
will turn out to be our greatest concern in years to come:  ozone depletion, global warming, acid rains, pollution of ground water, depletion of fisheries.  These problems will call for increased vigilance and action both at the national and international level.  Without effective policies to slow and eventually to stop population growth there is little hope that we can protect the environment and raise standards of living.
<P>
     Third, some political, social and cultural challenges:  the struggle to uphold human rights,
to advance the status of women and to promote and maintain democracy, will require persistent action.  Further, with ever increasing international integration - not least through the influence of media - there will be a need for measures to preserve the cultural diversity that is the rich heritage of the time before the world became one global village.  Lastly, we need to ensure that governments unite in their efforts to fight criminality.  There is a risk otherwise that the criminal elements in the world will integrate faster than the civilized elements do.

<TITLE> Promoting the Peaceful and Preventing the Military Uses of Nuclear Energy</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Promoting the Peaceful and Preventing the Military Uses of Nuclear Energy </H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR>Opening Session, Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hiroshima, Japan</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>13 April 1994</H4>
<P><HR>Not much time remains till we reach the moment that we call year 2000.  As on a new year's eve we look back over the past year and forward to the coming one, perhaps now is a moment to look at our situation from a longer perspective than we usually do.  This is said to be the nuclear age.  Indeed, questions concerning the uses of nuclear energy - for destruction and for development - have been at the top of the international agenda for the last 50 years.  There are at present great changes occurring which oblige us to re-examine the roles of nuclear energy.
<P>No place could be more appropriate for that re-examination than Japan, because Japan is among the very few countries which have consistently and successfully tamed the atom to use in medicine, in agriculture and, above all, to give a substantial and independent energy base for its growing standard of living and its fast expanding industry.  When today we rejoice in the phenomenal growth of Asian economies and the rising standard of living it brings to billions, we might do well to remember that this evolution began in Japan and that important elements - apart from education, hard work and stability - were the privilege of early demilitarization and a determined use of peaceful nuclear power.  We should ask ourselves whether this recipe is not one that the world at large could and should follow.
<P>In Japan no place could be more appropriate than Hiroshima for this discussion.  The spectre of nuclear war between great powers, which has haunted the world ever since the bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is at last losing its grip on us.  The discussion is no longer about mutually assured destruction but about how we can do away with existing nuclear arsenals and how we can prevent new nuclear weapons from coming into being.  Certainly the use of armed force at national and regional levels is not over, but cold war and containment are no longer the dominant factors they once were.  They are giving way to commercial competition and co-operation, negotiation and integration.  In this new era disarmament must go hand in hand with renewed efforts to help the hundreds of millions who live in deprivation, with efforts to uphold human rights, and to maintain cultural diversity, with efforts to protect the environment from mindless destruction and efforts to consolidate and develop regional and global institutions, notably the United Nations system.
<P>Those who work in the nuclear field must contribute their thinking and expertise especially to two vitally important items on this new world agenda: the practical elimination of nuclear weapons and the safe and expanded use of nuclear energy for health, development and environmental protection.  I shall address the second issue first.
Promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
<P>There are an ever increasing number of beneficial and peaceful applications of nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture and industry.  While all of them require full attention to radiation protection, only a few of them evoke any resistance.  In particular, as we all know,  As we all know public concern is focussed on nuclear reactors and the disposal of nuclear wastes.  Thus, the successful promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy requires, inter alia, understanding those concerns and meeting them or showing that they are not well founded.  I shall leave aside the many other peaceful uses of nuclear energy and address the issue of nuclear power.
<P>There is no doubt that the accident at Three Mile Island and the disaster at Chernobyl have had a heavy impact on public opinion regarding nuclear power and that there is a continuing preoccupation with nuclear safety especially in many reactors of older Russian design.
<P>It would also appear that mass media, ever in search of what can attract the public's attention, by disseminating any news which play on the public's fears of anything connected with radiation, actually help to confirm and amplify these fears.  It is true that in many countries where there is no immediately compelling need to add further electric capacity - as is the case in many industrialized States - the public will also resist further fossil fuelled plants and large hydro schemes.  In East Asia, however, where electricity demand is growing fast and it is understood that a higher standard of living depends directly upon responding to this demand, the public seems ready to cope with whatever concern it may feel and accept an expansion of nuclear power in the same way as it accepts other sources of electricity.  Nonetheless, public acceptance of or resistance to nuclear power does not depend only upon the presence or absence of strong demand for electricity.  Even in the face of a strong need for more electricity the expansion of nuclear power at present would meet insuperable resistance in several industrialized countries - not only those few, like Austria, Denmark and Ireland, which have made rejection of nuclear power a policy.  To take a recent example, Finland, with a largely pro-nuclear government, with four existing nuclear units with an absolutely superb safety and production record, needs additional electric power.  Yet, the Finnish Parliament last year rejected a government proposal for more nuclear power.  By contrast, France, with a relatively comfortable electricity balance based on a large and well-functioning nuclear sector, continues to build nuclear power plants without much public concern.  There is not one simple explanation as to why nuclear power is accepted or rejected.  Each community has its own history and power situation and must decide in its own constitutional way what energy sources it will rely on.
<P>Nuclear power must first of all compete with other power sources on its own economic, safety and reliability merits.  The rapid expansion of nuclear power in East Asia and the slow but continued growth in some other countries, like France, shows that competition on these grounds alone is possible.  Today, it is imperative, however, that the comparisons between different energy sources also take their respective health and environmental impacts into account.  This necessity ought to lead to a renewed interest in nuclear power.  Indeed, the global climate change that is presently foreseen as a result of the excessive emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, notably CO2 and methane, would appear to make an early revival of nuclear power crucially important.  It is curious that few of the many governments, international authorities and non-governmental groups who are deeply engaged in the question of global warming have highlighted this point.  In my view this has given a certain Alice in Wonderland character to what should be a serious public discussion.  Let me give illustrations.
<P>Although global climate change was one of the principal concerns at the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development in Rio, few speakers at the Conference addressed the question of energy.  The Framework Convention on Climate Change which was adopted by the Conference established the aim of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels which would not interfere dangerously with the climatic system.  However, the convention does not stipulate how this is to be done.  The aim of some countries to contain man-made greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 is characterized in the World Energy Council's authoritative report "Energy for Tomorrow's World" as simply unrealistic.  Indeed, in all the Council's global energy scenarios for the time up to the year 2020 - even the most optimistic - there is an increase in the use of fossil fuels and an increase in CO2 emissions.  To anyone looking around in the world today, it is evident that there is a global growth in reliance on the burning of fossil fuels and a global growth - not reduction - in CO2 emissions.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the rhetoric is going in one direction, the reality in another!
<P>The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is looking much beyond the year 2020 and is working with scenarios up to the year 2100.  Under a "renewable sources scenario" which it has before it, renewable sources, including hydro, would in the year 2100 have a share of 83% of the total energy supply - as compared to 6% commercial renewables at present.  Both fossil and nuclear power would be practically phased out.  Biomass would provide 50% of the world energy consumption, most of it being solid biomass used for electricity generation.  One may query how meaningful such theoretical exercises are.  In particular the rapidly accelerating and dominant role of renewable energies in the IPCC scenario I have referred to appears highly speculative.  The World Energy Council foresees for biomass, solar, wind and geothermal power still only a very minor role even 30 years from now.
<P>The paradoxical situation might be summed up as follows:
<P>First, relying today for over three quarters of our energy needs on the burning of fossil fuels, we are drastically interfering with the ecological balance of the Earth by releasing into the atmosphere at a fantastic speed huge quantities of carbon dioxide taken from the very same atmosphere in the course of millions of years and stored underground;
<P>Second, it is suggested to us that the phasing out of this enormous and risky interference should occur through the phasing in mainly of biomass, solar, wind and geothermal power - sources which after more than a decade of development contribute only a fraction of a percent of the world's energy and whose real development potential remains highly hypothetical;
<P>Third, it is deemed inopportune at the very least by most leading participants in the greenhouse discussion to suggest that nuclear power, which now contributes about 5% of the world's energy and hardly any of its CO2, should be expanded, although it is a proven and presently available technology which could easily and rapidly expand, and which - with breeder reactors - could offer an almost inexhaustible source of CO2-free energy.
<P>The dominant voices in the global environmental debate are so loud in their rejection of nuclear power and their advocacy of conservation and the hypothetical vastly expanded use of renewables that comments about the now existing and significant potential contribution of nuclear power are almost drowned out.  Even among important groups of scientists the focus seems sometimes to be chiefly on speculative recipes.  For example, reports from the recent annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science highlight suggestions that we might shoot a thin layer of dust into the atmosphere every few years to shield the earth from too much warming.  Certainly, the exploration of imaginative scientific ideas should not be discouraged but the world-wide attention given to ideas such as this is perhaps a sad sign that the nuclear option is placed on a distant, almost forgotten, back-burner.
<P>However, there are, to be sure, statements in support of the use of nuclear power coming from quarters other than from the nuclear industry itself.  Let me cite three.
<P>The 1993 report "Energy for Tomorrow's World" by the World Energy Council states - I quote - that "nuclear power has immense technical potential" and that "there is a need to continue to seek a way of exploiting the immense energy reserves of nuclear power which is publicly acceptable across the whole fuel cycle from procurement and processing through disposal."  The report also suggests that a major drive will be required to "achieve the early rehabilitation of nuclear energy" and to advance the introduction of renewable energy supplies "if a significant decline in the world's relative dependence on fossil fuels is going to occur over the next century" (page 90).  To these considerations one might add the observation that already in today's world more than 400 nuclear power reactors help us to avoid some 1800 million tons of CO2 emissions that would have resulted from an alternative use of coal.  This is about 9% of present total CO2 emissions (of 20 000 million tons) from fossil fuels.  One might also have added the observation that the average CO2 emission per kWh in the UK, where 70% of the electricity comes from coal combustion was nearly one kilogram, while in France, where more than 70% of electricity comes from nuclear power, the CO2 emission per kWh was about one tenth of the UK value, or less than one hundred grams. 
<P>Another statement comes from the Club of Rome.  More than two years ago a Club of Rome report concluded that - I quote - "the use of coal and oil is probably more dangerous to society, because of the carbon dioxide they produce, than nuclear energy.  There are therefore strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open and for the development of the fast breeder reactors ...".
<P>The third statement I want to quote is by the Government of Japan.  In a document submitted last December to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development it is stated - I quote  - that "Japan should promote development and utilization of nuclear power on the assumption of safety assurance, regarding it as an energy source which does not release CO2."  It is gratifying that at least one important government breaks the curtain of official silence about nuclear power and global warming.  There is a certain risk that political parties and governments which are in fact positive or at least open to the nuclear power option simply for fear of alienating some voters remain completely silent on the issue, leaving discussion to vocal anti-nuclear groups.  This could result in the option being unavailable one day when it may be needed to meet compelling demands for additional power capacity.  One conclusion to be drawn is that scientists, and engineers and others familiar with the nuclear power option must speak up so that the public can obtain a balanced picture of both the potentials and problems of nuclear power.  It should be understood, for instance, that if industrialized countries, which have the economic, scientific and technological capacity to expand their reliance on nuclear power used this capacity, the pressure on fossil fuels would diminish to the benefit of developing countries,  Although these countries are the most energy hungry, nuclear power is, for the most part, not a viable option for them today, because it is very demanding in technological infrastructure and in capital.
<P>Let me conclude that public discussion, with an active participation by scientists and engineers, is needed for a wide nuclear revival.  However, there are also a number of other things that this group could and should do to enhance the use of nuclear energy.
<P>The first and foremost, of course, is to ensure consistently good operation of existing nuclear plants.  Much has been attained in this sphere in the last ten years.  The notion of a nuclear safety culture to be emulated by all countries, is generally accepted and is propagated and assisted at the international level by the IAEA as well as the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).  There is now every prospect that an international convention on the safety of nuclear power plants will be adopted this year under IAEA auspices.  Through this convention, States will bind themselves to a number of important safety principles and accept participation in periodic peer review of implementation of the obligations under the convention.  This convention may be expected to be followed later by the elaboration of another, similar convention on the safe disposal of nuclear waste.  The international legal infrastructure relating to nuclear safety is thus slowly growing beyond the familiar instruments on civil liability, physical protection and notification and assistance in the case of emergencies.
<P>While we can now register over 6000 reactor years with the Chernobyl accident as being the only one which has caused significant off-site radioactive releases, there is still concern  that safety improvements are not taking place quickly enough in many older power reactors of Russian design.  Scarcity of resources in the former Soviet Union and too slow assistance from abroad are the reasons.  It is essential that all concerned accept their responsibility.  There is a compelling common interest in ensuring that no further accident occurs.  At the IAEA we are at present particularly concerned about the situation at Chernobyl, where two reactors are still in operation and where many skilled operators have left.  A special meeting will soon be held in Vienna on this subject.
<P>A second important area of activity is the further development of nuclear power technology.  The nuclear recession which still prevails in many countries in the Western industrialized world does not encourage expensive investment in such development.  However, we should be aware that the emergence of advanced types of reactors might do much to increase acceptability of nuclear power.  When public opinion does recognize the need to expand the use of nuclear power, as I trust one day it will, it should find that technology in this field as in others has not been standing still.
<P>Many new demands are being placed upon the next generation of reactors.  Their safety should be such that no plans are needed for the emergency evacuation of people living in their vicinity.  They should be economically competitive and easier to operate than present reactors.  With a renewed acceptance of the nuclear power option, new functions can be foreseen for nuclear energy.  The fast growing number of huge cities around the world could be supplied with electricity from reactors which are located not too far away.  Regions which must increasingly rely on the desalination of sea water could look to a new option.  Heat producing reactors could have wide industrial use and reactors could be used for district heating in the cold regions of the world.
<P>Japan is taking a prominent part in the development of the next generation of nuclear reactors.  This is far sighted and may one day pay off
well.  The high temperature gas cooled reactor is an interesting example.  Even the much maligned breeder reactors may one day be warmly
welcomed.  It is true that the economic case for breeders is not present today - with uranium prices at a very low level, and it is true that the use of
plutonium raises special security demands.  However, looking toward the next century the experience that a few countries, including Japan, France
and Russia, are gaining in the design and operation of breeders may turn out to be valuable - for themselves and for the world as well.
<P>The issue of waste from nuclear power still looms large in the public debate.  However, it is not of the same dimension as the issue of
operational safety and it is likely to be of limited duration.  Once suitable sites have been selected and appropriate installations have been built,
problems are unlikely to arise.  The operation of waste disposal installations is not very complicated.  Nevertheless there are some matters in the area
of radioactive waste which deserve particular attention.  First, it is known that the handling of nuclear waste in the military sector in the US and Russia
has had serious deficiencies.  This must be remedied over time and in a planned manner.  Second, it is important to get on with the selection of sites
which are suitable for waste disposal and, in doing so, to consult the local population.  Experience from several countries, including France, shows that
acceptance is by no means unattainable when full information is patiently given to the public and the potential benefits to the local communities are
explained.  Third, despite the fact that there exist today fully satisfactory methods of managing and disposing of all levels of radioactive waste, it is
desirable that research and development continue.  Just as we may expect a new generation of power reactors offering new and positive features,
new methods of waste handling may emerge which may be less costly or, perhaps, shorten the time span during which the wastes remain radioactive.
<P>The concept of "alternative energy" has been much in fashion.  We should coin the term "alternative waste".  Nuclear waste is an alternative to
the waste from burnt fossil fuels.  If the wastes from burnt fossil fuels could be managed and disposed of as safely as the waste from nuclear power,
our global environment would not be endangered.  It is the wastes from burnt coal, oil and gas - not the waste from nuclear power plants - that cause
acid rains and greenhouse gases.  These wastes are so voluminous that they cannot be contained and buried.  Sites for the ultimate disposal of these
wastes are not selected.  They are our atmosphere and the surface of our earth.
<P><B>Preventing the military uses of nuclear energy</B>
<P>After decades of nuclear arms races, the world is beginning to descend the arms spiral.  Russia and the United States have agreed to cut the
number of their nuclear warheads from some 65 000 together to around 3000 each.  Although even this number still represents a formidable
destructive potential, it points to a decisive turning of the tide and indicates that the nuclear-weapon States no longer consider nuclear armed conflicts
between themselves to be realistic.  The great powers appear to feel that they have no choice in this new era but to co-operate and to bridge
differences which inevitably arise.  Although the Security Council of the United Nations is not immune to paralysis through a veto, common action is
now routinely and sincerely sought and often achieved.  This, too, augurs well for the future.
<P>In this situation many new questions arise with a specific bearing on the nuclear sphere.
<P>A current problem is the safe dismantling of redundant nuclear warheads and the storing, managing and eventual use or disposal of the
plutonium and highly enriched uranium regarded as excess to defence requirements.  It must be verified that the material does not go back to military
use.  President Clinton has declared that the United States will place recovered material under the control of the IAEA and we expect considerable
quantities of such material to be placed permanently under safeguards already this year.  While the recovered enriched uranium is expected to be
transformed into low enriched uranium and made into fuel for light water reactors, there is still considerable discussion about the future of the
recovered plutonium: whether it is to be used in special dedicated reactors, or as MOX fuel in light water reactors or be mixed with nuclear waste and
disposed of as such.  In either case international verification of such peaceful use and disposal of such material will be much more demanding than
simply verification of  storage.
<P>It is in the context of the proposals to place excess HEU and Pu under safeguards that a discussion has started about the Pu which will come
back from the reprocessing of spent power reactor fuel - e.g. from Japan - and which is already under safeguards.  Although efforts will be made to
limit the quantities which have to be temporarily stored, special measures are being discussed to enhance confidence and transparency in all aspects
of the transport, storing and use of plutonium.
<P>With a growing surplus of plutonium and highly enriched uranium connected with nuclear weapons, it is not surprising that attention is now
turning to revived proposals for a universal prohibition of the production of further fissionable material for use in weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices - a so-called cut-off.  Such a ban would prevent the dismantling of nuclear weapons being offset by the simultaneous production of fissionable
material for new weapons.  If universally accepted and not limited to the declared nuclear-weapon States, such a ban would also put a cap on any
further production of fissionable material for weapons in the so-called threshold States, i.e. in India, Pakistan and Israel.  Verification of a universally
accepted cut-off would require a very extensive effort, as reprocessing and enrichment plants and - probably - all nuclear reactors in declared nuclear-
weapon States and in India, Pakistan and Israel may have to be safeguarded.
<P>It has been argued that participation by India, Pakistan and Israel in a cut-off agreement, although preventing these States from producing any
further fissionable material for weapons, would legitimize whatever stocks of such material they might have had when joining an agreement.  I do not
find this argument very convincing.  There is no reason to let the best - no nuclear weapons - be the enemy of the good - no further material for
nuclear weapons.
<P>A complete ban on nuclear testing is at long last under serious negotiation in Geneva.  Its conclusion and universal acceptance would give a
powerful signal that the era of further nuclear weapon development is over.  It would also give a powerful boost to the non-proliferation treaty by
eliminating one inequality between its non-nuclear weapons and its nuclear weapons parties.
<P>From the media and from some international public discussion, one might get the impression that as the world progresses toward nuclear
disarmament the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons to further States has paradoxically been growing.  The discovery that Iraq - an NPT State - was
pursuing a sizeable clandestine programme for the enrichment of uranium to use in nuclear weapons was a severe shock raising the questions of
whether there are other clandestine programmes and whether guarantees can be created against such developments.
<P>Some new dangers can, indeed, be identified but so too can a number of positive developments.  Let me first focus on the dangers.  At the
time the NPT was concluded, the concern was that the more industrialized countries might use nuclear energy for military purposes.  This has not
been the case.  Japan and other advanced industrial nations have not sought their security in these weapons.  Today, however, more developing
countries are reaching a technological level that might enable them to make nuclear weapons.  Iraq was secretly trying.  India, Pakistan and Israel -
not parties to the NPT - are deemed by most observers to have the capacity for the military use of nuclear energy.  At present, an ominous question
mark is attached to the DPRK which has adhered to the NPT but which - despite Security Council requests - is rejecting effective IAEA inspection,
especially in the plant built for plutonium separation.
<P>Another new concern about proliferation is linked to the changes in and the break-up of the former Soviet Union.  It may be hoped that the
risks identified are short-lived and that not only Kazakhstan and Belarus but also Ukraine will join the NPT and will, with appropriate economic and
security arrangements, transfer any nuclear weapons on their territories to Russia.  With the active co-operation of these countries the IAEA is
preparing for safeguards inspection of all nuclear facilities in them.
<P>Another risk is that nuclear material, know-how and experts might trickle out to States or groups potentially interested in making nuclear
weapons.  The response to this risk lies in strengthened regulatory control in the States of the former Soviet Union and in increased alertness against
smuggling.  So far, none of the many instances of smuggling which have come to light has involved nuclear material of types or quantities which give
rise to proliferation risks.  But there is no room for complacency.
<P>The new risks of proliferation which I have mentioned have an important counter-balance in new commitments to non-proliferation.  Argentina
and Brazil have opened the whole of their nuclear programmes to each other and to IAEA inspection.  If - as we now have reason to hope - Cuba joins
the Tlatelolco Treaty, the whole of Latin America could soon become a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.  In Africa, South Africa has become the first State
in the world to roll back from a nuclear weapon capability and to request IAEA verification of the termination of its weapons programme.  If, as recently
declared, Algeria adheres to the NPT, the path would be open to Africa becoming a second nuclear-weapon-free continent.
<P>In the Middle East, the peace process offers some hope for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  Indeed, it is hard to see how
the peace process could be complete without a well verified nuclear-weapon-free zone or zone free of all weapons of mass destruction.  The IAEA has
been asked to assist the parties in exploring the necessary verification arrangements.
<P>A special arrangement involving India and Pakistan and several other countries, may also be needed as part of the efforts to free the world
from military applications of nuclear energy.It is too early to speculate on the arrangements necessary for a world in which no single nation can threaten others with the use of nuclearweapons.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Until the United Nations has developed as an effective security system - and we are far from that situation - the five declared nuclear-weapon States are unlikely fully to abandon their capacity.  There is much, however, that can and should be done to promote non-proliferation before we reach that advanced level of global organization.
<P>Above all, it is important that the major States continue the policy of detente.  Since the end of the cold war tremendous progress has been
achieved, e.g. in Nicaragua and El Salvador, Mozambique, Namibia and Ethiopia, Lebanon and the Middle East, Cambodia.  But there are still areas
of large scale or limited armed conflicts, e.g. Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, Rwanda, Afghanistan.  As security interests drive arms races, including nuclear
arms races, detente is the first barrier against nuclear proliferation.  In this respect, we might perhaps dare to be optimistic.  We seem to be in an age
of negotiated settlements of conflicts - whether about territory, economics or even human rights.
<P>A second barrier to proliferation may lie - as we have learned from failure in the case of Iraq - in more effective controls over exports of
nuclear material and equipment.  A third barrier may lie in verification so effective that it will help to deter States from any secret military uses of
nuclear energy.  In this regard, too, experience in Iraq has helped us to make progress.  The safeguards system of the IAEA has been considerably
strengthened.  In the case of the DPRK it was the use of the latest techniques which led the IAEA to sound the alarm and, in that case, it is not
detection and verification techniques that are in question but rather the means available for inducement and enforcement.  However, further
consolidation and development must occur in the field of verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and
under future agreements relating to nuclear disarmament and arms control.  Greater national nuclear transparency vis-a-vis the safeguards system
and in full co-operation with that system may lead to stronger assurance that nuclear installations subject to safeguards are used for exclusively
peaceful purposes.<HR>

<TITLE>Director General's Opening Remarks at Meeting on Chernobyl, April 1994</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Director General's Opening Remarks at Meeting on Chernobyl, April 1994</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Opening Remarks at Meeting on Chernobyl, April 1994</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>April 1994</H4>
<P><HR>I declare the meeting opened and welcome you all.  We appreciate that you have responded at rather short notice to the invitation to this meeting.
<P>Perhaps someone might think that there was a special thought behind convening the meeting a few days before the eighth anniversary of the accident at Unit 4 in the Chernobvl plant.  I can assure you, however, that this is a pure coincidence.  The timing of this meeting is rather linked to the Agency safety mission to Chernobyl which was organized a month ago - in mid-March.
<P>As you know - and as will be reported in greater detail to this meeting - the safety review of the mission documented a large number of factors which affect the safety situation at the plant.  The Agency will normally submit findings of its expert safety missions to the national nuclear safety authorities.  In the present case the seriousness of the findings led me not only to do so but also to write a letter to the President of Ukraine, Mr. Kravchuk.  I informed him of the conclusions that international levels of safety were not being met at the plant.  And I suggested the desirability of convening an international meeting of the Ukraine with different interested parties for an exchange of views on what actions could be taken by the Ukraine itself and these other parties to remedy the precarious situation.
<P>I am glad to say that President Kravchuk responded very promptly and positively to this proposal.  The high-level delegation from the Ukraine here today demonstrates the importance that the Ukrainian Government is giving to the findings of the IAEA mission and also its eagerness to discuss the situation with representatives of interested States and organizations.
<P>The Agency is not an international regulatory body.  There is no such institution.  The operators of nuclear plants, the national regulatory authorities and the national governments carry the responsibility for safety in nuclear installations in their territory.  Yet there is unquestionably a strong international interest and legitimate international concern in the safety of nuclear installations anywhere.  The Agency has a duty to be a forum for expressions of this interest and - sometimes - for co-ordinated action or the promotion of such action.  It is not a mechanism for decisions on joint action but rather for exchange of knowledge and viewpoints.  However these exchanges are not to be academic.  They should promote informed action by the parties concerned.
<P>Now let me continue my introduction by focussing on the case before us.  Last October (1993) the Ukraine Parliament reversed a decision from two years earlier to permanently cease all power operations at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the end of 1993.  In November last year the Agency's International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group called my attention to the safety implications of that reversal.  Exchanges with Ukraine officials followed which resulted in the safety review mission which the Agency organized to Chernobyl in mid-March.
<P>The review documented numerous safety shortcomings in the plant's two remaining operational units.  Among these shortcomings are some well known problems in the design of the first generation RBMK Unit 1, which have not so far been dealt with.  A number of factors which taken together severely reduce overall safety are equally troubling.  Difficult working conditions and a serious loss of highly skilled personnel are major problems.
<P>The economic situation of Ukraine has limited the procurement of modern equipment and has had a negative effect on the availability of spare parts.
<P>The technically confirmed accelerated deterioration of the shelter enclosing the destroyed Unit 4 reactor has added a unique element to the safety situation.
<P>Some of the factors which afflict Chernobyl affect other plants with RBMK-type reactors in a similar way.  However, in the case of Chernobyl, these factors taken together lead to a safety situation which is more troubling than anywhere else.
<P>I said that in calling today's meeting the Agency is primarily providing a forum for exchange of information with a view to informed action, rather than joint decisions.  To make informed decision and to take informed action, the Ukrainian and other governments as well as international organizations, banks and groupings will need to understand not only the technical safety issues but also other factors that influence the situation.  I have in mind the overall energy and economic circumstances in the Ukraine, including the scope for energy conservation, and the status of nuclear plants under construction.  The meeting will be successful if it can help the Government of Ukraine to define more precisely when the two plants operated at Chernobyl are no longer, in its view, indispensible to the economy of the country.
<P>Such definition and decision by the Government of Ukraine is no doubt in part influenced by actions and decisions that will be taken by other governments and institutions.  Conversely the actions and decisions by these governments and institutions are influenced by the decisions of the Ukrainian Government.  Hence the need for exchange of information about data and about where interested parties stand and what action options they see.
<P>May I conclude by urging you to be both frank and creative in defining roads to remedies of the difficult situation at Chernobyl.  This situation is a terrible burden for the Ukraine.  The Ukraine is entitled to look for constructive attitudes among other countries and other countries are looking to the Ukraine for constructive action.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Closing Comments by the Director General</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Diplomatic Conference on a Nuclear Safety Convention</H4>
<P><h4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><h4 ALIGN=CENTER>17 June 1994</H4>
<P><HR>A few moments ago you have adopted [by consensus] the Nuclear Safety Convention.
Having immediately endorsed the idea of a convention when it was first advanced by Mr. Töpfer, the German Minister of the Environment, at our 1991 Conference on Nuclear Safety and being convinced of the importance of the development of law in the international community, I am particularly happy to see the successful outcome of this Conference.
<P>The Convention which you have adopted and the Final Act are the result of much work in Governments, in their nuclear safety authorities - as well as in the Secretariat of the IAEA.  Fortunately the political will to achieve a convention has been coupled with a readiness to make constructive compromises - both in the Expert Group that prepared the draft Convention and in this Conference itself.
<P>The four days which this Diplomatic Conference has lasted have certainly been long and full.  I think you have reason to be proud to have been able to finalize the Convention in such a short time.  In terms of effective treaty-making this Convention, and the work that led to it, is an excellent example and adds to the superb record set by the IAEA in 1986 in the adoption of the Conventions on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on Emergency Assistance.
 <P>In the present Convention, as in the case of the two Conventions I just mentioned, the expeditious and effective work has, of course, been much facilitated by the existence of prior internationally agreed fundamental principles.  The organic growth of norms into law is less problematic than the creation of instant law.
<P>The success of this Conference, we know very well, is also due to the able and dynamic guidance of its President, Dr. Walter Hohlefelder, to the hard and patient work of the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, Mr. Lars Högberg, and of its Vice-Chairman, Ambassador Theresa Quintella, the work of the Drafting Committee and its Chairman, Mr. Gopalakrishnan, and to the teamwork of the Bureau.  I think you will not mind if I also mention hard-working staff members of the IAEA, in particular the Director of the Legal Division, Mr. Sturms.
<P>We now look forward to the Convention coming into force and operation.  May I express the hope that the representatives and experts who have been so dynamic in working out the Convention now turn their energies to bring their own governments to speedily sign and ratify the Convention.  After all, by the consensus expressed here, we know that the governments support the text.  Let us try to bring the Convention into force in record time!
<P>The promotion of safety in nuclear installations is an important national and  international objective.  This Convention will give many well-known principles the force of law.  It will also establish innovative mechanisms to help us ensure that the letters of this law translate into safe nuclear reality.<HR>

<TITLE>DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE ON THE NUCLEAR SAFETY CONVENTION </TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE ON THE NUCLEAR SAFETY CONVENTION</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Opening Statement by the Director General of the IAEA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>14 June 1994</H4>
<P><HR>The IAEA is proud to be the venue of this conference to adopt a convention on the safety of nuclear power installations, and I am pleased to welcome you, distinguished delegates, to this important event.  The IAEA Secretariat will provide the logistics and secretariat functions of the Conference and may also, as an observer, present views on technical issues which arise.
<P>In opening this conference let me sketch the background to our deliberations.
<P> The vision of sustainable development, of combining environmental goals with improved living standards worldwide,  must inevitably address the issue of expanded and sustainable sources of energy, especially electricity.
<P>Nuclear energy can make an important contribution.  Assurance of safety, alongside assurances of exclusively peaceful use, remain fundamental prerequisites for the future reliance on nuclear power as an attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for energy.  These two elements are recognized in the Statute of the IAEA as well as in the national laws of  many States.  However, there are important differences  in the allocation of responsibilities for these two areas between the international community and national authorities - safety having long been a predominantly national concern, while the commitments to an exclusively peaceful use has been, even before the establishment of the IAEA, an intensely international concern.  As a result of this concern, a strong and complex network of international, regional and bilateral agreements has gradually been established of binding commitments to the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and to international control and verification.  States have accepted to be individually bound within a unique system of bilateral verification agreements concluded with the Agency - the Safeguards Agreements.  States choose or do not choose to commit themselves to non-proliferation, but once they have bound themselves by treaty the international system has strong and well defined measures for verification.
  <P><B>International safety norms</B>
<P>On the other hand the safe use of nuclear, as of other forms of energy, remains essentially a national responsibility.  As defined in the fundamental principles contained in the draft Nuclear Safety Convention before this Conference:  "the responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the State where a nuclear installation is located".  Nevertheless international efforts in the area of safety have come increasingly to recognize the interdependence of all participants in the nuclear fuel cycle.  An accident anywhere has the potential for direct transboundary radiation consequences and has global ramifications in terms of public confidence in nuclear power as a major energy source. 
<P>While it is possible to talk of an international nuclear safety "regime" it is, in contrast to the non proliferation regime, not essentially based on international treaties.  The conventions on Physical Protection, on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on Emergency Assistance, and the two Conventions on liability (now linked by a Joint Protocol) relate to the potential international safety and economic impact of national nuclear activities, and are certainly part of a growing international legal infrastructure.  However, they do not fundamentally alter the balance between national and international responsibilities.  The same holds true for most regional and bilateral arrangements which have been developed to meet particular needs.
<P>Nevertheless, in many important aspects of safety States have found it appropriate to co-operate first to harmonize national rules, by the concerted development and by adopting codes and guidelines of a recommendatory nature, and by accepting international standards and, second, more recently and just as importantly, by increasing their readiness and openness to international review and advice.
<P>Some of the codes and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have been updated and reviewed as necessary - as, for instance the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material; others such as the Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste have been adopted more recently in response to new concerns.  Internationally adopted codes and guidelines have, in some cases, been used by countries as the basis for national laws and regulations; in other cases, national rules of States have served as a common denominator to establish an international standard.
<P>A practical advantage of such codes and guidelines over formal treaties has been that the former can take effect without the need for what can be lengthy ratification procedures.  Also, as they often involve codifying "best practice" they have the potential for broad based adherence.
<P>In the area of international review and advice the IAEA has had a leading, but not exclusive, role.  Let me welcome and encourage the contributions in this area from national,  regional and non-governmental organizations.  WANO for example as a non-governmental organization is playing an important and unique role in providing expertise and peer support to nuclear power operators.  It is to be hoped and expected that these mechanisms for review and advice will, over time, take on an increased share of the burden.
<P>In the meantime the IAEA has been playing the part of the initiator and implementing agency of a wide range of advisory safety services.  Let me mention some:
<UL>
<LI>    The Agency's Operational Safety Review programme, known as the OSART service, aims at enhancing operational safety at nuclear power plants worldwide, and has by now provided advice to operators of 56 plants in 27 countries;
<LI>    The promotion of a nuclear safety culture has been pursued by the Agency through international seminars as well as through special review teams to Assess Safety Culture in Organizations;
<LI>    The Agency has established an International Peer Review Service for Probabilistic Safety Assessment to help in reviewing the growing number of probabilistic safety assessments (PSAs) underway in most countries with nuclear power plants;
<LI>    The Agency's Engineering Safety Review Service deals with the suitability of proposed and existing nuclear power plant sites from a safety point of view.  Overall site and seismic re-evaluations have been the major areas covered by this programme;
<LI>    Peer review of nuclear safety authorities and their practices was established by the Agency in recognition of the fact that a legally based, independent, technically strong regulatory authority is a necessary basis for safety.  In line with its  long established assistance activities in the regulatory area, the Agency began this service in 1989.
</UL>
In addition, the Secretariat publishes every year a report on recent world developments in nuclear safety and radiation protection.  The Nuclear Safety Review contained in the report is submitted to the Board of Governors as well as to the General Conference.  The review focusses mainly on how the world nuclear community is dealing with the problem of achieving greater international safety co-operation.  It also describes topical issues as well as accidents, incidents and events that have occurred and discusses briefly related issues of event reporting, analysis and communication.
<P>As the only global intergovernmental mechanism in the field of nuclear safety the IAEA is providing the forum for both norm-making - the development of legal instruments and codes - and for practical programmes of international review and advice.
<P>The accident at Three Mile Island and the disaster at Chernobyl have given some further impetus for international norm-making.  While the Chernobyl accident was the only one to have transboundary radiological consequences, the impact of both accidents went far beyond the borders of the States where they occurred.
<P>As a result States have sought to promote greater transparency and openness in  questions relating to the safety of nuclear power plants, and, by doing so, to promote their own nuclear safety culture.  They have done this by accepting reviews by outsiders and widening the scope of safety to include the human as well as the technological dimension.
<P>It is also against this background that the political will has emerged to conclude a binding international convention on the safety of nuclear power installations. 
<P>It might be said that the practical difference between on the one hand well developed recommendatory norms, like the Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) which are followed up by enquiries about implementation, and on the other, binding conventions, is not very great.  Maybe so, but it is clear that to the community of States the level of commitment is considerably higher in the case of a legally binding convention.  It is this commitment we now see manifested.
<P>Less than three years ago, in 1991, following an initiative taken by Member States of the European Union, an international conference was convened by the IAEA on the "Safety of Nuclear Power: Strategy for the Future".  This Conference was also an element of the IAEA's contribution to the 1992 United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development.
<P>Among its "Major Findings" the IAEA Conference declared that "safety should be primarily enforced at national levels, by conscientious application of existing safety principles, standards and good practices at each plant, and within each national regulatory body, making best use of national legal frameworks and working practices."  However, the IAEA Safety Conference also saw "a need to consider an integrated international approach to all aspects of nuclear safety, including safety objectives for radioactive wastes - which would be adopted by all Governments."
<P>In 1991 the General Conference of the IAEA supported that idea and invited the Director General to undertake preparatory work on a nuclear safety convention.  The result of the work thus started is now before this Conference.  The draft Convention submitted for consideration and adoption has been elaborated by a large group of legal and technical experts convoked by the Agency from some 50 countries representing all regions of the world, countries with and without nuclear power programmes.  During the discussions of the experts it has become clear that further instruments are needed, in particular relating to the management of radioactive wastes.  The work of the Group of technical and legal experts was characterized by a sense of timing and purpose, as well as by a sense of compromise.  The result is what has been termed an incentive-oriented Convention.  It aims at adding new impetus to the efforts of further developing a high level of nuclear safety worldwide.  Through this Convention, States will bind themselves to a number of important safety rules, and accept to participate in and report to periodic peer review meetings to verify implementation of the Convention's obligations.
<P>The Convention shall apply to "nuclear installations" defined as land-based civil nuclear power plants.  The obligations embodied in the draft Convention are based largely on the principles contained in the Agency's Safety Fundamentals document, "The Safety of Nuclear Installations" (Safety Series No. 110), which represents an international consensus on the basic concepts underlying the regulation and management of safety and the operation of nuclear installations.
<P>The Convention contains a requirement that the Contracting Parties establish and maintain a legislative and regulatory framework to govern the safety of nuclear installations.  There are obligations to be met covering general safety considerations, such as the necessity for policies which give priority to safety, adequate financial and human resources for safety, the assessment and verification of safety, as well as adequate quality assurance, radiation protection and emergency preparedness programmes.  Other obligations cover safety in the siting, design, construction and operation of nuclear installations.
<P>Under the draft Convention, each Contracting Party is required to take adequate national measures to assure nuclear safety and to report to the other Contracting Parties on the measures taken.  The peer review process, whereby the Contracting Parties meet to discuss national reports, is the Convention's key mechanism for promoting a high level of nuclear safety worldwide.  Further work is needed to draft the specific provisions governing the conduct of such meetings.
<P>The Agency is ready to assume the responsibilities as depository of the Convention and as the body providing Secretariat services for meetings of the Contracting Parties.
<P>The path to this Conference has not been altogether easy.  We owe much to Mr. Domaratzki - Chairman of the Group of Legal and Technical Experts - for his patient work and inspiration.  The text you are asked to review and adopt represents a milestone.  The IAEA Secretariat remains ready to assist this Conference and, to the extent mandated, in the implementation of the Convention.
<P>Let me conclude by wishing you every success in the adoption of this most important instrument.<HR>

<P><B>INTRODUCTION </B>
<P><HR>Many people fear radiation as something mystic, invisible and nuclear energy as something almost inherently evil.  This mystique must be dispelled through education and information.  The public must be made to understand that nuclear energy - like aeroplanes or gunpowder and many other things - can be used for good or bad and that we should use it for good and prevent the uses that are bad.  We should also use it with respect and prudence, as we do with aviation.  The risks we run will rarely be zero but they can be kept very low and the benefits to mankind can be very great indeed.  Some 17% of the world's electricity is today generated through nuclear fission - almost as much as through hydropower.  This production could easily be expanded if the will was there and fusion might, one day, give us an even larger source of power.
<P>That many people in the Pacific Basin should be particularly conscious of the destructive power of nuclear energy is not surprising.  In this vast region nuclear weapons  - both  fission and fusion - have been tested by four of the five nuclear-weapon States from the earliest times until just recently.  And in this region two large cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were devastated nearly 50 years ago by atomic bombs, one with highly enriched uranium, one with plutonium.
<P>Today the outlook is fortunately much brighter.  Tens of thousands of nuclear warheads are to be dismantled in a process that has already begun.  There are no nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific and there is a realistic hope that a treaty can soon be concluded prohibiting all nuclear explosions.  Particularly for the island countries of the Pacific, the recent global ban on the dumping of radioactive waste at sea is also welcome news.    
<P>I shall begin by examining the global prospects for ending the threat of nuclear weapons and then discuss what the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can contribute to sustainable development and to an environmentally sounder world.
<P><B>PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS IN PACIFYING THE ATOM</B>
<P>From the inception of the Atoms for Peace policy and the creation in 1956 of the IAEA it has been recognized that exploitation of the benefits of nuclear science and technology must be accompanied by efforts to contain its destructive potential.  At one time many countries, including some in this region, maintained policies which held open the nuclear weapons option.  Fewer and fewer do so today.  The tide is moving towards good use of nuclear energy.  Among the declared nuclear-weapon States the discussion today is not about mutually assured destruction but about how we can do away with existing nuclear arsenals and how we can prevent new nuclear weapons from coming into being.
<P>The end of the Cold War has brought with it major initiatives to reduce nuclear arsenals and to contain other weapons of mass destruction.  Recent agreements between the United States and Russia will see a radical reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons held - from over 60 000 to around 3000 each by 2005.  Discussion is now focussed on ways to control the fissionable material that this process will release and ways to use it or otherwise dispose of it. The agonizing fears of a nuclear conflagration which existed only a few years ago are fading.  However, while the arsenals of the great powers are being drawn down, concern remains about the risk that further States may acquire nuclear weapons capacity and about those States that maintain ambiguity over their nuclear intentions.  We must, indeed, recognize with realism the existence of some new threats and deal constructively with them, but we should also note that there has been much progress.
 <P>In the 1960s the world was faced with the possibility that a number of States, particularly in the industrialized world, might acquire nuclear capacities.  An increase in the number of States with nuclear weapons was deemed - not unreasonably - to increase the risks of nuclear war.  To permit the development of nuclear power and commerce while at the same time reducing the risk of weapons proliferation the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty was negotiated and came into force in 1970.  For a quarter of a century, that treaty has remained at the heart of international efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  The NPT and the safeguards verification regime which is linked to it and which is administered by the IAEA on behalf of the world community, were designed to create confidence about the non-proliferation commitments of States which might have been capable in the early 1970s to develop nuclear weapons - i.e. mainly industrialized countries.  The security situation of these countries, however, has stabilized over time.  Many of them have nuclear protection through alliances or other defence-related arrangements and have reliably discarded the option of acquiring nuclear weapons of their own.  Others have concluded that in their particular geopolitical and security situation, it might be more dangerous to possess nuclear weapons than not to have them.  
<P>On the other hand, an increasing number of developing countries which did not 25 years ago possess the technological sophistication needed to make nuclear weapons, have come to acquire it and some of them may have perceived security reasons to have such weapons.  Our specific experience in one such country, Iraq, demonstrated starkly that a determined proliferator could - with time, money, expertise and a relatively closed political system - evade not only international controls but also scrutiny from a range of national intelligence services in seeking a clandestine nuclear weapons capacity.  As a result, foreign policy measures in the security field as well as nuclear related export controls have been strengthened and a broad consensus has emerged to bolster IAEA safeguards to provide confidence that countries are truly adhering to their safeguards undertakings.  Our experience with the application of safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has shown the increasing ability of the IAEA safeguards system to detect potential problems.  What is now at stake is rather the means for responding to problems which the safeguards system has identified. 
<P>While the case of the DPRK raises the most acute and sensitive proliferation question of the moment, several other cases have evolved positively.  South Africa, which had developed a nuclear weapons capacity, dismantled six nuclear devices and allowed full international inspection of its nuclear activities.  As a result of this development and of Algeria declaring its intention to join the NPT, the African continent may soon be declared a nuclear weapon free zone.  In Latin America, Argentina and Brazil have agreed to full-scope safeguards arrangements which will involve verification of their commitment to non-proliferation.  When, as expected, Cuba joins the Tlatelolco Treaty - that treaty, designed to keep South America free of nuclear weapons, may be brought fully into operation.  
<P>In some of the States of the former Soviet Union, problems still persist but we believe they will become parties to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States.  They are progressively concluding agreements with the IAEA to allow international inspection.  I am rather confident that this will be true also for Ukraine.  Concerns persist that nuclear weapons materials and expertise might leak from the countries of the former Soviet Union and media often report on such events.  However, until now the quality and quantity of materials confiscated have not been of proliferation significance - as far as we have been able to ascertain.  
<P>The global regime of control of nuclear activities is supported and strengthened by several regional and bilateral arrangements.  In addition to the Treaty of Rarotonga, I have mentioned both the Tlatelolco Treaty for Latin America and a treaty in the making that would declare Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  The Middle East and South Asia remain the major unresolved areas of concern.  In the context of the peace effort for the Middle East we may nevertheless expect proposals for a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>In all the agreements which I have mentioned, global or regional, the IAEA is the arm of the international system entrusted with the task of providing verification of the undertakings to use nuclear technology exclusively for peaceful purposes.  At the same time as the safeguards system is being strengthened the use of it for further verification roles in the nuclear area is being weighed in negotiations now taking place.  I have in mind the discussions of a ban on the production of weapons-usable fissile material (a so-called “Cut-Off” agreement) and of an agreement to end tests of nuclear weapons (the “Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban”).  Given the complementarity of the various systems of nuclear verification there is much to be said for such functions being vested in the IAEA.  It would also help limit the costs of international verification which, while clearly worth paying and modest compared to the benefits it brings, are deservedly being watched carefully.  At present the regular budget costs of IAEA safeguards are about $US 70 million per year.  
<P>The question of the extension of the NPT will be considered next spring.  While there were earlier complaints that the nuclear-weapon States had not lived up to their commitments to negotiate nuclear disarmament, that criticism is fading.  The recent advances in arms control and disarmament and the achievements of the treaty in the last twenty five years provide a sound foundation for a strong re endorsement and prolongation of the treaty and for a renewed commitment to the continued strengthening of its means of verification.    
<P>While describing the efforts which we make to give IAEA safeguards sharper teeth, it must be understood that a political climate of detente - globally and regionally - is fundamental to remove possible incentives to acquire nuclear weapons.
<P>Can we hope to move toward a world free of nuclear weapons?  Today these weapons have come to be seen as increasingly obsolescent and irrelevant to the political and security concerns of the 21st century.  However, it will still be many years before the declared nuclear-weapon States fully discard their arsenals.  It will require an international security system that is far more developed than the rudimentary system that we have in today's United Nations.  We should be very pleased nevertheless that today, nearly 50 years after the creation of the United Nations, it appears meaningful to think and speculate about a more effective system of global governance and control of the atom.  It was not long ago that such discussion appeared totally naive.
<P><B>PEACEFUL UTILIZATION OF NUCLEAR ENERGY</B>
<P>Mention of a more advanced future security role for the UN leads me naturally to turn to another vital role of the UN system, namely to promote sustainable economic development as an essential foundation for a safer and more equitable world order.  The Pacific region has rightly acquired a reputation for dynamic economic growth and for tackling development issues with necessary vigour and imagination.  However, here as elsewhere, the welcome growth is being increasingly accompanied by concern that development should also be sustainable.  International aspirations in this regard were embodied in the Declaration of the Rio Conference on Environment and Development and its comprehensive action plan,  Agenda 21.
<P>In my view none of the technologies currently available to mankind ought to be overlooked in pursuing the goals that have been defined for sustainable development.  It is thus appropriate to consider what contribution nuclear technology is making and can make.  We do not often focus on the many non-power uses of nuclear energy and yet increasing reliance is in fact being made on them.  They already have established and acknowledged roles in agriculture, industry, and medicine.  Who questions radiation therapy for treatment of cancer, or the use of isotopes for research into water resources and to track the spread of pesticide residues or carbon-14 dating for historical or archeological purposes?  In all uses of radiation, the techniques used must obviously comprise appropriate radiation protection measures.  There must be proper workplace practices and a national regulatory infrastructure and legislation on radiation protection.  There must also be safe management and disposal of waste.  This is not questioned by the nuclear industry or by other responsible users of nuclear technology.  The IAEA for its part is helping to build appropriate infrastructures and is actively engaged in transferring nuclear technology and know-how for use in the developing world.  The IAEA Regional Co-operation Programme for Asia and the Pacific is a mechanism for such technology transfer and it is pleasing to note that it continues to enjoy active participation from countries throughout the region as well as strong financial backing from Australia and Japan amongst others.
<P>Increasing emphasis is being placed on the contribution that nuclear techniques can make to tackling environmental problems.  A wide range of work is already being done in national research institutes, and the IAEA is actively collaborating with several international bodies to implement the various elements of Agenda 21.  Our isotope hydrology team is collaborating with the World Meteorological Organization in preparing studies on climate patterns for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our Marine Laboratory at Monaco - the only one of its kind in the UN system - is collaborating with scientists from the relevant regions to assess the impacts of radioactive waste dumping in the Arctic Sea and the Sea of Japan.  We have a major programme in Poland for using electron beams to reduce emissions from coal-fired power stations and to turn the resulting residues into fertilizer.  Our agricultural unit, operated jointly with the FAO, is contributing to the eradication of insect pests in Africa and elsewhere using the Sterile Insect Technique, thus improving human health and increasing agricultural productivity.  And preservation of food by irradiation holds out the prospect of more food reaching more consumers in domestic and foreign markets unspoiled.  
<P><B>Nuclear Power</B>
<P>Nuclear energy's most spectacular and controversial form - nuclear power - has played a significant part in the rapid economic development in the Asian region and will continue to do so.   It is a major source of electricity for some of the largest Asian economies and remains a serious option for others.  In many other parts of the world, however, the role of nuclear energy is stagnating and it is difficult to predict when a revival will come.  In Finland, for example, despite a need for more electricity and the excellent record built up by four nuclear reactors over many years, the Parliament recently rejected a government proposal for another nuclear plant.    
<P>While the outlook for nuclear power is uneven, the latest OECD/IEA forecasts for electricity demand are clear.  Global demand for electricity is expected to increase by perhaps 75% by the year 2010.  In the Asia region, however, the cumulative growth by then is expected to be as much as 192%. How is this electricity to be generated?  Many countries are making major investments in expansion of fossil fuel generating capacity.   It is difficult to see how this trend can be reconciled with the expressed view of governments that action must now be taken to reduce global CO2 emissions and to address other environmental concerns.  There are no credible indications that new and renewable sources of energy - like solar power, wind power or commercial biomass - will be able to supplant existing technologies in this generation or even the next to meet these massive projected increases in baseline energy needs.  These sources now give a fraction of a percent of the world's energy and their further development, however desirable, remains hypothetical.  
<P>Nuclear power, on the other hand, constitutes 5% of the world's total energy and is a proven technology capable of expansion.  It is therefore essential that the nuclear option remain open and that its greater utilization be fostered.  While each country must decide for itself what energy mix it will have, it is important for those governments who see a place for nuclear in their energy mix to tackle constructively the obstacles to greater acceptance of nuclear power.  Information and safety are the most important factors.  The Chernobyl accident did immeasurable damage to the reputation of nuclear power, but it has also led to considerable efforts to prevent any recurrence in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and to bring about a safety culture accepted by all.  Within months of the Chernobyl accident, the international community concluded two conventions concerning the early notification of a nuclear accident and the provision of assistance in the case or a nuclear accident or a radiological emergency.  Safety standards and practices have been reviewed at other plants and improvements have been made.  An international convention is now being worked out under the auspices of the IAEA and may be opened for signature this year to provide international safety rules and peer review of  the safety of nuclear power plants.  It is obvious that nuclear safety must remain the ultimate responsibility of national governments, but acting through the IAEA and other mechanisms, governments can collectively prepare international standards, provide training and advice, and offer reviews to ensure that best practice is followed.
<P>While safety is the key, costs, including a quantification of the comparative health and environmental impacts of different energy sources, must be demonstrably acceptable.  In many countries nuclear power is competitive in traditional economic terms. Cradle-to-grave cost comparisons of the health and environmental impacts of different energy systems should also be examined to promote informed decisions on future energy mixes.  The IAEA is working with several international and national agencies to develop methodologies and databases for such comparative assessments.  Some simple and established data are already striking and deserve wider publicity.  A nuclear plant generating 1000 MW electricity - enough to meet the needs of one million people - would need 27 tonnes of slightly enriched uranium per year, i.e. a few truckloads derived from 160 tonnes of natural uranium.   The equivalent coal fired plant would need 2.6 million tonnes - or five trains a day - carrying 1400 tonnes of coal.  An oil fired plant would require 2 million tonnes of fuel oil per year, that is about 10 super tanker loads.  Taking a look at annual waste production, we find that a nuclear plant would generate the following:
<P><UL>
<LI>    as high level waste: 27 tonnes of spent fuel; once reprocessed/vitrified, about 3 m3; 
<LI>    as intermediate level waste: 310 tonnes;
<LI>    as low level waste: 460 tonnes; plus
<LI>    some low level radioactive gases, without public health significance; and, for completeness,
<LI>    tailings from uranium mines and ore processing plants.
</UL>   
By way of comparison, a coal-fired plant, even with state-of-the-art flue gas cleaning devices, would generate:
<UL>
<LI>    6.5 million tonnes of CO2;
<LI>    44 000 tonnes of SO2;
<LI>    22 000 tonnes of NOx;
<LI>    320 000 tonnes of ashes, containing about 400 tonnes of toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury; and tailings as well.
</UL>
It is not surprising that the Club of Rome - whom no one can accuse of a pro-nuclear bias - in a report two years back concluded that  - I quote - "the use of coal and oil is probably more dangerous to society, because of the carbon dioxide they produce, than nuclear energy.  There are therefore strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open and for the development of breeder reactors ...".  Indeed, I cannot help but be struck by the growing gap between the political rhetoric one hears about the need to reduce CO2 emissions and the real life energy choices being made today that expand the use of fossil fuels.  There is much talk about "alternative energies".  We should perhaps also talk about alternative wastes.  To my mind the wastes from fossil fuels - uncontained, unmonitored, inimical to our atmosphere, climate and environment and in some cases toxic from now to eternity - are the number one risk.  This is not to say that further work is not needed regarding nuclear waste.  Indeed, while the technology exists for the safe management of nuclear wastes, installations are all too often lacking for political reasons and there is a growing practical problem of accumulation of wastes in many countries.  Public confidence that nuclear waste is manageable will come only through demonstration of the fact.  This is being done in some countries, notably Sweden and Finland, but progress elsewhere, including the Pacific region, is lagging behind.
 <P>I would like to end on an optimistic note.  With the Cold War behind us, but admittedly with national conflicts still an everyday reality, we are beginning to see a blueprint emerge for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation measures that should become reality in the current decade and the years beyond.  Australia's voice in this regard is both valued and respected.  Peaceful nuclear technology applications across a broad spectrum will certainly continue to play their part to improve the lives of people in the developed and developing worlds alike.  And, for those countries with expanding economies, with expanding energy needs and with a readiness to include the option of nuclear power, that option will provide a substantial, readily available, increasingly reliable and environmentally benign source of energy.<HR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SOUTH AFRICA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>7 April 1994</H4>
<HR>
<P><B>Mr. Foreign Minister,  Distinguished Guests,</B>

<P>On behalf of the Agency I have great pleasure in accepting this highly symbolic gift.  The moment is right.  After decades of the nuclear arms race and attempts to contain the proliferation of nuclear weapons - horizontal and vertical - we have now reached a moment when, indeed, swords - not all but many - are being turned into ploughshares.
<P>Russia and the United States have agreed to cut the number of warheads from some  65 000 together to some 3000 each.  Although this number still represents a formidable destructive potential, it points to a decisive turn.
<P>And the number of countries committed to non-proliferation and accepting comprehensive verification of the commitment, continues to grow.  I point in particular to South Africa and to recent positive developments in South America as well as the forward movement in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
<P>At our end we have been reviewing our safeguards system to ensure its strength and cost-effectiveness.
<P>Those reviews have arisen from a growing international awareness of both the importance of nuclear non-proliferation and specific issues which have posed new challenges to the verification system.
<P>One such challenge was the welcome decision of South Africa to accede to the NPT.
 <P>When a State joining the safeguards system has many nuclear installations and much nuclear material, it is always a challenge to verify that everything that should be declared to the IAEA has been declared.  Such was the case in South Africa where safeguards implementation under South Africa's NPT-related Safeguards Agreement with the Agency began in November 1991.  
<P>The extensive nature of South Africa's nuclear fuel cycle required not only considerable inspection resources but also extensive co-operation on the part of the State authorities e.g. in providing access to defunct facilities and to historical accounting and operating records.  
<P>However, the Agency's activities in South Africa show how such challenges can be tackled successfully through sustained efforts by the IAEA and through a high degree of co-operation and transparency on the part of the inspected country.  Since September 1991, many discrepancies which had been identified have now been resolved.  In September 1993, the IAEA found it reasonable to conclude that the amounts of highly enriched uranium (HEU) which could have been produced by South Africa's pilot enrichment plant are consistent with the amounts declared in South Africa's Initial Report.  Work is continuing, aimed at reaching a similarly satisfactory conclusion in relation to the production of low enriched uranium.
<P>A new dimension was added in March 1993, when President de Klerk declared that South Africa had previously developed a limited nuclear capability which had been dismantled and destroyed before South Africa acceded to the NPT.  The Agency was invited to examine that South Africa's nuclear weapons programme had been terminated and that all the nuclear material used in it had been placed under safeguards.  For this purpose the IAEA sent experts to visit the facilities involved in the abandoned programme and to review historical data.  It found no indication casting doubt on South Africa's statement that all the highly enriched uranium for weapons had been reported in its initial declaration.  Also it has found no indication to suggest "that there remain any sensitive components of the nuclear weapons programme which have not been either rendered useless or converted to commercial non-nuclear applications or peaceful nuclear usage."
<P>I quote this language because it was carefully drafted wording used for our report to the General Conference indicating our generally satisfactory findings but also indicating the difficulty, indeed impossibility, of giving categorical statements in this complex area of verification.  
<P>This was the first occasion on which a State which had developed weapons had chosen to terminate its weapons programme. The invitation to the IAEA to verify that termination and the offer of full access to any location or facility associated with the former programme was vital to the fulfilment of the Agency's obligations and to the outcome I have described. For the future, the Agency would like to make use of the standing invitation extended earlier by the South African Government to grant the Agency full access to any location or facility associated with the former nuclear weapon programme and to consider requests for access to other facilities which the Agency deems pertinent to the implementation of comprehensive safeguards in South Africa.
<P>The Government of South Africa has helped demonstrate that the purpose of safeguards inspection is to create confidence that nuclear material and installations are being used only for peaceful purposes - and to uncover the opposite should it occur.  Safeguards are a form of institutionalized nuclear transparency.  Of course, nothing prevents a State from going even further in transparency than the current comprehensive safeguards system requires.  Indeed, there may be particular advantage in doing so where the state concerned perceives it of benefit to demonstrate even greater transparency designed to generate even further confidence on the part of others.  
<P>Today's presentation of a ploughshare crafted from non-nuclear material cut from one of its former nuclear devices is symbolic, above all of the way in which weapons of war can be transformed into the tools of peace.  South Africa is entering a new era which deserves, and I am sure will receive, all possible support from the international community.  At the same time South Africa will have the capacity substantially to contribute to further uses of nuclear energy on the African continent.  With South Africa having joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and been the first State to roll back from a nuclear-weapon capability, the road should soon be open for an early conclusion of an Africa Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty.<HR>

<TITLE>Seminar on "The Current and Future Safeguards Role of the IAEA: Challenges and Opportunities"</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Seminar on "The Current and Future Safeguards Role of the IAEA: Challenges and Opportunities"</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcoming Address by<BR>Dr. Hans Blix, Director General<BR></H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>27 January 1994</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H4>
<HR>
<OL>
<LI>    I should like to welcome you all to this Seminar, to explain why we are organizing it and to tell you what we hope to achieve by it.  I also want to talk about the situation of safeguards in  the political landscape, their functions, potential uses and limitations.
<LI>    The cases of Iraq, DPRK and the Ukraine have naturally provoked much public and political debate about the means of preventing and countering nuclear proliferation.  Safeguards are a part of these means and they, too, have been and remain the subject of much discussion.
 <LI>   We are right now at a stage where safeguards verification has assumed extreme importance in some places, notably DPRK.  We are also at a moment when -- after the experience of Iraq -- governments and the IAEA Secretariat very actively work on strengthening the system and on improving its cost-effectiveness.  And we are at a juncture where verification systems need to be made part of new nuclear arms control and disarmament schemes -- a cut-off, the recovery of nuclear material from dismantled weapons, a complete nuclear test ban and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions.
<LI>    At no time could it be more important that governments, experts and media understand the subject.  You are all very familiar with the safeguards system.  Several of you have even written books about it.  Is there really anything more you can learn about it?  I hope so.  And we who are organizing the seminar hope to learn from you.
<LI>    I said we are very actively working to strengthen the safeguards system.  Some  important things have already been done, others are projected.  We would like to tell you about this and have your comments.  Each subject presented is given about as much time for discussion as for presentation.  We will fit the experiences of Iraq, DPRK and South Africa into the larger question of the effectiveness of safeguards, but we shall also properly analyse these cases and discuss them with you.  We will, lastly, examine the potential use of the Agency's verification capacity and experience in new international agreements and seek your comments.
<LI>    In the course of these two days you will hear and meet several of the key actors of the Agency in the safeguards field, the Head of the Department, Deputy Director General Pellaud, the Head of the Action Team for Iraq, Prof. Zifferero, the Director responsible for safeguards in the DPRK, Mr. Perricos, the Section Head responsible for safeguards in South Africa, Mr. Dillon, the Director responsible for the major project for strengthening of safeguards, Mr. Hooper, and the Director responsible inter alia for the Agency's contribution to the preparations for the 1995 NPT Conference, Assistant Director General, Mr. El Baradei.  They are all people of great experience and knowledge, but they are, of course, only a few among many who are engaged in the application and development of safeguards in the Secretariat.  From the government side I shall only mention Mr. Ek, who is the Chairman of SAGSI (Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation), the group of government advisors who are grappling, together with the Secretariat, with the task of making the safeguards system both stronger and -- if possible -- less expensive.  I also especially welcome the representatives from the Conference on Disarmament:  Ambassadors Berdennikov of Russia, Marin Bosch of Mexico, and Tanaka of Japan.  We are also very pleased that Ambassador Dhanapala, who was last week nominated President of the 1995 NPT Conference, is with us.  Without mentioning any more of the distinguished participants from governments, media and think tanks, let me say that I think you may have as much interest in talking to each other as to discussing with us in the IAEA Secretariat.
<LI>    I should now like to make a number of points, placing safeguards in the political landscape.
The IAEA has two main activities -- promotion and control
<LI>    A first, or perhaps even preliminary, point is that safeguards is one of the IAEA's major activities, but only one of them.  The active promotion of various peaceful nuclear applications of nuclear energy, whether in medicine, agriculture or industry, is the other  major activity.  The safeguards budget is about 1/3 of the regular budget, or $68 million in 1994.
<P>A few critics of the safeguards system contend that there is a contradiction between these two functions.  The most extreme form of this argument which I have met, is that safeguards inspectors of the IAEA do not want to discover any irregularities, because this would prove that the promotional work of the IAEA had contributed to misuse.  Such argument has nothing to do with the practical reality.  Inspectors routinely report anomalies which they find and these are fully explored.  The argument also flies in the face of the original "Atoms for Peace" policy, which deliberately held out the bargain of offering peaceful nuclear techniques and obtaining commitments to non-proliferation and acceptance of verification.  There is also no doubt that in many cases effective safeguards are more readily accepted because the IAEA is identified not only as an inspector but also as an organization which helps development.  Although it is true that some assistance will expand the general fund of knowledge of things nuclear, the assistance we give is mostly focussed on medicine, agriculture, industry and safety or established nuclear power programmes.   I suspect that those who criticize the promotional role of the Agency do it less out of genuine concern for the non-proliferation and effectiveness of safeguards than because they want to conclude that the safeguards system is weak or because they are opposed to any promotion and use of nuclear techniques.  Whatever explanation, it is obvious that there is a massive support in the Agency membership for the dual role which the Statute lays upon the IAEA and an insistence by developing countries that there continue to be a balance between the two major activities.  In this view, an expansion of safeguards activities should be complemented by an expansion in promotional activities.
<P><B>The legal basis for safeguards</B>
<LI>    Let me take up another misguided criticism of the safeguards system.  There is sometimes an unfortunate tendency to view the acceptance of comprehensive safeguards as something already incumbent upon all but the declared nuclear-weapon States -- a rule supposedly to be imposed by the IAEA.  On this premise the Agency is considered as deficient in not imposing safeguards in, say, Pakistan or Israel.  The system is also seen by some as weak when the Agency has been unable to force an access for inspectors in the DPRK.  The Agency is criticized for not having sanctions available and sometimes it is suggested that the situation would be very different if the Security Council operated the safeguards.
<P>To understand how safeguards function we must understand how the international community functions.  Rules binding States do not arise in the same way as rules arise within States and the means through which rules are upheld vis-à-vis States -- when they are upheld -- are different from the means by which rules are upheld within States.  Within a State a legislature can adopt by majority vote a law under which, say, citizens are allowed to possess weapons only if they have a license.  The police will possess the means to enforce this rule in all cases which come to their knowledge.
<P>In the international community there is no legislature authorized to decide by majority that only the five declared nuclear-weapon States are to be licensed the possession of nuclear weapons and although references are not rare to "a norm of non-proliferation", this is a "political" norm -- not a legally binding one.  Clearly, however, it is a norm with considerable backing.  In their summit statement of 31 January 1992 the members of the Security Council stated inter alia that "the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security" -- thereby implying a capacity for the Council to intervene.  However, any attempt to maintain that a non-proliferation norm exists today which legally excludes the nuclear weapons option for all non-declared nuclear-weapon States would I think be opposed by Israel, India and Pakistan.  The development of legally binding commitments to non-proliferation in the international community is not through majority votes but by the more cumbersome process of individual express consent of States to various treaties.  This process as we know has been remarkably successful and now misses only a few crucial countries -- apart from the five declared nuclear-weapon States.  We have also seen in the DPRK case how a State's notice to revoke its consent  led to immediate and vigorous reactions.  It is safe to assume that the NPT Conference in 1995 will not lead to a lapsing but to a prolongation of the legally binding non-proliferation commitments made under the Treaty.  
<P>It is correct that from the viewpoint of any State, say on the Arabian peninsula, it would appear desirable that the Agency operate as fully effective comprehensive safeguards in Israel as in Iraq.  And we are sometimes criticized for not doing this.  However, it must be understood that, unlike Iraq, Israel has not yet adhered to the NPT and has not yet accepted a comprehensive safeguards agreement.  Therefore the Agency has no right to implement such safeguards in Israel.  This is not a weakness of the safeguards system, but a consequence of state sovereignty.  The first step is to seek the contractual consent of Israel.  In the same way, the IAEA cannot be criticized for not applying comprehensive safeguards in India or Pakistan, which have also not adhered to the NPT.
<P>Is it justified to criticize the safeguards system as weak, because the inspectors cannot forcibly obtain access to countries and installations?  We must realize that enforcing rules on States is mostly a very different matter from enforcing rules on individuals in a State.  The inspectors of the IAEA are not an international nuclear police that can force its way to facilities it feels it must visit.  Indeed, a country can even make the inspectors’ entry subject to visa.  To exert pressure the Agency can suspend technical assistance or even suspend rights and privileges of a country, but such actions do not constitute very effective sanctions.  However, the Agency can report a case of non-compliance to the Security Council, which possesses a wide spectrum of legal competences to bring a State to fulfil its obligations.  It is for the Council to determine in the light of all circumstances what means it finds appropriate.  It may safely be assumed that military force will only rarely be resorted to.  Diplomatic pressures, trade restrictions, the stopping of air traffic, economic sanctions are more likely measures.  Is this to admit the impotence of the world community?  Yes and no.  After the Cold War, the Security Council is much more likely than before to be able to agree on some measure of persuasion or enforcement.  Yet, mobilizing and applying the force necessary to coerce a State will remain problematic and will only occur where enforcement appears vitally important to the great powers in the Council.  In the face of Iraqi aggression, such force was mobilized and used.  In the case of the DPRK's refusal of adequate access to safeguards, great power diplomacy is still being used.
<P>From the IAEA horizon, the DPRK case is straightforward:  safeguards findings suggest that the DPRK has more plutonium than it has declared and when the country refuses to co-operate by allowing requested inspections of two non-declared sites and fails to give satisfactory explanations, the Agency turns to the Security Council.  It is not really the effectiveness of safeguards as an alarm mechanism which is now being tested.  Thanks to the use of new analytical techniques which are part of the strengthened safeguards, the system has produced warning signals.  What is being tested are the means available to the Security Council and its Members of prompting the DPRK to demonstrate credibly  through full acceptance of  effective safeguards its assertion that it is not using any nuclear installations for the development of a nuclear weapons capacity.  As I see it, the United States' talks with the DPRK representatives have been in pursuance of this Security Council objective.
<P><B>Incentives and disincentives to nuclear proliferation</B>
<LI>    If safeguards inspectors cannot as a world nuclear police prevent or stop diversion of nuclear material from peaceful to military use, but can only observe and report, what disincentives are there against proliferation and what incentives are there for non-proliferation?  The refusal of most possible supplier States to sell nuclear power technology and fuel to States not accepting full-scope safeguards is one form of disincentive.  The offer of guarantees against nuclear attacks of States accepting the NPT and safeguards on the other hand is a reward to those who forego the nuclear weapon option.  The current case of Ukraine shows how guarantees about inviolability of borders and economic compensation together provide incentives for commitment to non-nuclear weapon status and acceptance of comprehensive safeguards.  And both the case of the DPRK and the case of Ukraine show how States are seeking to obtain assurances relevant to their security -- and perhaps more -- to formally forego the nuclear weapon option and accept effective verification.  
<P>Inspection cannot -- as I said -- physically prevent or stop violation of a non-proliferation commitment, but the risk that verification could lead to the detection of violations and consequent reactions by other States, should provide some disincentive against violations.
<LI>Despite the incentives and disincentives, there exists the possibility that some States refusing to commit themselves to non-proliferation actually develop nuclear weapons -- as South Africa did -- and that a State may withdraw from the NPT and proceed to make such weapons, or that a State may successfully secretly violate its commitment and circumvent export restrictions of suppliers -- as Iraq tried to do.  The fact that these possibilities exist and need to be envisaged is not a good reason, however, to write off non-proliferation commitments and safeguards verification as soft, ineffective diplomatic stuff and to point to military hardware as the reliable remedy.  If it is legitimate to critically examine the cost-effectiveness -- and limitations -- of treaty commitments, safeguards and non-military measures to prevent proliferation -- as it clearly is -- it is equally legitimate to examine the cost-effectiveness and limitations of the military option to achieve the same purpose.
<P>Regrettably, despite the strengthening of safeguards, the case of a non-discovered clandestine nuclear weapons capacity cannot be ruled out.  As Mr. Spector was reported to have said, "We don't know what we don't know."  Accordingly we have to conclude that neither the effectiveness of the legal commitments plus safeguards and non-military incentives nor military means will give 100% assurance.  However, the ambition is to come as close as we can to such complete assurance.
<P>Before leaving this point let me finish by recalling -- even with Iraq and DPRK before our eyes -- that the policies leading to legally binding commitments to non-proliferation and safeguards have achieved a great deal, most recently regarding Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, and perhaps soon regarding Algeria, Cuba and Ukraine.  The ending of the Cold War, the drastic reductions in the nuclear arsenals and the patient policies of military détente and incentives and disincentives to non-proliferation are paying good dividends.
<P><B>Limits to willingness of States to accept verification and inspection</B>
<LI>    We shall talk a good deal about the strengthening of safeguards and describe what has been done and what is contemplated.  I shall not enter into the substance of that discussion, but I would like to make some comments on the general question of how far governments may be willing to go in accepting verification and inspection.  The safeguards system set up under NPT has been pioneering in the field of verification and on-site inspection.  To minimize intrusion and perceived risks of revelation of technological and commercial secrets, it focussed on the nuclear material and paid little attention  to the risk of secret installations, which is now a major point of interest.  As  we seek to expand verification and make it more effective, we also become aware of State sensitivities.
<P>As the purpose of inspection is to justify confidence between States, it is an activity in the direct interest of neighbouring States and the world at large.  Generosity concerning inspection should thus be expected.  However, we find that while States may wish to see intrusive inspection in other States' territory, it may wish to see some limitations when it comes to its own territory and installations.  The most recent experience of governmental discussion of this matter was in the long negotiations which resulted in the Chemical Weapons Convention.  While on some points the inspection system accepted there contains clear improvements over what we have under the NPT -- e.g. regarding multiple visas and the right to communication and travel -- many features are very similar in the two verification systems, e.g. the need for acceptance of inspectors designated.  The limitations are perhaps not so surprising.  As citizens we do not want the police to search homes without some warrant issued for adequate reasons.  It should not be expected that sovereign States will be less jealous about their privacy.  
<P>International inspection of facilities under military control may be both particularly important and particularly sensitive.  The CWC solves the problem by so-called "managed access" which will allow the shielding of certain sensitive objects not relevant to chemical weapons.  The problem was encountered in practice by the IAEA when the DPRK asserted that two non-declared sites which the IAEA wished to visit and take samples from were non-nuclear and military.  One of them, to which the Agency was allowed access on one occasion appeared, indeed, to have some military function.  In requesting access to these sites, the Agency has informed the DPRK that it is ready to discuss special arrangements which would take into account concerns about military secrecy.   This is probably as far as one can go.  While a State, like the DPRK, could have a genuine fear that its accepting inspection of military sites could be misused, the immunity of any sites could equally be used by a State wishing to hide prohibited material or installations.
<P>In my view, objections to the use of satellite photography or intelligence data by an inspectorate deserve less understanding.  Satellite pictures and remote sensing have been part of confidence-building for a very long time and must by now be regarded as conventional surveillance.  It might be good for an international inspectorate to obtain pictures from several different systems -- to reduce the risk of any manipulation.  National intelligence offered to an international inspectorate may, of course, be disinformation or erroneous.  So long as the inspectorate is fully aware of this possibility and critically examines any such data, I do not see strong reasons for objecting to its use -- if it is offered.  There will undoubtedly be restrictions in States’ readiness to offer such data.  However, a State can hardly complain about ineffectiveness of an international verification system if it silently sits on information that could have helped the international system to examine particular sites.  Both the Special Commission of the UN on Iraq and the IAEA received valuable information from national intelligence during their inspection work in Iraq.  It is, on the other hand, excluded, of course, that an international inspectorate could engage in illicit activities, or offer any State information in return for intelligence obtained.
<LI>    With some new safeguards techniques which have become available, with a readiness of States to be somewhat more accommodating -- in their own interest -- to comprehensive inspection with little or no notice and be more generous with information, one can considerably reduce the risk that undeclared activities go undetected.  However, as I have noted, 100% assurance cannot be achieved.  Accordingly a so-called "clean bill of health" can never be issued by the Agency.  Member States will have to make do with reports that after such and such extensive verification measures, the Agency has found no evidence suggesting the existence of undeclared material or activities which should have been declared.
<P>The conclusion that 100% certainty is unattainable through safeguards verification takes on greater significance as nuclear disarmament proceeds.  The fewer nuclear weapons there remain in the world, the more important it becomes that no clandestine weapons capacity develops anywhere.  No doubt this lack of full certainty will be one factor suggesting retention of a nuclear military capacity in the existing nuclear-weapon States  -- or in some distant international security organ to deal with any surprises.  It also points to the importance of regional and global policies which not only create but maintain disincentives to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and which maintain incentives to do without them, as well as export restrictions making it more difficult for anyone to acquire sensitive material or technology.
<LI>    After the uncovering of the clandestine nuclear weapons programme in Iraq and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it has been rather common to refer to the risk of nuclear proliferation as the greatest threat on the horizon.  It is true that the case of Iraq showed that more developing countries will be attaining the technological level at which a weapons programme is possible.  It is also true that Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan posed -- and at least Ukraine still poses -- problems and that the breakdown of discipline and order coupled with miserable living conditions and the existence of an abundance of nuclear material and nuclear expertise in the former Soviet Union raise specific dangers in the sphere of nuclear proliferation.  So far, none of these dangers seem to have materialized.  The material that has been smuggled and found so far raise more concern about fraud, health and safety than about proliferation.
<P>Alarmist reports which we read from time to time about new threats of nuclear proliferation, while useful as reminders of risks, often overlook the very significant progress that has been achieved in the realm of non-proliferation in the last few years.  With Argentina having accepted full-scope safeguards and Brazil near this decision, and Cuba apparently ready to do the same, the Tlatelolco Treaty may soon come into force.  And with South Africa having joined the NPT and Algeria declaring its intention to do so, an African nuclear weapons-free zone -- a draft of which already exists -- seems a very likely early project.  There remain three problem areas:  the Middle East, India/Pakistan and the Korean peninsula.  It seems clear  that regional tailor-made solutions will be needed in all three cases.
<LI>    A cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons production is of general interest as a complement to the reduction of nuclear arsenals in the declared nuclear-weapon States, and as a cap on the production of such material for weapons in Israel, India and Pakistan.  For the Korean peninsula, an agreement already exists on non-production of plutonium and enriched uranium.  It may need confirmation.  That agreement incidentally shows that the ambitions in the non-proliferation effort have increased from a ban on making weapons to exclude -- as far as possible -- the possession of weapons grade material and of capacity to produce such material.
<P>The conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty -- CTBT -- is of undoubted value to prevent the development of reliable nuclear weapons technology -- at least in some States.  It is also of signal political importance for the continued broad support of the NPT that the nuclear weapons States join such a treaty, which has been held out as an expectation for several decades.  Perhaps the time might even be ripe for a non-first use agreement.  Paul Nitze has recently argued that smart conventional weapons might be more credible than nuclear weapons.  A non-first use agreement -- by definition -- does not rule out nuclear retaliation.
<LI>    Let me conclude by confirming that verification will not of itself stop violations, but can and should bring warning signals of efforts to violate.  Verification may help to deter violation as the alarms must be expected to trigger reactions by governments, individually or collectively.  Although verification techniques are being improved and strengthened over today's level and will bring higher levels of assurance and confidence, they are not likely to bring 100% certainty.  Verification, alone, is not a sufficient barrier against proliferation.  However, it is the one we focus on here.  It should be made as strong as possible.  Following Iraq and the conclusion of the CWC, States may be willing to accept a number of measures making inspection more effective than before and making transparency greater.  New techniques are also available to inspectors.  The IAEA is in the midst of discussing and adopting new measures and has a rich experience to draw on.  This experience and the Agency's infrastructure -- if expanded and funded -- could be used also for other verification functions that will be needed under a number of new nuclear arms control and disarmament agreements.

<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Message from<BR>Dr. Hans Blix, Director General of the IAEA<BR>to the Regional Executive Management Seminar on Radiation Processing in Industry</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Regional Executive Management Seminar on Radiation Processing in Industry</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>9 April 1994</H4>
<P><HR>It is my privilege to welcome participants to this Regional Executive Management Seminar on Radiation Processing in Industry, which was jointly organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Institute of Atomic Energy Research of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST).
<P>  I am pleased to note that this is the second regional activity of its kind to be hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for executive managers from the Middle East region, and I warmly congratulate and thank the local organizers for their dedication and diligence in preparing the seminar, which aims at promoting the practical applications of nuclear techniques in the region for national development. I am equally pleased to note also that this meeting has brought together specialists from the industrialized countries to share their knowledge and experience with participants from the region.
<P>Your discussions will focus on possible ways of extending the peaceful applications of nuclear techniques to the industrial development processes of participating countries.  In recent times, as you may be aware, many nuclear techniques have been developed and are being applied on an industrial scale for the exploration and exploitation of energy and mineral resources, in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, and in the development and production of new materials.  These applications, and particularly radiation processing, have resulted in considerable technical and economic benefits, through improved quality of materials and improved reliability of equipment and savings in energy and materials.  These advances ultimately have the result of improving the quality of life. 
<P>Also, many institutions in the Middle East are usefully applying nuclear techniques in such diverse fields as medicine, hydrology, agriculture and industry; radioisotopes and radiation techniques are being used to improve crops, to preserve food crops, to determine groundwater resources, to sterilize medical supplies, to analyze hormones, to check for defects in pipelines, to control the quality of industrial products, and to study environmental pollution.  
<P>The IAEA is very actively engaged in the transfer of radioisotope and nuclear techniques to developing countries; the Agency's involvement in this Seminar is an example of the role it can play.
<P>I am informed that the programme of the seminar will focus on the basic principles of radiation processing in industry, non-destructive testing of materials, nucleonic control systems, ion implantation techniques, among others. These techniques are highly relevant for nations which are seeking to improve industrial development and productivity. The advantages of these nuclear techniques include speed and relative simplicity of use.  In some cases, nuclear techniques can be used in circumstances where no other instruments or methods can be used.
<P>The need to modernize and to improve the efficiency of industry in developing countries is increasingly being recognized, and the IAEA is pleased to be able to contribute to this effort.  It is my hope that the participants in this Seminar will increase their knowledge and understanding of industrial applications of isotopes and radiation and that this knowledge will be used fruitfully to advance the industrial development of the region.<HR>

<TITLE>Global Aspects of Nuclear Power, Energy Supply and Nuclear Disarmament</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Global Aspects of Nuclear Power, Energy Supply and Nuclear Disarmament</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> Energy Supply and Nuclear Disarmament<BR>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>KTH Symposium, <BR>Stockholm,Sweden</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER> 25 May 1994</H4>
<HR><P>In 1979 the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island occurred.  No human being was injured by radiation and hardly any radioactivity escaped to the environment.  Yet, to many people who were fearful and sceptical of nuclear power and its waste, the accident confirmed that this form of energy generation was too dangerous and must be abandoned.  Their dilemma was - and remains - that they are largely empty-handed when it comes to presenting credible alternatives to nuclear power.  We can "say no to drugs" without offering alternatives.  We live decidedly better without drugs than with them.  But we do not live better without energy than with energy.  While not in any way belittling the scope for and the desirability of energy conservation through higher efficiency, we must recognize that a high standard of living is dependent upon an abundant supply of energy.  A Swede uses some 17 000 kWh electricity per year.  A citizen in Bangladesh uses about 75.  Development everywhere requires more electricity.  It is true also for OECD countries.  Although they have a stagnant or slowly increasing use of total energy, their electricity consumption increases - largely following GNP.
<P><B>No credible non-fossil fuels alternatives to nuclear power:  the case of Sweden</B>
<P>I shall focus on global questions, but let me start here in Sweden, with an outstanding record of 40 years of nuclear reactor operations, which began here at the KTH when the research reactor R1 was brought into operation by my predecessor as Director General of the IAEA, Sigvard Eklund.
<P>In the Swedish referendum of 1980 there was, of course, behind all the three options presented an awareness of the lack of credible alternatives to nuclear power - other than fossil fuels.  An option which would have proposed stopping immediately the six nuclear reactors existing then would have been too clearly unrealistic and would not have attracted a large share of the votes.
<P>Option 3 expressed its determined opposition to nuclear power, not by proposing the immediate closing of the six nuclear power reactors, but by proposing that no further reactors should be built and that those already existing should be phased out in ten years, i.e. by 1990.  Many people (38%) were either sufficiently worried about nuclear power or - less likely - sufficiently convinced about the possibility of finding viable alternatives in ten years to vote for this option.
<P>Options 1 and 2, which together got 59% of the votes, represented a more cautious line.  Nuclear power should be phased out as other sources of energy became available and with due regard to economy, employment, etc.  If the proposal had stopped at that it could have meant, essentially, that nuclear power would be abandoned when something better was found.  Such a proposal would not have been unreasonable, but it would not have offered enough by way of tangible promises to the voters who were concerned to see some end to the nuclear power era.  So, it was also stipulated that no nuclear reactors would be built above and beyond the 12 which were either completed or under construction and, inasmuch as all reactors have a limited lifespan, it could be claimed that the nuclear power programme would come to an end when the 12 reactors ceased to operate.  However, what the undertaking gained in precision it lost in reliability.  The life span of reactors, to be sure, permitted a longer lead time for the development and introduction of non fossil fuel alternatives than the 10 year period of Option 3.  But was it enough?  When after the referendum, the Swedish Parliament decided that the outer limit was 2010, the credibility of the promise was even further in doubt.
<P>As the years have gone by and we come closer to the year 2010 the promises of the referendum ballot and of the parliamentary decision are being tested.  It is like slowly walking down to a sea of ice cold water.
<P>It will be said by some that had we only taken a bold phase-out decision, the engineers and planners would have been compelled to make the right photovoltaic cells or windmills and that we would have managed.  This is not really credible.  In Sweden, as in many other countries, a lot of resources have been made available to develop new sources of energy - so far with only modest results.  Today - as in 1980 - electricity in Sweden is generated mainly by hydro power, nuclear power and some fossil fuelled power.  Conservation has not reduced the overall use of power.  Indeed, the use of electricity is increasing in the improving economy and the need for a net import of 2.6 TWh of electricity in 1995 is predicted (by NUTEK).
<P>The conclusion must be drawn that, under Option 3, electricity supply in Sweden would have been in serious trouble in 1990.  Nearly 50% of the electricity we used then would have had to be substituted.  In all likelihood a "bold" decision would not have led to the use of solar power, wind or biomass but would have forced us to generate much electricity by burning more fossil fuels, perhaps coal as in Denmark or natural gas - certainly not what Option 3 had promised.  Had Option 3 prevailed in 1980, Sweden would have been in a situation somewhat similar to that of Italy after the Chernobyl accident.  Following a referendum, Italy closed its three nuclear power plants and stopped the construction of two further reactors.  And what is energy-deficient Italy using instead?  Solar energy? Biomass?  Wind power?  No, more gas from North Africa and import of almost 20% of its electricity from France where three quarters of the electricity comes from nuclear power plants.
<P>For Options 1 and 2 in the Swedish referendum the moment of truth has not yet arrived.  It is clear to more and more people that the parliament deadline of 2010 chosen by parliament for terminating nuclear power and for relying on non-fossil substitutes is unrealistic.  However, the lifespan of the Swedish reactors extends much further than the year 2010 and perhaps give a further 15 or more years in which to develop non-fossil fuel substitutes to nuclear power.  Even with more time available for fulfilment of the phase-out promise of 1980, the credibility of this promise is diminishing.
<P>I am not suggesting that the public's concern and anxiety about nuclear power has changed drastically despite 14 years of excellent Swedish nuclear power operations.  To be sure, people have got more used to nuclear power and their concern is directed more at nuclear reactors in the East, but their confidence remains shaky.  The slightest hiccup in a nuclear power plant is reported and registered.  The ardour of the proponents of wind power, solar power and biomass has not diminished very much, despite the very modest progress which they have made during a period that is longer than the one they promised would be sufficient in which to substitute all Swedish nuclear power.  However, 14 years after the Swedish referendum, the limited credibility which non-fossil substitutes for nuclear power had in 1980 is wearing even thinner.
<P><B>No non-fossil fuel alternatives to nuclear power:  the global situation</B>
<P>The situation globally - with allowance for some variations and for exceptions in the cases of France and the Far East - is in many respects similar to the Swedish situation.  In much of the Western industrialized world, following the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the popular perception of the risks of nuclear power is such that it is difficult or impossible for governments to propose building more nuclear power plants.  Opponents of nuclear power still tell us that conservation, plus development of renewable sources, will allow us to phase out nuclear power and will suffice to meet any new energy demands.  As this is not true, many more combined cycle gas powered plants and more coal-fuelled plants are being built in the UK, in Germany, in Denmark, and in other countries.  Conservation is proceeding everywhere for economic reasons as technology changes.  To take an example, the OECD countries have saved more than 30% of total energy since the first oil price shock - to a great extent by shifting to electricity which is efficient in the end use.  However, expanding energy demand mostly outpaces gains by conservation.  Therefore additional supply - especially of electricity - is required.  The growth of non-fossil fuelled sources is minimal in absolute terms.  To take an example, in Denmark, invariably heralded as a champion of wind power, only some 3% -  or 0.8 TWh - of the electricity is now wind generated.  The growth of Danish coal-fuelled electricity, on the other hand, has been rapid - from 15 TWh/year in 1980 to  30 TWh/year now.
<P>Other examples:  In Austria, where a nuclear power plant was stopped after a referendum, its replacement was a coal-fired plant.  In Belgium, where the government turned down the utilities' request to build another nuclear power plant, the substitute was a gas-fired plant.  And in Finland, a coal-fired plant has been regarded as a plausible alternative to the additional nuclear power plant which the government had proposed and parliament turned down last year.
<P>Many factors on the energy scene vary considerably from country to country.  To take examples, in the United States, the regulatory process has lent itself to excessive interventions by opponents and this has led to very costly delays.  In Japan and the Far East, the growth of demand has been and remains compelling.  In Germany, much power resides in the Länder and a major political party has an anti-nuclear platform.  Some other features, however, are fairly universal.  I have mentioned two:
<OL>
<LI>The fear which a segment of public opinion has about radioactive releases from accidents at nuclear power plants and waste disposal installations;
<LI>The reality that commercial renewable sources of energy, like wind and solar power or biomass, appear capable of providing only marginal contributions to the huge amounts of energy required.
</OL>
<B>Let me mention a few other relatively undisputed features:</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The reality that demand for energy is expanding in most parts of the world with population growth and the quest for higher standards of living, especially in developing countries.  To take electricity, it has been recently calculated - by the IEA of the OECD - that global demand may increase by 75% by the year 2010 and in Asia by as much as around 190%;
<LI>The reality that hydrocarbon-based energy sources, which today dominate the world's commercial energy supply, are finite.  Oil and gas supplies will not last for as long as a hundred years, and prices will rise.  Only coal reserves are expected to last for several hundred years;
<LI>The reality that although uranium, too, is a finite source, known resources could sustain a much expanded nuclear power sector.  If breeder reactors were in broad use, nuclear power plants could provide an almost inexhaustible supply of power.  Indeed, the energy content of 1g of plutonium is equivalent to that of 1 ton of oil.  Fusion could also give almost unlimited energy supply.  However, it is wise to remember that fission is an existing proven technology - fusion is not;
<LI>The reality that some of our most important environmental concerns are linked to our extensive and growing use of fossil fuels.  I have in mind in particular fears that the increasing emission of greenhouse gases, like CO2 and methane, will accelerate global warming.
</UL>
Taken together, the factors which I have mentioned may make for an unpalatable brew which democratic governments, while concerned about the voters' feelings in a next election will have to take account of in planning responsibly for long-term growing energy needs.  Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the major building blocs available.  Both will be needed.  Neither is loved.  For as long as the demand for increased energy supply is not compelling - as in Sweden today  - the issue can at best be pushed aside.  It gets more difficult - as we have seen in Finland - when decisions need to be taken.  So far, it is mainly in the Far East - Japan, Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan (China) - that governments facing rapidly increasing energy demands are at present actively promoting the nuclear option.
<P>Although nuclear power will need to compete with other power sources on its own economic, safety and reliability merits, a further necessary comparison relates today to impact on health and on the environment.
<P><B>The proclaimed  aim to reduce emissions of CO2 - and the reality</B>
<P>As I said a moment ago, there is a growing concern that emissions of CO2 and methane linked to energy use may contribute to climate change.  We have already seen discussions in Europe about special CO2 taxes.  We have also seen that a Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted at the Conference on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992 aiming at stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at levels which would not interfere dangerously with the climatic system.  However, the Convention is silent on the question how this is to be done.  Nor did it include the proposal advocated by many that man-made greenhouse gas emissions should have returned to 1990 levels by the year 2005.  Few speakers at the Rio Conference addressed the question of energy and it is curious to note that few of the many governments, international authorities and non-governmental groups deeply engaged in the question of global warming have highlighted the implications of this threat for the future global energy mix.  In my view this gives a certain Alice in Wonderland character to what should be a serious public discussion.
<P>In its authoritative report "Energy for Tomorrow's World", the World Energy Council says that the aim of early global reductions in CO2 emissions is unrealistic.  In all the Council's global energy scenarios for the time up to the year 2020 - even the most optimistic - there is an increase in the use of fossil fuels and an increase in CO2 emissions.  It is true that gas burning yields about half as much CO2 per energy unit generated as does coal and a switch from coal to gas should thus be advantageous.  Before any such conclusion is firmly drawn, however, one would have to examine whether or not leakages connected with the transport and use of gas offset the gain in terms of greenhouse effect.
<P>The factors which propel the world to greater energy use are not easily influenced.  Population increase is one.  It has been calculated that, at the time of Christ, there were 350 million people on the earth.  By 1900 there were 1.5 billion.  In 1990 there were 5.3 billion and in the year 2000 it is expected that there will be 6.2 billion.  Thus, in the last ten years of this century, mankind is expected to increase by almost as much as it did in the one thousand nine hundred years following the birth of Christ.  The additional billions which arrive in this world will need to cook their food and heat their shelters.  The second most important factor leading to greater energy need is the demand for a higher standard of living.  Developing countries especially will - naturally - demand that the lives of their teeming billions be made easier.
<P>Where is all this additional energy to come from?  If nuclear power were rejected and we were not to increase the use of fossil fuels for fear of more CO2 emissions we would appear, indeed, to be as empty-handed globally as we have been in Sweden after the referendum to phase out nuclear power.  However, this is not what is actually happening in the world today.  Globally, nuclear power is not being phased out - only stagnating.  The some 430 nuclear reactors which exist in the world help us to prevent much CO2 emission.  If they were to be replaced by equivalent coal plants - as was done in Austria - some 1800 million tons of CO2 would be added to the atmosphere annually, i.e. 9% of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.
There is also no reduction globally in the use of fossil fuels and in the emissions of CO2 connected with this use.  Quite to the contrary, there is a continuous increase.  The OECD/IEA report on world energy outlook predicts that energy-derived CO2 emissions will increase by almost 50% by the year 2010.  Thus, the rhetoric about global CO2-abatement is proceeding in one direction, and reality in another!  If the fast-growing economies of Japan, the Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan (China) were not significantly expanding their nuclear sectors, the increase in the use of fossil fuels and of emissions of CO2 would, of course, be even greater.  If we are seriously concerned about the CO2 emissions we should be glad that the booming Far East is fuelling an increasing part of its boom with nuclear energy.  In this connection, let me give some recent figures about the Republic of Korea - South Korea:
<UL>    
<LI>    nuclear power today generates about 40% of the electricity;
<LI>    the growth of total electricity generation in the period 1987 to 1993 has averaged 8.4% per annum;
<LI>    the installed nuclear power capacity planned for 2006 is about 20 000 MW(e) (compared to current installed capacity of 7220 MW(e)); and
<LI>    the nuclear share of electricity to be generated in 2006 is expected to be about 73%.
</UL>
<P><B>Hopes for renewable energy everlasting</B>
<P>It is interesting  - and to me disconcerting - that the very same convictions which lay behind the unrealistic contention made in 1980 that Sweden could phase out nuclear power by 1990 without increasing the use of fossil fuels now underlie global scenarios which would practically phase out both nuclear power and fossil fuels by the year 2100!  The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the chairmanship of the well known Swedish climatologist, Professor Bert Bolin, is the central official body concerned with the question of climate change.  It is generally credited with respectable scientific work in assessing the risk of climate change and the causes of such change.  It is also concerned, however, with evaluating mitigation response scenarios.  Among the experts advising the panel in this area is Professor Tomas Johansson of the University of Lund.  What possible responses are they contemplating?  Under a "renewable sources scenario", which is being considered, renewable sources, including hydro, would in 2100 have a share of 83% of the world's total energy supply as compared to 6% commercial renewables - almost all hydro power - at present.  As I said both fossil and nuclear power would be practically phased out.  Biomass would provide 50% of world energy consumption, most of it being solid biomass used for electricity generation.  One may, of course, query how meaningful such theoretical exercises are.  The rapidly accelerating and dominant role of renewable energies in this scenario appears to be highly speculative and unrealistic.  Today, after decades of development, new renewable sources - biomass, solar, wind and geothermal power - contribute only a fraction of a percent of the world's energy and the World Energy Council foresees for them only a very minor role even 30 years from now.  One would hope that the IPCC will focus its attention on more realistic options than the "renewable sources scenario" which I have referred to.
<P>The proponents of nuclear power are not maintaining that a rapid expansion of nuclear power alone will solve the formidable energy/environment problems.  But they are of the view that  these problems cannot be solved without greater use of nuclear power - which today provides some 5% of the world's total energy and some 17% of the world's electricity, a little less than hydro power.
<P>Whatever aversion and concern a section of the public in various countries may feel about nuclear power at present it is a proven technology, is capable of much expansion, and is especially useful for the secondary energy which in particular will be in increasing demand, namely electricity - but also for heat production and perhaps desalination of sea water.
Some two years ago the Club of Rome summed up the situation rather well when it said in a report - I quote:  "the use of coal and oil is probably more dangerous to society, because of the carbon dioxide they produce, than nuclear energy.  There are therefore strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open and for the development of fast breeders ...".
<P>What can and should be done to keep the nuclear option open and used?
<P><B>How to keep the nuclear power option open?</B>
<P>A first requirement is public discussion with active participation by scientists and engineers.  There is a certain risk that political parties and governments which are positive or at least open to the nuclear power option remain silent on the issue for fear of alienating voters in the short term thereby leaving discussion to vocal anti-nuclear groups.  This could lead to the unfortunate result of the option being unavailable one day, when it might be needed to meet compelling demands for additional non-fossil-fuel based additional power capacity.  Improved education in schools about radiation and nuclear physics is also important to ensure that, in the future, radiation is regarded as a natural physical phenomenon and not as something mystic or evil. 
<P><B>Safety of nuclear power</B>
<P>For the near and intermediate future, of course, an important requirement is to ensure the consistently good operation of existing nuclear power plants.  Much has been attained in this sphere in the last ten years.  Because of better maintenance and management nuclear power reactors now, by and large, have fewer unplanned stoppages than earlier and their personnel receives less dosage of radiation.  The aim - especially after the Chernobyl accident - is to ensure respect for a nuclear safety culture everywhere in the world.  This year we expect that an international convention on the safety of nuclear power plants will be finalized and adopted under the auspices of the IAEA.  Through the convention States around the world will bind themselves to a number of important safety principles.  They will report periodically on the implementation of these principles and will have to accept peer review of their reports.  Later, a similar convention - providing world-wide standards - will be elaborated on the safe management and disposal of nuclear waste - as requested by Sweden and several other States.
<P>     While we can now register over 6000 reactor years with the Chernobyl accident being the only one which has caused significant off-site
radioactive releases, there is still concern that safety improvements are not taking place quickly enough in many older power reactors of Russian
design.  Scarcity of resources in the former Soviet Union and slow delivery of assistance from abroad are the reasons.  I must, however, express
sincere appreciation to the Swedish Government, Swedish authorities and Swedish utilities for active and constructive assistance to the East.  These
are, indeed, acts of enlightened self-interest:  there is a compelling interest in ensuring that no further accident occurs.
<P><B>New nuclear power technology</B>
<P>A second important area of activity is the further development of nuclear power technology.  The nuclear recession which still prevails in many
countries in the Western industrialized world does not encourage expensive investment in such development.  However, we should be aware that the
emergence of advanced types of reactors might do much to increase acceptability of nuclear power.  When public opinion does recognize the need to
expand the use of nuclear power, as I trust one day it will, it should find that technology in this field as in others has not been standing still.
<P>Many new demands are being placed upon the next generation of reactors.  Their safety should be such that no plans are needed for the
emergency evacuation of people living in their vicinity.  They should be economically competitive and easier to operate than present reactors.  With
renewed acceptance of the nuclear power option, new functions can be foreseen for nuclear energy.  Regions which must now increasingly rely on the
desalination of sea water could look to a new option.  Heat producing reactors could have wide industrial use and reactors could be used for district
heating in the cold regions of the world.  Even the much maligned breeder reactor may one day be welcomed.  It is true that the economic case for
breeders is not present today - with uranium prices at a very low level, and it is true that the use of plutonium requires special security measures.
However, looking toward the next century the experience that a few countries, including Japan, France and Russia, are gaining in the design and
operation of breeders may turn out to be valuable - for themselves and for the world as well.
<P><B>Nuclear waste disposal</B>
<P>The issue of waste from nuclear power still looms large in the public debate.  However, the questions here are not of the same dimension as
the issues of operational safety and they are likely to be of limited duration.  When suitable sites have been selected in a country and appropriate
installations have been built, problems are unlikely to arise.  The operation of waste disposal installations is not very complicated.  Nevertheless there
are some matters in the area of radioactive waste which deserve particular attention.  Firstly, it is known that the handling of nuclear waste in the
military sector in the US and Russia has had serious deficiencies.  This must be remedied over time and in a systematic way.  Secondly, it is important
to get on with the selection of sites which are suitable for waste disposal and, in doing so, to consult local population.  The experience of several
countries, including Sweden and France, shows that public acceptance is by no means unattainable provided that full information is given and the
potential benefits to local communities are clearly explained.  I note particularly the important and positive decision last December by the Swedish
Government on the SKB research development programme leading to the construction of a deep underground demonstration repository for the
disposal of spent fuel.  The third point I want to mention is that, despite the fact that there exist today fully satisfactory methods of managing and
disposing of all levels of radioactive waste, it is desirable that research and development continue.  Just as we may expect a new generation of power
reactors offering new and positive features, new methods of waste handling may emerge which may be less costly or, perhaps, shorten the time span
during which the wastes remain radioactive.
<P>The concept of "alternative energy" has been much in fashion.  We should coin the term "alternative waste".  Nuclear waste is an alternative to
the waste from burnt fossil fuels.  If wastes from burnt fossil fuels could be managed and disposed of as safely as waste from nuclear power, our
global environment would not be endangered.  It is waste from burnt coal, oil and gas - not waste from nuclear power plants - that causes acid rains
and greenhouse gases.  These wastes are so voluminous that they cannot be contained and buried.  Sites for the ultimate disposal of these wastes
are not selected.  Our atmosphere and the surface of our earth are the ultimate disposal sites of the wastes of burnt fossil fuels.  It is to be welcomed
that we have developed techniques through which we can - at a cost - remove most SO2 and NOx from the atmospheric emissions of coal and oil
burning.  For the huge CO2 emissions, however, there does not seem to exist any viable solution.
<P><B>Reduction in the nuclear weapons arsenals</B>
<P>After decades of nuclear arms races, the world is beginning to descend the arms spiral.  Russia and the United States have agreed to cut the
number of their nuclear warheads from some 65 000 together to around 3000 each.  Although even this number still represents a formidable
destructive potential, it points to a decisive turning of the tide and indicates that the nuclear-weapon States no longer consider nuclear armed conflicts
between themselves to be realistic.  The great powers appear to feel that they have no choice in this new era but to co-operate and to bridge
differences which inevitably arise.  Although the Security Council of the United Nations is not immune to paralysis through a veto, common action is
now routinely and sincerely sought and often achieved.  This, too, augurs well for the future.
<P>In this situation many new questions arise with a specific bearing on the nuclear sphere.
A current problem is the safe dismantling of redundant nuclear warheads and the associated issues of storing, managing and eventual use or
disposal of the plutonium and highly enriched uranium regarded as excess to defence requirements.  It must be verified that the material does not go
back to military use.  President Clinton has declared that the United States will place material recovered from nuclear weapons under the control of the
IAEA and we expect a considerable quantity of such material to be placed permanently under safeguards even this year.  While recovered enriched
uranium is expected to be transformed into low enriched uranium and made into fuel for light water reactors, there is still considerable discussion
about the future of recovered plutonium: whether it is to be used in special dedicated reactors, as MOX fuel in light water reactors, or mixed with
nuclear waste and disposed of as such.  In either case, international verification of peaceful use and disposal of such material will be more demanding
than simply verification of  storage.
<B>An agreement on a "cut-off"</B>
<P>With a growing surplus of plutonium and highly enriched uranium connected with nuclear weapons, it is not surprising that attention is now
being given to resuscitated proposals for a universal prohibition of the production of further fissionable material for use in weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices - a so-called cut-off.  Such a ban would prevent the dismantling of nuclear weapons being offset by any simultaneous production of
fissionable material for new weapons.  If universally accepted and not limited to the declared nuclear-weapon States, such a ban would additionally
cap any further production of fissionable material for weapons in the so-called threshold States, i.e. in India, Pakistan and Israel.  Verification of a
universally accepted cut-off would require extensive efforts, because reprocessing and enrichment plants and - perhaps - all other nuclear facilities in
declared nuclear-weapon States and in the three threshold States would have to be safeguarded.  It seems likely that such verification function would
be entrusted to the IAEA.
<B>A nuclear test ban treaty</B>
<P>A complete ban on nuclear testing is now being negotiated in Geneva.  Its conclusion and universal acceptance would give a further powerful
signal that the era of further nuclear weapon development is approaching an end.  It would also give a powerful boost to the non-proliferation treaty by
eliminating one inequality between non-nuclear weapon and nuclear- weapon States Party.
<B>The non-proliferation treaty</B>
<P>From the media and from some international public discussion, one might get the impression that as the world progresses toward nuclear
disarmament the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons to further States has paradoxically been growing.  The discovery that Iraq - an NPT State - was
pursuing a sizeable clandestine programme for the enrichment of uranium to use in nuclear weapons was a severe shock, raising questions of
whether there other clandestine programmes exist and whether guarantees can be created against such developments.
<P>Some new risks can, indeed, be identified but so too can a number of positive developments.  Let me first focus on the risks.  When the NPT
was concluded, the concern was that more industrialized countries might use nuclear energy for military purposes.  This has not happened.  Japan,
Sweden and other advanced industrial nations have not sought their security in nuclear weapons.  Today, however, more developing countries are
reaching a technological level that might enable them to make such weapons.  Iraq was secretly trying.  India, Pakistan and Israel - not parties to the
NPT - are deemed by most observers to have the capacity for the military use of nuclear energy.  At present, an ominous question mark is attached to
the DPRK which has adhered to the NPT but which - despite Security Council requests - is rejecting comprehensive and effective IAEA inspection.
<P>Another new concern about proliferation is linked to changes in and the break-up of the former Soviet Union.  Hopefully the risks identified will
be short-lived and not only Kazakhstan and Belarus but also Ukraine will join the NPT and will, with appropriate economic and security arrangements,
transfer any nuclear weapons on their territories to Russia.  With the active co-operation of these countries the IAEA is preparing for safeguards
implementation in all their nuclear facilities.
<P>Another risk is that nuclear material, know-how and experts might trickle to States or groups potentially interested in making nuclear weapons.
The response to this risk lies in strengthened regulatory control in the States of the former Soviet Union and in increased alertness against smuggling.
So far, none of the many instances of smuggling which have come to the IAEA's notice has involved nuclear material in types or quantities worrying
from the perspective of proliferation.  But there is no room for complacency.
<P>New risks of proliferation which I have described are counter-balanced by new commitments to non-proliferation.  Argentina and Brazil have
now opened their nuclear programmes to each other and to IAEA inspection.  If - as we now have reason to hope - Cuba joins the Tlatelolco Treaty,
the whole of Latin America could soon become a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.  In Africa, South Africa has become the first State in the world to roll
back from a nuclear weapon capability and to request the IAEA to observe that its weapons programme has, indeed, been terminated.  If, as recently
declared, Algeria adheres to the NPT, the way could soon be open to Africa becoming another nuclear-weapon-free continent.
<P>In the Middle East, the peace process offers some hope for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  Indeed, it is hard to see how
the peace process would be complete without a well verified nuclear-weapon-free zone or zone free of all weapons of mass destruction.  The IAEA
has been asked to help countries of the Middle East to explore the appropriate verification arrangements.
<P>A special arrangement involving India and Pakistan and several other countries may also be needed as part of the efforts to free the world
from military applications of nuclear energy.
<P>It is too early to speculate on the arrangements necessary for a world in which no single nation can threaten others with the use of nuclear
weapons.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Until the United Nations has developed as an effective security system - and we are far from that situation -
the five declared nuclear-weapon States are unlikely fully to abandon their nuclear weapon capability.  There is nevertheless much that can and
should be done now to promote non-proliferation.
<P>Above all, it is important that major States continue the policy of detente.  Since the end of the cold war tremendous progress has been
achieved but there are still areas of large scale or limited armed conflicts.  Because security interests or perceptions of such interests drive arms
races, including nuclear arms races, detente is the first barrier against nuclear proliferation.  In this respect, perhaps we can be optimistic.  We seem
to be in an age in which conflicts between States are resolved through negotiated settlements - whether about territory, economics or even human
rights.
<P>A second barrier against proliferation might consist - as we have learned from failure in the case of Iraq - in more effective controls over
exports of nuclear material and equipment.  A third barrier might be verification arrangements so effective that they would help to deter States from
any secret military uses of nuclear energy.  In this regard, too, experience in Iraq has helped us to make progress.  The safeguards system of the
IAEA has been strengthened considerably.  In the case of the DPRK it was the use of the latest techniques which enabled the IAEA to be able to
sound the alarm.  In that case, it is not detection and verification techniques that are in question but rather the means available for inducement and
enforcement.  Nevertheless, further consolidation and development must occur verifying the peaceful uses of nuclear energy under the Non-
Proliferation Treaty.  Greater national nuclear transparency vis-a-vis the safeguards system and full co-operation with that system could lead to even
higher levels of assurance that nuclear installations subject to safeguards are being used for exclusively peaceful purposes.  I am pleased to conclude
on the note that the IAEA and Swedish authorities are engaged in a large-scale trial of new - hopefully more effective and economic - approaches to
verification, building on new techniques, greater co-operation on the part of national authorities, short notice and no notice inspections and the
maximum levels of transparency in nuclear programmes.  As a Swede and as a Director General of the IAEA I am very glad to see my own country in
the vanguard, both in using nuclear power and in ensuring its exclusively peaceful use.<HR>

<TITLE>Nuclear Energy in the Post Cold War World</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Energy in the Post Cold War World</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR><P>
Fifth Annual Scientific and Technical Conference of the Nuclear Society<BR>"Nuclear Power and Industry"</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Obninsk, Russia</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER> 27 June 1994</H4>
<HR>
<P>For decades the world was dominated by the Cold War.  The armaments race resulted in the US and the Soviet Union together having some 65 000 nuclear warheads.  Questions like development, environment were regarded as “soft issues” - in contrast to the hard strategic issues.
<P>Today we live in a radically transformed world.  The enormous armories are beginning to shrink.  Our think tanks are no longer concentrating on how best to maintain the prospect of a mutually assured destruction, no longer contemplating the risk that nuclear weapons might put an end to human civilization.  This certainly is a liberation.  They can now focus on how to develop our economic, social, political and cultural systems.  How to combat unemployment and inflation, how to clean up our soiled environment, how to restrain population growth and how to make nearly two hundred sovereign States co-operate more effectively and live more safely together.
<P>The nuclear scientists, engineers and administrators are not concerned with all these issues, but they have an important role to play in the tremendous work that lies ahead to make our world safer and more liveable.
<P>The first and most obvious task is to devise ways in which the nuclear weapons can safely be reduced in number and eventually eliminated.  Very significant progress has already been registered in this regard, above all through the START-2 agreement which stipulates a reduction of US and Russian warheads to 3000 each by the year 2005.  While we are hoping for a START-3 to take this number further down, the nuclear community should accelerate its study and discussion of the best way to take care of the large volumes of plutonium and highly enriched uranium that are being recovered through the dismantlement of the warheads.  Although this is undoubtedly a complex question, the current debate sometimes seems to reflect a greater concern about the surplus fissile material than there was about the nuclear weapons from which it is being recovered.  This is misguided.  Dismantling of weapons raises problems, but the existence of nuclear weapons certainly raises greater problems.
<P>Before the excess nuclear material is peacefully used or disposed of, the storage and management of it must be such that the world is guaranteed that it does not go back into new and possibly more modern nuclear weapons.  I welcome President Yeltsin's and President Clinton's agreement in this regard and the declaration of President Clinton that the United States will place nuclear material recovered from weapons under the safeguards of the IAEA.  We expect considerable quantities of such material to be placed permanently under safeguards by the United States already this year.  The IAEA could undoubtedly perform the same safeguards service for nuclear material recovered from weapons in Russia, if this were requested.
<P>In a situation where tens of thousands of nuclear warheads are waiting to be dismantled, a prohibition of the production of further nuclear material for weapons seems natural.  It would not, of course, affect the enrichment of uranium or reprocessing of plutonium for fuel fabrication.  However, if a cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons were made universal, it would also put a cap on any further production of fissionable material for weapons in the so-called threshold States, i.e. in India, Pakistan and Israel.  Verification of a cut-off would be indispensable in order to create confidence that nuclear material is no longer produced for weapons.  Such verification would require an extensive effort as at least the world’s enrichment and reprocessing plants would have to be placed under safeguards and there would need to be assurance that there were no secret production facilities.
<P>Another measure that the world nuclear community must now help to bring about is a ban on all nuclear testing.  It is now the subject of serious negotiation in Geneva where the seismic and other methods of verification are being discussed intensely.  The conclusion and universal acceptance of a complete test ban would give a powerful signal that the era of nuclear weapons development is over.  It would also give a powerful boost to the Non-Proliferation Treaty by eliminating one inequality between its non-nuclear weapons States parties which cannot produce and test a nuclear device, and its nuclear-weapon States parties, which at present can do so.
<P>Next year the Non-Proliferation Treaty will be up for prolongation.  After the revelations in Iraq of a secret nuclear programme and the resistance by the DPRK to effective verification, there has been much concern about the possibility of clandestine nuclear programmes.  The cases of Iraq and the DPRK certainly point to the need for strengthening and development of the international verification system to minimize the risk of undiscovered secret programmes.  Such work  is underway in the IAEA.
<P>I must also report to you that there is some anxiety in the international community about risks of proliferation stemming from the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  While it is expected that Kazakstan, Belarus and Ukraine will all confirm their renunciation of nuclear weapons and finalize safeguards verification arrangements with the IAEA, there is currently concern about the effective control of nuclear material.  There have been many cases of smuggling of such material.  In most cases, the quantities have been insignificant and often the material has proved to be a health hazard rather than a real proliferation risk.  What raises concern, however, is that the control in the nuclear sector is not sufficiently tight to make it impossible for criminal elements to steal nuclear material.  I should like to appeal to the nuclear communities represented here to join in a vigilance against these dangerous activities.
<P>I don’t want to leave the subject of non-proliferation without mentioning also the important positive developments - which in my view dominate.  Argentina and Brazil have both opened the whole of their nuclear programmes to each other and to IAEA inspection.  If - as we have reason to hope - Cuba joins the Tlatelolco Treaty, the whole of Latin America could become a nuclear weapon-free zone.  In Africa, South Africa has become the first State in the world to roll back from a nuclear weapons capability and to request IAEA verification of the termination of its weapons programme.  If, as was recently declared, Algeria adheres to the NPT, the path would be open for Africa to become a second nuclear weapon-free continent.  The Middle East and the Indian subcontinent are the areas where special arrangements still need to be worked out.
<P>Let me conclude my brief comments on the nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda by asking whether we can hope to move toward a world free of nuclear weapons?  Today these weapons have come to be seen as increasingly obsolescent and irrelevant to the political and security concerns of the twenty-first century.  However, it will still be many years before the five declared nuclear-weapon States fully discard their arsenals.  It will require an international security system that is far more developed than the rudimentary system which we still have in the United Nations fifty years after its creation.  Still, we are moving in a hopeful direction.
<P>My message to you is that the community of nuclear scientists, engineers and administrators must help in the extensive efforts that are needed to rid the world of the monsters that proliferated during the long years of the Cold War.  This community has an even more obvious task to help place nuclear energy at the positive service of humanity - in medicine, in agriculture and in industry and power generation.
<P>Exactly forty years ago, on 27 June 1954, the world’s first nuclear power reactor began to operate here at Obninsk in Russia.  We pay our respects to this momentous event.  Today, nuclear power generates about as much as hydropower does.  This is a rapid expansion of a source of energy.  Yet we know that the expansion could have been even larger and that at present nuclear power is actually facing stagnation in most of the Western industrial countries, and is continuing its fast expansion only in the booming Far East.
<P>In my view a general revival of nuclear power is highly desirable for several reasons.  A number of Western industrialized States at present have a comfortable electricity balance, but all indications are that over time much more energy, especially electricity, will be needed - particularly in developing countries.  It is true that significant energy savings will be achieved through efficiency gains and possible changes in lifestyle.  This is already assumed in most energy scenarios.  Nevertheless, the latest OECD/IEA study indicates that the world electricity demand may increase by 75% until 2010.  The World Energy Council's study reference case, published last year, projects an average growth rate of electricity demand of 2.3% per year from 1990-2020.  Where is all this electricity to come from?
<P>It has to be better and more widely understood that fossil fuels and nuclear power are the main options which can be deployed broadly, since they have reached the stage of commercial deployment and economic competitiveness.  However, the limits to the expansion of fossil fuel use should not be overlooked.  Oil and gas resources, recoverable at acceptable costs, will last less than a century.  Coal burning is inducing environmental impacts that are progressively becoming unacceptable in most regions of the world.  Environmental concerns are calling for measures to reduce atmospheric pollutant emissions.  In this connection, a report issued two year ago by the Club of Rome stated that “the use of coal and oil is probably more dangerous to society, because of the carbon dioxide they produce, than nuclear energy.  There are therefore strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option and for the development of fast breeders ...”.  It was said after the Chernobyl disaster that an accident anywhere is an accident everywhere.  It was rightly added recently that CO2 emitted anywhere is CO2 emitted everywhere.
<P>Renewable energy sources are often presented as “the” solution to energy problems of tomorrow’s world.  I do share the view that efforts should be made to exploit renewable resources wherever they prove to be a viable option.  However, taking into account the present stage of development of solar energy systems, windmills and other renewable sources of energy, a major contribution by these sources to global energy and electricity supply is more than questionable in the short and medium term.  Moreover, these sources are not free from environmental impacts.
<P>Nuclear power alone will not solve the problems of secure and sustainable energy supply of the world.  But energy strategies aimed at sustainability and addressing concerns over greenhouse gases without use of nuclear power seem to me, and to a number of experts in energy system analysis, highly unrealistic.
<P>The challenge for the nuclear industry is to maintain and improve the technical and economic performance of nuclear power while enhancing even further its safety and environmental credentials.
<P>Natural uranium and thorium resources, technologies and industrial capabilities are available and could be developed further to support a broader deployment of nuclear power.  The economics of nuclear electricity generation make it an attractive option for base load electricity supply, especially in countries which have no access to cheap fossil fuels.  One should also be aware that the implementation of more stringent environmental regulations may increase the costs of fossil fuelled systems, while technological progress and feed back from experience are expected to lead to some decrease in the costs of electricity generation by nuclear power plants.
<P>Scientists and engineers are now designing and developing advanced reactors which will enhance the efficiency, reliability and safety of nuclear power plants and at the same time reduce costs.  New approaches which incorporate innovative features are drawing from more than 6000 reactor years of experience acquired through operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plants worldwide.  Substantial progress regarding in core fuel management and fuel design has already been achieved leading to a better utilization of the energy content of uranium as well as a reduction of the volume of spent fuel and radioactive waste to be disposed.  The evolution of nuclear fuel burnup shows an increasing trend and values around 20 to 50% higher than today’s average are expected by the turn of the century.  Although at present the low uranium prices are not providing incentives to the development of recycling nor of breeder reactors, these options still offer long-term perspectives which should be kept open.  The Russian, French and Japanese experience in the design and operation of breeder reactors may come to provide an important and welcome basis for the enhancement of their performance and commercial deployment.
<P>Nuclear waste management and disposal is one of the issues that is in great need of being better explained to the public.  Past carelessness about nuclear waste, especially in the military sector, whether in the former Soviet Union or the United States, must be dealt with in a decisive manner.  However, the negligence of the past must not be allowed to hide the fact that satisfactory methods of responsible disposal of nuclear waste are available today.
<P>Low and intermediate level radioactive wastes arising from nuclear electricity generation which amount to less than 800 tonnes per GW(e) and year after conditioning can be permanently disposed of in near surface or underground repositories which are already in operation in several countries.  High level wastes, which contain 99% of the radioactivity of wastes from nuclear power, amount, per GW(e) and year, to only some 30 tonnes of spent fuel or 3 cubic metres of conditioned waste after reprocessing.  While final repositories for these wastes have not yet been built, assessments based on simulation models, laboratory studies and in situ testing have shown the feasibility of their safe disposal.  Furthermore, decisions have been taken recently by some countries regarding the construction of such repositories early in the next century.
<P>There is often talk about "alternative energies".  I think it is time to talk about "alternative wastes".  The public must be made aware that the main alternative to nuclear waste is waste from burnt fossil fuel.  One should also be aware that the final disposal sites of burnt fossil fuel wastes are not deep geological formations but the surface of the earth and the atmosphere.
<P>Let me now turn to nuclear safety.  Ensuring the safe operation of present and future nuclear power plants everywhere in the world is a prerequisite for a general revival of the nuclear option.  Safe operation is the result of many different factors, e.g. technology, operational experience, regulatory supervision.  The main responsibility lies with the operators and national authorities.  However, international measures play an increasing role.  The IAEA also provides services to Member States, upon request, in assessing the safety of their nuclear facilities.  Many expert missions are sent every year around the world.  The operation of many reactors in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe has been the subject of such safety assessments organized by the IAEA - OSART and ASSET missions.  With co-operation from nuclear engineers and nuclear authorities in these countries, the Agency has also devoted considerable efforts to bring about impartial and authoritative international assessment of positive features and weaknesses in different reactor designs, like the various models of VVER and of the RBMK, and thereby to create a basis for subsequent work to upgrade their safety.
<P> While technological improvement will undoubtedly enhance even further the safety of nuclear power plants and fuel cycle facilities, the implementation of a global nuclear safety culture will be a key factor to ensure their safe operation, maintenance and decommissioning.  The adoption in Vienna, two weeks ago, of an international convention on the safety of nuclear power plants, under the auspices of the IAEA, will further the emergence of an international safety regime.  It is true that most nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities are located within the territories of States and accidents in them will chiefly affect host countries.  We know, however, that radioactive fall-out may cross borders and we have seen how opinion across the world is affected instantaneously by nuclear events anywhere.  Nuclear safety, although incontestably a national responsibility, is therefore becoming an increasingly important subject of international concern and co-operation.  I stress co-operation because there is no international regulatory body that is asked to license or withdraw licenses from power reactors, but there is increasingly international co-operation to analyse nuclear safety regardless of country and to provide advice and assistance.  The latest mechanism for this is the convention on the safety of nuclear power plants.
<P>Before I close I should also like to touch the question of liability for nuclear accidents.  Safety is closely related with protection against possible nuclear damage.  In the last few years, the question of nuclear liability has attracted increased attention, and the IAEA is actively involved in the work to improve the existing international liability regime, including the revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.  The Russian Federation is not a party to that Convention, but, as I know, is considering the possibility of adhering to it.  Work seems also to be underway in Russia to adopt national legislation regarding liability for nuclear damage.  Given the social and political significance of this matter, I hope it will be given adequate attention and priority.  International co-operation in this field is very welcome.
<P>I would like to conclude by encouraging the nuclear industry to pursue its efforts to enhance the good performance of nuclear power plants and fuel cycle facilities. The present obstacles to a general nuclear power revival should not be underestimated  In my view, however, the potential for a broader deployment of nuclear power justifies sustained programmes of research and development.  They should make us ready for a revival of the nuclear power option.  They should also help to trigger such revival.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>STATEMENT TO THE FORTY-EIGHTH SESSION<BR>
OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Dr. Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, 1 November 1993</H4>
<P>
<HR>
<p>
     Almost 40 years ago, in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in
December 1953, President Eisenhower launched the "Atoms for Peace" initiative.  One
feature of this proposal was the creation of an international agency to "devise methods
whereby ... fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of
mankind".  It is to the "Atoms for Peace" initiative that the IAEA owes its birth as well as
its mandate to seek to enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and
prosperity, while at the same time guarding against its use for military purposes.

<p>
     The twin challenges thus described remain, but in a radically changed world.  In my
statement to the General Assembly last year, I noted that we are at last moving into a world
in which fewer resources will be used for military purposes, including nuclear arsenals.
Even though many new and serious problems face mankind, for instance environmental
threats, we seem to stand on the threshold of an era in which "Atoms for Peace" can at last
achieve its full meaning:  an era in which many nuclear techniques may be disseminated
especially for the benefit of the developing world;  an era in which a wider use of nuclear
power may help to reduce some of the environmental threats to mankind;  an era in which
we may even begin to think seriously about how to organize a nuclear-weapon-free world.
Let me develop these themes.
<p>
<B>Nuclear Energy and Sustainable Development</B>
<p>
     The objective of sustainable development was endorsed by the Rio Conference on
Environment and Development, and outlined in Agenda 21.  Nuclear techniques have much
to contribute to this objective.  The IAEA, as the central intergovernmental mechanism in
the nuclear sphere, can play an important role not only in the areas of safe generation of
energy and the safe disposal of radioactive waste.  It can also facilitate the transfer of nuclear
techniques to promote health, to ensure greater availability of fresh water, and to secure
important data on the atmosphere and the seas.  The IAEA is the only organization in the UN
system operating its own laboratories which have research and analytical capabilities that can
be used - and are used - for environmental protection and sustainable development.  Thus,
our laboratory in Seibersdorf outside Vienna is helping institutes in Africa to use nuclear
techniques for conducting element analysis in air, water, soil and biological samples.  Our
Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco, inter alia, supports and helps marine
laboratories in developing countries by providing expertise and training.  This work forms
an integral part of UNEP's Oceans and Coastal Areas Programme.
<p>
     Agenda 21 recognizes that although energy is vital for growth, its generation and use
can be sources of environmental degradation.  The Agenda therefore, calls for the design and
implementation of environmentally sound energy strategies.  This task will not be an easy
one.  All forms of energy generation and use entail some risks to health and to the
environment.  We shall need to aim at a mix of energy sources and ways of using them that
minimize these risks.  In the context of the Framework Convention on Climate Change,
governments are now starting to make commitments to stabilize carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions which are linked to the use of all fossil fuels.  However, we are still far from
formulating national and international energy policies that take into account all implications
of various energy choices.  To start with, we need more hard data about these implications.
To obtain such data, the IAEA has for some years been engaged with other organizations in
a project on databases and methodologies for the comparative assessment of health and
environmental consequences of different ways of generating electricity.

<p>
     The IAEA also contributes towards the process in which the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) is assessing the potential of nuclear power for mitigating
greenhouse gas emissions.  It is worth noting that most of the scenarios for future energy
policies which lead to substantial reductions in global carbon dioxide emissions, contain a
significant component of nuclear power.
<p>
<B>Disposal of Radioactive Waste</B>
<p>
     Agenda 21 devotes a whole chapter to the environmentally sound management of
radioactive wastes, reflecting the importance which the international community attaches to
this issue.  Agenda 21 encourages support for the IAEA's activities in this regard, especially
in strengthening the capacity of developing countries in the field of sound nuclear waste
management.  Much is being done within the IAEA to promote safe disposal of nuclear
wastes:  e.g. information exchange, expert assistance, advice and services in specific cases
and work on establishing international norms.  While non-binding Radioactive Waste Safety
Standards already exist, work is expected before long on a binding convention on the Safe
Management and Disposal of Radioactive Wastes.
<p>
        Let me also mention in this connection that under the so-called London Dumping
Convention, the IAEA provides the technical basis for norms relating to disposal of
radioactive materials at sea.  A moratorium on such disposal was recommended in 1985 and
next month the contracting parties to the Convention will take a decision on whether to
replace this moratorium by a complete ban.
<p>
     As is well known, some sea disposal of radioactive waste has occurred despite the
recommended moratorium and has caused concern.  During 1992 and 1993 the IAEA took
various initiatives towards evaluating the potential impact and possible remedial action to the
radioactive waste dumping in the Kara and Barents Seas.  In co-operation with the
Governments of Russia and Norway the Agency took part, through its Monaco Marine
Laboratory, in the sea expeditions organized by these two countries.  Analysis of the
environmental samples collected to date indicate that the present levels of radioactivity in the
area of the dump sites are low.  As a follow-up, the Agency initiated the International Arctic
Seas Assessment Project to fully evaluate the possible health and environmental impacts of
radioactive wastes dumped in the shallow waters of the Arctic.  The IAEA has declared that
it is also ready to help assess the potential impact of the radioactive wastes dumped in the
North Pacific, including the Sea of Japan.  The latest of these dumping actions took place
very recently.  I turn now to safety in nuclear power.
<p>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<p>
     The efforts of the IAEA to develop not only recommendations but legally binding
safety standards for nuclear power plants have continued.  I am glad to report that there is
now a consensus about the structure and main contents of a Nuclear Safety Convention.  The
scope of the Convention would be limited to civil nuclear power reactors.  An important
feature would be an obligation of the parties to report, at agreed intervals, to a Meeting of
Contracting Parties on the national application of safety principles laid down in the
Convention.  This reporting would be linked to a system of international peer review.  It is
hoped that the Convention will be approved within the next year.
<p>
     The IAEA continues to assist in seeking to mitigate the consequences of the disaster
at Chernobyl in 1986.   It participates in the Inter-Agency Task Force established by the
United Nations and chaired by Under-Secretary-General Eliasson.  One very successful
project has been to give cattle in the areas affected by the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl
accident a compound called Prussian Blue which radically and safely reduces radio-caesium
contamination in meat and milk.  Also since the accident, and as a result of far-reaching
changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, major efforts are under way to
upgrade the safety of nuclear installations in this region.  Assistance is offered by the G-24
Group of OECD countries, by the Commission of the European Communities and by the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).  The IAEA focuses its assistance on
implementing consistent international safety assessments and on making recommendations
regarding the most urgently needed safety improvements.  Some improvements in the safety
of these facilities are now achieved as a result of the considerable work undertaken by all
concerned - mostly, of course, by the countries themselves in the region.
<p>
     In conjunction with the UNDP, the IAEA has further taken an initiative to strengthen
radiation protection and nuclear safety infrastructures in the States of the former Soviet
Union.
<p>
<B>Nuclear Disarmament and Non-Proliferation</B>
<p>
     I should now like to discuss how the IAEA can meet several new challenges which
it may be asked to take on in the fields of security in the post cold-war world.
<p>
     In his message to the 37th IAEA General Conference, the Secretary-General noted
that although the post cold-war world is in some respects a safer one, it is also considerably
more complicated.  There could be a development which eventually leads all nations to do
away with nuclear weapons;  but there are also some new risks for a development in the
opposite direction, i.e. a spread of these weapons to further countries.  The most important
measures to prevent horizontal proliferation lie in the fields of security policy - in the
creation of such international and regional relations that the incentive to acquire nuclear
weapons disappears.  It is further of crucial importance that each State's renunciation of
nuclear weapons is reliable.  If it is not so perceived, there may remain incentives for other
States to acquire such weapons.  It is to give the greatest possible assurance that nonproliferation 
commitments are respected and reliable that IAEA verification - safeguards -
is demanded and accepted by non-nuclear-weapon States.
<p>
     In a world of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, a world of fewer nuclear
weapons, there is a need to feel confident both that non-nuclear-weapon States are not
violating their non-proliferation commitments and that States legally committed to dismantling
nuclear weapons do not secretly produce new weapons.  The key to confidence-building is
full nuclear transparency.  IAEA safeguards, particularly when applied to a State's complete
nuclear fuel cycle, are an instrument to create such transparency.  Not surprisingly,
considering the political and security significance of the reliability of non-proliferation
commitments, some of the Agency's safeguards and verification activities have been at the
forefront of political and media attention during the past year.  I shall describe those
activities in a moment.  However, no rational assessment of the Agency's safeguards system
or activities is possible without a realistic understanding of what they can and cannot do.
<p>
<B>IAEA Safeguards System</B>
<p>
     Safeguards inspectors are not a supranational police force that can parachute into a
country and stop proliferation.  They are inspectors who verify the correctness and
completeness of State declarations about nuclear material and installations.  Their reports,
if reassuring, may create confidence and d‚tente.  If alarming, they may trigger action by
the international community.  Power to take collective action - diplomatic, economic or
military - is vested in the Security Council and it is to this body that, in accordance with its
Statute and its Relationship Agreement with the United Nations, the IAEA will have to turn
if its safeguards verifications point to acts of proliferation or if there is non-compliance with
safeguards obligations.
<p>
     The revelations about Iraq's undeclared nuclear activities highlighted the fact that in
practice safeguards activities had been limited to declared nuclear material and declared
installations.  Following the experience of Iraq, the international community looks for
assurance also about the non-existence of undeclared nuclear material and installations in
States which have comprehensive safeguards.  It looks to the IAEA safeguards to provide this
assurance - insofar as it is possible.  This has led to considerable efforts in the IAEA to
strengthen the Agency's capacity to detect nuclear material and installations which should
have been but were not declared.
<p>
     Inspectors cannot go in blind search of undeclared nuclear material and installations.
They must have information about where to go and what to ask.  The single, most important,
factor for building a capacity to find possibly existing non-declared material and installations
is for the Agency to have access to information.  Accordingly, measures are taken to
strengthen the Agency's information base, e.g. regarding exports and imports of nuclear
material and relevant equipment.  However, all available safeguards-relevant information
must be scrutinized and analysed critically.  There exists much erroneous information and
the Agency must seek to avoid false alarms.  It is obvious that the more thorough and
comprehensive the Agency's verification activities are, the more confidence and assurances
they can provide.  Fortunately, several new techniques and approaches are emerging, like
environmental monitoring, which may be used to give safeguards the greater detection
capacity now asked for.  These techniques and approaches will need to be tested, assessed
thoroughly and accepted, before they can be broadly used and relied on.
<p>
<B>Safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)</B>
<p>
     The central safeguards issue relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
is that the IAEA verification activities in the DPRK suggest that some nuclear material exists
there which has not been reported to the Agency.  Hence, the Agency cannot verify the
correctness and assess the completeness of the DPRK's report of material subject to
safeguards.  The Agency has not asserted that the DPRK is diverting nuclear material for
weapons development.  However, until such time as the inconsistency between the DPRK's
report and the Agency's findings is satisfactorily resolved through additional information and
visits to additional locations - the possibility that nuclear material has been diverted cannot
be excluded.
<p>
     One would expect that a government faced with questions relevant to safeguards
implementation would go out of its way promptly to provide the IAEA with clarification.
Regrettably, so far, the DPRK has instead been seeking to restrict IAEA safeguards
verification - reducing transparency.  Thus, the area of non-compliance with the
comprehensive safeguards agreement has been widening.
<p>
     As a result, a number of verification measures of the DPRK's declared nuclear
activities have become overdue, and continuity of some safeguards-relevant data has been
damaged.
<p>
     The longer the Agency is precluded from conducting inspection, the more safeguardsrelated 
data deteriorate, and the less assurance safeguards can provide that even the declared
facilities are used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  For its part, the Agency is ready to
conduct inspection of the nuclear installations and material which the DPRK has declared and
submitted to safeguards.  However, the inspection activities are an integral whole.  They are
not a set of activities from which an inspected State can pick and choose.  The Agency is
also ready to consult with the DPRK on all outstanding safeguards issues, including the
question of inspection of non-declared sites and additional information.
<p>
     Only the practice of full nuclear transparency, including full implementation of IAEA
safeguards, can create confidence that the DPRK's nuclear activities are devoted exclusively
to peaceful purposes.
<p>
<B>South Africa</B>
<p>
     When a State joining the safeguards system has many nuclear installations and much
nuclear material, it is always difficult to verify that everything has been declared.  However,
the Agency's activities in South Africa show that such difficulties can be successfully tackled
through sustained efforts by the IAEA and a high degree of co-operation and transparency
by the inspected party.  Since September 1991, when South Africa concluded its
comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, twenty-two IAEA safeguards missions
have visited South Africa.  Many apparent discrepancies and inconsistencies, which were
earlier identified, have been resolved.  No reason has been found to doubt the veracity of
South Africa's initial declaration.
<p>
     A new dimension was added when President de Klerk declared that South Africa had
developed a nuclear weapons capability but had destroyed it totally before acceding to the
NPT.  The Agency was invited to examine that the programme had, in fact, been terminated
and that all the nuclear material had been placed under safeguards.  A team of Agency staff
and nuclear weapons experts visited South Africa for these purposes in April, June and
August this year.  It found no indication casting doubt on South Africa's statement that all
the highly enriched uranium from weapons had been reported in its initial declaration.
<p>
<B>Iraq</B>
<p>
     For the last two and a half years the IAEA has devoted much effort to fulfil the
mandate laid down in Security Council resolution 687 relating to Iraq.  Some 21 inspection
missions sent by the IAEA and considerable staff work in Vienna have enabled us to
conclude that, in all essential aspects, Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme has
been mapped, and is either destroyed or neutralized.  Declared, non-irradiated highly
enriched uranium was removed from Iraq in November 1991 and a schedule has been
established for the removal of declared, irradiated highly enriched uranium.  When this
activity is complete, no highly enriched uranium and no capacity to produce it should remain
in Iraq.
<p>
     There are still some gaps in our knowledge about Iraq's nuclear supply and
procurement channels and about sources of scientific and technical information.  We hope
that, on the basis of documentation very recently made available by Iraq, the last pieces of
this picture will soon be clarified in a way which will contribute towards full and effective
long-term monitoring.  This will be essential to give assurance that Iraq does not seek to
reacquire proscribed nuclear capability.  In recent discussions in New York with the Iraqi
side, the IAEA and the UN Special Commission have clarified how ongoing monitoring and
verification is to be pursued.  Such monitoring will not, of course, preclude the Agency from
using the extensive rights of inspection in Iraq approved by the Security Council should it
need to do so.
<p>
     On the basis of preparations carried out over the last year, the Agency has phased in,
on a de facto basis, certain elements of its ongoing monitoring and verification plan provided
for in Security Council resolution 715(1991) - a mandatory resolution that is automatically
binding on all Member States. The approach which has been followed will allow the Agency
to move into full and formal implementation of the plan at an early stage and thus accelerate
the implementation of the Security Council resolutions, insofar as they relate to Iraq's nuclear
capacity.
<p>
     However, as I reported recently to the Security Council, before the IAEA can report
that, in its view, Iraq has complied with the requirements of paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of
Section C of resolution 687(1991), Iraq must formally acknowledge its obligations under
Security Council resolution 715(1991) and the plan approved thereunder, and the IAEA must
satisfy itself that it is in a position to fully implement the plan.  The IAEA equally must
verify to its satisfaction recent information provided by Iraq on suppliers.
<p>
     I will now touch on some areas in which we can be sure that IAEA safeguards
activities will expand and others where such expansion is possible.

<p>
<B>Argentina / Brazil / ABACC</B>
<p>
     A good example of mutual openness and confidence-building in nuclear activities has
been set by Argentina and Brazil.  Increasing co-operation in the nuclear sphere between the
two countries over the last decade culminated in 1991 in the Guadalajara Agreement on the
Exclusively Peaceful Utilization of Nuclear Energy.  This agreement was supplemented by
a quadripartite safeguards agreement which was signed in Vienna in December 1991,
between Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of
Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the IAEA.  Under this latter agreement, comprehensive
IAEA safeguards will be implemented in the two countries.  I am pleased to note that the
Argentine parliament approved the safeguards agreement last year and the Lower House of
the Brazilian Congress has recently approved it.  The application of comprehensive IAEA
safeguards will by no means raise any obstacles to peaceful nuclear development in the two
countries.  Rather it is likely to remove some obstacles to wider international co-operation.
It could also lead soon to the entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  Latin America
becoming effectively a nuclear-weapon-free zone would be a major event and would
strengthen nuclear non-proliferation efforts generally.
<p>
<B>Africa</B>
<p>
     I have already spoken about the Agency's verification activities in South Africa.  The
positive developments in South Africa may also lead to the conclusion of a treaty making the
whole African continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  The Agency is working closely with
the UN-OAU Group of Experts entrusted with the drafting of an African Nuclear-WeaponFree 
Zone Treaty.
<p>
<B>Middle East</B>
<p>
     In the Middle East, the peace process has passed a difficult hurdle.  If the process
accelerates, the prospect of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons
of mass destruction may increase.  Support of the Parties to the peace process for the concept
of such a zone is firm.
<p>
     Against the background of the many past conflicts and the deep distrust between the
parties in the Middle East, there is naturally much interest in considering how, and by what
means, effective verification of a nuclear-weapon-free zone can be achieved and how
guarantees can be created for early warning of any violations, should they occur.
<p>
     There appears to be a general understanding among the regional parties on the need
for comprehensive and far-reaching verification in a future nuclear-weapon-free zone.
Another important confidence-building measure would be the development of active cooperation 
between the parties, in the nuclear field, in an open and transparent manner.
<p>
     In pursuance of a mandate placed upon me by a resolution of the IAEA's General
Conference GC(XXXVI)/RES/601), I have been consulting States of the Middle East region
with a view inter alia to facilitating the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to
all nuclear activities in that region.  In a further resolution (GC(XXXVII)/RES/627), the
General Conference added the request that the Director General should provide whatever
assistance may be requested by the Parties in the Middle East in support of the multilateral
efforts of the peace process.  I shall certainly respond to any such request.
<p>
<B>New Roles for the IAEA</B>
<p>
     In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 27 September 1993,
President Clinton spoke about steps to control the materials needed for nuclear weapons
production, to address issues related to growing global stockpiles of plutonium and highly
enriched uranium, and steps to encourage all nuclear weapon States to refrain from nuclear
testing and, to begin negotiations towards a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
<p>
     In areas such as these, roles may be assigned to the IAEA which, whilst consistent
with its mandate, would go beyond its traditional safeguards functions.
<p>
<B>International Arrangements for Plutonium and Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU)</B>
<p>
     Current nuclear disarmament measures, as well as current reprocessing of spent
civilian nuclear fuel, will lead to substantial quantities of plutonium and highly enriched
uranium (HEU) - nuclear weapons useable materials - which will have to be safely and
securely stored before they are put to peaceful use or otherwise disposed of.
<p>
     Concerns about the safety and security of such materials might be alleviated by
devising specific confidence-building measures which States could enter into either
unilaterally or multilaterally.  The IAEA has initiated some preliminary work in seeking to
identify some of the problems and possible modalities for the management of plutonium
and HEU.
<p>
Verified Cut-Off of Production of Fissionable Material for Military Purposes
<p>
     A verified cut-off of the production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for
weapons or other explosive purposes has been under international discussion for many years.
However, the present international climate gives grounds for hope that discussion could lead
to an agreement involving all States on an equal basis.  Verification arrangements needed to
underpin such an agreement would entail great challenges, having necessarily to focus on the
largest and most complex of nuclear installations:  enrichment and reprocessing plants.
Methods and techniques of verification exist but might have to be further developed.  Should
IAEA safeguards be applied to the operation or dismantling of all installations capable of
producing weapons-useable material, the added workload of verification - and the resources
need for it - would be significant.  The value of a cut-off agreement would also be very
significant.
<p>
<B>A complete test-ban agreement</B>
<p>
     Among arms control measures now under discussion is an agreement on a complete
ban on any kind of nuclear explosive testing.  It has been suggested that the IAEA might be
given a central role in verifying compliance with such agreement, including the management
of an international data centre and the conduct of on-site inspection.  The Agency has some
experience and expertise in the field of seismic measurements, the main verification method
under consideration, as well as in other relevant areas.  I am confident that, with some added
capacity, the IAEA would be able to perform verification tasks under a test-ban treaty, if
entrusted with this task.
<p>
<B>NPT Conference 1995</B>
<p>
     The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995 will also mark the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The NPT continues
to provide a solid framework for global nuclear non-proliferation endeavours side by side
with the other multilateral treaties on the subject.
<p>
     In its Summit Statement of 31 January 1992, the Security Council, inter alia,
emphasized the integral role of effective IAEA safeguards in the implementation of the NonProliferation 
Treaty.  There is little doubt that the most important contributions which the
Agency can make to the NPT are to continue to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency and
credibility of the safeguards applied under the Treaty, to continue to facilitate the transfer of
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as prescribed by the Treaty and to effectively
extend safeguards to the new Parties to the Treaty.

<p>
     In anticipation of the adherence of States of the former Soviet Union to the NPT,
much preparatory work has been undertaken for the introduction of comprehensive safeguards
in these States.  Both individual Member States of the IAEA and the Secretariat of the IAEA
have helped to provide information and equipment to facilitate the establishment of effective
national systems of nuclear accountancy and control.  Actual implementation of safeguards
must, however, await the conclusion of formal safeguards agreements.  To date, only one
such agreement has come into force - with Lithuania.

<p>
     I should like to conclude with some brief comments relating to the Agency's finances,
programme and personnel.  The Agency's financial situation remains precarious.  Crises have
been avoided only because substantial shortfalls in budgetary contributions to our activities
have been met by a curtailment or deferment of some activities.  When resources are so
scarce, it is particularly important that they be used in a way which reflects the Agency's
dual functions in a balanced and equitable manner.

<p>
     The community of States must not, by default, lose out on this era of opportunity and
challenge.   The IAEA stands ready to perform a verification role in a number of vital arms
control and disarmament measures, which may now become possible.  However, the Agency
must be given adequate resources to perform new tasks.  Without such resources, limits will
inevitably be placed on its ability to match up to the high expectations which are placed upon
it.

<p>
     Finally, let me record that Austria is an excellent host to all the international
organizations which are located in Vienna and I should like to finish this statement by
expressing before this august Assembly the thanks of the IAEA to the Government of
Austria.

Statement to the Thirty-Seventh Session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency
</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>27 September 1993</H4>
<P>
<HR>
<p>
     Since the General Conference met in September 1992 many events and developments
have occurred which have called for or will call for action in the IAEA.  Some have even
focussed the world's attention on the Agency.  In South Africa we see the first case of a
State abandoning its nuclear-weapon status - giving in the process a number of important
verification tasks to the IAEA.  Latin America and Africa may soon emerge as nuclearweapon
-free continents.  In the Middle East, the peace process appears to accelerate, inter
alia increasing the prospect of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. The nuclear
disarmament process seems to gather momentum with possibilities for agreements on a
complete test ban and a cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons purposes,
and certainly a release of large quantities of nuclear material from dismantled nuclear
weapons.  Such developments would help to create a favourable climate for the 1995
Conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty. They would also focus attention on the IAEA
as a possible international mechanism for verification.


<p>
     There are also new problems such as the undoing of Iraq's near-nuclear-weapon
capacity; and the presence of nuclear weapons in some of the States of the former Soviet
Union and the ambiguous attitude of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the NPT
and to IAEA safeguards.

<p>
     In the field of the development of nuclear power the outlook is highly diverse.  Most
Western industrialized countries are still in recession and this factor, together with significant
and vocal opposition to new nuclear power in many Western countries, has lead to a
stagnation in nuclear power construction.  By contrast, in East Asia, with several booming
economies and rapidly growing electricity needs, nuclear power is fast expanding.  The
countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern and Central Europe, facing grim economic
realities, remain committed to nuclear power while at the same time working hard on
upgrading the safety in equipment, operations and infrastructures.

<p>
     The awareness is increasing that some of the world's most serious environmental
threats are linked to our massive and careless use of energy.  The present understanding that
global CO2 emissions will have to be reduced to avoid a greenhouse effect may be expected
to lead - in due course - to a renewed active global consideration of the CO2-free nuclear
power option.  The years before that discussion starts must be used to further strengthen
nuclear safety, both in reactors and in the handling of nuclear waste.  When the sceptics are
seriously prepared to look at the nuclear option again, some features which may have raised
doubts earlier should have been fully addressed.

<p>
     For developing countries, many of which do not yet have the capacity to use nuclear
power, various nuclear techniques offer great benefits - in the field of health care, agriculture
and industry.  These countries rightly maintain that there should be a balance in the IAEA,
between safeguards and regulatory activities on the one hand and activities which aim at
promoting the transfer and dissemination of nuclear techniques on the other.  In stressing the
promotional role of the IAEA they are on firm historical ground.  Very nearly 40 years ago,
in a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1953, President
Eisenhower proposed the creation of the Agency.  He said the following:
<P>
          "The more important responsibility of this atomic energy agency would be to
          devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve
          the peaceful pursuits of mankind.  Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic
          energy to the needs of agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities.  A
          special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-
          starved areas of the world.  Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating
          some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind."
<P>
It is on this lofty mandate that the technology transfer activities of the Agency are built.

<p>
     The limited but vocal opinion that is so resistent to nuclear energy that it urges the
IAEA to abandon its role in promoting, say, mutation plant breeding, or the use of radiation
in medicine or in industry, will not meet much understanding among governments who
continue to share the aims proclaimed by President Eisenhower.

<p>
     After this quick tour d'horizon, I shall begin with some comments on the Agency's
engagement in the transfer of nuclear techniques.

<p>
IAEA promotion of  nuclear techniques

<p>
     Many nuclear techniques provide highly cost-effective means for solving problems in
medicine, agriculture and industry.  The ability of the Agency to help transfer such
techniques to developing countries is dependent upon several factors:  above all upon the
resources contributed, but also upon the efficiency of the TC operations and the ability and
engagement of the recipient parties.  Although the main resource base - the Technical
Assistance and Co-operation Fund - has steadily grown, the substantial devaluations which
have occurred in non-convertible currencies and pledges below targets by a few industrialized
countries regrettably reduce the resources available.

<p>
     For a long time the RCA - the regional co-operation agreement for Asia - has been
a very constructive tool in the transfer of nuclear technology to the countries of Asia.
Similar benefits are sought in ARCAL (the arrangements on regional co-operation among
Latin American States) and in AFRA (the agreement on regional co-operation among African
States).  In such a specialized area as nuclear techniques positive effects that can be gained
through regional approaches.  However, they require a strong commitment by their members
and a flow of resources.  I am glad that a meeting of co-ordinators and managers of the
regional programmes will take place during the General Conference to discuss common
issues and collaboration.

<p>
     Training forms an important part in almost all transfer of nuclear techniques.  We
must express our appreciation to the many nuclear institutions and laboratories in both
industrial and developing countries which receive trainees in the most diverse fields.  I must
also point to the important training function of the IAEA laboratories in Seibersdorf and
Monaco.  I am glad to note that the Government of Monaco will provide the Marine
Environment Laboratory with new excellent premises next year.  This Laboratory, which will
then comprise a training centre, continuously provides important analytical control services
in the measurement of nuclear and non-nuclear environmental contamination.  In recent years
it has provided key assistance in the radiological assessment of radioactive waste dumping
in the Arctic Seas, evaluation of post-war environment recovery in the Persian Gulf and a
nuclear and conventional pollutant survey in the Danube river basin.

<p>
     A large volume of advanced and highly specialized training in physics has been
provided through the International Centre of Theoretical Physics at Trieste, for which the
Agency has had the administrative responsibility.  With increasing and very generous
contributions by Italy and the dynamic leadership of Professor Abdus Salam, the Trieste
Centre has been an intellectual North/South hub of great excellence.  As the subjects treated
have gradually extended far beyond the Agency's domains, it has been agreed that UNESCO
shall take over the day-to-day administrative responsibility.  However, the Agency can take
pride in having helped to create and develop the Centre.  The Agency will continue to
support it financially and to rely on it as an important training institution.

<p>
     Some new approaches are being followed to increase the effective use of the resources
available for the Agency's technical assistance:

<UL>
  <LI> First, we shall seek increased assurance that requests for assistance are based
          on national development priorities.  This can be done through intensified
          contacts with the Member States, e.g. through pre-project missions.  With a
          firm basis in national priorities the prospect of effective implementation
          increases;

  <LI> Second, we shall verify - already at the time of project design - that projects
          are consistent with the policy of sustainable development.  In fact, surveys of
          Agency programmes show that a very high proportion of them do contribute
          to sustainable development and environmental protection.  What has been done
          in the past as a matter of common  sense will become conscious policy;

  <LI> Third, we shall also, in accordance with the statutory requirement, require the
          application of the Agency's Basic Safety Standards to all TC projects;

  <LI> Fourth, and last, we shall develop some practical, end-user oriented projects,
          which will provide the recipients immediate benefits and may serve as models.
          Examples of such projects include the use of the sterile insect technique in
          tse tse fly eradication and the use of radiation sterilization for a human tissue
          bank.

</UL>
<p>
     Let me conclude my comments about the dissemination of nuclear techniques by
giving you a few concrete examples of what the Agency is doing.

<UL>
  <LI> One project has very successfully been using Prussian Blue boli to reduce
          radio-caesium contamination in meat and milk in areas affected by nuclear
          fallout in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.  It has been calculated that the use of
          $5000 worth of boli has resulted in savings of $30 million.  We appreciate
          Norway's funding and technical support for this project;

  <LI> Another project consists in a joint FAO/IAEA campaign to develop and
          support the use of nuclear and molecular-based technologies to diagnose
          rinderpest, which is a devastating disease of livestock.  Under this project our
          laboratory in  Seibersdorf sends diagnostic kits to the affected countries in
          Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  The economic benefits of the campaign can
          ultimately be counted in billions of dollars;

  <LI> Another project planned relates to the eradication of the tsetse fly in Zanzibar
          by using radiation sterilized insects.  The economic and social development
          of a large portion of sub-Saharan Africa is strongly hindered by both human
          sleeping sickness and African Animal Trypanosomiasis transmitted by tsetse
          flies.  Given financing, there is an opportunity to overcome this scourge on
          the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania. The project would build on the work of
          a number of years by Agency and FAO experts who have been working with
          Tanzanian scientists to develop methods for combatting tsetse and
          trypanosomiasis.  Progress has been so encouraging that we are preparing to
          launch a Model Project to completely eradicate tsetse from Zanzibar;

  <LI> In the field of industry, the Agency has helped several States to make use of
          irradiation techniques for the sterilization of medical products and to improve
          products by polymerization through irradiation;

  <LI> Our laboratory in Seibersdorf has assisted laboratories in Africa in using
          nuclear analytical techniques to undertake trace element analysis in air, water,
          soil and biological samples.  Through these techniques important information
          can be gained about the  movement of air pollutants.


  <LI> In Poland a very successful pilot project is conducted using ammonium and
          an electron beam to transform into fertilizer the SO2 and NOx contained in the
          flue gases of a coal plant.  The upgrading of the technique to industrial scale
          is now being studied.  Several countries have requested assistance in the
          transfer of this technology, which turns waste products from the burning of
          fossil fuels into a useful fertilizer;

  <LI> Lastly, a study has been made and a document prepared about the possibilities
          of using nuclear energy to produce potable water.  Several countries have
          contributed to this work, notably the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya which has made
          AS 600 000 and two experts available.

</UL>
<p>
<B>Nuclear Power</B>

<p>
     International co-operation in the area of nuclear power remains a large and important
function of the IAEA.  As we all know the continued and expanded reliance on nuclear
power is a controversial issue in most countries.  The IAEA - as an intergovernmental
organization consisting of many States making extensive and increasing use of nuclear power
and of others which reject this option  - is not seeking to persuade Member States collectively
or individually to use nuclear power.  Decisions in this regard fall altogether within the
national sphere of States.  Rather the work of the organization in this area is based on the
simple premise that nuclear power is in fact used in many countries, that other States
consider introducing it and that there is a need for factual information, for the exchange of
views and experience, for the harmonization of standards and for a variety of services,
especially in the field of nuclear safety.

<p>
     The organization compiles and distributes to its Members much information relevant
to the nuclear power industry, e.g. on uranium production, on the performance of the
world's nuclear power plants, etc.  For countries considering the nuclear power option, the
Agency can offer advice and expertise.  The recent publication "Policy Planning for Nuclear
Power" identifies some of the issues which such countries will need to consider.  The Agency
further convokes technical meetings to discuss matters like the burn-up of fuel with a view
to achieving optimal fuel economy.  It provides fora for the meeting of experts dealing with
the design and construction of various new types of power reactors.  However, most of the
work in the sphere of nuclear power is devoted to safety and waste handling.  I shall revert
to this in a moment.

<p>
     The long economic recession that many countries have been experiencing and the
continuous improvements in energy efficiency tend to make us ignore that the use of energy,
notably electricity, is expected to grow significantly over the next decades - especially in
developing countries but also globally.  Since energy production and use are one of the
principal causes of environmental threats, it is appropriate that Agenda 21 which was adopted
at the world summit on the environment in Rio last year, stressed the role of energy in
sustainable development and the need for designing and implementing environmentally
sound energy strategies.  It is safe to predict that this is going to be a difficult task.  All
energy generation and use carry some degree of risk to health and environment.  The fossil
fuels by far dominate the commercial energy sources and it is also with the use of these fuels
that the most ominous health and environmental impacts are connected, e.g. forests dying
from acid rains and global warming linked inter alia to carbon dioxide emissions.


<p>
     In its search for agreement to prevent or impede climate change and transfrontier
pollution the international community will need the best possible basis in science and data.
Blind opposition to the use of nuclear power must not prevent a factual and rational
examination and comparison of the data relating to this energy source with those of other
sources.  For several years the IAEA has been engaged in an inter-agency project on
databases and methodologies for comparative assessment of different energy sources for
electricity generation.  The main conclusions and findings should be ready for presentation
and discussion at a Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment in 1995.  While
no one, least of all in the IAEA, is forgetting the health and environmental consequences of
the Chernobyl accident, I am convinced that the absence of SO2 and NOx and especially CO2
emissions from nuclear power installations, will prove to be of great importance.  Today,
some 17% of the world's electricity is generated by nuclear power.  If expansion of CO2-free
energy generation becomes a vital objective, nuclear power could be used not only to
increase the production of electricity but also for industrial heat, desalination and district
heating.  Modern windmills and solar cells are welcome sources of energy but they are not
likely to provide the substantial amounts of power needed to meet the growing needs of
industrial development in the decades to come.

<p>
     We cannot know today what conclusions will emerge from the impending discussion
of energy and environment.  What is fortunately clear, however, is that the programme of
the IAEA can build on a consensus that whatever future role will be given to nuclear power,
efforts must be made today to achieve globally a fully responsible disposal of radioactive
waste and a strengthening of nuclear safety, especially in those areas where weaknesses have
been found.

<p>
<B>The management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste</B>
<p>
     The IAEA activities relating to spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste consist of
information exchange, expert assistance, advice and services in specific cases, but also of
work on establishing international norms.
<p>
     The Agency's engagement in the question of the dumping of radioactive wastes at sea
combine the two types of activities.  Under the London Convention the Agency provides the
technical basis for establishing norms relating to disposal of radioactive materials at sea.  In
the areas of provision of advice and services, the IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory has
supported both the 1992 and the 1993 Kara Sea expeditions organized by Russia and Norway.
In co-operation with the Governments of these two States and as a part of the IAEA's
responsibilities under the London Convention, the Agency initiated the International Arctic
Seas Project to assess the possible health and environmental impacts of the radioactive wastes
dumped in the shallow waters of the Arctic.  Samples collected in 1992 and analysed at
Monaco have shown no evidence of increased activity.  However, a considerable amount of
information is needed before a reliable assessment of the potential impact of the dumping can
be made.  The IAEA is also exploring ways in which it could be of assistance in examining
the dumping of radioactive wastes in the North Pacific, including the Sea of Japan.  Here,
fortunately, the quantities dumped appear to have been much smaller than in the Arctic.

<p>
     Due to the increasing number of reactors in operation around the world, the amount
of spent fuel to be stored is continuously growing.  To disseminate information about new
technologies and good operating practices in this field, the Agency has initiated an advisory
programme for the management of irradiated fuel (IFMAP).  We are also engaged in the
preparation of Safety Guides dealing with the Design and Operation of Spent Fuel Storage
Facilities.  These are expected to be ready for publication in 1994.

<p>
     The Agency is further continuing the programme to develop Radioactive Waste Safety
Standards - RADWASS.  Twelve high-priority documents are being prepared under this
programme, including the RADWASS Safety Fundamentals which was sent to Member States
for review in July and may be submitted to the Board of Governors in 1994.  It is hoped that
these documents, when approved, may serve as a basis for a Convention on the Safe
Management of Radioactive Wastes - paralleling the Convention now being drafted on
Nuclear Safety.  The voluntary contributions made by the Republic of Korea to these
activities are of great help.

<p>
Nuclear Safety

<p>
     Much effort has been devoted to nuclear safety in the past year - in the domestic
spheres as in the international sphere.  I welcome among the participants at the General
Conference many heads of national governmental nuclear safety supervisory organs.  They
will meet with a separate agenda during the Conference.  It is of great importance that there
should be consistency between the safety policies applied around the world.  Meetings
between national regulators promote such consistency.  I also welcome the presence here
today of  Mr. R‚my Carle, the Chairman of the World Association of Nuclear Operators
(WANO), which plays an increasingly important role to help nuclear operators to strengthen
safety by learning directly from each other.


<p>
     As in the field of nuclear waste, the IAEA's activities in nuclear safety are geared
both to information collection and analysis, advice and services in specific situations and to
the development of norms.

<p>
     For many years the Agency has sought to obtain authoritative and accurate open
reports about serious nuclear events.  A  case in point was the accident in April this year at
the Tomsk-7 nuclear centre in Siberia.  Less than 24 hours after the Agency had received the
invitation, three experts left for Siberia to seek first-hand information about the radiological
effects of the accident and their consequences for the population and the environment.  I cite
this case, not to report on the results of the inquiry, which were made available to interested
States, but rather to stress the ambition for openness and for ways of strengthening safety by
learning from significant nuclear events.

<p>
     Major efforts are being made by authorities and experts in the former Soviet Union
and in East and Central European countries to upgrade the safety in nuclear installations.
Assistance from other countries and from the G-24 Group of OECD countries and the
Commission of the European Communities, as well as from WANO has been and remains
important.  The activities of the Agency, which have received considerable financial support
by Japan, have focussed on implementation of consistent international safety assessments of
various Soviet-designed nuclear power plants and elaboration of recommendations for
upgrading their level of safety.  Everything has not always worked smoothly and
expeditiously in this great endeavour, but I think it is true to say that all the work has been
imbued with a sincere wish to bring all the installations concerned - if at all possible - to an
acceptable modern safety standard.  And, although the work is still in full swing, it can be
said that significant improvements in safety have already been accomplished.

<p>
     One specific area in which the IAEA together with the UNDP has taken an initiative
relates to the strengthening of radiation protection and nuclear safety infrastructures in the
States of the former Soviet Union.  This is of relevance especially for safety in research
reactors, uranium mining and milling and facilities using radiation sources in medicine,
agriculture and industry.  The first phase of this project - an information exchange forum -
was successfully undertaken in Vienna from 4 to 7 May this year.  In a second and third
phase assistance packages will be prepared and implemented for individual countries.  The
Soviet Union certainly possessed an impressive capacity in the field of radiation protection.
As this centralized system has been broken up, the individual States must now acquire their
own capacity - individually or preferably in co-operation with each other.  The project we
have launched seeks to assist and facilitate such development.

<p>
     Let me report also about the work on two international conventions - one on Nuclear
Safety, the other on Liability.

<p>
The Nuclear Safety Convention

<p>
     A consensus about the structure and main contents of a Nuclear Safety Convention
has emerged in an open-ended working group of legal and technical experts and the
Chairman of the Group, Mr. Domaratzki, has now prepared a single text as a basis for
discussion at the next meeting in October.  The Convention would be limited in its scope to
civil nuclear power reactors.  It would oblige the parties to comply with fundamental safety
principles which are developed from the nuclear safety fundamentals approved by the Board
last June.  An important feature would be an obligation of the parties to report at agreed
intervals to a Meeting of Contracting Parties on the national application of the principles laid
down in the Convention.  The reporting would be linked to a system of international peer
review.  The Agency might be asked to assist the parties in the review process and to
function as the Secretariat of the Convention.

<p>
     It is gratifying that the discussions seem to be heading to concrete results.  If progress
is maintained a draft convention might be available to the Board of Governors in February
and could be considered and approved by a diplomatic conference to be held in conjunction
with next year's General Conference - or earlier as a separate event.

<p>
Nuclear Liability<BR>
     The Vienna Convention on Nuclear Liability and the Joint Protocol that links it with
the Paris Convention are important parts of the international legal infrastructure that is
needed for the operation and acceptance of nuclear power.  Indeed, it has been found in the
past year or so that adherence by countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
would remove some obstacles which exist in the international co-operation to upgrade nuclear
safety in these regions.  I am glad to report that the negotiation of possible amendments to
the Vienna Convention has advanced considerably.  Mutual concessions are needed, however,
to settle the issue of supplementary compensation.  In the light of the outcome of the
consultations on this issue, a new target date for a diplomatic conference will be considered
in October.

<p>
<B>Safeguards and non-proliferation</B>
<p>
     The safeguards and verification activities of the IAEA have often been at the centre
of political and media attention in the past year.
<p>
     In the case of Iraq, some 21 inspection missions sent by the IAEA and considerable
staff work in Vienna allow us to conclude that in all essential aspects, the nuclear weapon
programme is mapped and has been destroyed through the war or neutralized thereafter.  The
declared non-irradiated highly enriched uranium was removed from Iraq in November 1991
and the declared irradiated highly enriched uranium is now scheduled for removal from the
country in the course of the next five months.  Upon completion of this operation no highly
enriched uranium and no capacity to produce it should remain in Iraq.

<p>
     There are still some disturbing gaps in our knowledge about the nuclear supply and
procurement channels of Iraq and about the sources of scientific and technical information.
We hope that these last pieces of the picture will soon be clarified by the Iraqi side, which
is anxious that the IAEA and UNSCOM should conclude that Iraq has complied with the
requirements of UNSC resolution 687.

<p>
     The Agency has already phased in some of the elements required for the long-term
monitoring in Iraq, including arrangements for environmental sampling.  In recent
discussions in New York with the Iraqi side, the Agency and UNSCOM have clarified how
ongoing monitoring and verification will be pursued.  Such monitoring will not, of course,
preclude the Agency from utilizing, should it be needed, the extensive rights of inspection
which are laid down in the plan approved by the Security Council.

<p>
     My last points relating to the Agency's work in Iraq are the following:  first, the
extensive work of inspection and analysis of the Iraqi nuclear programme has been performed
in the Agency by an Action Team that never comprised more than five full-time professionals
and two very capable secretaries in Vienna.  For the inspections and much of the analysis,
we have been able to draw on the resources of our Safeguards Department, and at our
Seibersdorf Laboratories and on our chain of support laboratories in Member States.  For
some types of inspection expertise we have obtained specialized personnel from Member
States.  As international organizations are often criticized for lack of effectiveness and
efficiency, I think both the fulfilment of the IAEA's mandate in Iraq and the cost-effective
manner in which it was carried out, should be noted.  Second, the operations in Iraq have
given the Agency vast experience with new techniques which may be of great value as we
proceed to strengthen the capability of the safeguards system to detect undeclared material
and installations.
<p>
     The revelations in Iraq highlighted the fact that normal safeguards inspections are
focussed on declared nuclear material and declared installations and led to efforts to
strengthen the capability of the Agency to discover material and installations which should
have been declared but were not.  I shall soon discuss these efforts.  At this point, however,
I should like to point out that the discovery of a non-declared nuclear programme in a
country having comprehensive safeguards has led the Secretariat to add further precision to
certain important conclusions which it draws from the safeguards activities.  Thus in the
Safeguards Implementation Report for 1992 you will find the following formulation, I quote
<P>
     "On the basis of all the information available to the Agency, it is considered
     reasonable to conclude that nuclear material and other items which had been placed
     under Agency safeguards remained in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise
     adequately accounted for."
<p>
     This statement is deliberately limited to declared nuclear material and other items.
Even so it is qualified by a footnote recalling that the safeguards system is not so finemeshed 
that there is a high probability for it to detect diversions of less than a significant
quantity.  These circumspect formulations may appear pedantic, but I think it is important
that the Agency not offer more reassurance than can in practice be obtained from the
safeguards system.  However desirable it would be to have a flat affirmation that no nondeclared 
nuclear installations exist in a country with comprehensive safeguards, such
categorical formulations cannot be made on the basis of the results of our verification
activities.  All that can be done is to report on the results of the inspection and analysis effort
to verify the correctness and assess the completeness of State declarations, to point to
evidence which supports or undermines the veracity of the declarations and to note the
presence or the absence of any evidence casting doubt on the credibility of the declarations.
Even in the case of Iraq, where the Agency has had exceptional means of investigation and
rights of access, the task of assessing the absence of further non-declared nuclear items is
difficult.  Where the Agency operates under normal NPT-type safeguards rights, the task of
assessing the completeness of a declaration is still more difficult.  The transparency of the
nuclear programme and the co-operation offered are decisive factors for the fulfilment of this
task.  Strengthening the Agency's ability to give a higher degree of assurance of the absence
of non-declared items, must necessarily build on great openness by the inspected country.
Current discussions about strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards
system focus on these factors.

<p>
<B>South Africa</B>
<p>
     Since the conclusion, in September 1991, of the safeguards agreement between South
Africa and the Agency, pursuant to the NPT, the Agency has been engaged in activities to
implement the agreement and verify the completeness and assess the correctness of South
Africa's Initial Report.  As you will see from the report in document GC(XXXVII)/1075,
no less than twenty-two missions have been carried out in South Africa over the past two
years.  It is only fair to report that the Agency has encountered a highly co-operative attitude
on the part of the South African authorities.  With time, effort and co-operation our
inspectors have been able to resolve many apparent discrepancies and inconsistencies which
they had identified.  As stated in the report, the apparent discrepancies relating to low
enriched uranium - which were accorded lower priority - remain to be clarified and will call
for continued efforts.  No evidence has been found casting doubt on the veracity of the initial
declaration.
<p>
     A new dimension was added to the Agency's work in South Africa when, in March
1993, President de Klerk declared that South Africa had developed a nuclear weapons
capability, and that the weapons had been dismantled and destroyed before South Africa
joined the NPT and that the figures referring to the resulting quantity of recovered highly
enriched uranium had been included in the Initial Report submitted to the Agency.
<p>
     The Agency was invited by South Africa to examine all the facilities that had been
involved in South Africa's nuclear weapons programme, to inspect all remaining records, to
observe that the programme had, in fact, been terminated and to gain assurance that all the
nuclear material involved had been placed under safeguards.  A team of senior Agency staff
and nuclear weapon experts visited South Africa in April, June and August for these
purposes.  Their report is found in GC(XXXVII)/1075.  The team saw substantial evidence
of the destruction of equipment used in the development and making of the nuclear weapons
and of the termination of the programme.  It found no indications to contradict South
Africa's statement that all the highly enriched uranium from weapons was reported in the
Initial Declaration.  Nevertheless the Agency plans to utilize the standing invitation of the
South African Government - under its reiterated policy of transparency - to provide the
Agency with full access to any location or facility associated with the former nuclear
weapons programme to satisfy itself, on a continuing basis, that they are now dedicated to
commercial non-nuclear usage or to peaceful nuclear usage, and to request access, on a caseby
-case basis, to other locations or facilities that the Agency may wish to visit.
<p>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>
<p>
     I do not propose to give a chronological report about IAEA safeguards in the DPRK
since the 1992 session of the General Conference.  A fairly detailed paper is available in
document GC(XXXVII)/1084.
<p>
     The most important problem encountered is that the Agency's analysis of samples
obtained from the DPRK suggests that some nuclear material exists that is not reported in
the Initial Report.  Hence the Agency is not in a position to verify the correctness and assess
the completeness of that Report.  The Agency has not asserted that the DPRK is diverting
nuclear material for weapons development, but so long as the inconsistency between the
report of the DPRK and our findings is not resolved by credible explanations through
additional information and visits to additional locations, the Agency cannot exclude that the
nuclear material has been diverted.
<p>
     A Government which states that it is committed to non-proliferation and which is
faced with questions by the Agency about the completeness of its declaration should have
strong reasons to show maximum openness in order to clarify the matter as speedily as
possible.  I regret that the initial attitude of the DPRK to allow Agency officials to visit any
place at any time did not prevail and that we were constrained eventually to ask formally for
additional information and for special inspection of two sites which, we have reason to
believe, are related to nuclear waste and which might shed some light on the inconsistencies
we have found.
<p>
     Full nuclear transparency is a means of creating confidence and comprehensive IAEA
safeguards are a mechanism to create this transparency.  Without a State's effective cooperation 
fully to implement its obligations under a comprehensive safeguards agreement, the
results of the verification activities will be inadequate and they cannot create confidence.
This is the background of the resolutions of the Agency's Board of Governors and of the
Security Council urging the DPRK fully to co-operate with the Agency.  Regrettably the
readiness of the DPRK to implement the safeguards agreement appears to have diminished
rather than grown.  While last spring we were assured there was never any obstacle to ad
hoc and routine inspections, such inspections have now been declined and the DPRK
expresses only readiness to accept limited safeguards activities, mainly for maintenance.
Thus, the area of non-compliance with the comprehensive safeguards agreement is widening.
<p>
     There was earlier uncertainty as regards the possible existence of non-declared nuclear
material.  If effective inspection of declared nuclear material and installations cannot be
performed, no further assurance can be given about their exclusively peaceful use.  Only the
implementation of systematic, effective and timely safeguards can give such assurance.
Whenever the DPRK is ready to accept such inspection the Agency is ready to provide it.
The Secretariat of the IAEA is also ready at any time to consult with the DPRK about ways
to resolve the inconsistencies which have been found.
<p>
     The DPRK has resented the insistence with which the Agency is seeking explanations
for the inconsistencies it has found.  It is suggesting token safeguards measures.  I think that
on reflection everyone would agree that all countries, including the DPRK, need to be sure
that the Agency will display all the diligence allowed to it and required of it under the
safeguards agreements fully to implement these agreements and that the Agency will pursue
any discrepancies or inconsistencies it may find.  Confidence in the Agency and its
safeguards verification will require that we live up to this demand.
<p>
<B>Strengthening of safeguards</B>
<p>
     As I turn to our efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the safeguards system, while
keeping costs low, I would like to start by pointing out that there is sometimes a tendency
in the public debate to expect from safeguards more than they can conceivably achieve.  The
development over the last few decades of the safeguards system is a valuable contribution to
the arms control efforts and the system is potentially of important use beyond its present
applications.  We must, however, have a realistic understanding of what it can do and what
it cannot do.
<p>
     The safeguards inspectors are not a supranational police that can parachute anywhere
and stop violations of non-proliferation commitments.  They are not an executive force, but
inspectors who report observations which, if they are reassuring, may create confidence and
detente, and if they are alarming, may trigger action - in the last resort by the Security
Council and its members.  Inspection is accepted by States only on the basis of explicit
safeguards agreements which are entered into voluntarily.  The present model rules embodied
in INFCIRC/153 and 66 reflect a balance between the interest that States have collectively
in credible inspection and the interests they have individually in not being subjected to
excessively intrusive or cumbersome international control.  While such a balance will always
be required - and is, of course, found also in the recent Chemical Weapons Convention -
there is room for measures which will strengthen the effectiveness of the present safeguards
system and we seek to introduce such measures.
<p>
     In the past few years the Board has repeatedly examined different ways of improving
the effectiveness of safeguards while keeping the costs low.  Much has been attained but
considerable challenges lie ahead of us.  Action has been taken inter alia to allow the Agency
to receive design information concerning nuclear installations earlier than before.  States may
also give information about export and import and production of nuclear material and
relevant equipment.  The Secretariat will seek to extract more pertinent information from
data already available to it and will look to other sources, like public media, for relevant
facts.  While, in my view, the Secretariat should be keen to obtain all safeguards relevant
information, it must subject this information to critical analysis to avoid relying on erroneous
data or disinformation.
<p>
     As it is very much in the interest of Member States that the safeguards system should
be strengthened, notably to give greater assurance against the existence of nuclear
installations which should have been declared and which were not, I hope Member States will
positively follow up and give effect to the actions of the Board, e.g. by agreeing to
modifications in subsidiary arrangements and by providing safeguards relevant information.
<p>
     Simultaneously with the efforts to make the safeguards system more effective, efforts
have been made and are being made to deploy our resources in such a way as to avoid, if
possible, that the considerable increases in the number of nuclear installations and amounts
of nuclear material to be safeguarded lead to cost increases.  These efforts have been
intensified lately, but they are not new.  Indeed, over the eight-year period of zero-realgrowth 
budgets the cost of safeguarding nuclear material - per significant quantity - has been
cut in half.  The agreement reached in 1992 with the European Community on partnership
in the performance of safeguards in the community has meant a very significant saving of
resources precisely at the time when it was acutely needed, e.g. for safeguards in South
Africa and the DPRK.
<p>
     We hope current discussions in the Secretariat and in the Standing Advisory Group
on Safeguards Implementation on so-called alternative safeguards approaches may lead
eventually to both cost savings and greater confidence about the absence of undeclared
nuclear facilities and activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements.
However, we are not there yet.  And it is clear that several of these cost-saving approaches
will require a greater measure of transparency and co-operation by Members.  Several new
methods and approaches, including environmental monitoring, also need to be thoroughly
tested and assessed before they can be generally used.  A few States have offered to test
environmental monitoring and various methods to increase nuclear transparency.  This is
valuable.  Indeed, it would be useful if a small but representative group of both industrialized
and developing countries were to take part in the testing of the new approaches and methods.
I invite further States to join in these efforts.
<p>
     Let me now deal specifically with some areas in which we can be sure there will be
an expansion of safeguards activities and some others where such expansion is a possibility.

<p>
<B>Argentina-Brazil-ABACC</B>
<p>
     A very important development started several years ago when Argentina and Brazil
decided to embark on extensive bilateral nuclear co-operation.  The dividends that can be
expected of such co-operation are not only in the area of economics and scientific and
technical development, but also in mutual confidence.  With the bilateral openness
broadening to an international transparency through acceptance of comprehensive IAEA
safeguards the path was opened to ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty as recently amended.
If, as seems to be expected, Cuba were to join the Tlatelolco Treaty, that Treaty would enter
fully into force and Latin America would have formally and legally renounced nuclear
weapons and nuclear explosives.
<p>
     An important milestone was the signature in Vienna in December 1991 of a
quadripartite safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine
Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the IAEA.  The
Argentine Parliament approved the agreement last year and we welcome that the lower house
of the Brazilian Congress approved it last week - together with the amendments to the
Tlatelolco Treaty.
<p>
     Meanwhile discussions have taken place among the four parties about the
implementation approach, including the verification of the Initial Report and about the
subsidiary arrangements.  The co-operation with Argentina, Brazil and ABACC has been
intense and fruitful, with visits to the IAEA and seminars and training of operation and
inspection staff.  I myself and the Deputy Director General for Safeguards, Mr. Pellaud,
visited Brasilia and Rio last month to discuss principal points in the future safeguards
arrangements with Ministers and with the Argentine-Brazilian leadership of ABACC.  A
strong and effective ABACC will facilitate the Agency's task of performing comprehensive
safeguards and of reaching independent conclusions.  Even so the safeguarding of the broad
and advanced nuclear programmes of these two large States will place added demands on the
Agency resources.  I have assured the representatives of the two countries that far from
hampering nuclear scientific and technical development, comprehensive IAEA safeguards are
likely to facilitate such development by removing some obstacles to international cooperation.  
Extensive talks have taken place in Rio de Janeiro recently on the subsidiary
arrangements to the quadripartite agreement, and I am pleased to tell you that not many
points remain to be resolved.
<p>
<B>Safeguards in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union</B>
<p>
     In anticipation of their adherence to the NPT, a great deal of preparatory work has
been undertaken for the introduction of comprehensive safeguards in States of the former
Soviet Union.  It is of central importance, of course, that effective national systems of
nuclear accountancy and control be established and be compatible with the Agency's
safeguards system.  Both individual Member States and the Agency's Secretariat have helped
to provide information and equipment and to organize seminars on these matters.  A coordinated 
support programme for the newly independent States with substantial nuclear
programmes is currently being developed, with IAEA participation.  Fact-finding missions
and technical visits have allowed Agency staff to familiarize themselves with the nuclear
installations which are expected to come under safeguards.  Actual implementation of
safeguards must, however, await the conclusion of formal safeguards agreements.  To date
only one such agreement has come into force -  with Lithuania.

<p>
     It is obvious that the introduction of comprehensive safeguards in these countries will
give a considerable amount of additional work to the IAEA.

<p>
     I turn now to potential uses of IAEA experience and resources for verification of the
peaceful use of nuclear material and installations.

<p>
The application of safeguards in a future nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East

<p>
     There is no way of knowing when the parties to the present peace negotiations in the
Middle East will be able to agree on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  There
is, however, a keen interest in the region in examining appropriate modalities of applying
safeguards verification in such a zone and I have been charged under GC(XXXVI)/RES/601
to continue consultations to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency safeguards
to all nuclear activities in the region.

<p>
     As you will see from the Report which I have submitted - GC(XXXVII)/1072 - I have
continued my consultations with States in the region during the past year by requesting their
written comments and by personally visiting some States - Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

<p>
     With a view to familiarizing relevant experts from the Middle East with the many
questions of effective verification of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, the Agency also arranged
a Workshop from 4 to 7 May on "The Modalities for the Application of Safeguards in a
Future Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East".  The lectures given in this workshop
are now compiled into a compendium in order for it to reach a broader audience.

<p>
     As I have stated in the report, it is clear that the long-standing tension between parties
in the region can be dissipated only through the combined effects of many different types of
measures including political and military confidence building.  The nuclear activities of each
party will be the subject of interest of all parties and the climate of confidence will be
affected by the way in which these activities are pursued and verified.  Legally binding
commitments by every party for an elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and for
the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy, will be vital elements.  In addition, ways
must be found in which reasonable guarantees can be created for reliance on such
commitments and for the early discovery of departures from them should such occur.  This
is where an effective verification system comes in.  It should also not be ignored that there
is some experience in the world - notably among European countries and between Argentina
and Brazil - pointing to the usefulness of active co-operation between parties in the nuclear
field to create confidence through both openness and interdependence.

<p>
     Recent developments in the peace process in the Middle East provide hope that the
positive attitude among all the parties in the Middle East to a nuclear-weapon-free zone could
be translated by them in due course into an agreement.  The Agency's Secretariat remains
ready to provide whatever assistance may be deemed useful by the parties in the Middle East
to facilitate implementation of the resolution adopted by the General Conference.  The
Secretary-General of the United Nations has recently stressed the importance of assistance
by the UN system in connection with the accord between Israel and the PLO.  Regional cooperation 
projects involving nuclear techniques might be a useful instrument for confidence
building.


<p>
<B>An International Regime for the Management of Plutonium and HEU</B>
<p>
     Article XII:A:5 of the Agency's Statute contains provisions about "the deposit with
the Agency of any excess of any special fissionable materials ...".  It is evident that the
current process of nuclear disarmament in the US and Russia, as well as the ongoing
reprocessing of spent civilian nuclear fuel, will lead to substantial quantities of plutonium and
high enriched uranium which have to be stored before they are used or otherwise disposed
of.  There is a clear international interest that such storage take place under conditions of
adequate physical security, nuclear safety and - not least - under conditions which provide
a very high degree of assurance that the fissionable material will not be diverted or - in the
case of material recovered from the military sector - returned to use in weapons or
explosives.

<p>
     An agreement on an international regime for the management of plutonium and highly
enriched uranium might be a means of achieving this.  The Secretariat has undertaken some
work to prepare for discussion of these issues, should some member governments wish to
examine the advantages, problems and modalities of such a regime.  Clearly the safeguards
experience of the Agency would be a major element in such a regime.  How heavy a burden
a regime of this kind would place on the Agency would of course depend on the modalities
of the regime and the quantities of fissionable material States would want to place under it.
<p>
A Verified Cut-Off of Production of Fissionable Material for Use in Weapons or
Explosives
<p>
     A verified cut-off of production of plutonium and high enriched uranium for weapons
or other explosive purposes has been under international discussion for many years.  In the
present international climate this discussion could lead to concrete proposals for an agreement
involving all States on an equal basis.  The premise would be that there is more than enough
of weapons-useable material and no need for further production of such material.  Methods
and techniques of verification exist but they may need to be further developed.  One must
be aware, however, that should IAEA safeguards be applied to the operation or dismantling
of all installations capable of such production, the added workload of verification would be
large.  It would probably have to be assumed stepwise and it would require adequate funding.
<p>
<B>A complete test ban agreement</B>
<p>
     Among the arms control measures now subject to international discussion, is an
agreement on a complete ban on the testing of nuclear weapons and other explosives.  It has
been suggested that the IAEA might be given a central role in the verification of such an
agreement.  Some old and some new techniques for safeguards verification, e.g.
environmental sampling - might indeed be valuable in the verification of a complete test ban.
Although the Agency has not had an international role in the central verification method
discussed for a complete test ban, that of seismic measurements, the Agency does have some
experience and expertise in this area.  With some added capacity, it could probably undertake
the task of compiling and co-ordinating information provided by national institutions about
seismological measurements - the so-called clearing house function.
<p>
<B>NPT Conference 1995</B>
<p>
     The Agency is called upon to participate in the preparation of the 1995 NPT
Conference, which will review the operation of the Treaty and decide on its extension.  The
Agency will prepare the customary reports on its own role in the operation of some of the
articles under the Treaty.  There is little doubt, however, that the most important
contributions which the Agency can make to that Treaty are the strengthening of the
effectiveness and credibility of the safeguards applied under the Treaty, extending safeguards
to the new parties to the Treaty and continued promotion of a transfer of nuclear technology
for peaceful purposes.
<p>
<B>Finances, Budget, Programme, Personnel</B>
<p>
I should like to conclude with a few brief comments on matters relating to the
Agency's finances, budget, programme and personnel.
<p>
     The financial situation of the Agency remains precarious.  We have avoided crises
only because the substantial shortfalls in budgetary contributions to our activities have been
met by a curtailment in or deferment of activities, amounting to a 12% cut in expenditures
in 1993.  Although the seriousness and size of the present shortfall is mainly attributable to
arrears of a major contributor, I am bound to note that an almost across-the-board
improvement of discipline is needed to pay, to pay fully and to pay on time.
<p>
     The budget for 1994 marks almost a decade of zero real growth.  While it is evident
that important demands which represent priorities for one group or the other have not been
responded to, I think we can take pride in the fact that so many new needs of governments
for international action in the nuclear field have been met in our programme.  We must also
be aware that some vital activities are financed, not through the Regular Budget where they
should properly have been accommodated, but through voluntary extrabudgetary
contributions.
<p>
     When resources are so scarce, it becomes particularly important that they be used to
satisfy the interests of different groups of Members in an equitable and balanced manner.
Resolutions 587 and 596 of the General Conference last year remind us of this.  The lengthy
process in which the programme and budget are ironed out in interaction between Members
and the Secretariat provides the best means of securing a balance accepted by all.  The
Secretariat, for its part, is committed to drafting and implementing a programme that seeks
to satisfy the priority interests of all groups.
<p>
     Skill in perceiving and identifying the needs of different Members, innovation in
devising means of responding to these needs and effectiveness in action can only be achieved
if the organization is staffed by broadly recruited and highly competent professionals and a
dedicated general service staff.  All Groups and Members will not be happy with every
recruitment decision.  There are still under-represented countries and groups.  However, I
can assure you that I shall do my best both to maintain the highest level of professional
competence and a broad geographical basis for recruitment.  The success of this effort must
be judged over a period of time.  Above all, the success must be gauged by the quality of
the service that the Secretariat provides the organization.  In this regard I feel confident.  By
financial necessity we are understaffed, but we are well staffed in terms of quality to meet
the many challenges facing the Agency and to perform the tasks which Member Governments
may wish to lay upon us.
<p>
     Finally, I want to express my thanks to the Government of Austria and the City of
Vienna for their hospitality.

<TITLE>Statement by IAEA Director General on Verification in a Future Middle East Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement by IAEA Director General on Verification in a Future Middle East Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Workshop on the Modalities for the Application of Safeguards in a Future Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna,Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>5 May 1993</H4>
<P><HR>The IAEA has the mandate to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to verify through safeguards that uses submitted to its safeguards are actually exclusively for peaceful purposes.  Why has a safeguards function been laid on the organization?  States transferring nuclear techniques, material or equipment that could be of some relevance in a weapons development normally make acceptance of safeguards a condition for the transfer.  For the transfer of more important nuclear installations, most suppliers today will even make it a condition that the recipient country accepts safeguards over all its relevant nuclear activities - full-scope or comprehensive safeguards.
<P>Safeguards may thus be seen as a verification imposed by suppliers.  They are simply not willing to allow their exports to contribute to nuclear weapons development.
<P>However, safeguards need not be viewed as, or indeed be, an imposition.  The verification may be requested by the safeguarded party of imported or, indeed, indigenously developed nuclear techniques, equipment and material, because the State wishes to create confidence that the particular nuclear techniques, equipment or material serve only peaceful purposes.  If viewed in this way by the State, the nature of safeguards is one of an international service.  Verification by an outsider can provide greater credibility than verification by the party itself.
<P>In a nuclear-weapon-free zone the parties agree between themselves at a minimum that they will not possess, control or acquire nuclear weapons.  They may agree on a host of other things as well.  For instance they might agree only to operate sensitive nuclear installations jointly, so that they all will have full access to and joint control of such installations.  Such agreement may create further confidence that no party is moving ahead in a nuclear weapons acquisition or development.  A concrete example is the agreement between the DPRK and the ROK not to operate enrichment or reprocessing plants.
<P>The IAEA has no mandate to discuss these material provisions in a nuclear-weapon-free-zone agreement.  But it does have considerable experience in operating verification of the respect for such agreements.  It is against this background that the General Conference of the IAEA has asked the Director General several times to consult about the early application of full-scope safeguards to all nuclear activities in the  Middle East and to prepare model agreements.  It is evident that verification must always be adapted to the material provisions agreed upon.  You must know what the parties have agreed to, in order to devise the verification of their respect for the agreed provisions.  Verification should fit material rules as a glove fits the hand.
<P>In the case of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East we don't know yet what the hand will look like.  The material conditions and provisions are yet to be negotiated between the parties.  Hence we cannot devise a verification agreement.  However, we can thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the various techniques and problems of verification.  We can study components that are likely to be of use.  In my view this is a very meaningful preparation for the days when the parties hopefully are designing the material conditions of a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>I have discussed these matters with governments in the Middle East during several trips and this workshop is also convoked with the same idea of acquainting the relevant experts with different modalities of applying safeguards.  NPT-type safeguards - those defined in INFCIRC/153 - is the most commonly accepted and practised form of verification.  Most States in the Middle East have accepted it and its acceptance by all would provide much valuable transparency.  However, it is not the only type of comprehensive safeguards that could be of use in the Middle East.  You should examine broadly what might be needed.
<P>I should now like to walk with you gently and philosophically into the world of verification and study the landscape.
<P>In order first to obtain some perspective on verification of non-proliferation it may be of interest to think of other areas in which verification occurs within nations or between them.
<P>Within our respective States there are many activities and arrangements that are checked so that we may have confidence that they do not pose various unacceptable risks.  Our elevators are usually inspected - perhaps once a year.  Cars, too, are inspected regularly in many countries for their safety features, to reduce the number of accidents caused by technical faults.  Restaurant kitchens, slaughter houses and many other places may be inspected to check that the level of hygiene is at an acceptable level.  These are routine checks.  They may occur whether or not there is suspicion of fault.  The same applies to some checks against possible terrorist activities.  Before we may enter a parliament, for instance, we may have to go through a metal detector and to put our briefcases under X-ray.  And at airports we are familiar with the same procedure. In these controls we are all treated in the same way - whether we wear torn jeans or striped pants.
<P>It is not certain that the checker and the enforcer is the same person or authority.  If the lady who is looking at the X-ray picture of your briefcase detects a pistol, she would probably quickly call some police or guard.  If the inspector who checks the elevator finds a deficiency, he/she may perhaps order the owner of the building to remedy the deficiency, but if the owner ignores the  order enforcement authorities will be summoned.
<P>Thus we find that in not so few activities is checking on respect for standards, rules, bans in the hands of special inspectors, but the enforcement - the sanctions - are placed in the hands of police or other armed units.
<P>Safeguards inspectors, checking the absence of weapons-related nuclear activities, are not policemen who can enforce - seize a weapon or stop an activity.  They are checkers, verifiers.  They have to report and the power of enforcement - to the extent that it exists - lies elsewhere.  I shall revert in a moment to that question.
<P>Of course, we must also note that many verification activities in our national societies are directly placed in the hands of the enforcement authorities, e.g. the search for illegal possession of drugs or weapons.  But here we can notice a difference to the airport controls or the checking of our cars.  The police does not systematically check every house and person for drugs or weapons.  They mostly check where they have some reason to think that there may be a violation.  Indeed, they will normally have to show reason for a search of a house.  They cannot enter at random.
<P>If they find illegal weapons or drugs, they intervene themselves - they seize - since they are the enforcement agency.
<P>It is interesting to keep these various models in mind as we discuss international verification and enforcement.
<P>International verification is much rarer than verification in the national sphere.  There is, for instance, no international agency verifying the safe construction and maintenance of aircraft or ships.  This is done by national authorities and they may base themselves on national norms, which, however, may be modelled upon internationally agreed standards - perhaps even conventions.  There is, as we well know, no international authority that verifies the safe construction and maintenance of nuclear power reactors - no international licensing authority for nuclear plants - but there are internationally agreed safety standards and as a matter of service - not mandatory checking - there are visits by international expert teams to nuclear installations, notably power reactors, to observe, advise and report on their safety standards.
<P>As individuals and citizens we are jealous of our personal integrity and the inviolability of our homes.  We don't want to confer a right on the police to search our houses and apartments for weapons or drugs or our own clothes and bodies - except for good reasons.  The exceptions we make are few - at airports, on the road to check all motorists for possible excessive alcohol use.
<P>States are even more jealous of their personal and bodily integrity - their sovereignty.  We like to be masters in our own houses.  We don't like to have agents of any foreign State in our countries checking on our conduct.  But we have slowly come to realize that in some situations it may be in our own interest nevertheless at any rate to have such agents or agents of international organizations for some checking tasks.
<P>This realization has come slowly.  In the early part of this century so-called international sanitary councils were established in various cities where large numbers of pilgrims passed and where for that reason epidemic control had to be exercised.  Despite the strong rationale for such institutions the concept of sovereignty long inhibited acceptance.  (See Eagleton, International Government, 3rd ed. 1957, p. 175).
<P>Many of the obligations which States accept among themselves do not call for any international or mutual verification.  For instance, if States agree to combat the traffic in drugs, it is assumed that their respective national authorities will do the best they can and no international verification is needed of the efforts.  The supervision of an agreed international regime may, in this manner, be as it were delegated to national authorities - a construction which certainly facilitates the enforcement, as enforcement measures are far less problematic at the national than at the international level.
<P>In other areas international verification may have been found unnecessary because the violation of rules have been assumed to be easily visible by all.  Thus the 1925 ban on the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons did not have any verification clause.  Nevertheless, as we remember, in the war between Iraq and Iran the UN appointed an international team to verify the use of chemical weapons.  The ban on the production and use of biological weapons has also not been complemented by any verification machinery.  But the recent convention against chemical weapons has an elaborate verification system.
<P>However, it is obvious that more and more international verification is seen as a common need and interest - internationally, regionally and bilaterally and the traditional and conceptual objections to it are weakening
<P>Peace-keeping forces have often only the role to observe and report.  And it is becoming increasingly common to call in international observers at national elections.  Indeed, I think Costa Rica has made it a consistent practice.  Here, obviously, national authorities which may have a strong interest in a given outcome may not have maximum credibility to verify fairness.  International teams will be more credible.  The respect for human rights standards is also increasingly subjected to international verification.
<P>In hardly any area could the importance of full respect for a commitment and credible verification of this respect be greater than in disarmament and arms control and in this field no sector could be more vital than the nuclear one.  Even the cheating on one single weapon could have the most dramatic consequences.
<P>It is not surprising therefore that the nuclear field has seen the first large-scale arrangement for international verification.  Indeed, even before the IAEA safeguards system was devised verification existed under bilateral agreements between the United States and States which purchased nuclear material from the US.  Bilateral verification has not ceased with the establishment of an international system.  Verification of nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia is so far exclusively bilateral.  The Argentina-Brazilian agreement on a joint accounting and control system is evidently also a bilateral mechanism, but as you will hear, it is more joint than mutual inspection.  The agreement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK), on the other hand, is more genuinely a bilateral arrangement for mutual inspection.
<P>There are thus no conceptual or practical obstacles to bilateral, trilateral or regional verification.  Euratom is, of course, a regional inspection regime.  Bilateral inspection offers the parties the means of directly mutually convincing themselves of loyal implementation of non-proliferation pledges.  However, reservations about outside inspection might be stronger as regards a bilaterally based system than about a multilateral one, where inspectors will represent a jointly managed international institution rather than a neighbouring State.  There is nothing to suggest, lastly, that you could not construct a system that combined international and bilateral inspection.
<P>The rationales for international inspection of non-proliferation pledges may be said to be two-fold:  first, verification by outside inspection can achieve a level of credibility that can hardly be attained through measures undertaken by the inspected State itself.  Secondly, an international system for global use may accumulate experience and achieve a level of scale which makes it cost effective.
<P>Now let me look for a moment at the enforcement side of non-proliferation commitments.  We must be aware that enforcement is a very different thing at the international level from what it is at the level of a State.  I mentioned that at the national level many activities are checked by inspection and that enforcement is secured by authorities - police - which have a monopoly on the use of force.  The fact that there is such a monopoly has the result that the actual use of force is mostly not needed.  The threat is enough.
<P>Between States the situation is very different.  There is no police or joint army that can enforce an agreement.  States which violate a commitment may, themselves, control vast armed forces.  A nuclear-weapon State disregarding a commitment of some kind may not be easy to bring back to order.  However, the risk of retaliation or collective reactions from States who wish to uphold the commitment may deter violations and may even bring a violator  back to order.
<P>We must recognize that the international community of States is a rudimentary, or a primitive society.  In primitive societies - like Europe in the early Middle Ages - citizens and groups of citizens were armed.  The family or clan protected its members, if need be, by threat or reliance on blood revenge on rival families and clans.  The development of central authorities of power - kings - was slow.  When it occurred it brought invariably a monopoly on the use of force.  The citizens were disarmed, the central authority exercised the monopoly on the use of force and, at the same time, assumed the duty to protect the citizens against violence - by bringing offenders to court and to punishment.
<P>We have not yet reached this stage in the international community.  We still mostly live in clans - alliances - protecting their members by retaliation and we are certainly not disarmed!  The risk of retaliation and the balance of power helps to maintain the peace - not yet an overwhelming international force under the control of an international authority.  It will take a good deal of time before we get there.
<P>This does not mean that the international community is in a state of complete lawlessness.  Most international commitments - like agreements between citizens - are freely entered into and fulfilled because it is in the continuing interest of the party.  Pressures by other States and the risk of strong reactions by other States or by the collectivity of the international community may also deter a State from ignoring an international commitment which no longer appears so desirable.  But there is no parallel to the almost automatically available enforcement that you have in the state sphere.
<P>An element helpful to achieve effective international reactions to violations of commitments is, however, authoritative impartial establishment that a violation has occurred  - and not merely allegations by other interested parties.  Here international observers and inspectors have an important role, just as witnesses and court proceedings are indispensible preconditions for the use of enforcement power within States.
<P>I have already spent a good deal of my lecture time to explain the place of international inspection in a primitive international society.  However, there is even more to say on this score.  First, in a State evidence can be collected, if need be, with the help of the enforcement authorities.  You can be subpoenaed to bring your car to inspection.  And you know that.  In the international community your acceptance of international inspection is based on your explicit consent.  If you refuse or limit the right of access of inspectors, there are likely to be reactions, but they are by no means as automatic and predictable as in the domestic sphere.  Yet such reactions are most important.  Refused or limited access to safeguards inspectors would likely reduce confidence drastically.
<P>Secondly, international verification must be organized on the basis of equality - like the airport terrorism control.  An international inspectorate cannot - like a nation's police - concentrate resources on some parties and largely ignore others.  It cannot show more confidence in some countries and less in others.  It must impartially inspect all parties and report its findings.  If reasons are found to believe that something should have been declared and was not, the inspectorate is expected to explore the matter.  This is not a case of discrimination.  All parties are subjected to this.
<P>Now let me turn from these basic premises for inspection in the international community to some more specific points in the nuclear non-proliferation field.
<P>What are the possibilities and limitations of inspection?
<P>The objective for a State in joining a non-proliferation treaty and the concomitant verification is clearly to obtain confidence that other parties to the arrangement are respecting their non-proliferation pledge and not be surprised one day to find that a neighbour is a new nuclear-weapon State.  As this is a matter of fundamental importance for a State's security, the confidence must be solidly based - or expressed differently the verification must give a very high degree of assurance.  If it gives false assurance it may be worse than no verification, because it may lull a party into the belief that all is well, when in reality nuclear weapons are being made.
<P>Perhaps no verification system can be devised that is one hundred percent effective.  It is rare in this world that we reduce risks to zero.  Seven kilograms of Pu do not take much space, nor does a nuclear warhead, I believe, need to be very big.  If a State were to succeed in clandestinely buying one, and that is a big if, it might be able to hide it.  Certainly it would be harder to hide enrichment and reprocessing plants.  But - Iraq's enrichment installations had not been identified before the Gulf War.
<P>As the reliability of non-proliferation commitments is of such crucial importance, especially in a region like the Middle East, we must analyse which factors and features are likely to result in high - if not 100% reliability.
<P>We must remember, first of all, that we are dealing with sovereign States, controlling their own territories and controlling large resources.  Although non-proliferation commitments can be entered into and verification of them can be made for all time, one cannot create absolute guarantees that a State government will not change its mind, and denounce an agreement on one pretext or another.  As has often been said, the nuclear genie is out of the bottle.  The principles and techniques of enrichment and reprocessing are no longer mysteries.  The knowledge of advanced nuclear physics and engineering is also no longer a privilege of a few advanced States - as the case of Iraq showed.
<P>Hence the ultimate guarantee of the continued respect for a non-proliferation agreement lies in the maintenance of a political micro- and macro-climate that gives no incentive to nuclear weapons acquisition.  This means peace, extensive trade and interdependence, or integration.  After two thousand years of fighting the European countries are now looking to integration as the means of development - and reliable power.
<P>One can, of course, also seek outside security guarantees of various kinds.  They may be more or less reliable.  European NATO allies have looked to the US for a nuclear umbrella, but France preferred to have one of its own.
<P>Verification cannot guard against the denunciation of non-proliferation commitments  - as we see currently in the case of the DPRK.  But verification should first, and normally, give confidence that no proliferation is underway and, secondly, give timely warning, if one were underway.  Should such a warning signal be heard, there should be time for measures to prevent the proliferation to occur.  Both an awareness that verification would discover proliferation - with a high degree of probability - and that the States concerned and the world would take strong measures to thwart proliferation might help to deter such proliferation.
<P>What features are of key importance in verification to ensure a high probability of detection?
<P>One might sum up the essential in one word:  transparency.  Under safeguards agreements concluded pursuant to the NPT States are obliged to report nuclear material and installations to the Agency.  Recently our Board has strengthened the rules concerning the provision of design information and adopted recommendations concerning extensive reporting on the export and import of all nuclear material and on some equipment.  There is no reason why States or groups of States cannot go further in the direction of transparency.  The maximum nuclear transparency that can be attained between two or more States is presumably the joint operation of installations.  Awareness of this was part of the background for the establishment of some European nuclear institutions, like Eurodiff.  The joint Argentina-Brazil accountancy and control system does not constitute a joint operation of nuclear installations, but goes a very long way nevertheless in transparency by joint rather than mutual supervision.
<P>Short of such joint operation or supervision, one can imagine arrangements under which States participating in a non-proliferation scheme gave very extensive reports of all their nuclear activities - in research as in industry, in agriculture as in medicine.  Safeguards in pursuance of NPT falls far short of such reporting duties.  Out of fear that extensive reporting duties and extensive inspection might impede nuclear development and risk revealing commercial or industrial secrets, the reporting and verification has focussed on the nuclear material - without which weapons cannot be made.  With the benefit of many years of experience I think one dare now conclude that the fears were exaggerated and that wider reporting duties by the inspected and broader inspection rights could be instituted without any serious drawbacks but with some gains in transparency and assurance.  In a nuclear-weapon-free zone the parties would obviously be free to agree on such measures.  Inspectors need not be confined to "strategic points" but might be given the right to move freely around in nuclear installations and compounds.
<P>The case of Iraq made all acutely aware of something that was known but was not much in discussion, namely that IAEA inspection was geared to installations and material declared by the inspected State and that the Agency had little or no knowledge of installations and material which the State had not declared.
<P>Today I think there is increasing recognition that the Agency must sharpen its means of assessing whether there are any non-declared installations or there is any non-declared nuclear material.
<P>The case of Iraq has given us a great deal of experience in verification.  Much better analytical capacity now exists to identify even minute quantities of nuclear material and samples and smear tests are therefore of increasing value.
<P>Samples of water and air from a large number of points in the territory and waters of a State can also provide most valuable information/assurance.  This method has the advantage of not intruding into any installations.  Satellite photography, when made available, can be of great help to identify possible undeclared nuclear facilities.
<P>Now let me turn to "special inspections".  The Board of Governors has affirmed in general terms in February 1992 and in specific terms relating to the DPRK in February 1993, the right of the Agency to perform special inspections - also to additional non-declared locations - under comprehensive safeguards agreements.  The Secretariat has interpreted this right to exist when it has reason to believe that safeguards relevant information or locations exist which have not been declared and about which inadequate or no explanations are given.  It has not asserted a right to inspect locations chosen randomly.  However, it has taken the view - and been supported by the Board - that neither an assertion by the State that a location is safeguards irrelevant or that it is military, eliminates the Agency's right to special inspection.
<P>In a verification system under a nuclear-weapon-free zone the parties are evidently free to construct inspection rights regarding non-declared locations as they like.  Experience gained in the last years, in my view, points to rather wide rights.  The Chemical Weapons Convention's arrangements concerning "challenge inspections" are probably the most thoroughly discussed ones.  Especially the so-called "managed inspections"of military sites were the subject of much discussion.  The Agency's provisions concerning "special inspections" give no specific guidance concerning military locations, but it is evident that some regard must be had to legitimate military-security interests.  The Agency has also been ready to show such regard in the case of the DPRK.
<P>There might be many different ways in which bilateral challenge or special inspections can be foreseen in a nuclear-weapon-free zone, whether it is based upon an international verification system or one between the parties alone or a combination of the two.
<P>Let me also make one comment about the right of access, freedom of movement and communication of inspectors.  You will find that the safeguards system of the IAEA under INFCIRC/153 provides less far-reaching rights in these regards than does the recent convention against chemical weapons.  Under that convention inspectors will have the right to quick access, by their own transport means, if they wish, and they will be able to communicate freely with their home base.  They shall be granted visas for multiple visits and designations are deemed automatically accepted, if not expressly rejected.  These practical matters have importance for the effective functioning of an inspection system.  
<P>I shall conclude by some comments on a difficult but important subject:  enrichment and reprocessing plants.  Under NPT-type safeguards they are the subject of a considerable amount of inspection as they may contain direct use material.  If they are permitted under a nuclear-weapon-free-zone arrangement it may be taken for granted that inspection of them would be extensive.  It must be recognized, however, first that there is globally an excess enrichment capacity and that it will be hard, for a long time to come, to justify new enrichment plants - at least unconnected with sizeable nuclear power programmes.  Secondly, the need for reprocessing, today, when the breeder reactors are far away, is also questioned by many, at any rate when unconnected with a significant nuclear power programme or part of a closed fuel cycle, waste disposal system.  A nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would have to contain material provisions both as to the acceptability or not of enrichment and reprocessing and of the presence of any direct use material, whether highly enriched uranium or plutonium.  Conceivably such capacity and such material might have to be the subject of special transitory provisions.<HR>

<TITLE>Nuclear Energy and the Natural Environment</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Energy and the Natural Environment</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by IAEA Director General at the Public Information Seminar in Poland</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Jadwisin, Poland</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>22 June 1993</H4>
<P><HR>It is a great pleasure for me to be in Poland again, to welcome you all in my turn.  This is the latest seminar in a series which the IAEA started almost four years ago.  Nuclear Energy is seen by far too many people as something mystic or evil rather than as something that can be used for good or bad, prudently or recklessly.  We want to help demystify nuclear energy and believe it is important to bring together journalists, educators, officials and other specialists and to let them listen to and put questions to experts on various aspects of nuclear energy and techniques.  The calm and relaxed setting of Jadwisin should lend itself to this.
<P>My remarks today will take as their starting point three propositions.
<P>First, that environmental considerations are not just a luxury that should concern only rich countries in times of economic expansion.  Environmental effects influence our health and lives, the fate of our planet and future generations.  Countries whose economies are in transition should ideally learn from, and avoid, some of the environmental pitfalls of the development patterns which used to be followed in the industrially advanced States.
<P>Second, that nuclear techniques can make and are making a substantial and positive contribution to the protection of the environment and to sustainable development worldwide.
<P>And third, that the world's total appetite for energy and especially electricity will continue to grow, sometimes dramatically, requiring environmentally prudent choices by policy-makers as to the "mix" of energy sources to be used.  This is an area where factual information is of particular value.
<P>Let me develop each of these themes in turn.
<P>My first point is the general recognition that, particularly in recent decades, environmental destruction and dangers have evolved from the local to the national, to the regional and now to the global level.  Political and public awareness of this is increasing rapidly.  No international conference ever brought together so many Heads of State and Government as that on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil a year ago.  And nearly 10 000 media representatives there helped to heighten global consciousness about the threats to our environment.  The task now is to keep this awareness alive and to encourage environmentally sound planning.  The IAEA has been designated to serve on the United Nations inter-agency committee charged with the follow-up work and we take that membership very seriously.
<P>Unfortunately one major issue was not in focus at Rio, namely the delicate but central one of population growth.
<P>The importance for the environment of population growth can hardly be overestimated.  It is calculated that at the time of the birth of Christ there were about 350 million people on the earth; in 1900 there were 1.5 billion; in 1990 there were about 5 billion and in the year 2000 we expect to be about 6 billion.  Thus in the last ten years of this century it is expected that the world's population will increase almost as much as it did from the time of Christ to the year 1900.  As there are no virgin continents left, erosion, desertification and other environmental problems combined with economic factors will drive people to emigrate to areas and urban centres already  densely populated - with the attendant risk of conflict.  We can already see how increased immigration in rich countries in Europe and America is leading to friction.  Moreover, the demand for reasonable standards of living by an ever increasing number of people is already placing strains on global resources of soil and fresh water.  In my view none of the central problems of the next century - and certainly not the environmental ones - can be tackled with real hope of success, unless we vigorously address the issue of population growth.
<P>Some people, however, would place most of the blame for environmental dangers and destruction on science and technology, for example on new compounds invented by the chemists, or nuclear techniques developed by physicists and engineers.  This brings me to my second point.  It is undeniable that some compounds designed - for instance - to help increase agricultural production have indeed proved to have dangerous side-effects.  It is also true that many techniques, including nuclear power, can entail problems and risks and thus not only yield benefits.  It is important that resources be devoted, therefore, to non-chemical means of increasing food production and to sources in addition to nuclear power to increase energy production.  But it would be naive and futile to turn our backs on either chemistry or nuclear physics.  It is in large measure through science and technology that we have progressed in the industrialized world and it is to science and technology that we must turn to help solve our problems - including those created by science and technology themselves.
<P>Some people may want the world to close the nuclear chapter.  It would be most unwise, however, to disregard techniques that help to restore our health, increase food production and produce clean energy at competitive costs.  We would do better to analyse the cost benefits of nuclear techniques and compare them with alternatives.
<P>There are today many nuclear techniques directly serving environmental protection and effective resource utilization.  In agriculture, new strains of seeds are created through mutations induced by irradiation, strains that may be more pest-resistant or drought-resistant or have other desirable features.  Cotton crops in Pakistan and rice crops in Indonesia, to take two examples, have increased enormously thanks to the use of such mutants.  In China, nine million hectares have been planted with varieties derived from radiation-induced mutants.  The direct gain resulting from China's cultivation of the higher-yielding cotton varieties alone has been estimated to have far exceeded one billion dollars.
<P>Through the use of radioisotopes many difficult and important measurements can be performed which help identify water resources or paths of pollution, including marine pollution, or measure the uptake of fertilizer in plants.  In Libya the FAO and the IAEA helped, through a nuclear technique, to eradicate an infestation of the New World screwworm, a pest which kills cattle as well as wild animals, and even human beings.  The technique consisted in releasing millions of male insects which had been rendered sterile by irradiation.  They mated with fertile females but no offspring resulted.  The entire insect population was eradicated in less than one year from the beginning of the campaign.  The benefit cost ratio of this successful campaign was calculated to be 50 to 1.
<P>Food preservation by gamma irradiation is controversial in some countries.  However, the Codex Alimentarius Commission of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated, after thorough examination, that there is no objection to the use of irradiation for food preservation, provided that certain dose limitations are respected.  This method can help us to decrease wastage of food, avoid excessive use of chemical preservation methods, and give us healthier food products, e.g. chicken and spices, in which otherwise salmonella infestation is a risk.
<P>I should also mention that nuclear techniques have become standard tools in agricultural research, for instance, to optimize fertilizer use, to improve productivity and nourishment of livestock, and to produce animal vaccines.  Many millions of doses of radiation-attenuated lungworm vaccine have been given to cattle.  Nuclear techniques are now indispensible tools in all developments of agriculture biotechnology.
<P>In industry, nuclear techniques offer unique ways of conducting non-destructive tests or of making exact measurements which saves raw materials and other resources.   A nuclear technique is even being tested here in Poland to reduce pollutants arising from the burning of coal.  Chimney-stack gases from the coal burning are mixed with ammonia and subjected to electron beams from an accelerator.  The result is that most of the SO2 and NOx is removed from the emissions and a substance that can be used as fertilizer is obtained (ammonium nitrate and sulfate).
<P>I need hardly remind you of the many uses of nuclear techniques in modern medicine, not only to detect and combat cancer where they remain a principal method of treatment, but to achieve many new forms of diagnostic imaging.  Subsequent speakers will be describing many of these beneficial applications of nuclear technology in greater detail.
<P>In turning then to my third point of how to meet expanding world energy requirements, I would like to stress immediately that I would not want my remarks to be regarded as an intervention in any national debates about nuclear power anywhere.  Decisions about use or non-use of nuclear power are the prerogative of each country.  I do feel it appropriate, however, to call attention to the relevance of nuclear power generally to the pressing problems of energy needs and environmental dangers, notably the so-called greenhouse effect.
<P>Let us first look at likely demand patterns.  According to a new study by the International Energy Agency of the OECD in Paris, energy consumption will increase by the year 2010 by fifty percent compared to 1990 levels.  The increase in the OECD nations is forecast below that average, at 30 percent, but in Asia energy requirements may double already by the end of this decade.  The primary energy needs of the non-OECD countries will then start to exceed half of the world's total consumption which has traditionally gone chiefly to the industrialized world.  Long-standing OPEC-member oil-producing States like Indonesia expect to become net importers of oil by the turn of the century.  And according to another recent study, by Arthur D. Little Inc., installed power capacity in Asia will triple by the year 2010.
<P>There is some reason, of course, to be happy about this trend, since there is a clear relationship between the level of economic development, living standards and energy consumption.
<P>But there is equally reason for concern when one looks at the figures more closely.  Ninety percent of primary energy needs are still expected to be met by fossil fuels, with all the negative effects their burning has on the atmosphere.  And by the year 2010 oil consumption alone is likely to rise by 40 percent, again with the lion's share of this going to the non-OECD countries.
<P>These predictions lend further weight to the controversial arguments currently advanced in the European Community and OECD countries in favour of introducing a carbon tax as a way to help curb the consumption of fossil fuels and the increasing volume of carbon dioxide that their burning releases.  They have also led some countries to worry about future security of supply and price increases stimulated by demand.  Hence we must look for large-volume energy sources which are unaffected by these considerations and which have no undesirable environmental side-effects in normal operation.  The most obvious and widespread of these sources is, I submit, nuclear.
<P>I know, of course, what objections are raised to nuclear power.  There is the view that the economic costs of this energy are too high and that the social costs are unacceptable in terms of potential risk to life, health and the environment.  We must, of course, calmly analyse what these risks are.  We must also ask what risks we would be taking by relying on possible alternative means of energy generation, or by refraining from producing more energy and what risks are acceptable to society.  We must ask, lastly, to what extent  risks connected with nuclear power can be further reduced.
<P>The question of what level of risk is acceptable to society in various activities - how safe is safe enough? - is not technical but political.  Governments answer it, influenced by political movements, parties and the media.  Technical data and facts, while not irrelevant to this process, are only a small part of the input.  Nor is there a single answer to the question.  The answers vary from country to country.  They may depend on local circumstances and they vary greatly from one human activity to another.
<P>While continued widespread reliance on coal mining is not questioned by any strong body of public opinion, despite the well-documented heavy impact on the health of miners themselves and of the population at large, reliance on nuclear power is vigorously questioned and in most European States there are formal or informal moratoria on the construction of new plants.  There can be no doubt that this opinion has been influenced by the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island - where there were hardly any radioactive releases into the environment - and particularly at Chernobyl, where there were vast releases.  It has no doubt been influenced also by the fear that toxic radioactive wastes could leak now or in the future from their disposal sites.
<P>No one can ignore the health and environmental impacts of the Chernobyl accident which was a major tragedy that I would not seek in any way to minimize it, or the irresponsible handling of radioactive wastes that has occurred in the military sectors in the US and the former USSR.  It is interesting, however, to see the conclusions of a Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and the Environment which took place in Helsinki in 1991 and which was organized by a large number of international organizations, including the IAEA.  Comparing the health and environmental impacts of different electricity-generating systems and considering the impacts of the systems from beginning to end - e.g. from fuel extraction to waste disposal - the Symposium concluded - with some reservations due to incompleteness of data - that
<UL>
<LI>    "under routine operation conditions, nuclear power and renewable systems tend to be in the lower spectrum of health risk and ... energy systems based on coal and oil are in the higher spectrum of health risk"; and that
<LI>    "human health risks from severe accidents from nuclear, oil and natural gas are of the same order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude smaller than those from the hydroelectric option."
</UL>
The second conclusion may appear surprising until one looks at the number of hydro dams which have burst over the years drowning many thousands of people.  These dispassionate conclusions of an expert symposium deserve to be cited as they contrast with commonly held perceptions.
<P>In addressing the subject of nuclear power safety, I must mention the international agreements which were reached after the Chernobyl accident on measures that are designed to contain and mitigate the consequences of an accident, notably early notification and assistance in the case of radiological emergencies.  Notification has actually been given in two cases since the Chernobyl accident, although it was not strictly required under the convention.  Assistance has likewise been organized twice in the same period, not in connection with nuclear power accidents, however, but to help victims of accidents involving large radiation sources for medical and industrial uses.
<P>It is often claimed that we can do without nuclear energy and its risks, either through energy savings or through greater reliance on renewable sources of energy.  Although both accelerated conservation and the development of solar power and other renewable sources are desirable, neither is credibly predicted to be alternatives to nuclear power.  The World Energy Council has stated flatly that "we cannot do without any of the sources of supply which presently exist, since renewable energy and new technologies will not be able to replace fossil fuel or nuclear".
<P>If fears about a global warming effect from the so-called greenhouse gases, notably CO2, are confirmed as being justified, we will face a continuing dilemma:  how to reconcile the predicted greater use of energy with the need to restrain CO2 emissions - which are linked to the burning of all fossil fuel.  This is particularly true of coal, somewhat less so for oil, and less still for natural gas.  Nuclear power is of great importance in this situation, firstly as it is used primarily to generate electricity which is the fastest growing form of energy use, and secondly because nuclear power plants simply do not emit any CO2 or other substances which would have an impact on global climate.
<P>It has been suggested that nuclear power, which today is responsible for about 5% of the world's energy and 17% of its electricity - a little less than hydro's 20% of electricity  - is too small a source to be of any importance to global CO2 emissions.  No one contends that nuclear power, alone, can be the answer to the threat of global warming, but it has been calculated that if today's 400 or so nuclear power plants were closed and the electricity generated by them were instead generated by coal-fired plants, total global CO2 emissions would increase by some 7%.
<P>At the present time when a fairly large sector of public opinion in many industrialized countries is still sceptical about a wider use of nuclear power, it is understandable if governments, aware of the need to limit CO2 emissions, either postpone decisions on power generation or opt for gas, which does contribute to CO2 but generates about half as much CO2 per energy unit as does coal.
<P>Some twenty-five percent of the world's total CO2 emissions come from electricity generating stations.  It is interesting to note that in the
United Kingdom, where 22% of the electricity comes from nuclear stations, the average CO2 emission per kWh produced was 0.78 kg.  In Poland with
its heavy use of coal it is about 0.95 kg.  In France, where nuclear plants generate 75% of the electricity, the corresponding figure was 0.09 kg.  This
gives a perspective on what CO2 reduction can be achieved through the use of nuclear power.
<P>There is no doubt that the awareness is increasing among governments that, although the problem of global warming cannot be answered by
nuclear power alone, it cannot be answered either without some reliance on nuclear power.  The so-called G-7 summits of industrialized States have
pointed specifically on more than one occasion to nuclear power as a means of restraining greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>Even the Club of Rome seems - recently and reluctantly - to have come to the conclusion, in the face of the risk of global warming, that the
use of nuclear power is necessary.  Coal and oil, it is said, and I quote, are "probably more dangerous to society because of the carbon dioxide they
produce ..." and "there are, therefore, strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open".
<P>At the level of the United Nations, e.g. at the Rio Conference, no such conclusion would have been possible.  Certainly, a large majority of the
world's governments either favour the use or expanded use of nuclear power or, at least, the retention of the option, and only a handful of
governments are opposed.  Nevertheless conclusions at the UN level are mostly by consensus and there is clearly no consensus on the matter
between governments.
<P>At Rio a Framework Convention on Climate Change was concluded.  It failed to include the proposal that CO2 emissions by 2005 should
return to the levels of 1990, but it did set as an ultimate objective the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.  The Conference and Convention refrained from telling us, however, just how this was
to be achieved.  The real discussions on CO2 emissions and energy sources - including the merits of nuclear power - therefore lie before us in years
to come.  My own conclusion is that the industrially advanced States will have to consider a continued, indeed, expanded use of nuclear power partly
in order to offset the effect of many developing countries expanding their use of less demanding fossil fuel-based technologies.  In this perspective I
believe we must also develop nuclear power plants which are easier to operate for eventual use by the more advanced developing countries.
<P>It is clear that we can hope to reduce or contain global CO2 emissions only through international action and it seems to me that at least one of
these actions will have to involve limiting the burning of fossil fuels.  Such a limitation will raise formidable economic and political problems.  The
developing countries are not likely to accept to limit their development plans in order to help solve a problem which has been caused to the greatest
extent so far by the industrialized world.  Let me mention two examples:  China has plans to double its use of domestic coal and India plans to treble
its coal use.  If these two countries - with by the turn of the century more than one third of the world's population - manage to implement their plans,
they will use more coal than all of the OECD countries together in the year 2000 - and that is forecast to be 35% more than they were using in 1985.
The aspirations of other developing countries are not very different.  And these countries may have no real alternatives.  Both India and China do have
nuclear power programmes but for the main part they plan to meet their vast energy needs by fossil fuels.  If at all tractable, this problem can only be
eased through solidarity between industrial and developing countries.
<P>Especially in the industrialized world, many environmentalist groups keep coming back to two recipes to counter the greenhouse effect:
energy conservation and the rapid development and use of renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar power.  Let me discuss these
responses briefly.
<P>There is undoubtedly a considerable potential for energy saving.  Future cars will get more kilometres per litre than the present ones.  Getting
car owners to drive fewer kilometres on the other hand is a more doubtful proposition.  The World Energy Council fully recognizes the importance of
energy conservation, but it has warned at the same time that  - I quote - "few subjects have been or are the object of as much wishful thinking".  And:
"While there is no doubt that there are substantial further improvements in energy efficiency which can be achieved on an economic basis, and that
they can contribute to the alleviation of the environmental problems, these possibilities must be kept in a real world perspective."
<P>What may be the true scope for an expanded use of renewable energy sources?  If you except hydro power, these sources now contribute
less than 0.3% of the global energy supply - and a major part of that is geothermal energy which is significant, for instance, in Iceland.
<P>Solar and wind energy have so far shown little promise of economic competitiveness.  Much work is still needed to reduce the costs of solar
and wind generators if they are ever to become generally economically competitive.  Mrs. Helga Steeg, Director General of the International Energy
Agency, has stated that "the contribution of renewable energies, besides hydro power, in most of the IEA countries,[i.e. most of the Western
industrialized countries] for the year 2010 can be estimated to be a maximum of 5%".  The World Energy Council has suggested an even lower figure:
3% by the year 2020.  This does not negate the fact that these energy forms can be very important in specific regions or situations.  Research and
development funds should be increased for them, but present results suggest that it would be irresponsible to count on major global contributions from
them in a short or medium-term future.
<P>My conclusion is thus that, notwithstanding temporary slackening here and there due to sluggish economies, and although there may be
significant potential for saving both primary energy and electricity, especially in some high consumption countries, this will not be enough by far to
offset the increasing global energy demand which we can expect in the next two or three decades.  We will also not be able to meet this demand with
renewable energy sources alone.
<P>All of which brings me back to the nuclear option and to some final remarks about two principal points which underlie much of the scepticism
about nuclear power - waste disposal and operational safety.  One might argue that in the environmental context, nuclear wastes are, in fact, among
the greatest assets of nuclear power.  They do not contribute to acid rain or global warming and they are so limited in volume that they can be
disposed of and isolated from man's environment in their entirety.  They contrast drastically with the wastes from fossil fuels.  These are so
voluminous that the final disposal sites chosen are on the surface of the earth and our common atmosphere.  In waste disposal we speak of two
alternative approaches:  the d and d = dilute and disperse for fossil fuel waste, and c and  c for nuclear = concentrate and confine.
<P>Some figures and comparisons may be helpful at this point.  A coal-fired plant of 1000 MW(e) requires about 7000 tons of coal per day - i.e.
about five train loads.  A nuclear plant of the same electric capacity will use some 80 kilograms of uranium per day.  Even with excellent and
expensive chimney stack gas cleaning equipment the coal plant will annually emit some 9000 tons of SO2, 4500 tons of NOx, some 400 tons of
various toxic heavy metals and no less than 6.5 million tons of CO2.  The nuclear plant will produce     30 tons of highly radioactive waste per year in
the form of spent fuel.
<P>The methods which have been worked out for the disposal of these limited amounts of nuclear waste are designed to ensure isolation for tens
of thousands of years.  They would seem vastly less risky than our current free release of most of the waste resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.
It would seem desirable, however, that the international consensus on responsible management, transport and disposal of nuclear wastes should be
laid down in standards for both civilian and military wastes accepted and respected by all.  Such standards are, in fact, being worked at within the
IAEA.
<P>With regard to operational safety it is understood by the nuclear power industry that the level world-wide must be so high that accidents with
significant radioactive releases will not occur.  This realization is leading to an intensification of international co-operation regarding nuclear safety in
Eastern and Central Europe and elsewhere.  The safety weaknesses identified in design and operation of nuclear power plants in the former Soviet
Union and Central/Eastern Europe are leading the countries of these regions to work together with other industrialized States to back-fit and upgrade
plants or gradually phase out plants which are not deemed able to attain an internationally acceptable level of safety.  Moreover, much more use is
being made of international peer reviews in the nuclear safety field - both between operators and between regulators.  To existing non-binding
standards regarding nuclear safety we hope to add a convention containing safety fundamentals for nuclear power plants, which would become legally
binding upon States adhering to it.
<P>From what I have said you will have gathered that, in my view, nuclear power can play an important role for the sustainable supply of energy.
The resource base is large.  Current estimates are that uranium resources will last some 400 to 500 years at the present rate of use.  This should be
compared with perhaps as little as 30 years for oil and some 45 years for natural gas at current use levels.  Coal resources are said to be sufficient for
some  200 years at present levels of use.  There is still some hydroelectric capacity to be tapped in the developing world, and this should be used
wherever the environmental consequences are not severe.  In industrialized nations there is little exploitable potential left.
<P>Nuclear power provides 17% of the world's electricity and 5% of its primary energy.  The importance of nuclear power is, however, very
different in different countries.  France  - as I mentioned earlier - is the world leader with 75% of its electricity coming from nuclear power, which means
in practice that oil has been fully replaced by nuclear power for electricity generation.  Through its large nuclear power capacity, France now generates
more electricity than it needs itself, and exports electricity valued at more than $1 billion per year to its neighbours.  Belgium gets some 60% of its
electricity from nuclear plants, South Korea 43%, Sweden about the same, and Finland 33%.  There are now sixteen countries which get more than a
quarter of their electric energy from nuclear power.  Lithuania has the highest share of nuclear-generated electricity in this part of the world - 60%,
followed closely by the Slovak Republic (49%), Hungary (46%), Slovenia (35%), Bulgaria (33%), Germany (30%), Ukraine (25%) and the Czech
Republic (20%).
<P>You will be hearing from speakers from some of these countries later in the programme on their own national perspectives.  It only remains for
me at this stage to express the hope that the exchanges that will take place over the next two days will contribute constructively to creating a fuller
understanding of a wide spectrum of nuclear issues and to place them in context as a basis for weighing important scientific, energy and
environmental options in the future.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General regarding DPRK at informal briefing of UN Security Council, April 1993</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DPRK at informal briefing of UN Security Council, April 1993</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>6 April 1993</H4>
<HR>
<OL> 
<LI>    In a resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of Governors of the IAEA requested the Director General of the IAEA to report on behalf of the Board non-compliance of the DPRK with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material required to be safeguarded.
<LI>    The formal report is ready and has been submitted to the Secretary-General for transmission to the Council.  I am glad to have the opportunity already today informally to brief the Council about the resolution and its background.
<LI>    DPRK adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but it was not until 10 April last year that a safeguards agreement pursuant to NPT entered into force.  A so-called Initial Report of nuclear material and installations was submitted on 4 May 1992.  It listed inter alia a nearly completed reprocessing plant referred to as the Radiochemical Laboratory in which a small quantity of plutonium was stated to have been reprocessed in 1990 from damaged fuel rods which had been irradiated in the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor.
<LI>    In May last year I was, myself, invited to the DPRK and visited a number of nuclear installations, including the "Radiochemical Laboratory".  I was told that experience in reprocessing had been gained through an experiment in 1975-77, when a few grams had been separated from fuel irradiated in the IRT research reactor.  In replies to enquiries as to whether any pilot reprocessing plant had been operated between 1977 and 1990, the answer was that the leap had been taken from the experiment in 1975-77 to the construction of the Radiochemical Laboratory.
<LI>    Teams of IAEA safeguards inspectors visited DPRK installations from June 1992 and received much co-operation.  They also found some inconsistencies between the Initial Report and other information given by the DPRK and the findings made by the IAEA.  This is by no means unique.  Many errors and mistakes occur in reporting and the normal course of events is that these are cleared up through closer investigation.  In the case of the DPRK some relatively minor inconsistencies have been solved but some major ones have not gone away despite questions, discussion and analysis - which began already in the summer of 1992 and continued up to a meeting between experts in connection with the meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors in February of this year.
<LI>    The most important points on which information has differed from Agency findings are the following:
	   <UL>
	<LI>(a) Nuclear waste which was stored within the compound of the Radiochemical Laboratory and from which samples were taken for analysis, proved to have an isotopic composition indicating that some plutonium should exist which has not been declared.  Whether there are grams or kilograms the analysis cannot tell;
	<LI>(b) Sample analysis of the plutonium which has been declared indicates that there should be some nuclear waste which has not yet been made available for sampling and analysis;
	<LI>(c) The DPRK tells the Agency that only one reprocessing campaign has been carried out in the unfinished reprocessing plant - the Radiochemical Laboratory - in 1990 using irradiated fuel elements from the 5 MW(e) Experimental Power Reactor.  The Agency's analyses suggest that there should have been several such operations.
	   </UL>
<LI>Many hours have been spent in attempts to explain these inconsistencies.  The plutonium declared and analysed and the nuclear waste declared and analysed are like two gloves which don't match.  There should be two more gloves to match the pair which we have seen and analysed.
<LI>In view of these inconsistencies the Agency became much interested in information obtained from a third party about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste and which are located at the Nyongbyon nuclear village, one of the buildings in the vicinity of the Radiochemical Laboratory - the unfinished reprocessing plant.
<LI>Two Agency officials were permitted to visit this building in September last year.  They were told it was a one-storey building and they could see that some military but no nuclear equipment was stored in it.  What the Agency officials did not see, but what satellite pictures taken during different phases of the construction of the building later showed us was that there was a lower storey which was now invisible because of landscaping and which had a construction and a configuration that strongly suggested its purpose was nuclear waste disposal.
The two Agency officials I mentioned visited also a second site in September, a site that they became convinced was not nuclear-related.  It was therefore written off as of safeguards interest.
<P>
<LI>Satellite pictures taken in the fall were further made available to the Agency indicating that a location at Nyongbyon which has the obvious layout of a nuclear waste storage site was being covered by earth.  The road to it was erased and trees and  shrubs were planted.  I might mention that the layout of the site is very similar to the waste site at Tuwaitha outside Baghdad - a site with which the Agency is familiar.  I might also mention that while concealment of plutonium is not so difficult, because even a few kilograms is no larger in volume than a fist, the concealment of waste associated with the separation of plutonium is very much more so.  For every kilogram of plutonium derived from reprocessing, waste would amount to about 200 cubic metres.  Therefore, for larger quantities of plutonium, the associated waste could amount to many thousands of cubic metres.  Such wastes could only be stored in appropriate waste storage facilities.
<P>It is against this background that the two sites which the Agency wishes to visit and take samples, assume particular importance.
<LI>    During a meeting in Vienna on 30 November to 1 December 1992 between the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy and officials assisting him and myself and experts accompanying me, the inconsistencies were discussed.  I stressed the urgent need for the Agency to visit again the building which our officials had seen in September and the site which had been covered and landscaped last fall, and for the Agency to obtain samples from these sites.  This was not a request for a special inspection under the safeguards agreement, but a request for a visit in pursuance of an invitation issued earlier by the Minister for Agency officials to see sites whether or not they were included in the Initial Report.  The Minister and his officials responded that it would not be "normal" during such a visit to take samples but they did not decline the request.  Subsequent cables did not, however, bring any positive response. On the Agency side we felt that a visit of this informal kind would be more acceptable to the DPRK and less dramatic than a special inspection - a measure never before taken vis-à-vis an undeclared site.
<LI>In the absence of a positive response to our request for a visit by officials, we eventually, on 9 January, signalled our need for information to be obtained under the safeguards agreement's articles concerning special inspections - Articles 73 and 77.  This was resisted, but a mission headed by the Agency's Director of External Relations was accepted.  They visited Pyongyang on 20-22 January 1993. The mission explained in no uncertain terms that in the absence of the clarification - including the possibility of visits by officials which the Agency sought, and notably through taking samples from two sites that appeared waste-related - the Agency was not in a position to verify the correctness and assess the completeness of the Initial Declaration made by the DPRK.  The seriousness of the situation was thus made absolutely clear.  The formal request for special inspections, which followed later, could hardly have been a surprise.  The DPRK officials did not, however, show any signs of readiness to accommodate our request.  They asserted that the sites were non-nuclear and military.
<P>It should be recalled that at this time tension was rising on the Korean peninsula due to the expected military manoeuvre "Team Spirit" in the Republic of Korea.  The DPRK officials urged that all questions that needed clarification should be discussed between DPRK experts and the sixth Agency ad hoc inspection team which was due to arrive soon.
<LI>The sixth inspection mission arrived and spent nearly two weeks in intense discussions, which regrettably failed to give the needed clarifications.  Nor was it enabled to visit the two sites from which samples were desired.  Upon the return to Vienna of the sixth inspection team and analysis of its results,  it was decided in the Secretariat that there was no option other than formally to request a "special inspection".  This was done  in a cable of 9 February.  An annex to the cable listed inconsistencies between information provided by the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA.  The cable specified the two sites which the Agency had reason to believe were waste-related and to which the Agency wanted access to take samples.  The reply of  15 February from DPRK failed to accept our request but signalled that an expert DPRK mission would come to Vienna to discuss inconsistencies.  It stressed that the two sites which the Agency wished to visit were military and not nuclear-related.
<LI>The mission, headed by the Minister for Atomic Energy himself, arrived just before the IAEA regular February Board meeting.  While the discussions during the weekend of 20 and 21 February brought some relevant data concerning the operation of the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor, it did nothing to clarify the serious inconsistencies and offered no access to the two sites from which the Agency wished to take samples.
<LI>The impasse which thus appeared to have arisen was reported to the Board of Governors of the IAEA at its meeting on 22-25 February.  In my statement before the Board I said that the Agency did not want to assume lightly that an Initial Report was incorrect or incomplete.  Regrettably, however, the Secretariat was not in a position to confirm the correctness and completeness of the declaration such as it stood.   The Secretariat was of the view that the DPRK had the obligation under the Safeguards Agreement (Art. 3) to  co-operate and that such co-operation must include access to additional relevant information  as well as locations which the Agency had reason to believe were related to nuclear waste.
<P>As the detailed information given to the Board included safeguards confidential material by experts from the Secretariat, the Board met in closed session.  It received a detailed account of the inconsistencies relating to plutonium and nuclear waste and it was shown the pictures on the basis of which the Secretariat had concluded that two locations of the Nyongbyon nuclear centre were related to nuclear waste.
<P>I stressed that when looking for nuclear waste that matched the plutonium declared, the Secretariat could not possibly ignore any information about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste.  These sites, located within a nuclear centre, could not be immunized form inspections, I said, by the presence or placing of some military equipment on them.
<LI>On 25 February the Board adopted without a vote a resolution in which it took note of the significant inconsistencies between the declarations of the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA which remained unresolved, and called upon the DPRK urgently to respond positively to the request for access for additional information and additional sites.  The Board requested me to report within a month.
<LI>The resolution of the Board was immediately transmitted to the DPRK.  In a reply of 10 March the DPRK referred to the ongoing military exercise "Team Spirit" and the state of semi-war which existed in the DPRK.  In the circumstances, receipt of an Agency inspection team could not be considered.
<LI>    Shortly thereafter, on 12 March, the Agency received the DPRK announcement of its decision to withdraw  from the NPT as a measure to defend its supreme interests.  In a cable I advised the DPRK that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force until any withdrawal from the NPT took effect  and that a declaration of an intention to withdraw shall not impede implementation of the Safeguards Agreement.
<LI>On 16 March the DPRK replied, inter alia, that it "cannot receive the Agency inspection teams".
<LI>On 18 March, the Board of Governors met and adopted - still without a vote - a further resolution confirming that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force and that it was essential and urgent that the DPRK enable the Agency to take the necessary measures to resolve differences and ensure verification of compliance with the Safeguards Agreement.  The Director General was asked to report on the response of the DPRK at a Board meeting on 31 March.
<LI>In a cable to the DPRK the day after the Board meeting, i.e. 19 March, I reiterated the request for access by Agency inspection teams and advised that if access were not obtained, I would have no choice but to report non-compliance by DPRK with the Safeguards Agreement when the Board met again on 31 March.  I stated that the Agency was ready to discuss arrangements which might minimize legitimate security concerns about inspections at military sites.
<LI>On 30 March, one day before the Board meeting, the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy sent a further cable in which he stated that the DPRK was always ready to respond if the Agency's Secretariat wished to consult about the implementation of the Safeguards Agreement - thereby apparently implying recognition of the continued validity of the agreement.  At the same time, however, the position was confirmed that there was no readiness to discuss the issue of "special inspection".
<LI>In my statement to the Board on 31 March I pointed to the DPRK's reaffirmation of its express rejection of the Agency's right to make a special inspection - despite the decision of the Board on 25 February that the access requested to additional information and additional sites was essential and urgent.  The rejection was serious, I said, not only because it presented a challenge to the Agency's right of special inspections and the Board's endorsement of that right, but also because in fact it precluded the Agency from taking samples which might bring clarity where there was now inconsistency and uncertainty.
<LI>In its resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of the IAEA found that the DPRK "is in non-compliance with its obligation under the safeguards agreement with the Agency", and that the Agency is "not able to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material ... to nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices."  The Board called upon the DPRK to remedy its non-compliance by granting access to specific additional information and to the two locations indicated by the Agency.  It further decided, in keeping with Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute and Article 19 of the Safeguards Agreement, to report the non-compliance and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material to the Security Council, and to all Members of the Agency and to the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Lastly, in order to stress that the Agency itself continues to regard the matter as a high priority, the Board requested the Director General to continue his efforts and dialogue to implement fully the Safeguards Agreement and it decided to remain seized of the matter.
<LI>This was Thursday, 1 April - last week.  The formal report has been transmitted to the Secretary-General and is now distributed to the Security Council.
<LI>In concluding I would like to underline a few points:
First, the lack of co-operation from the DPRK with the Agency in clarifying inconsistencies is very serious and amounts to non-compliance as the Board of Governors has determined.
<P>In particular, it is worrying that the Agency is not in a position to verify the correctness of the quantity of plutonium which the DPRK has declared; rather the findings of the Agency point to the existence of plutonium which has not been declared.
<P>Second, the Agency has sought  over a period of time with patience and persistence to bring clarity where there is inconsistency.  While these efforts have met with some      co-operation by the DPRK, the explanations given to us have been ineffective and inadequate to clarify the most important inconsistencies.  Moreover, the DPRK has so far shown active resistance as regards inspection visits by the Agency to additional sites and sample-taking.
<P>Third, that a simple declaration by the DPRK that the sites are military and/or non-nuclear related cannot preclude inspection, where, as is the case, there is prima facie evidence of nuclear and safeguards relevance of the sites.
<P>Fourth, that the sites are not immunized by the presence or placing of military objects on them.  However, inspections can be undertaken with arrangements to minimize any legitimate security concerns.
<P>Fifth and last, IAEA safeguards are a vital component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The Security Council acknowledged this in its Summit Statement of 31 January.  Safeguards must be sufficiently effective to uncover any breaches or concealments with a high degree of probability.  The international community must be able to have confidence in the effectiveness of the system.  The findings which have been made by the Agency as regards the DPRK and which are at variance with some information given by the DPRK, are in part the result of strengthened safeguards techniques, and in part the result of more information now being made available to the Agency.  The demand which has been made for a special inspection of sites not declared and which has been endorsed by the Board is also a result of the Agency's asserting its rights.  Where these are resisted, the backing of the Security Council is required to protect the effectiveness and continued credibility of the safeguards system.

<TITLE>International cooperation for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power</TITLE>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>International cooperation for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address  of IAEA Director General at the Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Yokohama, Japan</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>14 April 1993</H4>
<P><HR>Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>It is a great pleasure and honour for me again to address JAIF's Annual Conference.  I should like to share with you some thoughts on two matters which are important to all of us and which are at the centre of the work of the IAEA, namely  "international co-operation for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power".
<P>Our societies will not accept the use of nuclear power unless  safety in the operation of reactors and in waste disposal is high.  It is the responsibility of the nuclear community - scientists, engineers and regulators - to ensure this.  Since safety must be ensured in all countries using nuclear power, international co-operation and international standards are indispensable.  The International Atomic Energy Agency is the most important inter-governmental instrument for achieving this.
<P>Our societies also insist that the expansion of nuclear power in the world must not be accompanied by a spread of nuclear weapons.  They seek guarantees that enriched uranium and plutonium be internationally controlled and used only for peaceful purposes.  In this respect, the IAEA has been given a crucial responsibility to operate the central control  mechanism - the international safeguards system.
<P>Both nuclear safety and nuclear non-proliferation present us today with a number of vital opportunities.  They must be exploited to the full.   Let me  begin with safety.
<P><B>SAFETY</B>
<P>It is strange that much of the public discussion of nuclear power continues as if nothing had happened to nuclear safety since the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 and the disaster at Chernobyl in 1986.  And yet we know that safety is continuously being improved and that these two events stimulated a host of new activities in the safety field:  new conventions on early warning and emergency assistance, new measures for filtered containment venting, fire protection, training of personnel, etc.  We know, moreover, that many of these measures are now being implemented on an international basis.  It is true that risks can never be reduced to zero, but it is possible to demonstrate to the public the progress which has been made.  The reduction in outages and in radiation doses to personnel and the increasing availability bear testimony to better maintenance, more reliable operation and safer nuclear power.
<P>It can be noted with satisfaction that civil nuclear operation in the past year was accident-free, but it was not - of course - incident-free.  None of the incidents was of alarming proportions, but there were serious events - at an RBMK at St. Petersburg in Russia, for instance.  In my own country, Sweden, and in France some generic weaknesses were detected and remedied.  There were also incidents in Germany and here in Japan at Fukushima.  Although all of these incidents attracted a good deal of national and international attention, it should be stressed that the safety checks and safety systems functioned as they were meant to do.  At the same time we are reminded that there is no room for relaxed vigilance.
<P>In particular, the recent serious incident at a reprocessing plant at Tomsk in Russia is a reminder that sections of the nuclear industry which have not been subjected to the full rigour of public and international scrutiny remain potential areas of concern.  Any inadequacies in military nuclear activities will have the same harmful effects on human health and the environment as inadequacies in civilian programmes.  They will also have a damaging effect on perceptions of the safety of the nuclear industry as a whole.
<P><B>INES</B>
<P>It is most important to be able to convey to the public an accurate idea of the severity of accidents or incidents - to that end we need a "Richter scale" for nuclear events.    I am very pleased to tell you that introduction of the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), an idea which was advanced at the IAEA and which was developed jointly by the NEA in Paris and the IAEA, has proved very helpful for public information officers at  nuclear plants and for the media in informing the public worldwide in an understandable way about the relative severity of such nuclear events and thus to place them in their proper perspective.  It is gratifying that forty-six countries - including Japan  - are now co-operating in the use of the scale for nuclear power plants.  The scale has moved out of its test phase into systematic, routine application, and its extension to nuclear facilities other than power plants is being considered.  It would be unrealistic to think that the INES would eliminate the sensationalization of nuclear events, but at least a good tool now exists to characterize the gravity of events - provided, of course, that the will to do so is there.
<P><B>Safety Services</B>
<P>Another encouraging development is that the various safety-related expert advisory services which are offered by the IAEA - known by their acronyms like OSART (Operational Safety Review Team), ASSET (Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team) and RAPAT (Radiation Advisory Protection Team) missions - are being increasingly requested by plant operators and Member States in order to bolster their own national efforts.  Although these missions are sent only upon express request by individual countries, they may be expected to contribute to high safety standards internationally, because they represent the state of the art and because practically all States ask for them.  This year Operational Safety Review Teams (OSARTs) and ASSETs will be going to France, Slovenia, the Republic of Korea, Argentina, Slovakia, Romania, China, South Africa, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic.
<P><B>Nuclear Safety Convention</B>
<P>Safety services have the effect of contributing in a very concrete and practical way to respect for internationally recognized standards, but their use of them implies no automatic commitment by governments to specific nuclear safety norms.  It has become apparent that the time may be ripe to work out a Nuclear Safety Convention in which a number of undertakings on fundamental safety norms and their implementation are laid down.  By adhering to such a convention States would demonstrate commitment to an international nuclear safety standard.  At the same time the Convention would demonstrate to the public that there are international safety norms that have virtually global acceptance.  There is no question of replacing national regulations and national responsibilities and prerogatives, but rather of complementing these at the international level and contributing to international transparency.   The scope, contents and nature of such a  convention have been discussed among  governments for some time.  The norms to be laid down must not be so general that they fail to offer specific guidance or set specific standards, nor must they be so detailed that they become a straitjacket.  Much will depend on the arrangements which are made in the Convention for implementation for instance through peer review of the parties.  These arrangements might permit procedures for dialogue and persuasion.
<P>So far there is only a consensus that the Convention should cover power reactors. If the Convention now being discussed were, in fact, to be limited to power reactors, it seems evident that subsequently other nuclear installations and activities should be similarly covered - notably waste disposal.
<P><B>Nuclear Safety in East and Central Europe</B><P>
One region of the world continues to give rise to special concern from the viewpoint of nuclear safety.
<P>States in Eastern and Central Europe and some of those that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union are wrestling with a four-fold problem:  how to meet current domestic energy needs; how to ensure in that context that their existing nuclear power plants function safely; what to do about completion of unfinished plants, of which there are about 20; and how to plan and finance their future energy sector, including the nuclear component.  All of this against a background of severe economic and other strains.
<P>The dependence of most countries in this region on nuclear generated electricity is high:  50% in Hungary (where the VVER-213s have been running well), 45% in Lithuania, 35% in Bulgaria, 28% in the former Czechoslovakia.  The Russian figure of 12% is an average, I should note.  Some areas of Russia are almost totally dependent on nuclear power.  It is clear that nuclear power is and will remain a substantial provider of electricity throughout this vast region.  The Russian Government  recently endorsed an ambitious plan which foresees building or completing as many as 30 nuclear power stations over the next 20 years.  At the same time it is evident that acceptance of nuclear power in Russia, as elsewhere in the world, will be dependent on the safe and reliable performance of existing reactors and the public's regaining of a confidence that was severely shaken by the Chernobyl accident.
<P>Existing Soviet-designed reactors suffer from a variety of shortcomings, in some cases relating to design and operation, in others stemming from the quality of manufacture and construction.  In some rare instances, as in Armenia, decisions have been taken to close an operating unit.  However, in view of energy shortages, we can expect that the remainder - I am talking about some 60 units - will in all likelihood continue to run, the oldest and most problematic for a limited number of years, others for a longer time.
<P>There is naturally a strong interest all around the world that the safety in these plants be strengthened without delay.  The Chernobyl disaster led to a moratorium on new nuclear power construction in a great number of countries and any new severe accident would reduce prospects  for a nuclear revival.  This concern is a natural basis for substantial assistance to back the efforts which the Russian and other governments in East and Central Europe are making.  The pressing need for comprehensive safety assessments, upgraded safety systems, improved operational safety and strengthened regulatory oversight has been recognized for several years.  The IAEA  helped at an early stage with the safety assessment of the 440/230 VVER reactors in Bulgaria and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) has been giving practical help in that country.  There have been valuable bilateral or joint initiatives elsewhere, notably through the Group of 24, we must regret that the organization and preparation of assistance has been far too slow.  In my view it would have been to the advantage of both donors and recipients if more use had been made of the IAEA, which has a long experience in nuclear co-operation with East and Central Europe.
<P>At present it seems there will be a blend of bilateral and multilateral projects.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London has been given a green light to start active involvement as a multilateral aid channel, with "seed money" pledges coming in from the G-7 and G-24.  Also, the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg is becoming involved with sizeable amounts in loans said to be available.  Last but not least the World Bank in Washington is currently elaborating future energy strategy options for the region.
<P>It is gratifying that these initiatives are gathering momentum, for it is high time to move from the stage of the innumerable technical visits and studies to implementation of practical improvements at the plants.  The necessary sense of political will and urgency needs to be maintained so that the work can be given new impetus through the next G-7 summit meeting here in Japan in July.
<P>I can assure you that the IAEA is trying both by working with other organizations like the G-24, and through its own programme to assist in the efforts which are now underway.  Thanks to financial support, notably from the Japanese Government, the IAEA has been able to carry through in-depth safety analyses of the early generation Soviet-designed PWRs - the  VVER 440-230s.  It is our intention to extend our analytical work to cover the later model PWRs - the VVER 440-213s and the 1000s - and the RBMKs.  Our essential task is to diagnose shortcomings and assess improvements which have been undertaken.  We can mobilize impartial and competent experts to do this.  Decisions regarding remedies involve political and commercial judgement and are essentially for the States concerned.  By now the IAEA has carried out safety-related review missions of one type or another at most reactor sites in Eastern Europe.  These missions have included operational reviews and assessments of operational events as well as design reviews in some cases.  Within the resources made available by Member governments - and shortly through collaboration with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) - the IAEA is thus contributing to the current efforts to assist East European countries in the strengthening of nuclear safety.
<P>In concluding my remarks on the question of nuclear safety in East and Central Europe, let me say that due to the centralized organization of the USSR many of the ex-Soviet States need assistance to build up their own nuclear safety and radiation protection organizations.  As to the power reactors, let us not overlook that nobody knows them better than the people who have designed them and have been working with them for years.  They need assistance to overcome the relative isolation in which they have worked; they need some sophisticated and high quality equipment; they need constructive outside comments and assessment - but they don't need any patronizing attitudes.  On the other hand, nuclear safety cannot be limited to the operation of nuclear power plants.  The hazards involved in the operation of other facilities in the nuclear fuel cycle, including reprocessing plants and waste treatment centres must be assessed and taken into account.  In the former USSR most of those facilities were operated in restricted areas under military authority.  The present openness and transparency of the Russian Federation should help to increase co-operation with the IAEA in these areas.
<P><B>Ensuring Exclusively Peaceful Use</B>
<P>I turn now to the second aspect of my remarks, that of ensuring the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear power.
<P>Controlled nuclear energy was born in war.  So long as nuclear weapons remain stored anywhere there remains a risk that the mushroom cloud will be seen again.  Even when the number of nuclear weapons is rapidly decreasing, as it will do in the years ahead, there is a risk of further countries acquiring such weapons.  As inhabitants of this world and as protagonists of the peaceful uses of nuclear power we have a strong interest in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Nuclear power may owe its birth to the development of nuclear weapons, but their continued existence is a handicap for nuclear power.
<P>Four recent developments have focussed interest in the last few years on the need to        co-operate in preventing the spread of nuclear technology for military purposes.  First, the discovery of how close Iraq came to success in secretly developing a nuclear military capability; second, the ending of the Cold War, which gives hopes for a world in which peace is no longer dependent upon a balance of terror but in which the dissolution of the former Soviet Union is also raising some fears about the trickling out of nuclear material and know-how; third, the recent events in North Korea;  lastly, interest and debate have been triggered by the growing quantities of plutonium, whether separated in the peaceful cycle or recovered through the dismantlement of nuclear weapons.
<P>Before dealing with each of these problems, let me first stress that there is a good deal of positive news.  The conclusion by Russia and the United States in early January of the START-2 Treaty was a major achievement, foreshadowing deep cuts in strategic arsenals on both sides.  Problems remain before we can hope to see this Treaty implemented, but the achievement of agreement, and in record time, is in itself remarkable.  Everything should be done in the months ahead to help ensure ratification and implementation, including financial and technical help needed for the dismantling and recovering of fissile materials from deactivated strategic weapons.  I know Japan is among the countries looking closely at this question.
<P>There has also been a welcome moratorium in nuclear weapon testing that will last at least until this summer and possibly beyond.  We must
certainly hope that agreement will soon be possible on a date for a complete halt to nuclear weapon tests.  Agreement might also be achievable on a
cut-off in the production for weapons purposes of enriched uranium and plutonium.  These two kinds of agreement would be strong and encouraging
signals as we approach the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference due in 1995, at which a decision has to be made on extending the duration of
the Treaty.  One of the persistent criticisms of the Treaty in the past has been that the nuclear "have-nots" have stood behind their substantive
commitments while States possessing nuclear weapons have only given general promises about disarmament measures.  If these promises turn into
specific action, as we can now hope, support for the NPT will be without reservations.  There will be a feeling that all countries are genuinely doing
their part to bring us toward  nuclear-weapon-free world.
<P>The NPT, which has been in force since 1970, remains the cornerstone of international efforts to inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons.  That
the Treaty is a living instrument is shown by the fact that there were more new signatories last year than in any single year since 1975 - a total of nine
States.  Not only did China and France, the last two declared weapon States, come in, but so did Estonia, Slovenia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Namibia,
Niger and Myanmar.  There are now 155 NPT States parties in all.
<P>There are reasons to expect that Ukraine and Kazakhstan will follow suit in due course.  They have declared their intention to do so.  From the
Agency we have already sent technical briefing and fact-finding missions, to over 30 major installations to prepare for safeguards operation in these
countries.  Other teams will go to Latvia, Armenia and Georgia.  Once such countries have signed the NPT, safeguards agreements can follow
between each of them and the IAEA.  We are already helping those States that do not have great depth of knowledge in the nuclear accountancy or
physical protection spheres to enhance their capabilities.  Some individual States such as Sweden, Finland, Hungary and the United Kingdom have
been doing the same.  The idea is to get off to a "flying start" once formal safeguards agreements are ready for signature and implementation.
<P>The emergence of a series of independent nations joining the NPT and accepting safeguards as non-nuclear-weapon States and new
safeguards tasks verification being called for in South Africa, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and in Argentina and Brazil will certainly
expand the areas in the world in which it is verified that nuclear energy is used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  The work laid upon the Agency will
increase.  I only fear that the Agency will be left to do this with the same financial and manpower resources as hitherto.  I cannot help wondering at
times whether it is wise for the international community to dress the safeguards effort in the zero real growth straitjacket, leaving some 60 million
dollars a year for the safeguards operations?  If it were not for the fact that some IAEA manpower resources will soon be freed up for redeployment to
these new tasks through a revised work-sharing arrangement with the Euratom reducing our inspection burden in the European Community, we would
simply not be able to cope with new burdens.  If the international community will require more - and more effective - verification of nuclear activities,
the necessary resources for it must be made available.
<P>I turn now to the lessons of Iraq, and I shall highlight a number of important practical actions that have been taken within the IAEA itself to
strengthen the safeguards system.  The case of Iraq raised the question whether the welcome increase in the number of parties to the NPT is
matched by an unwelcome erosion in the respect for the obligations assumed under the Treaty.  Are there more Iraqs?  What is done to strengthen
the safeguards system to reduce the risk that a secret programme may go undetected?
<P>Even though there were suspicions before the Gulf War about a clandestine enrichment programme in Iraq, the secret facilities were not
identified by satellites, intelligence - or IAEA safeguards.  In the IAEA we have asked ourselves what measures would have increased the chances of
discovering such a programme - and we have introduced such measures.
<P>The first and most fundamental is information.  If a State does not declare what it is doing in the nuclear sphere - and secret programmes are
by definition not declared - knowledge about the activity must come from somewhere else.
<P>To strengthen the information basis of the safeguards system all Member States are now asked to provide the Agency - on a voluntary basis -
with information relating to the export and import of nuclear materials, specified equipment and certain relevant non-nuclear related materials.  If we
had had such information regarding Iraq we might well have detected the emergence of an unusual pattern of procurement in a timely fashion.
<P>In general there appears to be acceptance of this reporting scheme, and we are now establishing a data base to process the information
received.  The submission of the information will be voluntary, as I said, but the hope is that it will achieve universality in due course.  If this comes
about, then it will strengthen and complement the IAEA safeguards inspection and verification regime to a substantial degree.
<P>In another significant development, the Agency has begun to receive some information from third party sources regarding possible evidence
of non-declared materials, activities or facilities in other States having comprehensive safeguards agreements, typically but not always as NPT parties.
I should mention that the Agency's inspectors did not have access to such evidence prior to the Gulf War.  And that it was such evidence that led
many of the Security Council mandated inspections to the right places in Iraq after the war.  Inspectors must have access to good and reliable
information in order to know where to probe.
<P>Some ask, is it appropriate for the Agency to make use of information obtained through satellites or national intelligence?  My answer is that
all information that appears to be safeguards relevant must be received and analysed.  The Agency is supposed to be a watchdog - not an ostrich!
However, there is much erroneous information around and much disinformation.  All information must therefore be critically assessed and analysed.
<P>If it appears, after evaluation of information received, that there are questions to ask, clarifications can be sought from the State concerned.
Should these be withheld or be unsatisfactory, a special inspection can be requested to undeclared sites, even over the objection of the State.
<P>If information is crucial in order to know where to go, the right to unimpeded access for inspectors to any sites which appear nuclear-
safeguards relevant is the necessary means to use such information.  The Agency's right under standard safeguards agreements to call for special
inspections has recently been reaffirmed by its Board of Governors in the case of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  If such inspections are
declined as they were in the case of the DPRK, the matter may be referred to the Security Council.
<P>I should mention one more new feature, namely the invitations which have been extended to the Agency by some States to visit any site or
installation, regardless of whether it has been declared and regardless of whether the Agency has reason to believe that the site contains  something
that should have been  declared but was not.
<P>Such invitations have been offered by Iran, Libya, South Africa and the DPRK.  Such visits have some advantages:  they provide a general
transparency and may enable the Agency to ask to see something when available information may be too vague or uncertain to justify a request for a
special inspection.  Such invitations may also enable a country to clear itself of any allegation that a particular site or installation is clandestine and
should have been declared.  Of course the contribution to transparency and confidence of such offers depends on the willingness of States to adhere
to them.  In the case of the DPRK the refusal to permit visits has only heightened concerns.
<P>I should mention, lastly, among the measures to give the safeguards system sharper teeth, that new analytical techniques give the Agency
and its laboratories powerful means through which much can be learnt even from small particles taken from inspected installations.
<P>It is important to remember nevertheless that the NPT and Agency safeguards, while central, are only part of the total non-proliferation
"architecture" designed to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and comprising a number of barriers and incentives.  Where the political
barriers may not suffice to discourage a State from the weapons path, greater restraint on exports on the part of supplier States may make nuclear
weapon development more difficult.  Such sharpening of the export controls has been agreed to among major exporters.
<P>A major problem encountered by IAEA safeguards inspections has of course occurred in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - North
Korea.  After a number of inspection missions there,  and analysis of many samples and records, significant differences remain between the Agency's
findings and the information given by the DPRK.  As a result the IAEA cannot confirm the correctness of the DPRK's initial report as to the amounts of
nuclear material the country has - notably plutonium.  We have not obtained the necessary clarifications through our inspections and discussions, nor
been given access to take samples from two apparently nuclear-waste-related undeclared sites at Yongbyon, so we have requested access to
additional information and to these sites under the rules relating to a special inspection in our safeguards agreement with the DPRK.  Although fully
endorsed by the Board of Governors of the IAEA, this request has not been acceded to so far and the matter has been submitted to the Security
Council, which is also considering the DPRK's  intention announced on March l2 to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  It is evident that the
obstacles to effective safeguards verification in the DPRK raise security concerns for all countries in the Far East.  Only its return to full nuclear
transparency with unimpeded access for inspections and sample taking will restore confidence.
<P>What I have described to you is a picture of problems and possibilities.  The problems must be tackled, to be sure, but the prospect of a
nuclear-weapon-free world is no longer Utopian, even though it may still be rather far away.  In the present situation it is not unreasonable in my view
to aim at an unlimited extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for review and prolongation in 1995, and also at universal adherence
to non-proliferation commitments.  Such adherence need not consist in accession to the NPT itself  but could be achieved in the context  of a regional
nuclear-free zone type arrangement, as we have seen in the case of Argentina and Brazil.  In such a framework, bilateral and multilateral inspections
could play a mutually reinforcing role.  This is the kind of scenario one could envisage in the context of a Middle East peace settlement.  The Indian
subcontinent - which I have just visited - would probably also require a tailor-made formula, but progress there presupposes both regional detente and
further steps towards global disarmament.
<P>I want finally to touch on the question of plutonium.  The quantities of separated plutonium and plutonium contained in spent nuclear fuels are
growing in the civilian nuclear sector.  So are the quantities of plutonium which we expect to be recovered through dismantling nuclear weapons.  All
this plutonium must be stored, transported and used in a manner that is fully reassuring from a viewpoint of safety and non-proliferation.  While each
country decides how to address these issues, there are international aspects as well.
<P>In recent years the IAEA Secretariat has been requested to provide Member States with data on the production of plutonium.  That information
has been made available and periodically updated.  The Agency also applies safeguards to plutonium in accordance with relevant agreements.  There
is a question whether additional safety and safeguards guarantees could be provided by a stronger involvement of the IAEA in this context.  We have
held one exploratory meeting at which inter alia the idea of international plutonium storage was reviewed.
<P>Certainly, if additional assurances concerning non-diversion and exclusively safe and peaceful use of plutonium are desired, then
arrangements would be called for under which the growing quantities of plutonium would be subject to special controls.  The Statute of the IAEA
envisages a function of this kind for the organization and the dialogue that has recently been re-opened will be continued.
<P>The post-cold-war political climate creates favourable conditions for disarmament and non-proliferation.  We can look forward to a future in
which international co-operation is freed from many of the ideological hindrances of the past.  It can be applied to both the need for nuclear safety and
nuclear non-proliferation and it will help us to maximize the benefits of nuclear power as a major environmentally-friendly and readily available source
of energy.<HR>

<TITLE>Introduction of IAEA Director General  to a Panel on Non-Proliferation at the Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, April 1993</TITLE>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction of IAEA Director General to a Panel on Non-Proliferation at the Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, April 1993</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Panel on Non-Proliferation at the Annual Conference of Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, April 1993</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Yokohama, Japan</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>16 April 1993</H4>
<P><HR>I should like to limit my remarks in this first round of the panel to questions of verification of non-proliferation commitments - essentially the safeguards system of the IAEA.  I must stress, however, that the verification system is only one component among many to prevent a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  I should also stress that safeguards inspectors area not nuclear policemen who can physically intervene and stop proliferation.  They are observers reporting.
<P>The most important barriers to proliferation lie in the technological and political-security fields.  Some 150 States have adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Most of the developing countries parties are not able technologically to develop nuclear weapons.  A concern, however, is that more and more States in this group are rising to the technological level where the option to make nuclear weapons may be available - if the wish is there.  Many States - industrialized and developing alike - have adhered because they feel no political-security need for the weapons.  They may, for instance, through membership in an alliance be protected by a nuclear umbrella.  Some countries have concluded that, although nuclear weapons might offer them some advantages, on balance it might be more dangerous to have these weapons than not to have them.  We are often inclined to kill a poisonous snake whether it is attacking or not.
<P>Against this background we can conclude that detente - globally and regionally - is the most important political means to reduce the motivation to go for nuclear weapons.  Export restrictions are another important factor that may make acquisition of weapons capacity more difficult, if the will to acquire them has not been neutralized.
<P>Let me  now focus on verification.<BR>
<P>Many international treaty commitments do not have any specific arrangements for verification of compliance. Assurance about full respect for commitments regarding non-proliferation, however, is so important that treaties on this subject contain arrangements for verification.  For practically all countries that pledge themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons it is important to feel sure that other countries which have made similar pledges - notably those in the same region - actually respect their pledges.
<P>The task of international verification - safeguards - has been entrusted to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is located in Vienna.  But I should also mention that the European Community has its own internal safeguards which interact with those of the IAEA.  Further, Argentina and Brazil have a joint bilateral verification mechanism which is to co-operate with the IAEA.  And the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are negotiating - so far without agreement - about mutual inspections under the agreement on a  denuclearized Korean peninsula.
<P>IAEA inspection is thus not the only possible verification mechanism - but it is the most important. The Agency's Safeguards Department has a staff of about 500 people, of whom some 200 are inspectors.  There is an office in Tokyo with a few resident inspectors and another one in Toronto but most inspectors are resident in Vienna and travel to the nuclear installations they inspect in various parts of the world.  The annual cost of the IAEA safeguards is about US $60 million - about one percent of the cost of  B2 bomber.  We are under constant pressure from our Member States to cut the costs.  At the same time, we have the obligation to perform the safeguards in any State that submits installations for verification.  Thus, the Agency is now asked to verify all nuclear installations in South Africa and it is expected soon to do so in Argentina and Brazil.  When Ukraine joins the NPT - as it is expected to do - a large number of nuclear installations will have to be inspected.  The Agency is preparing for it.
<P>Now let me turn to the effects that the case of Iraq has had on the safeguards verification system.
<P>At the end of the Gulf War, the Security Council adopted resolution 687 under which Iraq was to accept not to possess any capacity to make nuclear weapons or nuclear-weapons-usable material and the Agency was given the task to ensure destruction or removal or rendering harmless anything incompatible with the resolution.  Like the United Nations Special Commission for Iraq, the Agency was given extensive rights for inspection and these rights were expressly accepted by Iraq in an exchange of letters.
<P>Already the analysis of the results of the first IAEA inspection in Iraq showed that Iraq had been engaged in a secret programme of enrichment of uranium and further inspections gradually mapped a broad secret programme in the field of enrichment and weaponization.
<P>Iraq was - and is - a party to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the IAEA had carried out safeguards inspections at the Tuwaitha nuclear centre for many years.  Thus, side by side with declared and inspected activities, Iraq had been carrying out a large secret programme in violation of the NPT - since it obviously aimed at the making of nuclear weapons, and in violation of the safeguards agreement - since it should have been declared.  It should be noted that Iraq had not made use of any of the quantities which it had declared of highly enriched uranium for its bomb programme.  What had been placed under safeguards inspection had been left untouched, presumably in the awareness that any violation in this regard would have been reported immediately and led to some international reaction.
<P>The discovery of the secret programme in Iraq led to serious questions about the verification system.  Although some critics have wanted to see in this discovery a failure of the system, it would be more exact to say that the discovery demonstrated the limitations which existed in the system - as it was organized and practiced.
<P>The system was geared to control and verify nuclear material and nuclear installations declared by the inspected State.  What then about the possibility of secret non-declared installations?  The inspectors cannot roam large territories in blind search of non-declared nuclear installations and the Agency has no espionage organization or satellites.
<P>What the case of Iraq showed was above all the effect of the limitation on information upon the safeguards system.  It does verify that hundreds of declared nuclear installations and vast quantities of declared nuclear material around the world remains in exclusively peaceful use.  It is quite important to know that there is no diversion of material from the peaceful civilian sector to a secret weapons sector.
<P>The questions that the case of Iraq evoked were, first, are there more cases like Iraq and, second, what can be done to strengthen the safeguards system so that it may discover nuclear material and installations which have not been declared.
<P>I have said in response to the second question that the IAEA needs three kinds of access.  We must first have access to information to know where to go.
<P>In this respect, important things have been done in the Agency since Iraq.  A system under which States report to the IAEA on exports of and imports of nuclear material and equipment has been adopted and recommended to Members.  Had we had such a system before the Gulf War, it is possible that a pattern of procurement would have become visible which would have led to serious questions.  Secondly, while before Iraq the Agency was not informed by Members about findings from satellites or other national means of detection, it now does receive such information.  Some Members have felt uneasy about the Agency receiving "intelligence" and it is clear that all information must be critically analysed because there is much disinformation circulating.  However, if the Agency is to be a watchdog - and not an ostrich - it must be able to receive information from Members and make use of it.
<P>The second important measure taken in the Agency is to assert the right to access for inspectors to any site which the Agency has reasons to believe is safeguards relevant - regardless of whether it has been declared.  This is what has happened in the case of the DPRK.  The Agency has very good reason to believe that two sites which it has learnt about are nuclear-waste-related and safeguards relevant and it insists upon its right of inspecting them.  When this right has not been granted so far by DPRK, the Agency's Board of Governors has made of the third kind of access which I referred to - namely access to the Security Council.  I hope it will be possible to resume inspections and make all the inspections we have requested in the DPRK without any need for action by the Security Council, but the Council is the competent body to act regarding international peace and security and full acceptance of the safeguards verification system is an issue that the Council will not - for sure - ignore.
<P>In conclusion, while the case of Iraq demonstrated the limitations which existed on the safeguards verification system, the case of the DPRK shows the greater capacity of the strengthened verification system.  It would be rash to guarantee that any violation of non-proliferation pledges would be discovered with 100% certainty - but I think one can assert that the chance of detection of secret programmes or even some lesser violations are much greater today than before the Iraq case.<HR>

<HR>
<OL> 
<LI>    In a resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of Governors of the IAEA requested the Director General of the IAEA to report on behalf of the Board non-compliance of the DPRK with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material required to be safeguarded.
<LI>    The formal report is ready and has been submitted to the Secretary-General for transmission to the Council.  I am glad to have the opportunity already today informally to brief the Council about the resolution and its background.
<LI>    DPRK adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but it was not until 10 April last year that a safeguards agreement pursuant to NPT entered into force.  A so-called Initial Report of nuclear material and installations was submitted on 4 May 1992.  It listed inter alia a nearly completed reprocessing plant referred to as the Radiochemical Laboratory in which a small quantity of plutonium was stated to have been reprocessed in 1990 from damaged fuel rods which had been irradiated in the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor.
<LI>    In May last year I was, myself, invited to the DPRK and visited a number of nuclear installations, including the "Radiochemical Laboratory".  I was told that experience in reprocessing had been gained through an experiment in 1975-77, when a few grams had been separated from fuel irradiated in the IRT research reactor.  In replies to enquiries as to whether any pilot reprocessing plant had been operated between 1977 and 1990, the answer was that the leap had been taken from the experiment in 1975-77 to the construction of the Radiochemical Laboratory.
<LI>    Teams of IAEA safeguards inspectors visited DPRK installations from June 1992 and received much co-operation.  They also found some inconsistencies between the Initial Report and other information given by the DPRK and the findings made by the IAEA.  This is by no means unique.  Many errors and mistakes occur in reporting and the normal course of events is that these are cleared up through closer investigation.  In the case of the DPRK some relatively minor inconsistencies have been solved but some major ones have not gone away despite questions, discussion and analysis - which began already in the summer of 1992 and continued up to a meeting between experts in connection with the meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors in February of this year.
<LI>    The most important points on which information has differed from Agency findings are the following:
	   <UL>
	<LI>(a) Nuclear waste which was stored within the compound of the Radiochemical Laboratory and from which samples were taken for analysis, proved to have an isotopic composition indicating that some plutonium should exist which has not been declared.  Whether there are grams or kilograms the analysis cannot tell;
	<LI>(b) Sample analysis of the plutonium which has been declared indicates that there should be some nuclear waste which has not yet been made available for sampling and analysis;
	<LI>(c) The DPRK tells the Agency that only one reprocessing campaign has been carried out in the unfinished reprocessing plant - the Radiochemical Laboratory - in 1990 using irradiated fuel elements from the 5 MW(e) Experimental Power Reactor.  The Agency's analyses suggest that there should have been several such operations.
	   </UL>
<LI>Many hours have been spent in attempts to explain these inconsistencies.  The plutonium declared and analysed and the nuclear waste declared and analysed are like two gloves which don't match.  There should be two more gloves to match the pair which we have seen and analysed.
<LI>In view of these inconsistencies the Agency became much interested in information obtained from a third party about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste and which are located at the Nyongbyon nuclear village, one of the buildings in the vicinity of the Radiochemical Laboratory - the unfinished reprocessing plant.
<LI>Two Agency officials were permitted to visit this building in September last year.  They were told it was a one-storey building and they could see that some military but no nuclear equipment was stored in it.  What the Agency officials did not see, but what satellite pictures taken during different phases of the construction of the building later showed us was that there was a lower storey which was now invisible because of landscaping and which had a construction and a configuration that strongly suggested its purpose was nuclear waste disposal.
The two Agency officials I mentioned visited also a second site in September, a site that they became convinced was not nuclear-related.  It was therefore written off as of safeguards interest.
<P>
<LI>Satellite pictures taken in the fall were further made available to the Agency indicating that a location at Nyongbyon which has the obvious layout of a nuclear waste storage site was being covered by earth.  The road to it was erased and trees and  shrubs were planted.  I might mention that the layout of the site is very similar to the waste site at Tuwaitha outside Baghdad - a site with which the Agency is familiar.  I might also mention that while concealment of plutonium is not so difficult, because even a few kilograms is no larger in volume than a fist, the concealment of waste associated with the separation of plutonium is very much more so.  For every kilogram of plutonium derived from reprocessing, waste would amount to about 200 cubic metres.  Therefore, for larger quantities of plutonium, the associated waste could amount to many thousands of cubic metres.  Such wastes could only be stored in appropriate waste storage facilities.
<P>It is against this background that the two sites which the Agency wishes to visit and take samples, assume particular importance.
<LI>    During a meeting in Vienna on 30 November to 1 December 1992 between the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy and officials assisting him and myself and experts accompanying me, the inconsistencies were discussed.  I stressed the urgent need for the Agency to visit again the building which our officials had seen in September and the site which had been covered and landscaped last fall, and for the Agency to obtain samples from these sites.  This was not a request for a special inspection under the safeguards agreement, but a request for a visit in pursuance of an invitation issued earlier by the Minister for Agency officials to see sites whether or not they were included in the Initial Report.  The Minister and his officials responded that it would not be "normal" during such a visit to take samples but they did not decline the request.  Subsequent cables did not, however, bring any positive response. On the Agency side we felt that a visit of this informal kind would be more acceptable to the DPRK and less dramatic than a special inspection - a measure never before taken vis-à-vis an undeclared site.
<LI>In the absence of a positive response to our request for a visit by officials, we eventually, on 9 January, signalled our need for information to be obtained under the safeguards agreement's articles concerning special inspections - Articles 73 and 77.  This was resisted, but a mission headed by the Agency's Director of External Relations was accepted.  They visited Pyongyang on 20-22 January 1993. The mission explained in no uncertain terms that in the absence of the clarification - including the possibility of visits by officials which the Agency sought, and notably through taking samples from two sites that appeared waste-related - the Agency was not in a position to verify the correctness and assess the completeness of the Initial Declaration made by the DPRK.  The seriousness of the situation was thus made absolutely clear.  The formal request for special inspections, which followed later, could hardly have been a surprise.  The DPRK officials did not, however, show any signs of readiness to accommodate our request.  They asserted that the sites were non-nuclear and military.
<P>It should be recalled that at this time tension was rising on the Korean peninsula due to the expected military manoeuvre "Team Spirit" in the Republic of Korea.  The DPRK officials urged that all questions that needed clarification should be discussed between DPRK experts and the sixth Agency ad hoc inspection team which was due to arrive soon.
<LI>The sixth inspection mission arrived and spent nearly two weeks in intense discussions, which regrettably failed to give the needed clarifications.  Nor was it enabled to visit the two sites from which samples were desired.  Upon the return to Vienna of the sixth inspection team and analysis of its results,  it was decided in the Secretariat that there was no option other than formally to request a "special inspection".  This was done  in a cable of 9 February.  An annex to the cable listed inconsistencies between information provided by the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA.  The cable specified the two sites which the Agency had reason to believe were waste-related and to which the Agency wanted access to take samples.  The reply of  15 February from DPRK failed to accept our request but signalled that an expert DPRK mission would come to Vienna to discuss inconsistencies.  It stressed that the two sites which the Agency wished to visit were military and not nuclear-related.
<LI>The mission, headed by the Minister for Atomic Energy himself, arrived just before the IAEA regular February Board meeting.  While the discussions during the weekend of 20 and 21 February brought some relevant data concerning the operation of the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor, it did nothing to clarify the serious inconsistencies and offered no access to the two sites from which the Agency wished to take samples.
<LI>The impasse which thus appeared to have arisen was reported to the Board of Governors of the IAEA at its meeting on 22-25 February.  In my statement before the Board I said that the Agency did not want to assume lightly that an Initial Report was incorrect or incomplete.  Regrettably, however, the Secretariat was not in a position to confirm the correctness and completeness of the declaration such as it stood.   The Secretariat was of the view that the DPRK had the obligation under the Safeguards Agreement (Art. 3) to  co-operate and that such co-operation must include access to additional relevant information  as well as locations which the Agency had reason to believe were related to nuclear waste.
<P>As the detailed information given to the Board included safeguards confidential material by experts from the Secretariat, the Board met in closed session.  It received a detailed account of the inconsistencies relating to plutonium and nuclear waste and it was shown the pictures on the basis of which the Secretariat had concluded that two locations of the Nyongbyon nuclear centre were related to nuclear waste.
<P>I stressed that when looking for nuclear waste that matched the plutonium declared, the Secretariat could not possibly ignore any information about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste.  These sites, located within a nuclear centre, could not be immunized form inspections, I said, by the presence or placing of some military equipment on them.
<LI>On 25 February the Board adopted without a vote a resolution in which it took note of the significant inconsistencies between the declarations of the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA which remained unresolved, and called upon the DPRK urgently to respond positively to the request for access for additional information and additional sites.  The Board requested me to report within a month.
<LI>The resolution of the Board was immediately transmitted to the DPRK.  In a reply of 10 March the DPRK referred to the ongoing military exercise "Team Spirit" and the state of semi-war which existed in the DPRK.  In the circumstances, receipt of an Agency inspection team could not be considered.
<LI>    Shortly thereafter, on 12 March, the Agency received the DPRK announcement of its decision to withdraw  from the NPT as a measure to defend its supreme interests.  In a cable I advised the DPRK that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force until any withdrawal from the NPT took effect  and that a declaration of an intention to withdraw shall not impede implementation of the Safeguards Agreement.
<LI>On 16 March the DPRK replied, inter alia, that it "cannot receive the Agency inspection teams".
<LI>On 18 March, the Board of Governors met and adopted - still without a vote - a further resolution confirming that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force and that it was essential and urgent that the DPRK enable the Agency to take the necessary measures to resolve differences and ensure verification of compliance with the Safeguards Agreement.  The Director General was asked to report on the response of the DPRK at a Board meeting on 31 March.
<LI>In a cable to the DPRK the day after the Board meeting, i.e. 19 March, I reiterated the request for access by Agency inspection teams and advised that if access were not obtained, I would have no choice but to report non-compliance by DPRK with the Safeguards Agreement when the Board met again on 31 March.  I stated that the Agency was ready to discuss arrangements which might minimize legitimate security concerns about inspections at military sites.
<LI>On 30 March, one day before the Board meeting, the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy sent a further cable in which he stated that the DPRK was always ready to respond if the Agency's Secretariat wished to consult about the implementation of the Safeguards Agreement - thereby apparently implying recognition of the continued validity of the agreement.  At the same time, however, the position was confirmed that there was no readiness to discuss the issue of "special inspection".
<LI>In my statement to the Board on 31 March I pointed to the DPRK's reaffirmation of its express rejection of the Agency's right to make a special inspection - despite the decision of the Board on 25 February that the access requested to additional information and additional sites was essential and urgent.  The rejection was serious, I said, not only because it presented a challenge to the Agency's right of special inspections and the Board's endorsement of that right, but also because in fact it precluded the Agency from taking samples which might bring clarity where there was now inconsistency and uncertainty.
<LI>In its resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of the IAEA found that the DPRK "is in non-compliance with its obligation under the safeguards agreement with the Agency", and that the Agency is "not able to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material ... to nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices."  The Board called upon the DPRK to remedy its non-compliance by granting access to specific additional information and to the two locations indicated by the Agency.  It further decided, in keeping with Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute and Article 19 of the Safeguards Agreement, to report the non-compliance and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material to the Security Council, and to all Members of the Agency and to the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Lastly, in order to stress that the Agency itself continues to regard the matter as a high priority, the Board requested the Director General to continue his efforts and dialogue to implement fully the Safeguards Agreement and it decided to remain seized of the matter.
<LI>This was Thursday, 1 April - last week.  The formal report has been transmitted to the Secretary-General and is now distributed to the Security Council.
<LI>In concluding I would like to underline a few points:
First, the lack of co-operation from the DPRK with the Agency in clarifying inconsistencies is very serious and amounts to non-compliance as the Board of Governors has determined.
<P>In particular, it is worrying that the Agency is not in a position to verify the correctness of the quantity of plutonium which the DPRK has declared; rather the findings of the Agency point to the existence of plutonium which has not been declared.
<P>Second, the Agency has sought  over a period of time with patience and persistence to bring clarity where there is inconsistency.  While these efforts have met with some      co-operation by the DPRK, the explanations given to us have been ineffective and inadequate to clarify the most important inconsistencies.  Moreover, the DPRK has so far shown active resistance as regards inspection visits by the Agency to additional sites and sample-taking.
<P>Third, that a simple declaration by the DPRK that the sites are military and/or non-nuclear related cannot preclude inspection, where, as is the case, there is prima facie evidence of nuclear and safeguards relevance of the sites.
<P>Fourth, that the sites are not immunized by the presence or placing of military objects on them.  However, inspections can be undertaken with arrangements to minimize any legitimate security concerns.
<P>Fifth and last, IAEA safeguards are a vital component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The Security Council acknowledged this in its Summit Statement of 31 January.  Safeguards must be sufficiently effective to uncover any breaches or concealments with a high degree of probability.  The international community must be able to have confidence in the effectiveness of the system.  The findings which have been made by the Agency as regards the DPRK and which are at variance with some information given by the DPRK, are in part the result of strengthened safeguards techniques, and in part the result of more information now being made available to the Agency.  The demand which has been made for a special inspection of sites not declared and which has been endorsed by the Board is also a result of the Agency's asserting its rights.  Where these are resisted, the backing of the Security Council is required to protect the effectiveness and continued credibility of the safeguards system.

<TITLE>Non-Proliferation:  Past, Present and Future</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Non-Proliferation:  Past, Present and Future</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address of IAEA Director General at the International Conference Nuclear Technology and Politics</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Rjukan, Norway</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>17 June 1993</H4>
<P><HR>Especially after the discovery of the secret nuclear weapons programme of Iraq and the break-up of the Soviet Union we have seen many warnings that the Non-Proliferation Treaty and other barriers against nuclear proliferation are insufficient.  Without ignoring the specific new risks that can be identified, one can - and I do - take a much more optimistic view, namely that it should be possible to consolidate the present non-proliferation commitments, to universalize them and to achieve a rollback in the case of non-declared de facto nuclear-weapon States - and to bring about far-reaching nuclear disarmament among the nuclear-weapon States.
<P>Some experts seem to think that the break-down of the cold war has destroyed order and discipline and can lead to nuclear "recklessness" among "client States" which were formerly held in tight reins.  Whatever the truth - if any - in this gloomy vision, it is offset by the expanding active co-operation of the nuclear-weapon States in favour of non-proliferation and many other things.  I would worry more about a possible change of regime in Russia and China, and a break down of the non-ideological pragmatic co-operation between major powers which we now witness daily.
<P>Is there justification for the optimism which I express and which is in line with even more daring recent visions of Robert McNamara, Gerard Smith and others of a nuclear-weapon-free world?  We must recognize, of course, that when we look back into the past, we find that the early optimism and idealism which characterized the Baruch plan proved unrealistic.  The antagonistic world immediately after the second world war was not a possible framework for international control of all nuclear material and facilities - nor has the present world reached a level of co-operation that would allow such a scheme.
<P>The "Atoms for Peace" plan declared by President Eisenhower was certainly less radical than the Baruch plan, but still overoptimistic for its time in projecting an international agency to remove fissionable material from the stockpiles of the three weapons States then existing and distribute them to others for peaceful use.  It is nevertheless to the "Atoms for Peace" plan that we owe a central part of the non-proliferation strategy of the last 40 years, namely the sharing of peaceful nuclear technology in return for pledges of peaceful use.  This dual approach characterizes the IAEA Statute with its objectives of enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace on the one hand and of ensuring "so far as it is able" that the transfer of technology will not serve any military purpose.  The provisions of the Statute which allow the Agency to "acquire or establish" "facilities, plants and equipment" in the nuclear field (Art. III: A:7) or to "establish control over the use of special fissionable materials received by the Agency, in order to ensure that these materials are used only for peaceful purposes" are echoes of the early internationalism.  They have not been used so far, but might conceivably become practicable if we continue ambitiously to move toward a nuclear-weapon-free world.
<P>Before I describe how in the coming years we might come back to the optimistic ambitions of the early days in the nuclear field, I must, however, discuss the approach which has been developed to non-proliferation during the many years in between - originally modest, with time increasingly stronger.
<P>President Kennedy's gloomy vision of a world of dozens of nuclear-weapon States assumed that States would acquire nuclear weapons if they reached the technical level which enabled them to do so.  That this pessimistic vision did not come true is due to the realistic and tenacious work which has resulted in what we today term "the non-proliferation regime".  It builds to a great extent but not exclusively on incentives and disincentives.  The central idea of the Atoms for Peace is an incentive to non-proliferation in the shape of offers of nuclear technology on condition of pledges of exclusively peaceful use.  A continuation of the earlier American policy of secrecy would most certainly have provided an incentive for many States to develop enrichment and nuclear power technology indigenously - without any non-proliferation pledges.
<P>Originally, of course, the pledges of exclusively peaceful use had regard to the particular nuclear technology or nuclear material imported.  With the Non-Proliferation Treaty a quantum leap was taken and the required pledge of exclusively peaceful use was extended to cover all nuclear installations and material, in return for pledges of facilitation of the transfer of nuclear technology and of efforts at disarmament.  With this development non-proliferation graduated from having been a condition attached to the export of individual items to a comprehensive general policy of mutually reinforcing elements.
<P>Underlying the non-proliferation regime is the understanding that the major incentive to acquire nuclear weapons is national security concerns.  To eliminate the incentives the concerns must be allayed.  In the case of many countries the concerns were met through the nuclear umbrellas offered by alliances.  Other countries - like Sweden and Switzerland - concluded themselves that it might be even more dangerous to have than not to have nuclear weapons and renounced such weapons out of fear of being subject to pre-emptive nuclear strikes in a crisis.  Other countries were given a measure of assurance by the declarations made by nuclear-weapon States in the Security Council, promising non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States.  To the vast majority of developing countries nuclear weapons were not in 1970 a realistic security tool.
<P>There has sometimes been a tendency to describe comprehensive IAEA safeguards as  the key barrier to proliferation.  I would certainly not underestimate the role of the IAEA safeguards system, but it is important to recognize that the creation and maintenance of political-security incentives to non-proliferation is the most crucial factor.  Safeguards are not in themselves an incentive to non-proliferation, but through the confidence which effective verification creates, they help to eliminate security concerns which might otherwise arise about neighbours or other States perceived as potential adversaries.
<P>It must be remembered, however, that if a State begins to perceive a strong security need for nuclear weapons, its formal adherence to the NPT and the application of full-scope safeguards may not prevent it either from withdrawing from the NPT or from trying secretly to develop or acquire the weapons.  One must therefore in no case lose sight of the importance of maintaining the political/security disincentive to nuclear weapons acquisition.  The main reason for my optimism about non-proliferation lies precisely in the detente of today and the consequent reduction in political/security incentives to acquire nuclear weapons.  With the drastically reduced risk of a general nuclear conflagration and with accelerating nuclear disarmament there is no general political/security incentive for non-nuclear-weapon States to abandon their status.  This perception may well have helped Argentina and Brazil to renounce any nuclear weapon option in favour of non-proliferation pledges.  South Africa's decision to adhere to the NPT and to terminate its own weapons programme is evidently linked to the writing off of any threat from Communist-inspired countries.
<P>We can also see how the remaining principal proliferation problems are linked to perceived political/security considerations - in the Middle East, on the Indian sub-continent and on the Korean peninsula.  It is evident then that the main effort to prevent further proliferation and to achieve a rollback, as in South Africa, must be made in the political/security sphere and consist in the creation of peace and detente and in security guarantees.
<P>Let me turn, however, to the role of international verification.  Confidence about an exclusively peaceful use of nuclear installations and material can only come from transparency.  The safeguards system may be said to be a  form of institutionalized transparency.
<P>The technical objective of safeguards verification has been stated to be to "deter from diversion by risk of detection".  This formulation creates the impression that the system is a genuine barrier, deterring proliferation.  It is true, of course, that some State which might have become tempted to develop nuclear weapons after once having renounced them and having accepted safeguards, might be deterred from the temptation because it would know that the reactions of other States would be very strong if the safeguards system reported diversion.  In most cases, however, the function of the system is to provide the confidence that the State cannot itself create by its own declarations that its material and installations under safeguards are used only for peaceful purposes.
<P>The verification system, operated by the IAEA, now costing some $65 million per year and currently employing some 500 people of whom some 200 are inspectors, is essentially an audit system.  Safeguards operated under the NPT focus on nuclear material and its basic features are material accountancy supplemented by containment and surveillance.  This focus on the nuclear material - as the crucial material for weapons - emanated from a wish to minimize intrusion and to guard against industrial espionage by inspectors.  Regrettably the approach does somewhat limit the vision of the inspectors.  This might be one feature which should be taken into account in efforts to increase confidence by greater transparency.  Inspectors should have greater freedom of movement.
<P>Other limitations upon the safeguards system relate to its capacity of detection.  It is geared to detect so-called "significant quantities" of nuclear material - some 8 kg of Pu or 25 kg of HEU - not gram quantities.  Both in the case of Iraq and in the case of Romania gram quantities of Pu were separated without being detected by safeguards.  The same might be the case in the DPRK.  This is a consciously introduced limitation.  If it were at all possible to design - and it probably is not - a fine-meshed verification system that would detect very small quantities of diversion it would be unacceptably costly.  Moreover it could give rise to a disturbingly high number of false alarms.  No one has therefore suggested such a sharpening of the system.
<P>Another limitation is that the safeguards system can only assure us about non-diversion here and now.  It is like a radar scanning the horizon.  It does not tell us about the intentions of governments - what they might do tomorrow.
<P>A further limitation, which became evident in the case of Iraq, was that the system has been limited, in practice, to declared programmes.  This limitation has been well understood by governments, but it was the cause of a lot of criticism after the revelation of the secret programme in Iraq.  The Agency, not knowing and reporting about the existence and locations of the facilities in the Iraqi enrichment programme, has even been accused of giving Iraq a "clean bill of health" before the Gulf War.  This is an exaggerated criticism.  The careful reader would have seen that the Agency only reported that "all material under safeguards has been accounted for".  In fact, Iraq did not, as was feared by some, divert any of this material to its weapon programme.  In this sense safeguards acted as the deterrent they were intended to be.
<P>After the revelations in Iraq, which raised the question as to whether the increasing number of adherents to the NPT on the one end masked increasing disregard on the other, the demands on the safeguards system have changed.  Increased assurance is now sought against the existence of undeclared material and facilities and with the political momentum created by the shock of Iraq the Agency's Board of Governors and Secretariat have taken a number of steps designed to enhance the Agency's ability to uncover non-declared nuclear installations and material.  I have referred to the need for three types of access:  access to information, access to sites and access to the Security Council.
<P>The most crucial element for discovering secret nuclear activities is access to information.  If the State accepting safeguards withholds information about some nuclear activities, the information must come from somewhere else.  International inspectors cannot roam vast territories in blind search for secret installations or hidden material.  They must be directed to specific places and installations - as they were in Iraq thanks to information obtained through defectors and satellites.  The IAEA has neither satellites nor spies.  However, it amasses a lot of information from its overall verification activities; it is beginning to obtain a lot of information from Member States about exports and imports of nuclear material and equipment; it seeks to extract clues from an analysis of media and other open sources, and - since Iraq - it does receive some information which Member States have obtained through national means, e.g. satellites.  Some Members have not been comfortable with the idea that the Agency might receive "intelligence" information  - and the DPRK has denounced the reliance on satellite imagery.  I have taken the view, supported by most Members, that the Agency cannot ignore any relevant information.   However, in view of the existence of much disinformation and erroneous information, the Agency must critically examine all information available to it.
<P>Secondly, there must be a right of access to sites about which relevant information has been obtained.  In the case of Iraq, that right was founded upon cease-fire conditions and is unlimited.  For NPT-type safeguards the IAEA is now stressing its right to undertake so-called special inspections.  Despite strong resistance the Agency has asserted that right in the DPRK.  To those who point out that the Agency never asserted a right of special inspection of a non-declared location prior to the case of the DPRK, I would respond that this is simply because we have not previously been in possession of any information about non-declared sites meriting such inspection.
<P>Thirdly where access to information and to sites is not forthcoming, access to the Security Council assumes particular importance.  The relationship agreement between the United Nations and the Agency provides for prompt interaction between the two organizations, including the Security Council.  The Agency is obliged to refer cases of non-compliance with a safeguards agreement to the Security Council which may then decide to take enforcement action.  In the Gulf War and its aftermath, the Security Council's use of its power as the primary repositary of enforcement action in the UN system resulted, inter alia, in Iraq having to concede far-reaching rights of inspection for the IAEA and the dismantling of its nuclear-weapons-related programme.
<P>It may be unrealistic to assume - and it is at least uncertain - that the Security Council would marshall substantial military might in every case which appeared to involve nuclear proliferation.  We can, however, be sure that the Council will be firm in taking whatever measures it deems fit in the event of further breaches of agreement.  Here I should recall the Council's Summit Statement of 31 January 1992 which emphasized not only the integral role of fully effective IAEA safeguards in implementing the NPT but the Council's readiness to take "appropriate measures in the case of any violations notified to them by the IAEA".  The Council is acutely conscious of the risks inherent in proliferation, of the need for Agency safeguards to be sufficiently effective to uncover any breaches or concealment with a high degree of probability and that the international community must be able to continue to trust in the credibility  of safeguards.
<P>Some have argued that the Security Council should itself take charge of nuclear inspections, saying that it can be "a far tougher force than the IAEA" (Wall Street Journal, 1993-03-18).  However, the Council has shown no signs of wishing to take over such a function and we have noted from its Summit Statement that it can be expected to continue to rely on the IAEA in this respect.  I would also say that the issue is not "either" the IAEA or the Council.  Events have shown that both may be involved.  The particular characteristics of any inspection undertaken are less dependent upon the body mandating the inspection, than on the extent of the rights which the inspectors are given.  In Iraq, defeated in war, these rights are unlimited.  In the DPRK they are laid down in the safeguards agreement.
<P>I would conclude my comments on the safeguards system by suggesting that the case of the DPRK illustrates the changes that have taken place since the revelations in Iraq.  In the case of Iraq information about a vast secret programme was missing.  In the case of the DPRK, advanced methods of chemical analysis of material from inspected installations plus satellite imagery have provided much relevant information.  In Iraq no requests were made for special inspections to non-declared sites because the sites were unknown.  In the DPRK such requests were made when proposals for other types of visits were turned down.  Lastly, in the DPRK as in Iraq the Security Council is, in the last resort, the authority which has to ensure access for verification, where access is not willingly granted.
<P>I am not asserting that the safeguards system of the IAEA is now perfect.  A number of improvements still need to be made.  The system was designed some 30 years ago as the world's first on-site inspection system.  States have since then become more accustomed to confidence-building measures in the form of international inspection.  The long negotiated Chemical Weapons Convention contains some features - notably regarding practicalities of access - which appear to be advances over nuclear safeguards.  Such features, in my view, should be transposed to IAEA safeguards.  There is also room for governments to agree on greater degrees of nuclear transparency by adding new features to the safeguards system, e.g. fuller reporting about their nuclear programmes, wider access of inspectors to installations, and perhaps acceptance of so-called environmental monitoring, i.e. the taking of samples of soil and water for radiological analysis.  Whether, in order to economize, it will be possible to "individualize" the inspection effort according to country, is more questionable.  The safeguards system must continue to be non-discriminatory - like the security screening of airline passengers.  Governments will hardly accept being treated differently.
<P>The criticism which has been voiced by a handful of writers of the safeguards inspections as sleepy and ineffective stands in sharp contrast to the praise expressed by governments.  Perhaps this criticism is based on a lack of understanding that a system that is to verify thousands of installations around the world must have some routines, some log sheet, some order.  But I agree it remains important at the same time to maintain the curiosity and alertness of the inspector, to fully use the human resource that he or she represent.
<P><B>Export Controls</B>
<P>I have commented at length on safeguards verification because that is where I have most knowledge.  As I said, however, safeguards are a confidence-building measure more than a barrier to proliferation.  NPT and safeguards agreements can theoretically be denounced as we have recently seen.  Export controls, on the other hand, are designed to make the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons more difficult, where the political/security disincentives may not have worked.  The case of Iraq showed that there was room for considerable improvements in export controls and that the system is now being strengthened.
<P><B>Non-Proliferation in the Future</B>
<P>I started on an optimistic note and I shall also conclude on a hopeful tone.  A climate of detente, stability and nuclear disarmament will lead to diminished general interest in nuclear weapons acquisition.  However, for the universalization of non-proliferation and the unlimited extension of commitments several things are needed.  There is global detente, but some regions remain very tense.  Drastic nuclear disarmament has been agreed, but it is not yet accomplished.  International verification is being much strengthened to provide the confidence that States need so as to dare to live without, or with few, nuclear weapons - but the safeguards strengthening process is not yet finished.  It is not naive to aim at the universalization of non-proliferation and at an unlimited extension of the NPT but it is prudent to be aware of the considerable hurdles.
<P>Accelerated nuclear disarmament measures by the nuclear-weapon States have a great value per se and will also much facilitate the NPT Conference in 1995.  I am not sure that the absence of a complete test ban agreement would block success, but I am sure that the conclusion of such an agreement would be of great help.  A cut-off in the production of direct use nuclear material for weapons purposes would also seem a plausible proposition at a time when the US and Russia seem to have much more such material than they need.  A verified cut-off might also be an interesting venture for countries like Israel, India and Pakistan.
<P>To universalize reliable non-proliferation pledges detente will be needed in the Middle East, on the Indian subcontinent, the Korean peninsula and in the region of the former Soviet Union.  Tailor-made solutions above and beyond adherence to NPT may be needed in several of these cases.  We have already seen how North and South Korea have agreed to renounce enrichment and reprocessing capacity.  Such agreement obviously goes beyond the NPT and some such arrangement may well be needed in the Middle East where no legitimate peaceful need can be seen for such capacity at present.  A nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  would certainly only come about in the context of a peace settlement in that region.  It would in turn be of importance for the extension of the NPT.  Unless it comes about and comprises all relevant States including Israel, there is a possibility that Arab States will be reluctant to commit themselves to non-proliferation for an unlimited period of time.  I should add that a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would require far-reaching arrangements for verification - perhaps combining international verification with some arrangements for mutual verification.
<P><B>IAEA's Role</B>
<P>I have repeatedly stressed that the primary factors for success lie in political/security considerations.  However, the need for confidence that commitments are being respected will continue to result in the need for effective on-site inspection.  Some have suggested that the NPT-type safeguards agreements should be renegotiated in the light of recent experiences.  I do not think this is either realistic or risk-free in the immediate future.  The approach, I think, is more likely to continue to be incremental.
<P>Provided that the safeguards system of the IAEA is further strengthened, developed and given adequate resources it is not far-fetched to believe that it could be used to verify the peaceful storage or use of nuclear material - highly enriched uranium or plutonium - once the material has been recovered from dismantled weapons and moved to the civilian sector.  In fact this is what now is happening in South Africa.  The safeguards system is likely to be used in further nuclear-weapon-free zones - as it is now used in the Tlatelolco and Raratonga Treaties.
<P>The safeguards system might also be used to verify a cut-off - a task that would be both very difficult and resource demanding, involving as it would large bulk-handling facilities.
<P>Even a complete test ban, it has recently been suggested, could be anchored in the IAEA.  Obviously some new department would be needed in the Agency for co-ordination of reports from national systems of seismological surveillance.  However, the nuclear expertise of the Agency could be of direct use in identifying the radioactive traces of any test explosion.  Furthermore, the Board of Governors of the IAEA with its balance between North and South and special representation of States which are advanced in the technology of atomic energy, would seem to be a well designed body to supervise the implementation of a test ban treaty.  It is not necessary to create new international organizations for every new task.
<P>In conclusion, new verification tasks will continue to arise with further measures in the nuclear arms control and disarmament field.  Safeguards are dynamic, not static.  Personnel with new expertise can be recruited for new functions.  Were some or all of the political developments which I have outlined to come to fruition, the IAEA could be faced with significant new challenges.<HR>

<TITLE>Prospects of Multilateralism in the Non-Proliferation Regime </TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Prospects of Multilateralism in the Non-Proliferation Regime </H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General,<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR></H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Bonn, Germany </H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>April 1993</H4>
<P><HR>The era of the cold war is over, and with it almost four decades of dominant bipolarity and ideologically coloured struggles.  In many ways this makes the competition between States less dangerous and the multilateral regulation of problems less difficult.  This, indeed, in turn, permits and demands new and constructive thinking and action in the fields of security, disarmament and international organization.
<P>Non-proliferation - preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries - was comparatively less hampered by the cold war than many other desirable international measures, because here the interests of the two superpowers mostly coincided.  A good deal of success was achieved, but much more needs and can be done as we approach the Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995.
<P>What is often termed “the non-proliferation regime” consists of many approaches and components.  They can be examined from different perspectives.  One is to identify different barriers, the first being political and consisting in the absence of an incentive to acquire nuclear weapons or the presence of an incentive not to acquire such weapons.  Détente in a region, the absence of any neighbour who has or is acquiring nuclear arms, will reduce a State's incentive to acquire them.  Security guarantees will have the same effect.  For some developing countries promises of assistance in return for a non-proliferation commitment may constitute a significant incentive to make such commitments.
<P>Nuclear disarmament by nuclear-weapon States will tend to make the use of nuclear weapons a more remote option and will thereby encourage others to remain non-nuclear.  By contrast, the opposite effect can be expected from retention and further development of nuclear weapons and a broad deployment of “mini-nukes” that would blur the distinction with conventional weapons and make the use of nuclear weapons more likely.
<P>A second barrier may be seen in the legal commitment entered into under a treaty.  States do break treaties sometimes, but there is a certain inhibition against doing so.  It is likely that the arguments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for withdrawing from the NPT will be found inadequate by most States and that the world will seek to induce DPRK to maintain the legal commitment it entered into when acceding to the NPT.
<P>A third barrier is the verification system linked to the legal commitments - in most cases IAEA inspection.  To be sure, the inspectors are not police that will stop a transgressor.  Rather it has been said that the purpose of safeguards is to “deter from diversion by risk of detection.”  Of course, the overwhelming majority of States concluding safeguards agreements with the Agency do not do so in order to deter themselves from any future temptation.  They do so because they want to create maximum confidence that they are not developing nuclear weapons.  It remains true, nevertheless, that safeguards must be sufficiently effective to uncover any significant breaches with a high degree of probability and that any State tempted to violate its commitment must be aware of - and hopefully deterred by - this risk of detection.
<P>A barrier of a different kind is control of the export of nuclear material and equipment.  It is recognized today that almost any State at a certain technological level could develop nuclear weapons, provided that it is able and willing to devote  the necessary resources.  Thus, if the barriers which I have described fail, a State's  ambition to develop nuclear weapons may still run into practical obstacles as a result of  export restrictions on nuclear technology, hardware and material. This may at least considerably delay weapons development.
<P>One may choose other criteria for analysing the non-proliferation regime.  I shall seek here to distinguish between a relatively easily identifiable multilateral approach and another approach that may be said to be bilateral.  The simplest illustration is the difference between the NPT, the pre-eminent multilateral approach, and the bilateral agreement between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea on a nuclear-weapon-free Korea.
<P>The reason why I address non-proliferation efforts from this angle is not that there is any sudden new enthusiasm for bilateral approaches, but rather a scepticism in some quarters about the effectiveness of the multilateral approach.
<P>There is a good reason, in my view, to follow a multilateral approach to non-proliferation, as the incentive to acquire nuclear weapons chiefly lies in the fear that others have them or may acquire them.  Hence credible pledges to forego the nuclear weapon option - especially among neighbours and in regions - tend to reinforce each other.  The NPT and the Treaties of Tlatelolco and Raratonga represent the multilateral approach.
<P>The multilateral treaties under which non-proliferation is pledged are complemented by multilaterally organized verification:  IAEA safeguards.  The inspection regime for each country is laid down in a bilateral agreement with the IAEA, but it follows a set pattern and the IAEA applies the safeguards on behalf of the international community.
<P>There is no tendency to abandon the multilateral approach - whether in commitments, in verification or in export restrictions.  On the contrary, the new political climate is allowing a further significant extension and strengthening of the multilateral regime.  At the same time, however, the discovery of the clandestine Iraqi nuclear programme and the emergence from the Soviet Union of a dozen new States with little experience of their own in nuclear accountancy have pointed to some weaknesses in the present multilateral system.  All this has led to consideration of remedies within the multilateral context, of limits in what the system may realistically achieve and of supplementary bilateral or regional approaches.
<P>Let me first discuss the extension of commitments under the multilateral regime, the shortfalls and weaknesses found in it, and how it could be supplemented by bilateral approaches.  I shall then discuss the recent criticism of safeguards verification, how this verification is being strengthened and how it can be supplemented by bilateral measures.
<P><B>More commitments</B><BR>
Although the Tlatelolco Treaty has still not entered into force, considerable progress toward its entry into force was made when Argentina and Brazil decided bilaterally to open up their nuclear sectors to each other and, in addition, to accept comprehensive international verification.  With the recent adoption of a number of amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty, and with new hopes that Cuba may join, there is an expectation that this multilateral treaty will enter into force for all of its parties in the not too distant future.  This would, indeed, be an important accomplishment.  Several factors would have contributed to it, one being the reduced importance generally attributed to nuclear weapons in the new international climate.
<P>South Africa's adherence to the NPT may also be seen as a fruit of the new political climate.  As explained by the President of South Africa in a speech on 24 March 1993, the perceived threat of communism no longer being present, the reason for maintaining a nuclear-weapon option disappeared.  Once South Africa had joined the NPT, a number of African countries followed, and the prospect of an African nuclear-weapon-free zone became a distinct possibility - whether de facto, through universal adherence of African States to the NPT, or through an additional treaty.  A second continent would be completely committed to nuclear non-proliferation.
<P>China's and France's adherences to the NPT mean that all declared nuclear-weapon States now firmly and formally support the objective of non-proliferation and the means specified in the NPT to attain it.
<P><B> Shortfalls in adherence</B>
<P>The number of countries still outside all the non-proliferation treaties is getting smaller.  In the Middle East and Arab world, the significant ones are Israel and Algeria.  In Asia, they are India and Pakistan.  Also, some former members of the Soviet Union have not yet joined.  While Israel's adherence to the NPT is eagerly demanded and would be welcomed by all, it must be noted that accession alone would probably not be enough to create confidence in this region of conflict.  Accession to the NPT would oblige Israel to dismantle any nuclear weapons it might have and to abandon any nuclear weapons intentions - as South Africa declared it did.  However, it is not clear that it would oblige the country to abandon its reprocessing activities or the plutonium it is assumed to have - only to declare what it has and to open everything for inspection.  As neither Israel nor any other country in this region has a nuclear power reactor, let alone breeders, any reprocessing and enrichment activities would appear intended for weapons purposes.  In an agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone, the parties might proscribe such activities or prescribe a moratorium on them until there would be an identifiably peaceful need for them and - perhaps - multinationally-controlled installations for them.
<P>It is improbable that either India or Pakistan would join the NPT without the other State also joining.  There is a strong bilateral element that would have to be satisfied.  Here again, however, there are not only bilateral questions.  India has consistently linked its stand on non-proliferation to global progress in disarmament.  It may be assumed that, in particular, measures by China in the sphere of nuclear disarmament would be important to India.  Security guarantees might also be of importance to both India and Pakistan.  In addition, the question of the existing enrichment capacity in both countries, the reprocessing capacity in India, and the stocks of highly enriched uranium and plutonium would require solutions that satisfy both parties and the international community.  A special regime would be needed.  Acceptance of NPT obligations alone would hardly be enough.
<P>The cases of North and South Korea show two parties in a tension-ridden area seeking to solidify their declared nuclear weapon-free status with a bilateral accord under which they committed themselves to abstain from acquiring enrichment and reprocessing capability - for which there would hardly be a convincing economic rationale.  Mutual confidence was also to be strengthened by adding bilateral mutual inspections to IAEA safeguards.  Although at the time of this writing (September 1993) North Kroea's continued adherence to the NPT is somewhat uncertain, it is very much to be hoped that the combination of a multilateral and a tailor-made bilateral regime will become reality.
<P>I leave aside the cases of Ukraine and Kazakhstan which, hopefully, perhaps with some special security guarantees and appropriate economic arrangements, will adhere to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States in due course.
<P><B>Weaknesses in the multilateral non-proliferation regime, including safeguards</B>
<P>Apart from the non-adherence of some crucial States to the non-proliferation regime, two further threats to the regime are often pointed to at the present time.  One is the threat that nuclear material and technology as well as nuclear engineers and scientists might trickle out from the former Soviet Union to States interested in acquiring a nuclear-weapon capacity.  The remedies lie in effective export controls, new jobs in CIS States and in creating disincentives to proliferation in the potential recipient States.  This problem is not exclusively one for the former Soviet States.  It should be noted, however, that there would be no customers for any “trickling,” if non-proliferation commitments were solid, reliable and universal.  The concern about “trickling” thus points directly to the other weaknesses presently perceived in the non-proliferation regime - that of more Iraqs.
<P>When the NPT was concluded, the fear was that industrially advanced countries might feel inclined to acquire nuclear weapons.  Today, the situation in this group of countries appears stable.  Many of them would be capable of making nuclear weapons, but they have decided against it.  The fear is rather that many developing countries may now have reached such a technological level that they could develop nuclear weapons - if they were to so decide.  Iraq was the rude awakening.
<P>It is clearly the case of Iraq that has given rise to doubts whether the impressive non-proliferation edifice is solid.  The number of parties to the NPT has been increasing continuously, yes, but is the adherence genuine or in some cases just a cover for secret ambitions?  The IAEA's comprehensive safeguards regime is expanding with each new party to the NPT, yes, but are there more Iraqs evading IAEA verification and secretly preparing for bomb-making?  Is the DPRK another country party to the NPT with bomb-ambitions and perhaps trying to evade IAEA controls?  So it is asked.
<P>It seems clear that the dominant opinion in the CIA is that there is a growing - not diminishing - threat of nuclear proliferation.  In remarks on 15 December 1992, Mr. Robert Gates, then Director of the CIA, warned that “the increased instability of the new world order has encouraged an increasing number of States to distrust alliances and seek advanced weapons of their own.”  He referred specifically to Iran, Iraq and the DPRK as countries which are actively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons capacity.  President Clinton's appointee as Director of the CIA, Mr. Woolsey, is reported to have said in a Senate Committee hearing on 26 February 1993 that more than twenty-five countries were engaged in the development of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons - without, however, specifying how many were working on nuclear weapons.  It is not helpful to lump all these weapons together as “weapons of mass destruction.”  Nuclear weapons present an incomparably greater threat and must be viewed separately.
<P>While some US officials have been pointing to the risk of more States seeking nuclear weapons, a number of American non-officials specializing in the subject of nuclear proliferation have been, in addition, exceedingly - not to say excessively - critical of the IAEA safeguards as a means of verification and some of them have suggested that verification measures might be better conducted under the responsibility of the Security Council.
<P>The New York Times was fair enough to write in an editorial on 15 February 1993 that as the IAEA had not been provided with any intelligence about Iraq's clandestine programme by any Member because they did not know about it, it was not the Agency's fault that the programme was undetected.  Gary Milhollin, in an amazing New Yorker article (1 February 1993) that seems saturated by aversion against the IAEA, is not so generous.  He cites an “American official” as saying about Agency inspections under the Security Council:  “the IAEA missed the Iraqi bomb before the war, and it's missing it again.”  The statement quoted, not substantiated by credible evidence, stands in stark contrast to the testimony given by Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci - former Vice-Chairman of the Special Commission in Congress on 29 June 1993.  He said: “Along with the damage inflicted by the war and subsequent military actions, we believe these [IAEA] inspections have effectively put the Iraqi nuclear weapons program out of business - at least for the near term.”
<P>A high point in Mr. Milhollin's article is another quote from an anonymous participant in one of the early Iraq inspections under resolution 687 saying that “It is against the IAEA's culture to find anything.”  Why?  Because, in his view, the Agency was given the job to spread nuclear technology to developing countries and, at the same time, to check that nuclear exports were not used to make atomic bombs.  “The conflict of interest is obvious,” says the author, “if the Agency catches somebody making bombs, it means that the nuclear exports ... should not have been promoted.”  It is, in short, insinuated that safeguards inspections are a deliberate sham, because they might otherwise discover something that should not have been exported.
<P>It is worth noting at this point that there may be a convergence between criticism of the Agency by hawks and greens.  Both are against the dissemination of nuclear technologies to developing countries, the hawks for fear that such technology might be helpful on the road to bombs and the greens because of blind aversion at least to nuclear power.  In a recent letter to the New York Times (1993-02-28), Gordon Thompson, who in 1992 made a study of the Agency for Greenpeace, urged that “the Agency should shed its nuclear power promotion function, which conflicts with its mission of preventing proliferation.”  An alliance of greens and hawks pressing this line, if successful, would erode the support for the NPT that has slowly grown among developing countries.
<P>It is important to ask where this pessimistic view of the multilateral non-proliferation regime leads its critics?  It seems clear that some of the critics feel that the only real protection against proliferating “rogue States” is military hardware.  In an article in the British paper, The Guardian, on 5 January 1993, Paul Rogers, Professor of Conflict Analysis at Bradford University,  writes as follows:
“US nuclear planners, like their Russian counterparts, simply do not believe that the proliferation of nuclear weapons will be controlled.  They envisage within a decade a world with many more nuclear States, most of them in the Third World, and they believe that strategies and weapons must be developed in the expectation that ‘small nuclear wars in far-off places' may become a feature of 21st century conflicts.”
<P>One of the means devised to meet the proliferation danger perceived is GPALS, Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, a modest successor to the Strategic Defense Initiative, consisting of lots of super-versions of the Patriot missiles to meet the few nuclear-armed missiles that might be launched from some third world country.  According to an article in the Sunday Telegraph (1992-12-13) by its Defence Correspondent, Christy Campbell, there is already co-operation between the US and Russia on GPALS, Russia fearing “breakaway nuclear powers such as Ukraine and the potential new ones, including Iran and Iraq.”  Mr. Campbell reports that GPALS is meant to be able to shoot down 200 warheads and that Britain, like the US and Russia, is looking at strategic defences against maverick new nuclear powers.
<P>This approach, however, is also meeting criticism.  In an article in Arms Control Today (September 1991), Thomas W. Graham states as follows:
“Building limited missile defense - as part of an approach to 'manage nuclear proliferation' - a step advocated by top Pentagon officials, though not by some other proponents of the management approach - would probably cost more in a single year than all US non-proliferation efforts have to date, while still not providing protection against many of the most likely means of delivery.”
<P>Mr. Graham argues that one should “think more about winning the non-proliferation battle than managing the consequences of losing it.”  He says - and I agree - that it is now time to think big “concerning a multilateral initiative to 'solve' the proliferation problem” in the rather small number of States which cause concern.  He seems to favour inter alia a comprehensive test ban, a verified cut-off of operation and production of weapons-grade material and, ultimately, a “changed security environment” in  which “nuclear weapons programs can be rolled back (emphasis supplied), following the precedent of South Africa.”
<P>I shall revert to this vision of a “changed security environment” but first discuss ideas which have been advanced on how to develop a substitute for  IAEA safeguards.
<P>In the opinion of Milhollin, Leventhal, Kay and other critics of the IAEA, the task of verifying nuclear non-proliferation should be entrusted to the
Security Council and be performed by some subsidiary organ like UNSCOM (the Special Commission for Iraq).  To Leventhal the Board of Governors
of the IAEA is a bunch of officials promoting nuclear power and caring little about proliferation, while the Security Council consists of Ambassadors
who have broader perspectives - a view that ignores the simple reality that the  delegations to each organization receive their instructions from the
same source.
<P>In an article about the DPRK, David Kay suggested that “the decision of how to respond should be moved immediately from the IAEA in
Vienna to the far more serious (sic) forum of the UN Security Council.  The Security Council has shown in Iraq that it can be a far tougher force than
the IAEA ...” (Wall Street Journal, 1993-03-18).  Indeed, the Security Council is the sole repository of military enforcement power in the UN system,
and in Iraq it made use of this power.  But it is not certain that it will marshal half a million men in every conflict.  Nor is it easy to see that it is a “more
serious forum” than the IAEA.  In the case of the DPRK, the Council has chosen, at any rate initially, the path of persuasion rather than displaying
tough force.
<P>To the critics, IAEA inspectors are timid diplomats visiting locations agreed upon by the host States, while UNSCOM inspectors descend in
surprise missions uncovering clandestine activities, material and equipment.
<P>It is not worth the effort of trying to find who are the originators of this caricature of IAEA inspections in Iraq.  Some staff of the Special
Commission and some of the Commission's friends in the US intelligence community and defence establishment were never very happy about the
Security Council having given the Agency direct responsibility for the nuclear inspections.  Attempts were made by various means not only to assist
and support the Agency - as the resolution required - but also to direct and control it in its task, and this led to friction.  Over time an accommodation
occurred and there is no doubt that the assistance from the Commission has been both necessary and valuable.  An objective analysis of the working
methods and styles of the inspection teams of the two organizations, I think, will not reveal significant differences in approach or style.  The Agency
had the advantage of being able to draw on an existing organizational infrastructure, on a large, trained inspectorate of its own and to use analytical
laboratories of its own.
<P>In criticism of IAEA inspections the most diverse points have been made:  for instance, that Agency inspectors not coming from nuclear-
weapon States would not recognize a nuclear bomb if they stumbled on one, the implication being, I suppose, that inspectors should be drawn from
nuclear-weapon States.  However, these are mostly silly points.  There has been no difficulty in supplementing in-house inspectors with all kinds of
expert inspectors from Member governments.  Another matter would be if inspections requested by the Security Council were to have some
paramilitary character.  Although a few inspections undertaken in Iraq under the Agency's responsibility had almost such a character, it might be
argued with some reason that, should paramilitary operations be necessary, another type of  organization than the IAEA would be more appropriate.
<P>It should be well understood that in the case of inspections under Security Council resolution 687, Iraq formally agreed, as a part of a cease
fire, to grant very special and extensive rights to UNSCOM and IAEA. The inspection rights of the IAEA pursuant to NPT as set forth in INFCIRC/153,
on the other hand, were freely negotiated by many governments and show how far free governments wanted nuclear inspections to go in 1971.  In a
renegotiation today they might go a little further - as they have done in the Chemical Weapons Convention  (CWC) - but not much and it is, indeed,
very hard to understand why any NPT inspections, in which there is so much experience in the IAEA, and for which it has some 500 staff and a large
laboratory, should be placed under some subsidiary organ of the Security Council.  This conclusion was also reached by the New York Times in its
editorial of 15 February 1992:
<P>. . . it's difficult to see how replacing the IAEA with a new agency, as some suggest, would keep Iraq under better surveillance or stop the next
nuclear renegade . . .
<P>It is amazing that this suggestion could get so far as to be discussed seriously in the New York Times.  In the Agency's Board of Governors,
its General Conference, in the Security Council and in the General Assembly there has never been anything but solid praise for the Agency's way of
handling inspections.  The Agency's verification activities are ultimately controlled by a 35-member Board of Governors, in which all the five nuclear-
weapon States, as well as nuclear-advanced non-nuclear-weapon States, participate and in which, in addition, there is a certain North/South balance.
The consensus support which this representative structure gives to safeguards is valuable and not easily replicated  elsewhere.
<P>Subordinating the IAEA to an UNSCOM type of organ or setting up a nuclear inspectorate under the Security Council may not appear as more
than a bizarre idea that has obtained more publicity than it deserves.  This does not, mean, however, that all criticism of the safeguards system is
unfounded.  Some important proposals for changes in the system were advanced well before the armed action in Iraq, notably during the 1990 NPT
Review Conference. I myself outlined a programme of changes at the IAEA February Board in 1991 before the clandestine programme in Iraq had
been discovered.
<P>NPT-type safeguards were designed primarily with open industrialized countries in mind. There was concern about the risk of revelation of
industrial secrets and of impediments to nuclear research and production.  Over the years these concerns have proved  to be largely unfounded.
However, they were responsible for an approach concentrating on so-called strategic points and on declared nuclear material, rather than on
installations.  The comment has also been made that the system was somewhat mechanistic, with check lists and log sheets for routine data collection
and too little room for initiative and spontaneous inquisitiveness by inspectors.
<P>Some critics will contrast this “bureaucratic” IAEA system with the daring, dashing inspections carried out by the IAEA under Security Council
auspices and during which the Iraqis were taken by surprise and important evidence was secured.  This is not a meaningful comparison, however,
because no universal system of inspection will provide for the kind of access rights that were imposed upon the defeated Iraq.
<P>It is more meaningful to examine what, after years of negotiation, was obtained for the verification system of the brand new Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC).  Such an examination will show the level of intrusiveness that governments are ready to accept today.  There are,
indeed, some important differences between inspections under NPT-type safeguards and those under the CWC.  Designations of inspectors are
deemed accepted under the CWC, unless expressly rejected; visas must be granted for multiple entry of inspectors; the inspectors have an express
right to use their own means of communication and of being taken to the site of inspection without delay.  Finally, parties to the CWC may request
challenge inspections of any location; such a request can only be ruled out by a decision of a qualified ¾ majority of the Board of the organization.
Acceptance by IAEA members of some of these features would clearly improve the safeguards system.  It must be noted, however, that any system
that has the task of visiting hundreds of installations, verifying many thousands of records, and of analysing vast numbers of samples, must have
some order, some routines.  With hundreds of inspectors the system cannot be left to their individual intuition.  At the same time it is important that the
system should not stifle the inspectors' imagination and individual initiative and lead the inspector to the conviction that because a thousand
inspections have not uncovered any violations,  the next one could not do it.  The Agency's Board and Secretariat and its advisory organ on
safeguards are at present (Autumn 1993) engaged in exploring how routine safeguards inspections might be reduced, and  compensated by greater
transparency in the nuclear programmes of States and wider rights of access for the Agency short-notice inspections.
<P>It is rather widely recognized that the safeguards system, as practised before the Iraq revelations, was effective in verifying non-diversion of
declared nuclear material at declared nuclear installations.  It was - and is - a good audit system.  Indeed, it worked also in Iraq as well, where no
safeguarded nuclear material was directed to the weapons programme.  What was less widely understood before the Iraq revelations was that the
system was not really equipped to discover clandestine programmes.  What has been done to equip it better for this purpose?
<P>In the summer of 1991 I said in the Board of Governors that three forms of access were of crucial importance to strengthen safeguards:
access to information, access to sites and access to the Security Council.
<P>Provided that you have information about where to look, the right to access to sites for inspection becomes meaningful.  In the case of Iraq
this right is unlimited.  In the case of NPT-type safeguards the Agency has asserted - and in the case of the DPRK, the Board has supported this
assertion - a right of access through special inspection to any site which it has reason to believe is nuclear-related and relevant to safeguards,
regardless of whether it is military.  We have stated to the DPRK, however, that we are willing to discuss inspection arrangements that would minimize
legitimate security concerns.
<P>There are several differences between IAEA special inspections and the CWC challenge inspections.  The latter can only be undertaken at
the initiative of a member, while the Secretariat of the Agency can demand a special inspection.  On the other hand the IAEA Secretariat must have
reason to believe that a site is nuclear-related and safeguards-relevant before requesting a special inspection, while a challenge inspection may be
prompted by mere doubts or suspicions.
<P>Those critics of the IAEA safeguards system who advocate that nuclear non-proliferation verification should be placed under the authority of
the Security Council do not seem to have noticed that the Council is free at any time, under its authority to maintain peace and security, to request the
IAEA - or some ad hoc body if it so wished - to perform inspections.  Conversely, the IAEA is free - indeed, in case of a State's non-compliance with a
safeguards agreement, obliged - to refer safeguards issues to the Council, which alone in the UN system can take enforcement action to induce a
State, if need be, to accept inspection.
<P>Even with a substantially strengthened safeguards system it can hardly be 100% guaranteed that every case of clandestine nuclear
programme would be detected, but there should be a substantial improvement compared with the pre-Iraq situation.  It is possible that there will be an
insistence on supplementary bilateral inspections in some sensitive areas.  Such inspections have been discussed between North and South Korea  -
but have not been agreed on.  In the Middle East it seems likely that both Israel and the Arab States may demand that verification in a nuclear-
weapon-free zone should have a large component of bilateralism.
<P>In a thoughtful article in the journal Foreign Affairs, John Deutch, now Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Defense writes as follows:
“Conventional IAEA inspections serve a useful role, and there are no significant examples of diversion from safeguarded facilities.  Expanding
IAEA inspections to suspect sites is also welcome.  But since IAEA inspections are not designed to detect covert programs, there should be realistic
expectations about how much warning the IAEA can provide, even with expanded authority for challenge inspections.  These limitations make it
necessary to maintain the option of insisting on inspections outside the IAEA framework.  This could be done through bilateral arrangements, such as
the United States is encouraging between North and South Korea and like Brazil's and Argentina's agreement under the 1968 Treaty of Tlatelolco.  It
could also be done, perhaps, under the direct auspices of the UN Security Council”  (Foreign Affairs, Fall 1992).
<P>It should be noted, however, that although Argentina and Brazil, two countries with close, friendly relations, have agreed to open up their
nuclear activities to each other, it may not prove quite so easy for antagonistic countries to accept mutual inspections or for the Security Council to
negotiate intensive inspection of the kind accepted by Iraq after defeat in war in order to obtain a cease-fire.
<P>What are the means of attaining a world free from the risk of nuclear proliferation?
<P>It is an interesting sign of the post-cold-war climate that even some very experienced diplomats and statesmen are beginning to think aloud
about a nuclear-weapon-free world.  Gerard Smith, in an article in the Bulletin for Atomic Scientists (December 1990) describes a scenario under
which national nuclear forces would be sharply cut back in a first phase and the testing, production and deployment of nuclear weapons would be
halted.  In a second phase, the remaining small forces would be assigned to a multilateral force.  Nations would have custody of them but any decision
on their use would be taken by the supplying nations jointly, and only in retaliation for aggression.  In a third, rather long and final phase, an
international organization would become the “safe deposit” for nuclear weapons until they were abolished.
<P>Robert McNamara , in an article in the International Herald Tribune on 1993-02-24 similarly argues a return to a non-nuclear world, “insofar as
it is possible.  One or more declared nuclear-weapon States - or an international agency - he says would have to retain a small nuclear force, with a
maximum of 100-200 warheads, as protection against blackmail.  In the shorter term he advocates a strong role for the Security Council, which should
agree to prohibit the development, production and purchase of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles “by countries which do
not have them.  Countries which violated such prohibitions would be subject to economic sanctions.  If this had no effect “a UN military force would be
given a mandate to eliminate the production capability and destroy any stocks produced or bought.”  “Countries that have such weapons - including
both declared and undeclared nuclear powers such as India, Pakistan and Israel - would be subject to inspection and control, and would be asked to
approve a treaty prohibiting the first use of nuclear weapons.”
<P>I cite these writings to show that there is no lack of long-term “big thinking” at present.  I should like to conclude, however, with some “big
thinking on the near-term perspective  of 1995.
<P>Gerard Smith writes that the challenge for today is to develop “anti-proliferation strategies,” including the “rollback” of instances of proliferation
which have occurred, e.g. in Israel, India and Pakistan. Ambassador Smith is thus more ambitious than Mr. McNamara.
<P>For 1995 many express the hope for universalization and an open-ended extension of the NPT.  There is hope that the drastic nuclear
disarmament agreements will come into effect and that both a complete test-ban and a verified cut-off of production of nuclear material for weapons
use might be attained.  Such results would certainly go far beyond the wildest hopes that might have been entertained only a few years ago.  It is
probable that such a general disarmament climate would have a positive influence on the previously intractable areas, the Indian sub-continent and
the Middle East.  However, a growing political détente will be needed if proliferation rollbacks are to take place in these areas.  Bilateral and regional
measures will be needed in addition to universal ones.  A Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone - as a part of a zone free of weapons of mass
destruction for that area - may also prove to be important for the extension of the NPT.  It might prove difficult for Arab parties to the NPT to accept an
extension that binds them for an unlimited time unless Israel has taken decisive steps to “roll back.”
<P>To conclude:  I do not see any retreat from the multilateral approach - neither from the NPT, nor from IAEA safeguards - but I do see some
bilateral and regional measures supplementing the multilateral ones.  In his testimony to a US Senate Committee, Mr. Woolsey, the new CIA Director,
referred to “an expanding role for multilateral agreements and international organizations in stemming worldwide arms proliferation” (Washington
Weekly Report, 26 February 1993).  I am sure there will be a continued important role for IAEA verification.  NPT-type safeguards are being
strengthened.  They are part of the wider concept of nuclear transparency, which will remain essential for building confidence.  There is some
discussion of using IAEA safeguards to verify that nuclear material recovered in the context of disarmament is used only for peaceful purposes; there
is renewed discussion of an international regime for the management of plutonium to give assurances that this material is not misused; and there are
suggestions that the IAEA might play a verification role in a cut-off of production of weapons-usable nuclear material.  Lastly, it has been proposed that
the IAEA might be entrusted with the operation of a complete test ban agreement.  I am confident that, given resources and assuming that the present
efforts to strengthen the safeguards system are successfully completed, the IAEA would have the ability to assume roles such as these.<HR>

<P><HR>In today's world the situation of the nuclear industry in any country is highly dependent upon nuclear events in other countries.  The stagnation in the growth of nuclear power in the western industrialized world can be traced not only to lower than expected electricity demands, but also to the powerful psychological impact of the Chernobyl disaster.  In order to revive, the nuclear industry in each country must put not only its own house in good order but also help ensure that all the world's nuclear industries are in good order.  
<P>In my view the global revival of the nuclear power option is of crucial importance as a means of adding to the world's supply of energy without adding to the supply of CO2.  Awareness of this need is increasing but broad acceptance of nuclear power in Europe and the US will require further efforts in the fields of safety, waste disposal and non-proliferation.  There must be no more big accidents.  And we need to phase out the nuclear weapons era.
<P>The IAEA as an intergovernmental instrument is deeply involved in the efforts to strengthen nuclear safety, notably in Eastern and Central Europe and in the former Soviet Union.  It is engaged - at the initiative of Minister Töpfer - in the working out of an international nuclear safety convention; it is active in drafting international standards for the safe disposal of nuclear waste; and it is contributing through its safeguards operations to the international efforts to prevent a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  Success in all this international work is of importance for the acceptance of nuclear energy.
<P>In the post cold war world we have reason to be optimistic, both about nuclear disarmament and about non-proliferation.  I shall discuss one component of the efforts to prevent proliferation, the IAEA safeguards system - its achievements, limitations and potential.  Before I do so I must, however, place it in perspective among the several other measures which together seek to prevent a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.
<P><B>Barriers to nuclear proliferation</B>
<P>The most reliable means of preventing nuclear proliferation lie in creating such military and political conditions, locally, regionally and globally that States do not feel any need to acquire or develop nuclear weapons.
<P>Alliances and security guarantees - nuclear umbrellas - have convinced many industrially advanced States, for instance within NATO, that they did not need any nuclear weapons.  Some other States, like Sweden, have felt that it might be more dangerous to have nuclear weapons than not to have such weapons.
<P><B>Détente</B>
<P>The global détente that has come with the end of the cold war is not only leading the US and Russia to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons from deployment and to dismantle many thousands of nuclear warheads, but also leading many other States to downgrade the value of the nuclear weapon option.  As the Swedish Prime Minister said recently, the magic substance today is not plutonium but silicon.  In this new political climate it is not surprising that Argentina and Brazil - earlier often mentioned as potential proliferators - are renouncing the nuclear weapon option and opening all their nuclear installations to inspection.  Nor is it surprising that South Africa, freed from the fear of cold war confrontations, has decided of its own will to roll back from a weapons capacity which it possessed - the first country to do so.
<P>It is true, of course, that once you have learnt how to make a nuclear bomb you cannot unlearn, but you can destroy the tools and invite continuous inspection to create confidence about your non-nuclear-weapon status.  The IAEA is now invited to South Africa precisely for this purpose and to verify, as it must under the safeguards agreement, that all the highly enriched uranium which was contained in the South African nuclear devices has been included in the nuclear material which South Africa declared when it joined the NPT.  And in Iraq the Agency is asked by the Security Council to monitor on a long-term basis that the scientific knowledge and engineering know-how which remains in the country do not again result in uranium enrichment and nuclear weapons programmes.  Absolute confirmation that the last gram of enriched uranium in a country has been declared and that not a single engineer is designing a centrifuge is not possible.  What can be achieved, if there is full co-operation and transparency, is a high degree of assurance that comes from extensive inspection and analysis based on information from a range of activities.
<P>The areas of the world where the risk of proliferation is the greatest are those where international tension and conflict still prevail - the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and the Korean peninsula.  Here, as elsewhere, the creation of détente is the best means of securing non-proliferation. 
<P><B>Export Restrictions</B>
<P>We must recognize, of course, that in the short and even medium term, détente and peace may be elusive in some regions.  Accordingly there must be policies and measures to prevent and impede nuclear proliferation also where tension continues to provide States with inducements to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.  Even in these situations, some types of international co-operation can make proliferation more difficult, notably restrictions on the export of certain sensitive technology and equipment.  After the discoveries through IAEA inspectors that Iraq had imported crucial equipment and material for its uranium enrichment programme, a widening group of nuclear supplier countries have strengthened their nuclear export restrictions.
<P><B>Limitations in technological capacity</B>
<P>Most developing countries in the world are still without the industrial and technological base which would enable them to embark on a nuclear weapons programme, even if they wished to do so.  One lesson of the case of Iraq was, however, that a growing number of developing countries are attaining a technological level which might enable them to pursue the nuclear weapons option.  When the NPT was concluded, the fears were about industrialized countries.  Today the fears are rather about developing countries.  The most effective way to counter such risk is to establish and maintain détente to eliminate any incentive to develop a nuclear weapon capacity.  The provision of assistance and co-operation of various kinds, e.g. peaceful nuclear techniques for medicine, agriculture and industry, as well as in the development of nuclear energy, as rewards for non-proliferation commitments may also strengthen the reliability of these commitments without significantly adding knowledge that could be used to pursue a nuclear weapons option.
<P><B>Risk of "trickling" from former Soviet Union</B>
<P>Another new nuclear proliferation fear is that the combination of economic strain and loosening discipline and control in the former Soviet Union may lead to a trickling of nuclear material, equipment and engineers to potentially proliferating countries.  Fortunately so far these fears have not become reality.  We often see news items about the smuggling of uranium or plutonium.  The swindlers who are peddling this stuff have an interest in advertising it as bomb grade material.  When we have checked the stories, however, we have found so far that they are about natural uranium, depleted uranium or low enriched uranium or about minute quantities of plutonium.  However, a continued vigilance is needed to guard against the emergence of any black market.  The IAEA is now continuously monitoring media news in this field and following up reports with relevant national authorities.
<P>To sum up what I have said so far, détente and security guarantees may remove incentives to develop nuclear weapons. Moreover, export restrictions and the technological underdevelopment of many countries remain obstacles to proliferation.  What do safeguards do?
<P><B>The role of safeguards</B>
<P>I should like to begin by stressing the positive role of safeguards.  States accept safeguards on their nuclear material and installations normally to demonstrate to their own public opinion, to their neighbours and to the international community that they fully abide by their non-proliferation commitments. Testimony by an independent international organization has a much greater credibility than assurances given by any national authority.  It is in many cases a precondition for the supply of nuclear material and equipment from other countries.  Without safeguards there would not be much international nuclear trade!
<P>The purpose of safeguards may thus be seen, in most cases, as being one of confidence-building.  However, to create confidence, safeguards verification must be sufficiently reliable to detect any violation with a degree of probability that is so high that it would even deter from violations, if a State were so tempted.
<P>It is often stated that the technical objective of safeguards is to deter States from diverting nuclear material from civilian to military use by the risk of detection.  The thought is that a State may be deterred from misusing nuclear material by an awareness that other States would be alerted through safeguards reporting about a diversion - or even about a possible diversion - and would react.  Although inspectors cannot physically stop proliferation, awareness of the consequences of any report that signals possible proliferation may be an important disincentive to proliferation.  The case of the DPRK today shows that other States are, indeed, sensitive not only to proven diversions but even to uncertainty and to lack of compliance with safeguards obligations.  And we can note with some satisfaction that Iraq did not divert any of the quantities of highly enriched uranium which were under IAEA safeguards.  Iraq was fully aware that using that material would have been immediately reported by the IAEA and would have triggered an alarm.
<P><B>Some facts about safeguards</B>
<P>Before going further, it may be appropriate to note some basic facts.  First, safeguards verification is entrusted to the IAEA under the NPT - with some 154 parties - under the Treaty of Tlatelolco for Latin America with 24 parties - and under the Treaty of Raratonga for the South Pacific - with 11 parties.
<P>International safeguards are a sizeable activity, yet in relation to the importance of the task it is modest in cost.  The Agency's Safeguards Department has a staff of about 500 people, of whom some 200 are inspectors.  There is an office in Tokyo with a few resident inspectors and another one in Toronto but most inspectors are resident in Vienna and travel to the nuclear installations which they inspect in various parts of the world.  The annual cost of the IAEA safeguards is about US $60 million.  We are under constant pressure from our Member States to cut the costs.  At the same time, we have the obligation to perform the safeguards in any State that submits installations for verification.  Thus, the Agency is now asked to verify all nuclear installations in South Africa and it is expected soon to do so in Argentina and Brazil.  When Ukraine joins the NPT - as it is expected to do - a large number of nuclear installations will have to be inspected.  The Agency is preparing for all this.  Fortunately a recent arrangement with the European Community has enabled the IAEA to reduce inspection in community countries while maintaining our ability to obtain independent conclusions and this gives the Agency sufficient capacity for the time being  -just to manage the safeguards obligations laid upon us.
<P>It is desirable that the safeguards system be subjected to constructive criticism so that we may improve it.  However, some limitations are inevitable and it is necessary to be aware of them.  There is no point in expecting the system to do things it cannot do.
<P><B>Inevitable limitations</B>
<P>We are sometimes asked why the IAEA does not inspect all nuclear installations in Israel, India or Pakistan.  The answer is, of course, that these States have not adhered to the NPT, nor have they accepted comprehensive safeguards.   NPT adherence and safeguards still remain voluntary acts - which some States are not yet willing to undertake.  No changes in the system would bring these States to accept safeguards over all their nuclear activities.  The solutions lie in foreign policy and regional security accommodations, e.g. a peace settlement and a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.
<P>Especially after some dramatic situations in Iraq there have been exaggerated ideas about the ways in which inspections can be conducted.  Safeguards inspectors are not international nuclear policemen who can shoot their way into facilities or seize undeclared nuclear material. We conduct inspection in sovereign States which have full control of their territory and of the installations on them.  We rely on these States to observe their international commitments and to facilitate our work.  However, if a State does not comply with its safeguards obligations regarding inspection this would be reported within the IAEA and from the IAEA to the Security Council of the UN, which could enforce the right of inspection.
<P>Another well-known limitation upon the safeguards system surfaced with full visibility in the case of Iraq:  a few grams of plutonium had been separated from irradiated fuel under safeguards without the required reporting to the IAEA.  It could have been done legally, but Iraq had chosen to do it secretly - and it was not discovered until after the Gulf War.  It appears to have been an isolated experiment.  No larger scale reprocessing activities have been uncovered.
<P>Although it would certainly be desirable for the safeguards system to discover such experiments, it is not deemed possible within reasonable costs to devise a system that is so finely meshed that it would discover very minor diversions.  The system is geared to discover the diversion of what is called a significant quantity of enriched uranium or plutonium - a quantity with which a nuclear explosive device can be made.  This is certainly a limitation on the system but a limitation which has so far been deemed tolerable.
<P>The various limitations on the safeguards system which I have mentioned do not deprive it of value.  Safeguards do verify that hundreds of declared nuclear installations and vast quantities of declared nuclear material around the world remain in exclusively peaceful use.  It is important for governments and the public to feel confident that there is no diversion of material from the big civilian nuclear sector to a secret weapons sector.  International verification offers an additional impartial check over and above the national or regional systems of accounting and control.  Between States only an international system will have good credibility.
<P>Let me now turn to some shortcomings which are being remedied in the international safeguards system.
<P><B>Secret nuclear programmes</B>
<P>The criticism which has been voiced that IAEA safeguards inspection had given Iraq a "clean bill of health" before the Gulf War is not correct.  It had merely been concluded that "all material under safeguards" had been accounted for.  However, this very sentence illustrated that the safeguards system, as practiced, was performed only on nuclear material and installations which had been declared by the inspected State itself and that little was done to give assurance that no secret nuclear installations existed.  It raises the question whether there are more Iraqs that we don't know about and whether safeguards are lulling us into confidence that is not justified?
<P>Can safeguards be sharpened to discover secret programmes and offer warnings about them?  This is the most important safeguards question which the Agency has been grappling with since the discovery of the secret nuclear weapon programme in Iraq.
<P><B>The information basis of safeguards</B>
<P>There can be no doubt that, if any one factor should be singled out as essential for uncovering secret programmes, it would be information.  International inspectors cannot roam vast territories in a blind search of secret installations or hidden material.  They must be directed to specific places and installations.  If a host country hides material and installations, the information must come from other sources.  The IAEA does not have any satellites or spies, but there are things that can be done and are now being done to strengthen the Agency's information basis.
<P>Firstly, more extensive use is being made of data collected by the Agency itself.  New analytical methods permit conclusions about the presence and absence of various radionuclides even when only tiny samples, e.g. from smear tests, are available.  Such samples can be taken by inspectors at declared sites and analysed at the Agency's laboratories.
<P>Secondly, a scheme under which governments will report exports and imports of nuclear material and equipment has been approved by the IAEA Board of Governors and may help the Agency to check the consistency between a State's declared nuclear programme and the pattern of the State's imports.  Had such a system functioned before the Gulf War, the Iraqi programme for uranium enrichment might have been more strongly suspected and led to questions by the Agency.
<P>Thirdly, systematic scanning of the media will make available a wealth of observations by reporters around the world.  Admittedly such scanning also makes available a wealth of misunderstandings but it may sometimes offer useful clues.
<P>Fourthly, the Agency now receives some information obtained by Member States through national means, e.g. through satellite surveillance.  Some members of the IAEA Board of Governors have not been comfortable with the idea that the Agency might receive "intelligence" information and the DPRK has vehemently objected to the use of US satellite pictures.  For my part I have taken the view that the IAEA cannot possibly close its eyes to any credible safeguards relevant information.  The Agency is expected to be a watchdog, not an ostrich!  Another matter is that all information must be critically analysed before any use is made of it.  There is much disinformation around and many misunderstandings.
<P>It is important for all to understand and respect that the information flow must be a one-way traffic.  The Agency is only in a position to receive information, pictures, data to make use thereof in its safeguards operations and assessment.  It must respect its own rules on the confidentiality of data and is not in a position to give any confidential data back to individual States supplying information, not even where such feedback would help to bring further information.
<P><B>The right of access for inspection</B>
<P>If access to information about where to look is the most important precondition for a successful search by inspectors for possible hidden material or secret installations, inspectors' right of access to sites and installations is a second vital precondition.  In the case of the IAEA inspections in Iraq, this right of access was made unlimited and has been effectively backed up by the Security Council.  In NPT-type safeguards agreements there is a right for the IAEA to so-called "special inspections" to any location which the Agency has reason to believe it needs to visit to obtain additional information relevant to safeguards.  It is such a right that the IAEA Board of Governors has asserted in relation to the DPRK and the implementation of which the Security Council is now dealing with.  It is true, as noted by some, that this right had never been asserted by the Agency with regard to a non-declared location before this was done in the case of the DPRK.  The reason, I think, was not timidity but rather that the Agency had not been in possession of any information about non-declared sites meriting visit.
<P><B>The role of the Security Council</B>
<P>Some critics of the IAEA have suggested that the Security Council rather than the IAEA should have responsibility for inspections, because
the Council has shown in Iraq - I quote - "that it can be a far tougher force than the IAEA .  .  ."  . (Wall Street Journal, 1993-03-18).  I submit the issue
is not either/or.  Indeed, both may be involved.  The Security Council is the primary repository of enforcement action in the UN system, and in the Gulf
War it made use of this power.
<P>One can be sure that the Council will remain very firm in taking measures to prevent nuclear proliferation.  There is no indication, however,
that the Council would like to take charge of nuclear inspections.  On the contrary, there is every indication that the Council will rely on the IAEA for
inspections.  The Council stresses the integral role of IAEA safeguards in the implementation of the NPT.  The establishment of United Nations
Special Commission under the Iraq resolution was a consequence of the need for mapping and neutralizing Iraq's capacity regarding other weapons
of mass destruction - biological and chemical - and missiles, matters not falling under the competence of the IAEA.
<P>As it has demonstrated in the case of the DPRK the Agency will turn to the Security Council to report on any significant non-compliance with
safeguards.  There is no simple answer how the Council will back up IAEA safeguards implementation in individual situations.  We can expect that
each case will be examined on its own merits and in its own particular  political, military and security context.
<P><B>The further strengthening of safeguards</B>
<P>The safeguards system of the IAEA was the world's first on-site inspection system.  It has grown tremendously and become more
sophisticated.  However, even with the measures introduced after the revelations in Iraq, the system is not perfect.  Further improvements can be
made.  Some have suggested that the model safeguards agreement pursuant to NPT should be renegotiated in connection with the NPT Conference
in 1995.  However, renegotiation is a somewhat risky process.  Perhaps it would be wiser to progress, as we have done so far, by introducing
voluntary additional features.
<P><B>Transparency</B>
<P>It is important always to remember that the purpose of safeguards inspection is to create confidence that nuclear material and installations are
used only for peaceful purposes  - and to uncover the opposite, should it occur.  Transparency of nuclear activities enables the world to verify that they
are peaceful.  Safeguards may be seen as a form of institutionalized transparency.  Nothing prevents a State from going further in transparency than
what this system currently requires, e.g. by offering very full information about the nuclear activities in the country.
<P><B>Visits to any site, any time</B>
<P>Under NPT-type safeguards routine access is limited to so-called "strategic points" out of concern for industrial and commercial secrets.  It is
generally recognized that these concerns were exaggerated.  States may choose to be more open than is required by the  agreements.  A practice is
now developing that States may voluntarily offer the Agency access to any site at any time, regardless of provisions of safeguards agreement.  Such
offers have been given - in chronological order - by Iran, Libya, the DPRK and South Africa.  Such offers may be made by States to allow visits in
order to allay suspicions which they consider unjustified.  They may be used by the Agency to visit sites which are of interest for one reason or another
but which would not normally justify a formal request for an inspection under safeguards.  Obviously such offers of transparency are only of value if, in
fact, lived up to.  Missions using such offers have gone to Iran and to South Africa.  In South Africa even military sites were visited.  One such visit was
also made in the DPRK, before the current restrictions on inspections and visits were introduced in that country.
<P><B>Environmental sampling</B>
<P>Invitations to take samples of water and air anywhere in a State may prove to be another - not very painful - means of showing transparency
and may help to confirm the absence of reprocessing activities.  It has been suggested that such measures of transparency might reduce the need for
some routine inspection that is now carried out.
<P><B>Are IAEA inspections too "soft"?</B>
<P>It has been claimed by some critics that IAEA safeguards inspections tend to be too "soft",  or to lead to too "cosy" relations between the
inspectorate and the inspected country.  One writer recently referred to "the IAEA, with its inherited ethos of trust in those it monitors." (Foreign Affairs,
Spring 1993, p. 147)
<P>I do not personally think a very serious problem looms in this sector, certainly not compared to the very real limitations which have followed
from lack of information about secret installations.  It is true that when several thousand individual inspections are carried out per year without
uncovering any diversions, one could expect trust to develop.  However, I do not think this is the case.  The frame of mind is neither trust or mistrust.
Inspectors are looking at data, material and equipment.  They do find inconsistencies and discrepancies - which are investigated and fully explained in
most cases - or else reported.  The inspectors are like the pilots in the cockpit, systematically checking a large number of instruments.  Normally
everything is okay, but nothing is taken for granted.  If something unusual is found, it must be fully explored.
<P>The difficulties which I can see lie elsewhere.  First, although States are anxious that other States be fully inspected, they may wish to get
away with a minimum of inspection for themselves.  As States are both the members and masters of the IAEA, they may sometimes utilize this status
to try to assert their views in inspection matters.  And any concession made for some special reason to any inspected party will be invoked by others -
as if a most favoured nation clause existed.  The Secretariat needs clear regulations to withstand such pressures and a readiness to submit problems
to the Board of Governors, which may uphold the collective interest of effective inspection against the interest of individual States in lighter or fewer
inspections.
<P><B>Designation rules and visas</B>
<P>Even as a collectivity States insist on some features which, although not crippling, nevertheless somewhat reduce the effectiveness of
safeguards.  States may reject inspectors from non-NPT countries or countries with which they have no diplomatic relations - or without giving any
reasons.  In many cases visas are still required for each inspection mission.
<P>In my view inspectors should be regarded as the international civil servants they are and have the right of access, when on duty, with only a
UN laissez-passer and a letter of instruction from the Agency.  States have not been willing to go so far yet.  Similarly the inspectors' freedom of
movement and right of speedy access should be improved.  The Chemical Weapons Convention marks some progress in these regards and these
features should be accepted by States within the IAEA as well.  They do not give as far-reaching rights to the inspectorate as in the case of Iraq, but
they are better than the normal safeguards conditions now prevailing.
<P><B>The capacity of the inspector</B>
<P>	Another question relates to the full use of the individual inspector.  A large organization with thousands of inspections must have order and
effective routines.  It cannot rely on the curiosity and intuition of the inspector, alone.  But it should also not lose this invaluable asset.  Hence
activating and motivating the individual inspector remains very important, while demanding at the same time that he fulfils all routines and reports fully
on his log sheet.
<P><B>Adequate resources</B>
<P>Yet another matter relates to resources.  Although governments in principle affirm the vital interest they have in effective safeguards, the fiscal
interest of minimum cost is vigorously asserted.  It is not, in my view, sensible that the IAEA should need to feel budgetary  restraints when it
schedules inspections or decides on the numbers of inspectors to send.  The Agency should also have ample laboratory capacity of its own to perform
most of the advanced analysis it needs.
<P><B>Potential use of stronger safeguards</B>
<P>I should like to end on a less lamenting and more forward-looking note.  The revelations about the secret nuclear programme in Iraq which has
shocked the world has given the political push that was needed to strengthen the system.  The case of the DPRK - with more effective information and
analysis and assertion of the right to special inspections  - demonstrates the stronger safeguards that have resulted and the scope for interaction with
the Security Council.  I do not think that any international verification system can attain 100% certainty, but I am sure that the system which is now
emerging, if it has the full support of members, will offer a much higher degree of certainty than was possible to attain earlier.  This progress is
needed.  We are dealing with matters vital to the security of States and the more nuclear disarmament progresses the more important it will become
that no proliferation occurs.
<P>Given the requisite resources I do not see any strong reason why the strengthened international safeguards system of the IAEA should not be
used to verify the peaceful storage and use of nuclear material recovered from nuclear disarmament or to verify a cut-off in the production of highly
enriched uranium or plutonium for weapons use.  Nor do I see any insuperable obstacles in making the IAEA the international body responsible for the
administration of a complete test ban.  The tasks under a test ban would be a good deal different from the safeguards tasks, but they would still fall in
the nuclear field and there may be great advantages in expanding the role of an existing organization rather than creating a new one.
<P>What is vitally important is that we should all use the time between now and the conference in 1995 on the extension of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty to seek the universalization of non-proliferation commitments, effectively verified.  We should also seek accelerated nuclear disarmament and a
complete test ban both for their own sake and because such measures will strengthen support for and reliability of the non-proliferation regime.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement by the Director General Hans Blix on his appointment for a fourth term</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Appointment for a fourth term</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>28 September 1993</H4>
<P><HR><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Mr. President,</H4>
<P>I should like to thank the General Conference for the confidence it is showing in me by approving my appointment as Director General for a fourth term.  I am very happy that my service during the nearly twelve years that I have been here has been such that the Board and the General Conference have wanted to prolong my mandate.
<P>The years that lie immediately ahead of us are likely to be full of exciting challenges and I feel grateful for the opportunity to work with Member Governments and with a highly competent Secretariat to meet these challenges.  Nuclear disarmament and arms control measures will drastically reduce the number of nuclear weapons, but may also call for verification activities by the IAEA.  The non-proliferation regime may reach universality.  There is a large agenda - with a role for the IAEA - before the 1995 NPT Conference.  There is another large agenda for the strengthening of nuclear power safety, to make nuclear power an even more important part - and a more accepted part - of a global sustainable energy production.  And there is yet another large agenda for the transfer of nuclear techniques in medicine, agriculture and industry to promote development.
<P>The IAEA is a good organization to work in.  Member Governments and policy-making organs have a long tradition of defining joint interests and translating them into constructive action.  Although inevitably politics are never far away, the organization's dedication to science, technology and rationality is a great asset.  An engaged, professionally highly competent, international staff is a third asset.
<P>Mr. President, I am proud to be given the confidence to head this Secretariat for a fourth term and I assure you that I shall serve all the Member States enthusiastically and impartially.

<TITLE>STATEMENT OF HANS BLIX, DIRECTOR GENERAL, IAEA AT INFORMAL BRIEFING OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL
REGARDING THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK)</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>STATEMENT OF HANS BLIX, DIRECTOR GENERAL, IAEA<BR> AT INFORMAL BRIEFING OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL<BR>REGARDING THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK)<BR></H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (DPRK)</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER> 6 April 1993</H4>
<HR><OL>
<LI>In a resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of Governors of the IAEA requested the Director General of the IAEA to report on behalf of the Board non-compliance of the DPRK with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material required to be safeguarded.
<LI>The formal report is ready and has been submitted to the Secretary-General for transmission to the Council.  I am glad to have the opportunity already today informally to brief the Council about the resolution and its background.
<LI>DPRK adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but it was not until 10 April last year that a safeguards agreement pursuant to NPT entered into force.  A so-called Initial Report of nuclear material and installations was submitted on 4 May 1992.  It listed inter alia a nearly completed reprocessing plant referred to as the Radiochemical Laboratory in which a small quantity of plutonium was stated to have been reprocessed in 1990 from damaged fuel rods which had been irradiated in the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor.
<LI>In May last year I was, myself, invited to the DPRK and visited a number of nuclear installations, including the "Radiochemical Laboratory".  I was told that experience in reprocessing had been gained through an experiment in 1975-77, when a few grams had been separated from fuel irradiated in the IRT research reactor.  In replies to enquiries as to whether any pilot reprocessing plant had been operated between 1977 and 1990, the answer was that the leap had been taken from the experiment in 1975-77 to the construction of the Radiochemical Laboratory.
<LI>Teams of IAEA safeguards inspectors visited DPRK installations from June 1992 and received much co-operation.  They also found some inconsistencies between the Initial Report and other information given by the DPRK and the findings made by the IAEA.  This is by no means unique.  Many errors and mistakes occur in reporting and the normal course of events is that these are cleared up through closer investigation.  In the case of the DPRK some relatively minor inconsistencies have been solved but some major ones have not gone away despite questions, discussion and analysis - which began already in the summer of 1992 and continued up to a meeting between experts in connection with the meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors in February of this year.
<LI>The most important points on which information has differed from Agency findings are the following:
<UL>
<LI>(a)	Nuclear waste which was stored within the compound of the Radiochemical Laboratory and from which samples were taken for analysis, proved to have an isotopic composition indicating that some plutonium should exist which has not been declared.  Whether there are grams or kilograms the analysis cannot tell;
<LI>(b)	Sample analysis of the plutonium which has been declared indicates that there should be some nuclear waste which has not yet been made available for sampling and analysis;
<LI>(c)	The DPRK tells the Agency that only one reprocessing campaign has been carried out in the unfinished reprocessing plant - the Radiochemical Laboratory - in 1990 using irradiated fuel elements from the 5 MW(e) Experimental Power Reactor.  The Agency's analyses suggest that there should have been several such operations.
</UL>
<LI>	Many hours have been spent in attempts to explain these inconsistencies.  The plutonium declared and analysed and the nuclear waste declared and analysed are like two gloves which don't match.  There should be two more gloves to match the pair which we have seen and analysed.
<LI>	In view of these inconsistencies the Agency became much interested in information obtained from a third party about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste and which are located at the Nyongbyon nuclear village, one of the buildings in the vicinity of the Radiochemical Laboratory - the unfinished reprocessing plant.
<LI>	Two Agency officials were permitted to visit this building in September last year.  They were told it was a one-storey building and they could see that some military but no nuclear equipment was stored in it.  What the Agency officials did not see, but what satellite pictures taken during different phases of the construction of the building later showed us was that there was a lower storey which was now invisible because of landscaping and which had a construction and a configuration that strongly suggested its purpose was nuclear waste disposal.
The two Agency officials I mentioned visited also a second site in September, a site that they became convinced was not nuclear-related.  It was therefore written off as of safeguards interest.
<LI>	Satellite pictures taken in the fall were further made available to the Agency indicating that a location at Nyongbyon which has the obvious layout of a nuclear waste storage site was being covered by earth.  The road to it was erased and trees and  shrubs were planted.  I might mention that the layout of the site is very similar to the waste site at Tuwaitha outside Baghdad - a site with which the Agency is familiar.  I might also mention that while concealment of plutonium is not so difficult, because even a few kilograms is no larger in volume than a fist, the concealment of waste associated with the separation of plutonium is very much more so.  For every kilogram of plutonium derived from reprocessing, waste would amount to about 200 cubic metres.  Therefore, for larger quantities of plutonium, the associated waste could amount to many thousands of cubic metres.  Such wastes could only be stored in appropriate waste storage facilities.
It is against this background that the two sites which the Agency wishes to visit and take samples, assume particular importance.
<LI>	During a meeting in Vienna on 30 November to 1 December 1992 between the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy and officials assisting him and myself and experts accompanying me, the inconsistencies were discussed.  I stressed the urgent need for the Agency to visit again the building which our officials had seen in September and the site which had been covered and landscaped last fall, and for the Agency to obtain samples from these sites.  This was not a request for a special inspection under the safeguards agreement, but a request for a visit in pursuance of an invitation issued earlier by the Minister for Agency officials to see sites whether or not they were included in the Initial Report.  The Minister and his officials responded that it would not be "normal" during such a visit to take samples but they did not decline the request.  Subsequent cables did not, however, bring any positive response. On the Agency side we felt that a visit of this informal kind would be more acceptable to the DPRK and less dramatic than a special inspection - a measure never before taken vis-à-vis an undeclared site.
<LI>	In the absence of a positive response to our request for a visit by officials, we eventually, on 9 January, signalled our need for information to be obtained under the safeguards agreement's articles concerning special inspections - Articles 73 and 77.  This was resisted, but a mission headed by the Agency's Director of External Relations was accepted.  They visited Pyongyang on 20-22 January 1993. The mission explained in no uncertain terms that in the absence of the clarification - including the possibility of visits by officials which the Agency sought, and notably through taking samples from two sites that appeared waste-related - the Agency was not in a position to verify the correctness and assess the completeness of the Initial Declaration made by the DPRK.  The seriousness of the situation was thus made absolutely clear.  The formal request for special inspections, which followed later, could hardly have been a surprise.  The DPRK officials did not, however, show any signs of readiness to accommodate our request.  They asserted that the sites were non-nuclear and military.
It should be recalled that at this time tension was rising on the Korean peninsula due to the expected military manoeuvre "Team Spirit" in the Republic of Korea.  The DPRK officials urged that all questions that needed clarification should be discussed between DPRK experts and the sixth Agency ad hoc inspection team which was due to arrive soon.
<LI>The sixth inspection mission arrived and spent nearly two weeks in intense discussions, which regrettably failed to give the needed clarifications.  Nor was it enabled to visit the two sites from which samples were desired.  Upon the return to Vienna of the sixth inspection team and analysis of its results,  it was decided in the Secretariat that there was no option other than formally to request a "special inspection".  This was done  in a cable of 9 February.  An annex to the cable listed inconsistencies between information provided by the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA.  The cable specified the two sites which the Agency had reason to believe were waste-related and to which the Agency wanted access to take samples.  The reply of  15 February from DPRK failed to accept our request but signalled that an expert DPRK mission would come to Vienna to discuss inconsistencies.  It stressed that the two sites which the Agency wished to visit were military and not nuclear-related.
<LI>The mission, headed by the Minister for Atomic Energy himself, arrived just before the IAEA regular February Board meeting.  While the discussions during the weekend of 20 and 21 February brought some relevant data concerning the operation of the 5 MW(e) experimental reactor, it did nothing to clarify the serious inconsistencies and offered no access to the two sites from which the Agency wished to take samples.
<LI>	The impasse which thus appeared to have arisen was reported to the Board of Governors of the IAEA at its meeting on 22-25 February.  In my statement before the Board I said that the Agency did not want to assume lightly that an Initial Report was incorrect or incomplete.  Regrettably, however, the Secretariat was not in a position to confirm the correctness and completeness of the declaration such as it stood.   The Secretariat was of the view that the DPRK had the obligation under the Safeguards Agreement (Art. 3) to          co-operate and that such co-operation must include access to additional relevant information  as well as locations which the Agency had reason to believe were related to nuclear waste.
<P>As the detailed information given to the Board included safeguards confidential material by experts from the Secretariat, the Board met in closed session.  It received a detailed account of the inconsistencies relating to plutonium and nuclear waste and it was shown the pictures on the basis of which the Secretariat had concluded that two locations of the Nyongbyon nuclear centre were related to nuclear waste.
I stressed that when looking for nuclear waste that matched the plutonium declared, the Secretariat could not possibly ignore any information about sites which appeared related to nuclear waste.  These sites, located within a nuclear centre, could not be immunized form inspections, I said, by the presence or placing of some military equipment on them.
<LI>On 25 February the Board adopted without a vote a resolution in which it took note of the significant inconsistencies between the declarations of the DPRK and the findings of the IAEA which remained unresolved, and called upon the DPRK urgently to respond positively to the request for access for additional information and additional sites.  The Board requested me to report within a month.
<LI>The resolution of the Board was immediately transmitted to the DPRK.  In a reply of 10 March the DPRK referred to the ongoing military exercise "Team Spirit" and the state of semi-war which existed in the DPRK.  In the circumstances, receipt of an Agency inspection team could not be considered.
<LI>Shortly thereafter, on 12 March, the Agency received the DPRK announcement of its decision to withdraw  from the NPT as a measure to defend its supreme interests.  In a cable I advised the DPRK that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force until any withdrawal from the NPT took effect  and that a declaration of an intention to withdraw shall not impede implementation of the Safeguards Agreement.
<LI>	On 16 March the DPRK replied, inter alia, that it "cannot receive the Agency inspection teams".
<LI>	On 18 March, the Board of Governors met and adopted - still without a vote - a further resolution confirming that the Safeguards Agreement remained in force and that it was essential and urgent that the DPRK enable the Agency to take the necessary measures to resolve differences and ensure verification of compliance with the Safeguards Agreement.  The Director General was asked to report on the response of the DPRK at a Board meeting on 31 March.
<LI>	In a cable to the DPRK the day after the Board meeting, i.e. 19 March, I reiterated the request for access by Agency inspection teams and advised that if access were not obtained, I would have no choice but to report non-compliance by DPRK with the Safeguards Agreement when the Board met again on 31 March.  I stated that the Agency was ready to discuss arrangements which might minimize legitimate security concerns about inspections at military sites.
<LI>	On 30 March, one day before the Board meeting, the DPRK Minister of Atomic Energy sent a further cable in which he stated that the DPRK was always ready to respond if the Agency's Secretariat wished to consult about the implementation of the Safeguards Agreement - thereby apparently implying recognition of the continued validity of the agreement.  At the same time, however, the position was confirmed that there was no readiness to discuss the issue of "special inspection".
<LI>	In my statement to the Board on 31 March I pointed to the DPRK's reaffirmation of its express rejection of the Agency's right to make a special inspection - despite the decision of the Board on 25 February that the access requested to additional information and additional sites was essential and urgent.  The rejection was serious, I said, not only because it presented a challenge to the Agency's right of special inspections and the Board's endorsement of that right, but also because in fact it precluded the Agency from taking samples which might bring clarity where there was now inconsistency and uncertainty.
<LI>	In its resolution adopted on 1 April the Board of the IAEA found that the DPRK "is in non-compliance with its obligation under the safeguards agreement with the Agency", and that the Agency is "not able to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material ... to nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices."  The Board called upon the DPRK to remedy its non-compliance by granting access to specific additional information and to the two locations indicated by the Agency.  It further decided, in keeping with Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute and Article 19 of the Safeguards Agreement, to report the non-compliance and the Agency's inability to verify non-diversion of nuclear material to the Security Council, and to all Members of the Agency and to the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Lastly, in order to stress that the Agency itself continues to regard the matter as a high priority, the Board requested the Director General to continue his efforts and dialogue to implement fully the Safeguards Agreement and it decided to remain seized of the matter.
<LI>	This was Thursday, 1 April - last week.  The formal report has been transmitted to the Secretary-General and is now distributed to the Security Council.
<LI>	In concluding I would like to underline a few points:
<P>First, the lack of co-operation from the DPRK with the Agency in clarifying inconsistencies is very serious and amounts to non-compliance as the Board of Governors has determined.
<P>In particular, it is worrying that the Agency is not in a position to verify the correctness of the quantity of plutonium which the DPRK has declared; rather the findings of the Agency point to the existence of plutonium which has not been declared.
<P>Second, the Agency has sought  over a period of time with patience and persistence to bring clarity where there is inconsistency.  While these efforts have met with some      co-operation by the DPRK, the explanations given to us have been ineffective and inadequate to clarify the most important inconsistencies.  Moreover, the DPRK has so far shown active resistance as regards inspection visits by the Agency to additional sites and sample-taking.
<P>Third, that a simple declaration by the DPRK that the sites are military and/or non-nuclear related cannot preclude inspection, where, as is the case, there is prima facie evidence of nuclear and safeguards relevance of the sites.
<P>Fourth, that the sites are not immunized by the presence or placing of military objects on them.  However, inspections can be undertaken with arrangements to minimize any legitimate security concerns.
<P>Fifth and last, IAEA safeguards are a vital component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The Security Council acknowledged this in its Summit Statement of 31 January.  Safeguards must be sufficiently effective to uncover any breaches or concealments with a high degree of probability.  The international community must be able to have confidence in the effectiveness of the system.  The findings which have been made by the Agency as regards the DPRK and which are at variance with some information given by the DPRK, are in part the result of strengthened safeguards techniques, and in part the result of more information now being made available to the Agency.  The demand which has been made for a special inspection of sites not declared and which has been endorsed by the Board is also a result of the Agency's asserting its rights.  Where these are resisted, the backing of the Security Council is required to protect the effectiveness and continued credibility of the safeguards system.

<TITLE>International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Power Systems -Design, Technology, Safety and Strategies for their Deployment</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Power Systems -Design, Technology, Safety and Strategies for their Deployment</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>OPENING STATEMENT <BR>by Hans Blix, Director General, IAEA<BR></H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Seoul, Republic of Korea</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>18 October 1993</H4>
<P><HR>It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you all to the IAEA International Symposium on Advanced Nuclear Power Systems.  On behalf of the organizers and participants, I would like to express appreciation to the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Korean Electric Power Corporation for hosting the Symposium here in Seoul and for generously supporting it.
<P>It is perhaps appropriate to ask at the outset of this Symposium whether there will be any demand for advanced nuclear power systems.  In the Western industrialized world - where at present even France has much reduced the pace of its programme for new nuclear power plants construction - an affirmative answer is not as self-evident as here in East Asia, where several big economies are growing at a fast pace and are dependent upon an equally fast increasing and reliable supply of energy.
<P>In many parts of the Western industrialized world we are suffering from what you might call "a post-industrial hangover".  Standards of living have risen tremendously but we have discovered that we have been and still are wasteful with resources and careless with waste - with serious pollution and environmental problems resulting.  In some circles a bad conscience exists for the high level of consumption and among most people there is a justified anxiety regarding pollution and environmental degradation.
<P>These sentiments often contribute to anti-nuclear attitudes.  High technology, including nuclear power, is seen as a symbol of an impersonal, inhumane society and highly toxic nuclear waste, radioactive for many thousands of years, is seen by many as a symbol for all the dangerous wastes of the industrialized societies.  Little reflection is devoted to the fact that the nuclear waste is so limited in quantity and volume that it can be taken care of in its entirety, while the wastes of the main alternative sources of energy - fossil fuels - are so voluminous that the atmosphere and the surface of the earth inevitably become the final disposal sites!  We speak of two methods of waste disposal:  d and d = dilute and disperse  - which is what we do with wastes from fossil fuels and c and c = concentrate and confine  - which is what we do with nuclear wastes.  With the world's atmosphere being overburdened in particular by the dispersion of SO2, NOx and CO2, I have no hesitation in expressing support for the c and c methods developed for the disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste and for spent nuclear fuel, namely in both cases emplacement in metal containers which are deposited deep down in stable geological formations.
<P>As we all know, even though nuclear wastes from the military sectors in some countries have been carelessly handled - sometimes dumped in the sea - it is not from nuclear wastes, but from the fossil fuel wastes - e.g. SO2, NOx and CO2 - that our lakes and forests are threatened by acid rains and our climate is threatened through global warming.  We have yet, however, to translate these facts about nuclear power into public awareness and energy policy conclusions, e.g. conclusions about the desirability to develop and use advanced nuclear power systems.
<P>There is broad agreement that the global CO2 emissions - which in large measure are linked to the use of fossil fuels - should be reduced or at least be stabilized at the 1990 levels.  There is no agreement, however, on energy policies through which this could be achieved.  Developing countries with fast growing energy consumption will certainly not go along with a freezing of their CO2 emissions at current levels and industrialized countries will have serious difficulties in drastically reducing their CO2 emissions.  Green movements tell us that we should reduce CO2 emissions by further increasing energy efficiency, by reducing our electricity consumption and by relying more on wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biomass.  However, while energy efficiency is important and is endorsed by all, and while so-called alternative sources of energy should be promoted, few experts believe these approaches will provide viable answers to the world's energy/environment problems in the foreseeable future.  We know, for instance, that Japan, despite being the most efficient user of energy in the world, has been compelled to increase its electricity generation with a large nuclear component.  We are also familiar with the large differences in energy consumption.  In 1991 the average North American used almost  7700 kg of oil equivalent per year; the average consumption per capita in the Republic of Korea was 2040 kg; the average Chinese used 650 kg, and the average Indian used only 310 kg of oil equivalent per year.  Does anyone doubt that the modest consumers of energy will seek to improve their standard of living by increasing their use of energy?
<P>Nuclear power's share of the world primary energy supply is today a modest 5%.  However, it supplies some 17% of the world's electricity or as much electricity as the world consumed when the first nuclear power stations were put into commercial operation less than 40 years ago.  And nuclear power does so without contributing to acid rains or the risk of global warming.  It can be readily calculated, indeed, that if the world's some 420 nuclear power reactors were closed and the electricity generated by them  were instead generated by coal-fired plants, total global CO2 emissions would increase by some 8%.  It therefore does matter if newly added capacity  is based on fossil fuels or uranium.
<P>Of course, these alternatives have to be compared not only for their environmental impacts but also from the viewpoints of cost, reliability, energy independence and safety.
<P>In terms of cost there may not at present be a vast difference between electricity generated by coal-fired plants and by uranium-fuelled plants.  But the nuclear power plants have much of their cost up front in the construction, while coal plants are cheaper to build and more expensive to fuel.   It is probable that nuclear power - a young technology - may still benefit from many cost-saving innovations, while this may be less likely for the long existing fossil-fuel-burning technologies.
<P>In terms of reliability there is also not a vast difference between fossil-fuelled plants and nuclear power plants.  The latter are likely to have the attention of media every time they are stopped for one reason or another.  Statistics do not, however, indicate that the availability of nuclear power plants is lower than fossil-fuelled plants.
<P>Large industrialized and industrializing countries, like Japan, Taiwan (China) and the Republic of Korea, all poor in indigenous energy resources, are sensitive to a reliable supply of primary energy - coal, oil, gas or uranium.  They aim at an optimal energy mix, avoiding to have all their energy eggs in one basket.  Nuclear fuel has the advantage over fossil fuels, in that it is so small in volume that it can be easily stored for several years' consumption, insulating the importer from supply problems sometimes arising with oil and gas.
<P>The nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, where no radioactive releases occurred to the environment, and the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, where considerable release and contamination took place, shook the world and are at the root of many people's scepticism about nuclear power.  These accidents must be compared, however, with the many accidents in coal mines and disasters in hydro dams that collapse or gas cisterns that explode.  No generation of energy is without some risk.  It seems clear, however, that the public is less tolerant of nuclear accidents than of other accidents.  The nuclear industry must accept this and respond with a globally practiced nuclear safety culture that put the risk of accidents causing radioactive releases to the environment near zero.  Many steps have been taken and are being taken to achieve this - nationally and internationally.
<P>The current efforts by Russia and countries in East and Central Europe are perhaps the most important ongoing efforts to upgrade and consolidate nuclear power safety.  Many other countries seek to assist in these efforts.  Rightly so, because it is very much in their interest, too, that this upgrading takes place.
<P>The efforts within the IAEA to draft international nuclear safety standards as guidance to all States and an international safety convention to bind all States to certain rules, are other parts of the international nuclear safety culture.  Nuclear power worldwide is becoming an important industry and it must grow within an international infrastructure of agreed rules and conventions, not only about safety but also about early warning of accidents, emergency assistance, physical protection and liability in case of damages.  This infrastructure is gradually emerging.  A convention about nuclear power safety will probably be ready next year and work on a convention regarding the safe disposal of nuclear waste will begin thereafter.
<P>While supervision of nuclear safety remains a national task, increasingly international expert advisory services are becoming available through the IAEA and the nuclear operators' own organization, WANO.  These services, too, help to bring all operators into the international safety culture.
<P>This Symposium rightly assumes that there will be a continued need for nuclear power to meet growing needs of electricity all over the world, to produce heat for industries and for the warming of houses and to help desalinate water to meet the scarcity of fresh water in many dry zones.  The nuclear options must be kept open even though there are currently strong tendencies to do just the opposite, namely letting them atrophy.
<P>The Symposium also rightly assumes that nuclear technology, like other technologies, continuously develops.  We learn from our past experience and we discover new needs.  The Symposium is, indeed, a forum in which we exchange our experiences and discuss our future needs.  There is no reason to believe that the advanced nuclear power systems will comprise only evolutionary models which draw on some 6500 reactor years of accumulated experience, which are already here or at least around the corner and which will show improvements from design to safety and economics.  We shall also see the emergence in a not too distant future of some other types of advanced reactors, such as breeder reactors for optimal resource management when economic uranium resources may be less abundant than today.  There will be high temperature reactors for generating industrial process heat, for example for producing clean fuels such as hydrogen, and there will be smaller reactors which are simpler to operate for developing countries and which fit smaller electric grids.
<P>Although for the design and construction of advanced nuclear power systems we cannot perhaps expect joint international projects of the kind we have for the International Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor (ITER), there is nevertheless much that designers, constructors, buyers and regulators need to jointly discuss internationally about the next generation of nuclear power plants.
<P>The IAEA - as an organization consisting of many States which make extensive and increasing use of nuclear power and other States which reject this option - is not seeking to persuade Member States collectively or individually  to use nuclear power.  Decisions in this regard fall altogether within the national sphere of sovereign States.  The work of the organization in this area is based on the simple premise that nuclear power is in fact used in many countries, that other States consider introducing it and that there is a need for joint discussion between States about ways to further strengthen safety, simplicity in design, ease in operation, reliability and economy.  The Agency has long provided a forum for joint discussion of the demands that should be placed on future nuclear power plants and of ways of meeting these demands.  A recent IAEA document, the result of international co-operation, describes Objectives for the Development of Advanced Nuclear Power Plants.  Another IAEA document is being prepared concerning Safety Principles for Future Nuclear Power Plants.  This Symposium is important to carry the joint discussions further.  I express to you my best wishes.
<P>I can think of no better venue for this Symposium than the Republic of Korea with its fast growing economy, with its fast growing demand for energy and with its fast growing park of nuclear power reactors.  The Symposium salutes its host country for what it has already achieved and expresses its good wishes for further successes.<HR>

<TITLE>Nuclear Energy and the Environment</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Energy and the Environment</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>by Dr. Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR>
<P>Nuclear Energy and Human Safety<BR>IV Annual Scientific & Technical Conference of the Nuclear Society<BR></H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Nizhny Novgorod, Russia</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>28 June 1993</H4>
<P><HR>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>In my home country, Sweden, there is an association of some thousands of environmentalists who favour  nuclear energy, but there are also much larger environmental groups which are critical of nuclear power.  Such groups may have a healthy influence in focussing society's attention on safety issues in nuclear operations and on issues relating to  disposal of nuclear waste.  Opinions and opposition are needed in all societies.  In my view, environmental groups go against their own real interests, however, when they blindly oppose the use of nuclear power.  I came myself to support nuclear power for environmental reasons, and these reasons remain the main motivation for me to support a continued and  expanding role for nuclear power.  It would be very unwise for the world to turn its back on nuclear power and nuclear techniques, which now give it 17% of all its electricity, which form a growing part of modern medicine, and which help us to increase food production at competitive costs.  We must utilize nuclear energy and nuclear techniques for our benefit, not least to reduce the threats to the environment.  In my view these threats may in the future pose greater problems to humanity than the threats of conflicts between States, now that the Cold War is over.  We must, however, use nuclear energy responsibly and prudently and correct the errors of the past.
<P>Environmental destruction is not a new phenomenon.  Our ancestors achieved a lot of environmental destruction, e.g. deforestation through excessive logging for shipbuilding.  However, our ancestors were far fewer than we are and their tools were not so powerful as ours.  Our ancestors inflicted damage on a local and regional scale.  We are degrading the environment on a truly global scale.  The feared global warming through a `Greenhouse Effect', caused, inter alia, by our excessive use of fossil fuels, is an example.
<P><B>The population increase</B>
<P>It must be stated at the outset that the increase in the global population is a critical element in the environmental threat.  It is we and not the animals that destroy the world.  The more numerous we are, the more we destroy, pollute and consume.  It is calculated that at the time of Christ the population of the Earth was about 350 million; in 1900 it was 1.5 billion; in 1990 it was about 5 billion; and in the year 2000 it is expected to be about 6 billion.  Thus, in the last 10 years of this century the world's population will increase by almost as much as it did in the 1900 years from the time of Christ to the year 1900.  
<P>Erosion, desertification and other environmental problems will push people to emigrate, and there are no new continents, no virgin lands, so they will try to go to areas which are already well populated - with the risk of ethnic frictions and conflicts.  The demand for an acceptable standard of living by an ever increasing number of people is already placing great strain on resources of land and fresh water.  In my view none of the problems anticipated to be central in the next century - and certainly not the major environmental problems - can be tackled with any hope of success unless the global population can be stabilized.
<P><B>The Rio Conference</B>
<P>Awareness of the environmental threats is growing rapidly.  No international conference has been attended by so many Heads of State and of government as that on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.  At this "green" conference many positive words were not said about nuclear energy.  It was the more important therefore that the IAEA presented a report on `Nuclear Power, Nuclear Techniques and Sustainable Development', which focused on the contribution that the use of nuclear energy and nuclear techniques can make to protecting the environment.  
<P><B>Nuclear energy and sustainable development</B>
<P>There are, indeed, many nuclear techniques that directly serve environmental protection and effective resource utilization.  In agriculture, new strains of seeds are created through mutations induced by irradiation, strains that may be more pest-resistant or drought-resistant or have other desirable features.  To take two examples, cotton crops in Pakistan and rice crops in Indonesia have increased enormously thanks to the use of mutant strains.  Through the use of radioisotopes, difficult and important measurements can be performed which help identify water resources or paths of pollution, or measure the uptake of fertilizer in plants.  In the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya the FAO and the IAEA helped, through a nuclear technique, to eradicate an infestation of the New World screwworm, a pest which kills cattle as well as wild animals.  The technique consisted in releasing millions of insects which had been sterilized by irradiation so that no offspring resulted when these mated with fertile insects.  The insect population was eradicated in less than one year.  The benefit/cost ratio of this successful campaign was calculated to be 50 to 1.
<P>In industry, nuclear techniques offer unique ways of making exact measurements which save raw materials and resources.  A nuclear technique is even being tested to reduce pollutants arising from the burning of coal.  Flue gases from the burning coal are mixed with ammonia and irradiated by electron beams from an accelerator.  The result is that most of the SO2 and NOx is removed from the gases and converted to substances that can be used as fertilizers - ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate. 
<P>I need hardly remind you of the many uses of nuclear techniques in modern medicine, not only to combat cancer, where radiation remains a principal method of treatment, but also in many new forms of diagnostic imaging.  Today, computer tomography, gamma cameras and nuclear magnetic imaging are invaluable tools in hospitals.
<P>Few people perhaps are ready to turn their backs on nuclear techniques such as these.  Indeed, relatively few are aware of the wide range of nuclear techniques which serve us in today's world.
<P><B>The risks of nuclear energy</B>
<P>We must, of course, analyse the risks that are connected with the various uses of nuclear energy.  We must also ask what risks are acceptable to society, and what risks we would be taking by relying on possible alternative means of energy generation, or by refraining from expanding energy use.  And we must ask to what extent risks connected with nuclear power can be further reduced.
<P><B>What level of risk is acceptable?</B>
<P>The question of what level of risk is acceptable to society in various activities - how safe is safe enough? - is not technical but political.  Technical data, while not irrelevant in the answering of this question, are only a small part of the input.  Let me give an example:  many pesticides are used extensively and are accepted - but the use of them has considerable negative consequences as well.
<P>A publication by the WHO (1990) on the "Public Health Impact of Pesticides used in Agriculture" estimates the global number of annual unintentional deaths caused by pesticide poisoning in 1985 at 20 000 and the total number of unintentional non-fatal poisonings caused by pesticides in 1985 at 1 million!  One terrible accident was the methyl mercury contamination of seeds in Iraq in which over 6000 people were affected and over 400 died.  Another example was the parathion-contaminated flour in Colombia which affected 600 people and caused 88 deaths. As pesticides continue to be used on a large scale without global protests, we must conclude that these high numbers of casualties are "accepted" by governments and public opinion because of the vital importance of pesticides to food production.  The Bhopal accident - with about 2500 dead - shocked the world, but no one suggested a moratorium on the production of pesticides.
<P>Similarly use of automobiles and coal mining are not questioned by public opinion, despite the heavy toll of lives these activities take.  However, the reliance on nuclear power is questioned, and in several States there are formal or informal moratoria on the construction of new nuclear plants.  Why this difference in opinion?  There can be no doubt that the opinion about nuclear power has been influenced by occurrence of the accidents at Three Mile Island - where there were hardly any radioactive releases to the environment - and Chernobyl, where there were large releases.  Opinion has no doubt been influenced also by the fear that radioactive wastes could leak now or in the future from waste disposal sites.
<P>The health and environmental impacts of the Chernobyl accident and the irresponsible handling of radioactive wastes that has occurred in the military sectors both in the former Soviet Union and in the US should not be ignored.  It is interesting, however, to read the conclusions of a Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and the Environment which was organized by eleven international organizations, including the IAEA, and which took place in Helsinki in 1991.  The Symposium compared the health and environmental impacts of different electricity generating systems and considered the impacts of the systems from beginning to end, for example from fuel extraction to waste disposal.  With some reservations due to incompleteness of data, it concluded that:"under routine operation conditions, nuclear power and renewable systems tend to be in the lower spectrum of health risk and ... energy systems based on coal and oil are in the higher spectrum of health risk"; and that
<P>"human health risks from severe accidents from nuclear, oil and natural gas are of the same order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude smaller than those from the hydroelectric option."
<P>The second conclusion may appear surprising; however, we should recall that not so few hydropower dams have failed over the years, drowning many thousands of people.  These factual conclusions of an expert symposium deserve to be cited as they contrast with commonly held perceptions
<P><B>Increasing use of energy</B>
<P>Some environmentalists think that the environmental problems linked to our energy use - like the greenhouse effect - can be reduced simply by the use of less energy.  While all are agreed that energy conservation is necessary and should be vigorously pursued, it is not realistic to think that the global use of energy can be reduced.  Energy is the lifeblood of modern societies.  It is evident that developing countries in particular will seek to use much more energy than they do today.  The average North American now uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent in energy per year; the average Chinese uses 590 kg and the average Indian makes do with 280 kg of oil equivalent per year.  China is at present planning to double its use of coal by the year 2000.  The World Energy Council has estimated that global energy consumption can be expected to increase by 50-75% by the year 2020 - even assuming vigorous efforts to increase energy efficiency.
<P>The increasing CO2 emissions and the use of nuclear power to contain them If fears about a global warming effect from the so-called greenhouse gases, notably CO2, are confirmed to be justified, we will face a dilemma: how to reconcile the predicted greater use of energy with the need to limit CO2 emissions.  Asia's CO2 emissions are for example expected to increase by a factor of 30% by the year 2000.  
<P>In this dilemma, the nuclear power option may prove of great importance;  firstly since it is used primarily to generate electricity, which is the fastest growing form of energy use, and secondly because nuclear power plants do not emit CO2 or any other substances which might affect the climate globally.
<P>It has been suggested that nuclear power, which accounts for about 5% of the world's energy and 17% of its electricity - a little less than hydropower's 20% of electricity - is too small a source to be of any importance to global CO2 emissions.  It is true that nuclear power, alone, cannot avert the threat of global warming, but it is probably also true that the problem of global warming cannot be tackled without reliance on nuclear power.  It has been calculated that if today's 400 or so nuclear power plants were closed and the electricity generated by them were instead generated by coal-fired plants, total global CO2 emissions would increase by some 7%.  The awareness is increasing among governments that the use of nuclear power is highly relevant to the efforts to prevent global warming.
 <P>The relevance of nuclear power to CO2 emissions can also be illustrated by a comparison between the United Kingdom and France.  In the United Kingdom, where about 70% of electricity comes from coal burning, average CO2 emission per kWh was 0.78 kg.  In France, where more than 70% of electricity comes from nuclear power, the CO2 emissions per kWh are about one tenth of the British value (0.086 kg).  This is a positive feature.  Moreover, according to a recent study by the French government, nuclear power will remain the cheapest centralized source of new baseload power for France into the next century.  France's fifty fourth PWR went critical in May this year.
<P><B>Energy savings and renewable sources to reduce CO2 emissions</B>
<P>It is often claimed that we can could reduce CO2 emissions without reliance on nuclear energy, either through energy savings or through greater reliance on renewable sources of energy.  Although both increased energy efficiency and the development of solar power and other renewable sources are desirable, neither can realistically be expected to offer an alternative to nuclear power as a base load for electrical production.  The 15th Congress of the World Energy Council held in Madrid last year put the contributions of renewable sources of energy - excluding hydro - at around 3% by the year 2020.  
<P>The present alternative to nuclear is thus not solar power or, for that matter, wind power.  It is fossil fuels.  When Austrians decided in a referendum several years back not to make use of a 725 MW(e) nuclear plant that had already been built, the country did not rely on wind or solar power or energy saving, but built instead a 724 MW(e) coal plant.  And when the Belgian Government refused permission to build another nuclear plant, it granted instead permission for the construction of gas-fired generating capacity.  In my own country, Sweden, a decision was taken after the Chernobyl accident to close two of Sweden's nuclear power plants in 1995 and 1996.  It turned out, however, that the substitute was not to be biomass, solar or wind power, but natural gas.  The phase-out decision was cancelled after an intensive public debate in which possible higher electricity prices and the effects of increased CO2 emissions from the burning of gas were important elements.
<P><B>Climate Change</B>
<P>In Rio de Janeiro a Framework Convention on Climate Change was concluded.  It had been proposed that it should stipulate that CO2
emissions should  be reduced by 2005 to the levels of 1990.  This proposal could not win a consensus.  However, the convention adopted  as an
ultimate objective the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous effects on the climate
system.  The Conference and Convention did not state how this was to be achieved.  Further discussions on CO2 emissions and energy sources -
including the merits of nuclear power - therefore lie before us.  My own belief is that the industrially advanced States will have to consider a continued,
indeed, expanded use of nuclear power in order to enable many developing countries to expand their use of less demanding fossil fuel based
technologies.  I believe we must also develop nuclear power plants which are easier to operate for eventual use by developing countries.  There may
also be scope for greater reliance on nuclear power for the production of industrial heat.
<P><B>Nuclear Waste</B>
<P>The two principal matters which cause scepticism about nuclear power are waste disposal and operational safety.  I have already pointed out
that radioactive waste does not contribute to acid rain or global warming.  Although nuclear waste is dangerous, it has the great merit of being so
limited in volume that it can be disposed of and isolated in its entirety.  This is the great environmental value of nuclear waste.  Some figures
comparing the volume of coal fuel and waste and nuclear fuel and waste may be helpful.  A coal-fuelled plant of 1000 MW(e) will require about 7000
tonnes of coal per day - i.e. about five train loads.  A nuclear plant of the same electric capacity will use some 80 kilograms of uranium per day.  Even
with the best available flue gas cleaning equipment the coal plant will annually emit some 9000 tonnes of SO2, 4500 tonnes of NOx,  and no less than
6.5 million tonnes of CO2. It will also produce some 400 tonnes of various toxic heavy metals in the ash.  The nuclear plant will produce 30 tonnes of
highly radioactive spent fuel per year.
<P>The methods for the disposal of the limited amounts of nuclear waste are intended to ensure isolation for tens of thousands of years.  This
contrasts with our current free release of most of the waste resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.  For fossil fuels the final waste disposal site is the
ground and the atmosphere.  It would seem desirable, however, that the consensus which exists on responsible management, transport and disposal
of nuclear wastes should be laid down in international standards for both civilian and military wastes.  Such standards are, in fact, being elaborated by
the IAEA, and a binding convention is also likely to be worked out within some years.
<P><B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>In the matter of safety, it is understood by the nuclear power industry that the level worldwide must be so high that accidents with significant
releases into the environment will virtually never occur.  National and international authorities are dedicated to achieving this, and there is an
intensification of international co-operation.  To existing non-binding standards for nuclear safety there may soon be added an international convention
containing safety fundamentals, which will become legally binding upon States adhering to it.
<P>The IAEA is promoting nuclear safety in several ways other than by the conclusion of binding international conventions.
<P>The Agency has developed a comprehensive set of Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) comprising some sixty publications in five subject
areas associated with nuclear power.  Following the Chernobyl accident, relevant standards were updated to take account of experience from the
accident and advances in knowledge and approaches.  The NUSS publications reflect an international consensus on the requirements for nuclear
safety and form a basis on which national requirements can be built.
<P>Since the 1980s, the Agency has also provided a growing number of advisory expert services to improve safety at specific nuclear
installations.
<P>In 1985, the IAEA established a high-level International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG), composed of senior safety experts, to give
independent advice on nuclear safety issues.  INSAG produced, in 1988, a particularly important, comprehensive set of Basic Safety Principles for
Nuclear Power Plants.  Included in these principles is the goal that existing nuclear power plants should have a probability of a severe accident not
greater than one in 10,000 operating years.  The probability of an accident requiring protective measures off the site should not exceed one in 100,000
operating years.  Future nuclear plants should be safer than this by a factor of at least ten.  The present goal is considered achievable through good
safety management and a `safety culture'.
<P>The design safety goal set by INSAG for new plants is easily surpassed by most  emerging designs.  These designs often include passive
safety features and seek to achieve a design level of safety at which the risks of an accident are determined mainly be external events such as
possible airplane crashes or earthquakes rather than internal plant faults.  The IAEA is seeking further international agreement on more detailed safety
objectives for future plants based on these new designs.
<P>The IAEA has also developed an International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) - to classify the severity of nuclear accidents and incidents in a
manner that is understandable to news media and the public.  This event scale may help to show to the public that most nuclear incidents and events
are trivial.  This may be important because the public's attitude to nuclear power is based on its perceptions of how well nuclear power functions.
<P>If an excellent international operating record is attained over a period of time for nuclear power plants worldwide, and if this is perceived by the
public, I think we will find that the expanded use of nuclear power, which may prove to be indispensable from the environmental point of view, may
also be fully acceptable to the public.
<P>It is clearly a great challenge for you in Russia to make nuclear energy safe and environmentally acceptable in the Russian Federation - not
least to clean up after accidents and imprudent waste handling.  The IAEA is working to assist you in this vital work to improve nuclear safety and
restore the environment.
<P>I should now like to use a few minutes to talk about recent IAEA work outside the themes of nuclear power and the environment - especially
as this work has regard to the countries of the former Soviet Union.
<P>The growing acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards - e.g. in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa - is giving the Agency more installations
and ever-growing quantities of nuclear material to safeguard.  An even greater challenge has arisen from the expectation of the public and of
governments, after the events in Iraq, that full-scope safeguards should be strengthened to detect and deter any non-declared secret nuclear
activities.
<P><B>Safeguards in the Newly Independent States (NIS)</B>
<P>The IAEA is now preparing for the application of safeguards in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.  According to
information provided to us by the depositaries of the NPT, currently four of these States - Azerbaijan, Estonia, Lithuania and Uzbekistan - have joined
to the NPT.  Safeguards agreements have been or are in the process of being concluded with these States.  Already safeguards are being introduced
at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania and we expect work to begin soon on verification of the initial inventory for Lithuania.  In the remaining
States of the former Soviet Union - apart from Russia - the Agency has continued activities to prepare for the future application of safeguards.
<P>The Agency has obtained information about nuclear materials, identified safeguards equipment needs, and verified inventories of nuclear
material.  Almost all of the major nuclear facilities and installations in Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan have now been visited by Agency
experts.  Thus, it is expected that all preparatory activities for the future application of safeguards will be completed soon in these States.  However,
for the Agency to actually apply safeguards, the conclusion of safeguards agreements will be required and this will occur after accession to the NPT.
<P><B>Radiation Protection in the NIS</B>
<P>In response to requests from several countries of the former Soviet Union, the Agency has developed an international initiative aimed at
strengthening national infrastructures for radiation protection and nuclear safety in countries of the former Soviet Union.  The Secretariat of the Agency
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) worked out a proposal designed to address problems not covered by other international
initiatives to date, notably the safety issues related to research reactors, uranium mining and milling, and installations using radiation sources in
medicine, agriculture and industry.
<P>The initiative comprises three phases: (1) a meeting for the exchange of information; (2) the development of projects, consisting of assistance
packages for individual countries or for groups of countries with similar needs; and (3) the actual implementation of these assistance packages.
<P>The meeting which took place in Vienna from 4 to 7 May was attended by representatives of Russia and most of the former States members
of the Soviet Union.  UNDP financed this first phase of the project and has indicated that up to $300,000 may be made available soon to implement
the second phase of the initiative, project developments and some of the immediate actions.
<P><B>The accident at Tomsk</B>
<P>Last April the Agency was invited to visit the nuclear centre, Tomsk-7, in Siberia, where an accident at a reprocessing plant had taken place a
few days earlier.  The purpose was to provide representatives of the international community with first hand information about the radiological situation
in the area of the accident and its consequences for the population and the environment.  Less than 24 hours after the invitation had arrived at the
Agency, we had experts on their way to Siberia.  The team undertook a preliminary assessment of the radiological situation.  Some samples of soil,
vegetation, water and snow, collected by the team of experts which inspected the site of the accident, were analysed at the Agency's laboratories in
Seibersdorf.  The measurements confirmed the absence of radiologically significant amounts of caesium isotopes.  The amount of plutonium in
vegetation and soil was also found to be negligible.  The measurements also confirmed the data communicated by the Russian officials on the relative
composition of the four fission products: zirconium-95, ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106 and niobium-95.  A report containing a number of
recommendations was submitted to the Russian authorities.
<P><B>Visit to St. Petersburg</B>
<P>In May 1993 the Agency's Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team (ASSET) carried out a two week visit to the Leningrad Nuclear
Power Plant.  Since the Chernobyl accident, a great number of safety improvements have been carried out at the plant, however the ASSET team
found that the training of the operators and maintenance personnel could be improved and the failure of the electrical, control and instrumentation
systems is occurring too frequently.  More recently a large team of experts under Agency auspices visited the Smolensk nuclear power plant Nr. 3 and
had useful discussions with their Russian counterparts.
<P><B>Nuclear dumping in the sea</B>
<P>The issue of nuclear waste dumping in the Arctic Seas by the former Soviet Union has attracted much international public attention and the
Agency seeks to help establish the facts.  A project has been launched which seeks to evaluate the possible health and environmental effects of the
dumping.  Secondly the Agency is directly involved in the Norwegian-Russian exploratory visits to the Barents and Kara Seas through the participation
of staff of the Monaco Laboratory.  More information has still to be obtained before a reliable assessment of the potential impact of the dumping can be
made, but it is hoped that the work can be completed and reported to the London Convention within three years.
<P><B>Let me sum up:</B>
<OL>
<LI>The environmental problems which are facing us have gone from local to becoming regional and global and now threaten to have a
serious impact on the global climate.  The wastes from our energy use are an important part of the problem, in particular the CO2, SO2 and NOx from
fossil fuels.
<LI>	Many nuclear techniques are of direct help to avoid environmental damage and to use natural resources more efficiently.  We must
make more efforts to demystify nuclear energy to the public and explain that we can use it and are using it to the benefit of the world.
<LI>	We must explain in particular that nuclear power, used safely, gives us great amounts of energy without causing acid rains or global
warming.  The limited volumes of waste which it produces can be altogether isolated from the biosphere.
<LI>	We must further show in practice that the nuclear waste can be safely handled and clean up where it has been imprudently handled,
especially in the military sphere.
<LI>	We must show, through coming years of good nuclear operations around the whole world, that nuclear power is one of the safest
ways of generating energy.
<LI>	Lastly through nuclear disarmament and successful non-proliferation we must ensure that nuclear energy becomes an exclusively
peaceful power.
</OL>
In the matter of safety, it is understood by the nuclear power industry that the level worldwide must be so high that accidents with significant
releases into the environment will virtually never occur.  National and international authorities are dedicated to achieving this, and there is an

material.  Almost all of the major nuclear facilities and installations in Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan have now been visited by Agency
experts.  Thus, it is expected that all preparatory activities for the future application of safeguards will be completed soon in these States.  However,
for the Agency to actually apply safeguards, the conclusion of safeguards agreements will be required and this will occur after accession to the NPT.
<P><B>Radiation Protection in the NIS</B>
<P>In response to requests from several countries of the former Soviet Union, the Agency has developed an international initiative aimed at
strengthening national infrastructures for radiation protection and nuclear safety in countries of the former Soviet Union.  The Secretariat of the Agency
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) worked out a proposal designed to address problems not covered by other international
initiatives to date, notably the safety issues related to research reactors, uranium mining and milling, and installations using radiation sources in
medicine, agriculture and industry.
<P>The initiative comprises three phases: (1) a meeting for the exchange of information; (2) the development of projects, consisting of assistance
packages for individual countries or for groups of countries with similar needs; and (3) the actual implementation of these assistance packages.
<P>The meeting which took place in Vienna from 4 to 7 May was attended by representatives of Russia and most of the former States members
of the Soviet Union.  UNDP financed this first phase of the project and has indicated that up to $300,000 may be made available soon to implement
the second phase of the initiative, project developments and some of the immediate actions.
<P><B>The accident at Tomsk</B>
<P>Last April the Agency was invited to visit the nuclear centre, Tomsk-7, in Siberia, where an accident at a reprocessing plant had taken place a
few days earlier.  The purpose was to provide representatives of the international community with first hand information about the radiological situation
in the area of the accident and its consequences for the population and the environment.  Less than 24 hours after the invitation had arrived at the
Agency, we had experts on their way to Siberia.  The team undertook a preliminary assessment of the radiological situation.  Some samples of soil,
vegetation, water and snow, collected by the team of experts which inspected the site of the accident, were analysed at the Agency's laboratories in
Seibersdorf.  The measurements confirmed the absence of radiologically significant amounts of caesium isotopes.  The amount of plutonium in
vegetation and soil was also found to be negligible.  The measurements also confirmed the data communicated by the Russian officials on the relative
composition of the four fission products: zirconium-95, ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106 and niobium-95.  A report containing a number of
recommendations was submitted to the Russian authorities.
<P><B>Visit to St. Petersburg</B>
<P>In May 1993 the Agency's Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team (ASSET) carried out a two week visit to the Leningrad Nuclear
Power Plant.  Since the Chernobyl accident, a great number of safety improvements have been carried out at the plant, however the ASSET team
found that the training of the operators and maintenance personnel could be improved and the failure of the electrical, control and instrumentation
systems is occurring too frequently.  More recently a large team of experts under Agency auspices visited the Smolensk nuclear power plant Nr. 3 and
had useful discussions with their Russian counterparts.
<P><B>Nuclear dumping in the sea</B>
<P>The issue of nuclear waste dumping in the Arctic Seas by the former Soviet Union has attracted much international public attention and the
Agency seeks to help establish the facts.  A project has been launched which seeks to evaluate the possible health and environmental effects of the
dumping.  Secondly the Agency is directly involved in the Norwegian-Russian exploratory visits to the Barents and Kara Seas through the participation
of staff of the Monaco Laboratory.  More information has still to be obtained before a reliable assessment of the potential impact of the dumping can be
made, but it is hoped that the work can be completed and reported to the London Convention within three years.
<P><B>Let me sum up:</B>
<OL>
<LI>	The environmental problems which are facing us have gone from local to becoming regional and global and now threaten to have a
serious impact on the global climate.  The wastes from our energy use are an important part of the problem, in particular the CO2, SO2 and NOx from
fossil fuels.
<P>
<LI>Many nuclear techniques are of direct help to avoid environmental damage and to use natural resources more efficiently.  We must
make more efforts to demystify nuclear energy to the public and explain that we can use it and are using it to the benefit of the world.
<LI>We must explain in particular that nuclear power, used safely, gives us great amounts of energy without causing acid rains or global
warming.  The limited volumes of waste which it produces can be altogether isolated from the biosphere.
<LI>We must further show in practice that the nuclear waste can be safely handled and clean up where it has been imprudently handled,
especially in the military sphere.
<LI>	We must show, through coming years of good nuclear operations around the whole world, that nuclear power is one of the safest
ways of generating energy.
<LI>	Lastly through nuclear disarmament and successful non-proliferation we must ensure that nuclear energy becomes an exclusively
peaceful power.

<P><HR>Mr. Vice Minister Hong Gun Pyo,<BR>Representatives of the DPRK,
<P>I am pleased that we have now signed an agreement whereby the DPRK is submitting all nuclear material and facilities in the DPRK - present and future - to IAEA safeguards verification.  The DPRK is a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  IAEA safeguards are applied to verify that the parties to that treaty are using all nuclear material and installations for exclusively peaceful purposes.  To create the openness that is necessary for confidence, regionally and globally, these safeguards must be effective and comprehensive.  We are trying to strengthen them.
<P>We look forward to an early ratification of the agreement by the DPRK and to full co-operation with IAEA in the implementation of the agreement.  I should like to thank all those who have been involved in the negotiation and drafting of the agreement and thank the delegation from the DPRK for having come here to sign the agreement.<HR>

<P>
<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>To many people the words "atomic" or "nuclear" evoke mainly fear.  They think of bombs and Chernobyl.  It is certainly important for us to be aware of the risks of some uses of the atom, because they do exist.  But this should not lead us to overlook, for instance, that radiation is a principal way of treating cancer.  Nor should we forget that over 16% of the world's electricity supply comes from nuclear power - compared with 17% for hydro power.  Nuclear energy can be used for good and bad.  It can be used prudently or carelessly.  Used for peaceful purposes and prudently nuclear energy has tremendous benefits to offer mankind.
<P>In 1957 the IAEA began its work with the twin tasks of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and of verifying that such use was exclusively peaceful.  This remains the core of the Agency's work.  However, the volume of work has increased much since 1957.  Let me give you some figures.
<P>We should all be aware that budget and manpower increases do not necessarily mean that useful work is done.  It depends on what you do with the money and the people!  However, the IAEA is an international organization with a reputation for using both its money and its personnel well, and I think the figures which I will give you therefore do say something about expansion of useful work by the IAEA.
<P>In its first full year of work, l958, there were 81 professional staff in the secretariat.  In 1992, there are 721.  In 1958, the budget was just under $4 million.  For 1992, the  budget is approximately $200 million.  From outside the budget some $43 million are available for technical co-operation.  Membership today stands at 112 States, and will soon be 116 when the three Baltic States and Yemen ratify the Statute.  The Russian Federation will continue the membership, rights and obligations of the USSR and we expect States of the Commonwealth of Independent States to join.
<P>The IAEA does not operate any nuclear power plants.  Nor does it licence such plants.  Nor does it run any cancer radiation wards.  What, then, does it do?
<P>The Agency is an instrument through which the member governments co-operate in the nuclear field.  The co-operation takes four main forms:
<P>The first is the exchange of information and experience.  There are, for instance, over 200 international expert meetings a year.  Experience is also shared through the dissemination of a vast number of specialist publications and through the operation of the 
International Nuclear Information System (INIS), a comprehensive database which is an electronic bibliography for nuclear science and technology.
<P>	A second - more advanced - form of co-operation lies in the joint international elaboration of norms in various nuclear matters, e.g. recommendations, standards, guidelines or, indeed, binding conventions.
<P>The third form of co-operation is the collective effort to try to obtain assurance, through the safeguards system, that nuclear material and installations in civil programmes are not diverted from peaceful to military uses and that all material subject to safeguards are declared and safeguarded.
<P>The fourth form of co-operation is using the Agency as a mechanism for services to Member States.  The transfer of technology from the industrialized to developing countries through technical assistance and co-operation is such a service.  There are many services organized to strengthen nuclear safety and radiation protection.  You might also consider the safeguards system a service.  The outside, independent and impartial verification of the peaceful character of nuclear activities in States is a service to Member States to have it demonstrated with a credibility that self-inspection can never give, that activities on their territories are exclusively peaceful.  Trade in nuclear material and equipment would hardly be possible without safeguards.
<OL>
<LI><B>	TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER: NUCLEAR ENERGY AND DEVELOPING WORLD </B>
	I shall begin to talk about the Agency's role in the transfer of technology to developing countries.
<P>	What role does nuclear energy have for developing countries?  It is very clear in today's world that "appropriate" technology is much more than tractors and sewing machines.  Where advanced   including nuclear   technology can be used economically and competently for development, it should be used.
<UL>
<LI>(a)	Agriculture
<P>	In the field of agriculture, where we operate a joint programme with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), nuclear techniques are in fact already making a substantial impact.  Let me touch here on some of the key uses in the agricultural field.
<P>Fertilizers.  Nitrogen fertilizers are used widely to increase agricultural production.  If they are used excessively or inappropriately, however, many fertilizers harm the environment and lead to pollution of water supplies.  A nuclear technique, which uses a stable nitrogen isotope as a tracer, can help us to determine the best form, timing, and 
placement of fertilizers and thereby to avoid waste and reduce pollution.  Other isotopes are used to detect, measure, and track fertilizer supplied nutrients in soil and plants, to determine the availability of soil moisture, and to study the natural process of nitrogen fixation by certain plants.  Thereby you can considerably reduce fertilizer costs, and at the same time increase plant protein.
<P>	Sustainable agricultural production requires an adequate supply of water in soils.   Nuclear techniques help irrigation specialists and others to choose the best option to increase or improve the way water resources are used.  Results of co ordinated research programmes where neutron moisture gauges are used extensively show that traditional irrigation methods can be improved to cut total water use by 40%.  Saved resources can thus be spent to irrigate additional areas.
<P>Plant breeding and genetics.  The radiation of seeds, provoking mutants, can be used to develop new strains of important food crops.  Sometimes these techniques are used in combination with other biotechnology.   These techniques have yielded new varieties of many different crop species, such as rice, wheat, and soy bean.  They may have a better resistance to disease, be of a higher product quality, or have a higher yield.  Worldwide, more than l500 mutant cultivars of crop plants and ornamental plants have been released to growers in the past 30 years.  Eight percent of agricultural land in China, for example, is planted with mutants of rice, wheat, corn, and cotton.  In Asia as a whole, over 600 plant varieties derived from seeds or plant tissues exposed to ionizing radiation are now growing on millions of hectares of land.
<P>The Agency provides assistance to Member States in the proper application of mutation breeding techniques in highly diversifed plant breeding programmes.  Research contracts and agreements focus on the advancement of mutation breeding technology particularly to improve root and tuber crops, oil seed crops, and cereals, and to improve resistance to disease.  Plant breeders from 46 countries at a recent meeting assessed the economic benefit of mutant crop cultivars as running into billions of dollars.
<P>Animal production and health.  Sensitive techniques based on the use of radioactive "tracers" are used to improve animal production and health,  e.g. in studies of the productivity of sheep and goats in both Africa and Asia.  Similar methods are used to determine whether animals are infected with disease causing agents.
<P>To make some of the modern nuclear-based techniques easier to use in the field, the Agency produces standardized kits and distributes them worldwide.  For example, under the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign, kits are sent regularly to 17 African countries so that veterinarians can monitor accurately the progress of their vaccination programmes.
<P>	Insect and Pest Control.  Radiation can be used to sexually sterilize insects.  When insects that are mass reared and sterilized in laboratories are released in the wild population, the female mates of sterilized males will not produce offspring.  This method, called the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), has been used successfully to control or eradicate dangerous insects and pests which account for substantial losses in food supplies and animal production.  The technique has been further developed at the IAEA's Laboratories.
<P>The technique has been used in the past to successfully eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly in Mexico and against various species of tsetse fly in Nigeria.
<P>	I am happy to report a further success for the technique in eradicating the New World Screwworm Fly here in Libya over a ten month period.  The fly, first detected in Libya in 1988, infested more than 12,000 animals here in 1990.  It could have spread elsewhere in 
Africa and the Mediterranean Basin, with devastating consequences for livestock and wild animals.  However, following the release of over 1,300 million sterile male flies only 6 cases were recorded in Libya in the whole of 1991.  Monitoring work has continued since release of the sterile flies ended in October last year, and if no further evidence is found, the Libyan Government should be able to declare the country officially free of the pest by June of this year.  The organization and equipment which has been set up for the screwworm and so successfully operated here in Libya, could perhaps be used now to tackle the Mediterranean Fruit Fly.
<P>	This is an excellent example of a collaborative effort, in which Libya, the FAO, the IAEA, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) combined their efforts.  Support also came from the Swedish International Development Authority, the Austrian Government, in addition to a number of other donors.  Later on you will hear more about nuclear applications in 
agriculture from Dr. Sigurbjoernsson, Director of our Joint Division with FAO and on the screwworm programme from Dr. Lindquist, Director of the screwworm field programme here in Libya who, in fact, is on loan from the IAEA to the eradication campaign.
<P><LI>(b)	Medicine<P>An area which is just as important as agriculture in terms of nuclear applications is the medical field.  A wide spectrum of techniques is available.  To take an example, chemical compounds "labelled" with short lived radioactive isotopes are especially useful for diagnostic purposes.  These compounds are "watched" as they travel through the human organs which are being studied to assess how well they are functioning.  
<P>	Radiation biology and radiotherapy.  In many countries, doctors use disposable sterilized prepacked medical supplies, such as hydodermic syringes and needles, that are thrown away after only one clinical use.  To improve quality control of sterility, the Agency has developed a code of practice for the radiation sterilization of disposable medical supplies.  The Egyptian Government with the assistance of UNDP and the Agency has installed irradiation facilities to sterilize medical supplies and preserve food using irradiation.  At the present time the Agency is assisting Syria to set up a pilot scale irradiation facility for radiation sterilization purposes.
<P>A variety of radiation techniques for cancer treatment has been devised especially for use in developing countries, where hospital resources are often limited.  One particularly successful technique is for the treatment of cervical cancer, which is common in many 
developing countries.  The Agency and WHO together with the Government of Italy, are supporting the use of this technique in Egypt where it is saving hundreds of lives each year.
<P>	Radiation dosimetry.  As many as one out of every three cancer patients in industrialized countries may receive radiation treatments.  The dose of radiation each patient receives must be precise.  Accurate dosimetry   the measurement of radiation doses 
  is vitally important.  The IAEA and many institutes in Member States have established a network of Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratories (SSDLs) to expand the number of laboratories that can maintain accurate standard measurement instruments.  With the assistance of the Agency an SSDL has been set up in Egypt and Algeria and one is at present under construction in Libya.  National laboratories participating in this network can determine the accuracy of their own instruments and check instruments used in the field.  For countries wihtout an operational SSDL, the IAEA's dosimetry laboratory at Seibersdorf in Austria provides calibration services upon request.
<P>	Industrial applications.   Many applications of radiation and radioisotopes are now well established in industry.  They include non destructive testing, control systems and radioactive tracers, analytical techniques and quality control.
<P>Radiotracer applications in chemical, oil, steel and cement industries have offered great economic benefits and have provided solutions to problems which could not be solved by other techniques.
<P>The most important "industrial" application of nuclear energy - nuclear power to generate electricity - is a subject to which I will revert in a moment.
</UL>
<LI><B>	IAEA REGIONAL PROGRAMMES   AFRA</B>
<P>Over the years, the IAEA and its members have found it practical to promote co operative nuclear research, development and training projects through regional institutions.  We have had very positive results from the Regional Co operation Agreement (RCA) in Asia 
and its younger counterpart   ARCAL   in Latin America.  The latest is the African Regional Co operation Agreement related to nuclear science and technology, known as AFRA.  Thirteen countries have so far acceded to it. 
<P>Regional activities can allow resources to be used more efficiently: experts can advise counterparts in several countries during the same assignment, equipment can be purchased more economically for several laboratories, and training can be organized regionally at lower cost and in the mother tongue of the participants.
<P>The AFRA programme is based on the concept of collaboration among participating African countries.  As activities increase in that region co ordination and co operation amongst countries and institutions in it should continue to improve.
In regional projects emphasis is placed on the development priorities of the Member States in the region and on contributing to their institution building.  Both are crucial in the African region where many of the countries have limited resources.
<P>	The AFRA programme has prudently concentrated at the outset on a limited number of areas.
<P>These include:<P>  Waste management, to provide training for scientists and technicians.  With Agency assistance Egypt has established a facility for the storage or treatment of liquid and solid low and medium level radioactive wastes.  This is a subject of high priority for Algeria, Egypt and Libya.
<P>Food preservation by radiation processing, in which Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Nigeria are active.
<P>Nuclear instrumentation: to maintain and repair nuclear instruments and to establish a capability to design and manufacture simple instruments.  Here, Algeria, Egypt, Madagascar, Nigeria and Tunisia are co-operating.
<P><UL>
<LI>-		Non destructive testing techniques, to improve quality control and safety through standardized, regionally harmonized certification schemes, involving Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.
<P>	Other projects are under consideration such as one to determine the areas with Mediterranean fruit fly infestation in Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia as a basis for future programmes using the sterile insect technique.
<P>	Another effort of particular interest to developing countries, which was initiated with the active involvement of Libya, concerns the assessment of the costs of potable water production by various sizes of nuclear desalination plants at selected promising sites and to compare the costs of desalination by nuclear and other means.  Additionally, several North African countries, including Libya, have submitted a request to the Agency for assistance in carrying out a feasibility study on nuclear desalination at selected sites in this region.  It was decided to proceed simultaneously with a general assessment of nuclear desalination costs and the feasibility study.
<P>	Radiation Protection.  As nuclear techniques are used more widely, a condition for acceptance is effective protection against any injury or damage.  This is why the Agency places great emphasis on radiation protection.
<P>The number of major radiation sources in medicine, agriculture and industry - cobalt, caesium, etc. - continues to grow.  Although the overall safety record is good, it is essential to ensure that users and regulatory authorities continue to be able to meet their responsibilities, notably in the area of management of spent sources.  Radiation accidents involving loss of life or causing extensive exposures and damages have occurred in the last years in Goiania in Brazil, in Morocco, in El Salvador, in Spain (Saragossa) and in France.
<P>The IAEA has launched a new project, of particular interest to developing countries, to improve the safe management of spent sources of radiation used in medicine, industry, and other fields.  Such sources include cobalt 60 (commonly used in radiotherapy units and 
industrial irradiators) iridium 192 (used in industrial radiography and medical care), caesium 137 (used in agricultural moisture and density gauges, medical care, and radiography), and radium, once widely distributed in developing and industrialized countries for medical and other applications but now largely replaced by other sources.  Worldwide, more than half a million sealed radiation sources are estimated to be in commercial use.
<P>The project is particularly directed towards assisting developing countries, where needs are considered most urgent.  The estimated number of spent radiation sources in developing countries is about 30,000, most of which are radium sources.  Under the project's action plan, which covers a period of 5 years, international experts will convene training courses and conduct field missions to assist authorities in identifying, collecting, conditioning, and properly storing spent radiation sources.  Also planned is assistance to countries interested in establishing interim storage facilities on a national or regional basis.  Before concluding my comments on the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries through the IAEA, I should like to stress that we could handle a much larger volume of Technical Co-operation Projects if more funds were available.  For instance, in the 1992 TC Programme, projects positively assessed and representing a total value of       $14 million, have not been included because of lack of funds.
</UL>
<LI><B>NUCLEAR POWER</B>
<P>I turn now to the subject of nuclear power.  We live in an energy hungry world, where appetite for electricity in particular is growing.  Increase in the world population, urbanization and the demand for a higher standard of living provide the basis for the greater 
demand for electricity.  Over the past 15 years energy use more than doubled in developing 
nations and electricity demand went up by almost 200%.  This electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent into the next century whereas the world's total consumption of electricity will be growing at a rate of about 3 percent.
<P>
</OL>
The World Energy Council reports that worldwide consumption of energy will increase by 50 to 75 percent by the year 2020, even with vigorous efforts for more efficient uses of energy.  The question is:  where will this energy come from?
<P>The answer is that there will be a mix, as there is today, of fossil fuels coal, oil, gas   plus hydro power and nuclear, with renewables such as solar, wind power and biomass becoming significant only well into the next century.  China plans to double its coal burning capacity in this next decade, and in India it is supposed to treble, although both countries do have a nuclear component as well.
<P>The problem with burning fossil fuels is the effect they are reported to have on the world's atmosphere and climate   the greenhouse effect and, regionally, in the form of acidification.
<P>Nuclear power has the advantage of giving rise to no harmful emissions in normal operation.   This means nuclear power helps us to avoid CO2 and NOx and SO2 emissions.  According to our calculation, if the electricity currently produced by nuclear power plants 
worldwide were produced instead by burning coal, a further 8 percent or l.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide would be added to the world's atmosphere.
<P>The Japanese Government has announced two new programmes on energy policy   one is "Targets for Supply of Alternative Energy Sources to Oil" and the other is an "Action Programme to Arrest Global Warming."  The Japanese plans include targets for use of alternative energy sources for oil including nuclear power.  Those targets state that the supply of nuclear power will increase 2.5 times between 1989 and 2010 with a target of 30.8% of electricity coming from nuclear by then.  The Action Programme to reduce greenhouse effect causing gases states that Japan will stabilize carbon dioxide emissions per capita after 2000 at the same levels as 1990 on condition that the industrialized countries of the world make joint efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  It is difficult to see how such efforts can be achieved without the contribution that nuclear can make.
<P>It is clear that we can hope to reduce or contain CO2 emissions only through international action and it is generally understood that at least one of these actions will have to involve limiting the burning of fossil fuels.  Such a limitation will raise formidable economic and political problems.  Developing countries are not likely to accept limitation of their economic development plans to help solve a problem which has been caused mostly by 
the industrialized world.  It may also reasonably be argued that the technically more 
advanced countries have a political duty to employ nuclear power as the technically more demanding solution.
<P>	I do not claim that expanded use of nuclear power alone is the answer to the greenhouse problem.  I do believe, however, that it must be part of the answer.
<P>Among the objections to nuclear power that are frequently voiced, three are particularly common:  the issues of safety, waste and proliferation.  Let me address all three.<P><B>Safety.</B><BR>
  No one will deny that operating nuclear power requires adequate safety everywhere in the world.  Some have suggested that there should be binding international safety rules and inspection of their implementation.  Although governments are not at present ready to confer a supervisory role on any international body in the field of nuclear safety, they may accept some binding rules relating to safety.  The Agency is currently exploring the possibility of drafting a global safety convention, to which a series of specific protocols on specific safety issues, e.g. transport of nuclear material, etc. could be attached.
<P>Already in the 1970s an international consensus on safety standards and practices was worked out within the IAEA, the so called NUSS programme, with five Codes of Practice for nuclear power plant safety.  Member States have used these extensively in the elaboration of national regulations.  To take an important example, China, with its emerging nuclear power programme, has adopted the NUSS standards as the basis for its national regulatory requirements.
<P>Standards and regulation are not enough to ensure nuclear safety.  Equal attention must be paid to operational safety in the some 430 nuclear power plants which are now 
operating in the world and the 100 or so plants which will soon be put into operation.  To 
assist its Member States in this regard, the Agency is offering several services which are being increasingly used.
<P>Most important are the so called Operational Safety Review Teams (OSARTs) are sent to nuclear power plants in response to a request.  The teams are composed of experts from both the Agency and Member States. Over a period of several weeks they thoroughly review plant operations management and procedures.
<P>What about the future nuclear power plants which are supposed to be safer and more tolerant of human errors than the ones belonging to the current generation?
<P>Actually even today's most common types of nuclear power reactors are designed to tolerate a great deal of human error.  Their safety systems have much built in redundancy and they rely on decades of proven technology and engineering.  In the TMI accident, the containment worked as the final barrier in spite of several operator errors which caused a melt of about 50% of the core.  The accident at Chernobyl occurred because of deficiencies in the design and because several safety systems had in fact been switched off.
<P>The industry now seems ready to present advanced versions of the currently most common reactor types, with standardized and simpler design, more "passive" safety features and often smaller sizes.  This could make them attractive for the industrialized countries 
seeking to meet the current lower rate of increase in electricity demand.  They might also 
be interesting for some developing countries.  The emergence of these new reactors should not and does not preclude R & D work on radically new types of power reactors.  From the Agency's side, we are seeking to promote renewed co operation on this subject between governments and industry, also internationally.
<P><B>Nuclear waste management.</B>
<P>  Nuclear waste is another issue of key importance for public acceptance of nuclear power.  Experts have been convinced for a number of years that the concepts and technologies which already exist for waste disposal guarantee the safety of present and future generations.  However, the public concern, often caused by nuclear opposition groups, remains in many countries.  A sustained effort to disseminate factual information is needed.  However, the actual construction of repositories for waste and installations for interim disposal of spent fuel would be the most tangible way to demonstrate our ability to handle this issue.  Such construction will gradually come in more and more countries.
<P>Within the IAEA a programme   called RADWASS   will provide a structured series of international consensus documents on radioactive waste management safety.  It may be particularly valuable for developing States wishing to establish waste management programmes.
<P>Transboundary movement of radioactive waste.  Recently an expert code was adopted by consensus within the IAEA on the international transboundary movement of radioactive waste.  This code was a response to reports of illicit transfer and dumping of hazardous 
wastes, notably in African countries.  Although no case of illicit dumping of nuclear waste had been found, the Agency's Member States have drafted a code which establishes basic principles for the transfer of radioactive wastes.  It affirms the sovereign right of every State to prohibit the movement of radioactive waste into, from or through its territory.  It further requires that transboundary movements of radioactive waste should only take place in 
accordance with internationally accepted safety standards, and with the prior notification and consent of the sending, receiving and transit States and in accordance with their respective laws and regulations.
<UL>
<LI>4.<B>	SAFEGUARDS: PREVENTING DIVERSION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL</B>
<P>	A third public concern about nuclear power is the risk that its use may facilitate a proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Although none of the five declared nuclear-weapon States came to nuclear weapons via the development of civil nuclear power, the risk of a misuse of such programmes exists.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty and some other treaties enable States to make binding pledges not to use peaceful installations to develop weapons.  To be credible such pledges require verification of the nuclear activities.  
<P>The task of verifying that nuclear material in civil inventories and programmes remains peaceful and are not diverted to military applications has now been a central function of the IAEA for a quarter of a century.  This was the world's first experience of international on-site inspection.  Of late, it has taken on even greater importance as a result of several factors.
<P><UL>
	<LI>First, the more the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-weapon States may become reduced, the more important it becomes that no further States acquire and develop nuclear weapons capacity.<P>
<LI>Secondly, the tendency is toward more universal support for non-proliferation.  Both China and France are preparing to sign the Non Proliferation Treaty.  South Africa has already adhered to the treaty and accepted inspections by the IAEA.  Late last year Argentina and Brazil accepted a comprehensive safeguards agreement.  A similar step was just taken by the DPRK.  The NPT has already 140 States parties.  I see universality of adherence to the non-proliferation regime as a realistic and desirable ambition for 1995 when the NPT comes up for extension.  The regime must then be reliable.<P>	The discovery of a major clandestine uranium enrichment programme in Iraq, an NPT country with full-scope safeguards, has led to calls for more vigorous checks and inspection to ensure that all countries that have adhered to the NPT and have accepted to place all nuclear installations under IAEA safeguards actually live up to their obligations.
<P>	To give confidence that there is no clandestine development of nuclear weapons anywhere, the IAEA verification system must be strengthened.
</UL>
<P>What sort of steps do we have in mind?  The Agency needs to receive information from a variety of sources and not be dependent exclusively on the declarations of an inspected State.  We cannot look for possibly undeclared material or activities unless 
we have some information about them.  However, all information must be very carefully evaluated.  If there were reasons to believe that undeclared nuclear material or facilities existed, the State concerned would be asked for explanations.  Should such explanations be 
deemed inadequate, the possibility of a special inspection would come to the fore.  Should the State refuse to receive such inspection, the Board of Governors might transmit the question to the Security Council.
<P>Some have asked whether the IAEA's inspections in Iraq will serve as a model for strengthened safeguards.  The answer is no.  The role which the IAEA has been called upon to play in Iraq by the Security Council under Resolution 687 goes far beyond what will be acceptable to States under safeguards.  It is clear, however, that safeguards must be improved as regards their ability to give confidence about the absence of non-declared nuclear facilities.
<P>To a State which respects a pledge given under the NPT or other treaty not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons the strengthening of safeguards should be welcomed.  There is no question of encroachment of sovereignty.  These activities take place on the basis of agreements freely made.  The verification which occurs will result in a stronger - more credible - assurance about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.  Indeed, it would seem to me that if allegations were made about the existence of clandestine nuclear activities or installations in a country, that country would be well advised spontaneously to ask the 
<P>IAEA to visit the location and report on it.  IAEA verification should be able to detect violations of NPT and safeguards agreements, but they should also be able to clear a country of unfounded allegations or suspicions.
I shall not go into many other measures that are now discussed in order to strengthen the effectiveness of safeguards and thereby the confidence they can offer that a country accepting full-scope safeguards actually respects its non-proliferation pledge.
<P>	I should mention, however, that the IAEA currently has some 200 inspectors and a safeguards budget of some $60 million.  With this we check nuclear material at well over 900 installations worldwide.
<P>The strengthening of safeguards is not the only thing that can be done to reduce the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Supplier States may have to show more rigour and vigilance in the control of experts of nuclear sensitive items and materials.
<P>An even more important factor is détente - global and regional.  Perceived threats to a country's security may constitute an inducement to acquire or approach nuclear weapons capacity.  The geographic areas of continuing proliferation concern are, of course, the Indian sub continent and the Middle East.  It might not be unrealistic to hope that if global nuclear disarmament accelerates and the regional political climate improves, India and Pakistan will at some point be able to come to an arrangement similar to that arrived at recently by Argentina and Brazil whereby mutual, bilateral nuclear openness is practiced and supplemented by international inspections.
</UL>
As regards the Middle East, it can only be hoped that a peaceful settlement will result from the conference that has started.  The question of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, is on the agenda, and might be solved within the context of a broad peaceful settlement.  All the States in the region are on record as supporting a nuclear-
weapon-free zone.  No doubt the question of verification will be central for confidence within such a zone.  I have been asked by the General Conference of the IAEA to explore with 
countries in the region what kind of safeguards would be required and I am doing so through contacts in capitals.  Let me only add on this point that confidence between countries about 
non-proliferation can gradually grow not only from effective verification but also from active co-operation in the nuclear sphere, e.g. through technical or scientific projects.  I wish you well in your efforts at this conference to develop active regional co-operation.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement by IAEA Director General Hans Blix on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the Tlatelolco Treaty</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>25th Anniversary of the Tlatelolco Treaty</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Mexico City, Mexico</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>14 February 1992</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
I appreciate the invitation to participate in this 25th anniversary of the Tlatelolco Treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons in Latin America and I should like to begin by congratulating the Latin-American States to the creation and possession of this important instrument.  May I turn in particular to Mexico which has played such a crucial role as initiator and guardian of the Treaty.  And let me pay homage to that indefatigable and persistent crusader for disarmament who earned the respect of the world for Mexico's and his own efforts, Alfonso Garcia Robles.  His passing away was a great loss for all of us.
<P>Many people think only of bombs and of Chernobyl when "nuclear" is mentioned.  Both are indeed realities which we must tackle.  But in our preoccupation with these problems, we must not forget that nuclear energy is used for enormous benefit to mankind and that its potential for further use is great.
<P>We must not forget that nuclear techniques are of central and growing importance in medicine.  The use of radioisotopes is of great value in diagnostic work and the use of radiation is still a principal method of treating many forms of cancer.
<P>We must not forget that nuclear techniques are helping us to achieve better crops and to protect them.  Nuclear agriculture is an important branch.  New strains of seeds are provoked by radiation and some are found that are more resistant to drought or salt or cold.
<P>Nor should we forget that nuclear power gives the world some 17% of its electricity -only one percent less than all the hydro power in the world.  We must not ignore the Chernobyl accident, but consistently strengthen nuclear safety - phase out or modify reactors that are not up to high standards, design new, safer, easier to operate plants.  But we must also not ignore that nuclear power is the only economically viable alternative to fossil fuels -coal, oil and gas - when we need additional large-scale generation of electricity.  Hydro power is already exploited fully in large areas of the world and renewable sources like wind power and solar power do not yield the quantities we look for.  Within foreseeable time nuclear power is the main alternative, if we wish to avoid increasing our use of the fossil fuels which all give rise to carbon dioxide and thereby contribute to the risk of global warming.  I am not suggesting that nuclear power is the solution to the global warming or acid rain.  But it is unrealistic to believe that we can tackle these problems without the use of nuclear power.
<P>Some people oppose the use of nuclear power for fear that a further reliance on nuclear techniques will lead to weapons production.  We should remember, however, that the weapons techniques can be developed also without power stations.  No one of recognized nuclear-weapon States began with nuclear power.  They began with weapons.  Indeed, even if all the some 430 nuclear power plants in the world were closed, it would not make weapons development impossible.
<P>The road we must go is rather to create such conditions that countries do not feel any security need for nuclear weapons.  Mutuality is of importance.  A country can renounce nuclear weapons if potential adversaries also renounce them and effective verification gives confidence that no cheating occurs.  This is really the basis and rationale of nuclear-weapon-free zones.  It is easier to abstain from these weapons if you do it together with others in the same region.  It is also easier if the five nuclear-weapon States reduce their arsenals through nuclear disarmament and if they stop testing new weapons.
<P>The Tlatelolco Treaty was the first to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in a large inhabited area of the world.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty with its world-wide scope came second.  There is no competition between these treaties.  Most Latin American States are parties to both.  The fundamental aim served by both is to ensure that nuclear weapons do not spread and that disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, be promoted.
<P>As we seek the full accomplishment of that aim in the next five to ten years, the example set by Latin-American States in concluding a treaty that responded to their particular requirements and conditions is important.  It may well be that some other areas, too, may best be made secure against nuclear weapons by regional arrangements.  States in the South Pacific have concluded the Rarotonga Treaty and recently the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have issued a joint declaration for a Non-Nuclear Korean Peninsula, supplementing their adherence to the NPT.  A zone free of weapons of mass destruction is an important point on the agenda of the Middle East.
<P>	Today we have reasons both for optimism and for vigilance.<BR>
<P>The increasing optimism is justified by the fact that there remain only a handful of States with significant nuclear know-how outside the treaties which together form a non-proliferation regime and it is justified by the fact that the largest retainers of nuclear weapons - the United States and Russia - are embarking on significant reductions of their nuclear arsenals.  The nightmarish armaments race should be turned into a disarmament race.  It is not unrealistic, in my view, to aim at a universalization of binding non-proliferation commitments and drastic nuclear disarmament by 1995.
<P>The increasing vigilance is prompted by our recent experience that a State which had legally and voluntarily committed itself to non-proliferation could embark on a weapons programme without being detected.  The very essence of non-proliferation commitments and their verification is that neighbours, regions and the world shall be able to rely upon them with confidence and without risking surprises that may be catastrophic from the viewpoint of security.  If it is not possible to reduce to zero the risk that clandestine and impermissible nuclear activities could take place without detection, it is possible to considerably reduce the risk.
<P>Firstly, a universalization of binding non-proliferation commitments should, in itself, help to reduce the risk of violations.  So long as any States remain outside the non-proliferation regime and the nuclear-weapon States have not decisively embarked upon nuclear disarmament, the regime could still be subject to some strain.
<P>Secondly, the system through which we verify that States comply with their non-proliferation commitments under the various treaties - the safeguards system - can and must be strengthened.  For the vast number of States which rely in their security policies upon non-proliferation pledges of neighbours and other States, it is not enough to feel certain that there is no diversion of nuclear material for weapons purposes from declared facilities.  They want to feel sure that - whether declared or not - no nuclear materials will be devoted to weapons.  Where there exist reasonable doubts in this regard, such doubts call for explanations and - if these are not sufficient - inspection.  In my view we are not here concerned with any inroads on State sovereignty.  Of course, inspectors are given the right to visit countries and nuclear facilities or suspected nuclear facilities.  However, acceptance of the system is a voluntary act, made by States because they find it is in their interest.  Through this system of independent outside inspection their non-proliferation stance achieves a credibility that no self-inspection could offer.
<P>It is now 25 years ago that the Tlatelolco Treaty was concluded.  It has been in force for a great many countries in this hemisphere and it has contributed to the detente between Latin American States.  After the conclusion by Argentina and Brazil of the agreement at Guadalajara last year on a joint accountancy and control system and the safeguards agreement between the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC), Argentina, Brazil and the IAEA, it is not unreasonable to expect that the Tlatelolco Treaty will soon be joined by all parties required for it to enter into force for all.  The world is eagerly looking forward to this event.  I note in this context the Foz de Iguacu Declaration on Common Policy between Argentina and Brazil and the undertakings of the two States "to adopt, after the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency is concluded, pertinent measures leading to the full entry into force for both countries of the Treaty including actions at updating and improving its text."  Entry into force of the treaty should encourage and spur us to new efforts at disarmament and demilitarization.
<P>It is for the parties to the Treaty to examine what improvements may be appropriate in the Tlatelolco Treaty and to decide whether such improvements require formal amendments.
<P>	We need to build on our experience.  Twenty five years ago many thought nuclear explosions might have important peaceful uses.  Experience has told us that such explosions for peaceful purposes are not a practical need and we cannot moreover distinguish them from weapons testing.  Experience has also told us that inspection has not impeded national nuclear development, nor resulted in the revelation of commercial secrets - which some feared 25 years ago.  Experience has rather told us that commitment to non-proliferation and credible verification to it is a precondition for full participation in nuclear trade.  Suppliers want to feel sure that they don't contribute to weapons development.
<P>Verification and inspection still evoke mixed feelings in some.  I think it is time we recognize that verification is a service to all who respect their obligations.  They have nothing to fear from it - only to gain.  And should some State try secretly to disregard its commitment it is vitally important for all others that it be detected at an early stage.  This is a lesson which we have learnt in the past year.
<P>On the part of the IAEA I should like to conclude by expressing support for the efforts to make the Tlatelolco Treaty a live force in a disarming world and by assuring you that the IAEA remains at the service of Latin American States and of all other States to provide with the co-operation of the States comprehensive objective verification of non-proliferation commitments and thereby contribute to confidence, detente and a full use of the peaceful potential of nuclear energy for the benefit of their people.<HR>

<TITLE>Seminar on Energy, Economics, Environment and Nuclear Power</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Seminar on Energy, Economics, Environment and Nuclear Power</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by Hans Blix, IAEA Director General</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Cairo, Egypt</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>3 March 1992</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
The world around us generously generates front page events, such as the break-up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, nuclear disarmament, a conference on peace in the Middle East.  What I am going to talk about this morning may seem to be less breath-taking stuff Ä the environment, energy and economics Ä but these items are of decisive importance for the climate in which our grandchildren will live, the standard they will enjoy and the security they will feel.  Governments and the public have therefore reason to pay serious attention to them.
<P>	Energy is a vital condition for development.  Our standard of living depends on it.  It is no wonder that the world is greedy for it.  There is a clear relationship between the level of economic development and energy consumption.  The average North American uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent per year and the average Chinese uses 590 kg, the average Indian makes do with 280 kg of oil equivalent and here in Egypt, the average per capita consumption is 550 kg oil equivalent per year.
<P>The OECD countries with one sixth of the world's population now use almost one half of the world's primary energy, while the developing countries with three quarters of the world population use less than one third of its primary energy.  The appetite for electricity, in particular, is growing.  Increase in world population, urbanization and the demand for a higher standard of living all drive this greater demand for electricity.  Over the past 15 years, total energy use increased by more than 100% in developing countries, but electricity demand went up by almost 200%.  This demand for electricity by developing countries is projected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 6% into the next century, while the world's total consumption of electricity is expected to grow at a rate of about 3%.
<P>It is hard to overstate the importance of electricity to the standard of living and the quality of life in a country.  A friend of mine told me that his 105 year old father thought the most important change he had experienced in the world during his long life was the introduction of electricity.  We sometimes hear voices urging a return to lifestyles of minimal reliance on energy, including electricity.  The reality is that electricity transports energy to our doorsteps and houses, that ample lighting prolongs our days and makes our streets light at night, that electric pumps bring water to fields and houses, that refrigerators and deep freezers keep our food fresh and reduces spoilage, television allows us to meet the whole world at home.
<P>The services which electricity provide may be taken for granted in industrialized countries but they are anxiously sought by the developing nations of the world.  In these countries the words of the famous Indian nuclear physicist, Homi Bhabha "No energy is more expensive than no energy" are well understood.
<P>An example:  China has the ambition to ensure that each household has a refrigerator.  But to fulfil this desire for a basic improvement in the quality of life, China will have to expend enormous amounts of energy.  Even with refrigerators of modest size and of the most current and efficient model available, they will need a base load capacity of some 20 000 MWe or 20 large nuclear power reactors.
<P>A major driving force behind the appetite for energy, apart from development, is the explosive growth in the world's population.  At the birth of Christ there were some 350 million people on the Earth.  In 1900 there were 1 billion; in 1990 there were more than 5 billion and in the year 2000 there will be well over 6 billion.  Thus, in the last ten years of this century we expect to increase about as much as we did in the one thousand nine hundred years following the birth of Christ! (or from the birth of humanity to the year 1900).
<P>Is it not possible to stop the world's appetite for energy by conservation?  Energy saving is, indeed, of the greatest importance, but even with vigorous efforts for more efficient use of energy, world-wide consumption of energy can be expected to increase by 50 to 75 percent by the year 2020 according to the World Energy Council.
<P>We must ask ourselves:  "Where will this energy come from?"  And, confronted with evidence that already the present level of consumption of energy has brought severe environmental damage world wide, we must understand that there is tremendous tension locally, regionally and globally between the demands for more energy, notably electricity, and the demands for the protection of life, health and the environment.  We face a dilemma.
<P>We must also realize that one cannot change energy systems overnight.  In the foreseeable future there will be an energy mix, as there is today.  Fossil fuels Ä coal, oil gas Ä that now cover a little under 90% of the world's total energy use Ä are certainly not going to be phased out.  Nor is hydro nor nuclear power.
<P>All of these sources will continue to be used, but the proportions in which they come into play have relevance from an economic as well as from an environmental point of view.  The practical questions will rather be whether old coal fired electricity plants are to be replaced by new fossil-fuelled plants or by nuclear?  Or conversely, will old nuclear power plants be replaced by fossil fuelled plants?  In industrialized countries little hydro potential remains to be exploited.  Commercial, new and renewable sources of energy, e.g. biomass, solar and wind power now give less than 0.5% of the world's energy and experts believe they may provide some 3 5% by the year 2010.  This leaves us in reality, for the foreseeable future, with the choice between coal, oil and gas on the one hand and nuclear power on the other.
<P>Looked at from a global standpoint it is reasonable to suggest that the least developed countries should be enabled to use the least demanding technologies, which are the fossil based ones and that the advanced countries should make greater use of the more demanding nuclear technology.  In reality both industrially advanced States and some of the more technologically advanced developing countries are at present planning to use both more gas, coal and nuclear.  Mexico, that is now operating one nuclear power reactor and is scheduled to take another into operation in two years, is also building six coal fired plants to cover its growing needs for electricity.  China Ä while it is at present building a few nuclear plants Ä is also planning to double its coal use by the year 2000.  And India, which has a number of nuclear plants, is planning to treble its use of coal by the same year.  The coal consumption of China and India together would then be greater than the coal consumption of all the advanced industrialized States lumped together.
<P>These are the realities.  The global demand for energy will increase significantly in the future.  However, this demand is now standing face to face with fear about the environmental consequences of even present levels and patterns of energy use.
<P><B>Environmental Concerns</B><P>Twenty years after the first UN Conference on the Environment in Stockholm, we are now becoming painfully aware that environmental problems have not diminished.  On the contrary, they have escalated from the local to the regional level and now pose some threats to the entire planet.  Here in Cairo you are well acquainted with air pollution but it is only part of a much greater problem.  The emissions of SO2 and NOx caused by the burning of coal and oil have led in Europe and North America to the problems of acid rain, dying forests and decaying cities.  To these problems we must now add the global threat of the greenhouse effect which is linked to a great extent to the world's use of fossil fuels.  As you know, the "greenhouse effect" Ä or global warming Ä is the increase in the temperature of the world's atmosphere which is expected to follow from the current level of emissions of some gases of which carbon dioxide is the most important.
<P>Certain gases released into the world's atmosphere Ä primarily chlorofluoro-carbons (CFCs), methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) Ä trap the heat in the atmosphere.  It is calculated that the increases in these gases are gradually leading to a higher temperature in the world's atmosphere Ä with consequent climate changes.  More research can be expected to give us greater certainty about the threat, but many scientists are convinced that we have already experienced a minor warming and that further warming is inevitable.  The question seems only to be whether, through determined action, we are able to slow this development and stabilize it.  The governments of the world are at present jointly focussing upon this issue but so far no world-wide agreement has been reached on world-wide CO2 reductions.
<P>On the other hand the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used in modern refrigerators and in foam plastic production are to be phased out because, apart from being a source of greenhouse gases, they also are destructive to the world's ozone layer and it is this characteristic which has led to an early agreement.  Methane gas gets into the atmosphere from animals, rice paddies and leaks during the production of natural gas.  It is not easy to reduce these emissions.  Then there remains carbon dioxide (CO2), which results from the burning of all fossil fuels and all organic material, including wood.  There is no economically viable way in which CO2 emissions can be avoided in such combustion.  All fossil fuel burning Ä in cars and other machines, in heating and in electricity generation Ä is thought to contribute about 50% of the greenhouse effect.  The current burning of rain forests is deemed to add some further 10 20%.  The different fossil fuels do not, however, contribute CO2 in equal measure.  Counted per unit of energy generated, the burning of gas yields about half as much CO2 as does coal.  The amount of CO2 produced by burning oil lies between those of coal and gas.
<P>If the current global levels of burning of fossil fuels are too high for the health of our planet, it is easy to see that increased levels are even more dangerous.<P><B>Energy Planning</B><P>We must accept the fact that all energy sources have some impact upon life, health and the environment.  We must also face the reality that all sources will be needed and that the real question before us will not be the inclusion or exclusion of some energy options but rather their optimal mix, national and internationally.
<P>Traditionally, energy planning took only the economic aspect into consideration.  The cheapest energy was the best energy.  After the oil embargo a number of countries began to consider energy independence as a significant factor.  And today it is evident that we must take into account, not only the costs of generating and distributing energy, but also the costs in terms of life, health and environmental damage.   A gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere through a continuous increase in the carbon dioxide level caused by an accelerated use of fossil fuels may be a price we don't want our grandchildren to pay.
<P>It is important to recognize that the discussion of the merits and demerits of an energy option become meaningful only when this option is compared with its alternatives.
<P>Currently, about 63% of the world's electricity is generated by the burning of coal, oil and gas.  The technology is not very complicated.  From the point of view of economic cost, generation by coal is about equal with nuclear in many places.  From the viewpoint of safety, all three fossil fuels are accepted by the public, although the number of casualties is high in accidents related to coal mining, offshore drilling and gas transportation.  Oil is a much more expensive fuel for electricity production than coal.  The price of gas used to be linked to that of oil, but we have seen recently how it has instead been linked to the price of coal, at least for electricity generation.  This makes gas attractive.                         
<P>There has been a decided trend in the past few years to make greater use of natural gas in producing electricity.  This has less consequences in the form of acid rain and dying forests.  As the burning of gas results in half as much CO2 as does coal per energy unit, there is a net advantage in replacing coal by gas in terms of the greenhouse effect.  Where gas is burned for additional energy generation, there will, of course, be additional CO2 Ä though less than if coal had been used to generate that additional electricity.
<P>Looked at from the viewpoint of the world's resources, one might regret the burning of finite oil and gas resources, which could have more valuable uses.  Coal is more plentiful Ä but also more problematic from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions.  Other pollutants from coal Ä SO2 and NOx Ä can be removed Ä at a cost.  In the IAEA we are even promoting a method of using electron beams on the flue gases of coal plants to transform the gases into fertilizer!<P><B>Conservation</B><P>If you ask green movements about the energy-environment dilemma you are likely to get the answer that it can be solved by conservation and a greater use of renewable energy sources.  The concept of conservation covers both a more discriminating and more efficient use of energy.  The difference between the two ways of saving energy is easily seen when we consider that we can save petrol by driving less or by using a more fuel efficient engine.  The latter form of saving is easily accepted Ä though it may be expensive if it requires a new car ...  To limit reliance on energy Ä to drive less Ä is more difficult.  It is very difficult to calculate how much energy we can save.  The quantities are significant, but no serious energy experts believe that one can achieve more than a partial off setting of the increasing demand for energy.  Certainly current energy plans in the world do not point to a reduced use of fossil fuels.
<P><B>Renewable Sources of Energy</B><P>	The most important renewable and non CO2 producing source of electricity is hydro power.  At present, it generates some 20% of the world's electricity.  In the industrialized world, most hydro potential has already been exploited, but in some developing countries, notably Africa, significant resources remain and will undoubtedly be used, where it is economic and where the environmental consequences are not too severe.  The Assuan dam is an example of a huge electricity producing hydro power installation which has also had very severe environmental consequences.  In China, a giant hydro-electric project on the Yangtse river will now be launched.  It is to yield enormous quantities of electricity, but will also, apparently, require the resettlement of large numbers of people.
<P>There is much talk about the use of biomass in the industrialized countries.  Rapidly growing trees, harvesting, burning and the planting of new
trees would be a fuel cycle without any net contribution of CO2.  However, the economics of this source have not yet been established and so far it
has not really been relied upon on a large scale anywhere.  In many developing countries, biomass in the form of non commercial fuel wood and
animal dung is a dominant fuel.  With growing population, the reliance on this source has become much too heavy in many places, with deforestation
and desertification as a result.  In such areas, a more efficient use of fire wood, replantation and greater use of other fuels is desirable.  As far as we
can see today, a greater global reliance on biomass is not likely to become a very significant method of substituting for fossil fuels.
<P>Solar power is making a substantial contribution in isolated locations and on a small scale and heating of water by solar energy is practical
and economic in many places Ä not least in this part of the world.  However, solar cells for large scale economic electricity production are still deemed
to be far away.
<P>Windmills have a long tradition, but despite considerable experimentation and promotion, wind power has not become economic, nor does it
yield the large quantities of energy we need.  More about that in a moment.
<P>Taken together solar power, wind power, biomass and other commercial, new and  renewable sources yield today less than 0.5% of the
world's energy.  Most of it is actually geothermal Ä e.g. in the United States, Iceland, Italy and New Zealand.
<P>What I said a moment ago, that the realistic energy choice boils down to one between fossil fuels and nuclear power, is clearly demonstrated
by experience in Europe.  Let me give you some examples.  Denmark, that rejects nuclear power, is often cited as a country with an ambitious wind
power programme, but not more than 2% of Danish electricity originates in wind power, while the capacity of coal generated power stations has been
allowed to expand fast and covers some 95% of the Danish electricity generation.  In Belgium, industry's request to build another nuclear plant a few
years ago was rejected by the government.  The alternative proved to be gas.  And gas on a large scale would also have been the replacement for
nuclear in my own country, Sweden, if a phasing out had started in the middle of the nineties as originally intended.  For Finland the choice at the
present moment seems to be nuclear or coal.
<P>How does nuclear power compare with other sources of electricity from the four key standpoints of environment, economy, security and
safety?<BR>
<B>Environment and Nuclear Power</B>
<P>Nuclear power - which provides about 17% of the world's electricity - has the great advantage of giving rise to no harmful emissions in normal
operation.  This means that the use of nuclear power helps us to avoid CO2 and NOx and SO2 emissions.  According to our calculation, if the
electricity currently generated by nuclear power plants worldwide were produced instead by burning coal, a further 8 percent or 1.6 billion tonnes of
carbon dioxide would be added to the world's atmosphere.
<P>The Japanese Government has announced two new programmes on energy policy Ä one is "Targets for Supply of Alternative Energy Sources
to Oil" and the other is an "Action Programme to Arrest Global Warming."  The Japanese plans include targets for use of alternative energy sources
for oil, including nuclear power.  According to those targets, the supply of nuclear power is to increase 2.5 times between 1989 and 2010 with a target
of 30.8% of electricity coming from nuclear power in 2010.  The Action Programme to reduce gases which cause the greenhouse effect aims at
stabilizing Japan's carbon dioxide emissions per capita after 2000 at the levels which prevailed in 1990 Ä on condition that the industrialized countries
of the world make joint efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  It is difficult to see how such aims can be achieved without increasing reliance on
nuclear power.
<P>I am not suggesting that increased use of nuclear power alone can stabilize CO2 emissions in Japan as in other industrial countries, but I do
maintain that it must be part of the solution.
<P>In terms of economics, as I said a moment ago, there is today not much difference between nuclear power and coal generated electricity.
Assumptions regarding discount rates, the number of years of use and the upfront investment for construction have a heavy influence on cost
calculations.  In the United States and the United Kingdom the high costs calculated for nuclear power is one main reason for the absence of new
nuclear power projects.  However, in other countries privately owned utilities wish to build more nuclear power plants and it may be assumed that they
expect to make a profit.  In Asia, countries pushing ahead with nuclear include Japan, the Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan (China).  A special
economic problem with nuclear power is that the upfront investment costs are very heavy.  This is undoubtedly a drawback for developing countries.
The lower fuel costs, which make for economy, are only enjoyed later.
<P>In the long term, I think nuclear power will present significant economic advantages.  The potential for reducing the production costs of nuclear
power is still large, for instance through standardization of construction and serial fabrication of main components.  On the other hand, the coal burning
techniques are probably reaching the limit of industrial improvements, and modifications imposed for environmental reasons may add to the production
costs.  To take an example, clean air legislation in the United States imposed such stringent filtering conditions on old high sulphur coal plants, that a
number of them will be forced to close.<P>
<B>Security</B>
<P>There are several kinds of security to discuss in relation to energy.  One is security of supply.  Perhaps coal offers the greatest security of
supply, there being many different suppliers and an ample supply available.  To be at the end of a gas pipeline offers much greater supply risks.  As to
oil, a nervous world was reminded during the Gulf crisis that both price and availability depend much on the political conditions in a rather small
number of supplier countries.
<P>The risk of supply that exists for nuclear power hardly relates to uranium which is in ample supply for many different regions and countries,
like Australia, Canada, Namibia, Niger, China, CIS.  The number of States able to supply enrichment services was for a long time very limited.  This is
less true today.  The energy density of uranium is also such that a utility can store fuel for several years' use and, thereby, acquire very substantial
energy independence   even without an indigenous supply of uranium and enrichment services.  A 1000 MW(e) nuclear plant consumes about 80Kg of
uranium per day.  A coal fired plant of the same capacity uses about 7000 tons of coal per day   i.e. about five train loads.  Thus where the electricity
generating plants cannot be located at the coal fields, the use of coal for electricity generation requires a well functioning and vast transport network.
To take an example, the rail-roads of China are burdened by coal transports.
<P>We can also speak of security of operation, in the sense of reliability.  Available statistics do not point to more frequent or longer stoppages in
nuclear plants than in fossil fuelled plants, though one might get such an impression from news reports that are inclined to report all nuclear stoppages
and ignore those in coal  or oil fired plants.
<P>Another security aspect relates to physical protection of plants.  One cannot completely rule out the risk that terrorists could try to occupy a
nuclear plant, although fortunately it has not happened so far.  If they were not experts the chances are that their actions would only achieve automatic
shut downs.  It must be recognized, however, that modern society is vulnerable to many other risks from terrorists.  None can be ignored.
<P>Reference is sometimes made to the risk that nuclear power plants present in time of war.  It cannot be ignored or denied, but if we think of
war, it seems more justified to look first at the risk of tens of thousands of nuclear warheads that still remain in the world.  In the region of the Persian
Gulf nuclear reactors have been bombed three times.  Twice there was no nuclear fuel present:  when Israel bombed a big research reactor in Iraq in
1981 and when Iraq fired rockets at Iranian power reactors under construction during the Iraq Iran war.  Only the American action during the recent
UN authorized operation against Iraq involved the bombing of two small research reactors containing nuclear fuel.  Fortunately, as IAEA inspection
has found, the fuel was not damaged and no radiation hazard arose.
<P>The bombing of coal mines is not likely to pose a great war hazard, but as we all know the burning of oil wells can cause grave damage, and
attacks on gas cisterns or big hydro dams may have devastating consequences.
<P>It is often alleged that nuclear power increases the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons to other countries.  As is well known, President
Kennedy surmised in the 1960s about a world with over twenty nuclear weapon States.  This fear has simply not materialized.  However, the risk of
proliferation cannot be ignored   least of all these days.
<P>It cannot be excluded that a State could try to make use of a nuclear power programme to hide a weapons programme.  However, not even
the dismantling of all peaceful nuclear power in the world would be a guarantee against development of a nuclear weapon by a State which was
determined to have one.  The nuclear genie has been out of the bottle for a long while.  The risk that some country develops a nuclear weapon
capacity exists regardless of whether it has civilian nuclear power.  All the five recognized nuclear weapon States developed weapons first   nuclear
power second.  And Israel, which many believe to have developed nuclear weapons, does not have any nuclear power.  Nor was Iraq building any
nuclear power plants.
<P>The non proliferation regime, verified by IAEA safeguards, is not a police power that can stop nuclear activities in a State.  But States which
pledge themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons and promise to hold all their nuclear material, present or future, available for inspection, open
themselves for considerable control.  A misuse of the verified programmes could not be physically stopped by inspectors but it would be reported.  It is
not only the verification of nuclear non proliferation but the verification of all arms control that will be limited to observation and reporting.
<P>States allow themselves to be inspected by international inspectors, because they want to demonstrate to neighbours and to the world at large
that they are using nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.  Inspection is not an encroachment on sovereignty.  It is rather a service requested by
and rendered to the inspected State.  To be credible and have the confidence-building effect that is desired by the inspected State, the inspection
must be sufficiently thorough and frequent.
<P>What is the risk that international inspectors will not discover violations of nuclear non proliferation pledges?  It is simply not feasible to
organize a control system under which inspectors systematically comb through every nook and corner, every cave and cellar of whole countries.  The
present system is based upon States declaring nuclear material that they import, produce and possess and it is supplemented by declarations of other
States exporting nuclear material.  This system does not create a guarantee against a State secretly mining its own uranium and itself secretly
enriching it.  In today's world with many satellites and much intelligence around, evidence is likely to become available of such clandestine
programmes.  Uranium mining is mostly visible and enrichment and reprocessing plants are also likely to be seen from above.  Such observations, if
made known to the IAEA, may trigger proposals for special inspections of possibly non declared nuclear material.  The risk of non-detection is not
great but the case of Iraq shows that it is not zero.  With greater alertness and more effective export controls it should be possible to make it minimal.
Let us also note that a universal commitment to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament coupled with effective verification will reduce the security
interest that any State may feel for acquiring a nuclear weapons capacity.  A well verified nuclear-weapon-free zone for the Middle East as a part of a
peace settlement is thus an important aim to pursue.
<P>Let me sum up:  the risk of proliferation would not go away even by a total elimination of all civilian nuclear power in the world.  It has to be
tackled by a combination of political means, export controls and inspection.<P>
<B>Safety</B>
<P>My last points relate to the safe operation of nuclear power plants and the safe disposal of nuclear wastes.
<P>A Symposium in Finland last May on Electricity and Environment which compared risks of different energy sources through the whole cycle,
from mining to waste disposal, found that virtually all sources have some degree of risk.  Nuclear and renewables were found to be in the low end of
the risk spectrum, whilst coal and oil were found on the high.  This conclusion is certainly encouraging for nuclear power and squares with our
experience that Chernobyl is the only large radiation releasing accident in a civilian nuclear power plant despite the experience of some 6000
operation years of civilian reactors.  However, we face a special problem in that the public, which seems to tolerate the risk that people may drown in
hydro dam catastrophes, die in explosions in coal mines, on oil platforms or at gas cisterns and pipes, may be less tolerant about the risk that
anyone's health is affected by the exposure to radiation   whether in the short term or the long term.
<P>We can only respond to this public attitude in two ways.  First, by factual information about the risks of nuclear power use and waste disposal
and by comparing these risks with those that will be taken if fossil fuels are the alternative.  Second, by strengthening the safety of nuclear power so
that no accidents occur in which significant radiation is released.  This, of course, is what is being done   even without any public concern.  Safety is
never static   whether in automobiles, aeroplanes or nuclear power plants.  Nuclear power is safer today in most countries than it was before the
Chernobyl accident and it will be safer tomorrow.  Some technical modifications have been made on many existing plants and the next generation of
plants which will be ready for ordering within a few years will be improved compared to the present generation.
<P>Responsibility for nuclear power safety rests with national authorities.  The IAEA is no supranational regulatory body with powers to order a
State to modify plants or to close them.  Yet, we know that an accident anywhere has a heavy psychological fall out everywhere.  It is against this
background that much interest is now focussed on how the international community can better influence nuclear power safety in individual countries.
<P>The IAEA does not have a right to inspect the safety of any nuclear power reactor as it has a right, in most non nuclear weapon States, to
inspect and verify that the reactors are not used for weapons production.  The Agency does, however, offer Member States safety reviews of various
kinds through international expertise.  These services are increasingly used and the expert advice offered is normally accepted and acted upon.  But
we  cannot order action.  If serious deficiencies are found, we must tell the responsible government about it and, if need be, seek to organize
assistance.<P>
<B>Nuclear Waste</B>
<P>Let me conclude by some comments on nuclear waste.  It is a fact that the public is concerned about this issue in many countries.  It is also a
fact that nuclear experts are convinced that there are no scientific or technological breakthroughs needed for a waste disposal that is safe even for
very, very long time periods.  The technological solutions favoured all around the world are the same, namely to leave spent nuclear fuel at surface
level to cool and lose in radioactivity for some 30 60 years and thereafter to isolate it from the biosphere by several barriers and place it in deep stable
geological formations.
<P>It is puzzling that the confidence of the experts is not conveyed to the general public.  Much more information is evidently needed.  My own
country, Sweden, may be an exception.  A Gallup poll not long ago indicated that a majority of people in Sweden would accept a high level nuclear
waste disposal site in their own community, if that community were judged to be the most suitable location.
<P>The point is often made that we are dealing with waste that remains hazardous for many thousands of years.  This is true, but the quantities
are so limited that they can be isolated.  This is not the case with the larger quantities of toxic waste that result from the burning of coal.  By 1987 the
high level nuclear waste arising annually from all the world's nuclear power stations amounted to about 6000 tons in the form of spent fuel.  If the
amount of electricity that these nuclear plants generated had instead come from electricity generating coal plants, alone the toxic heavy metals
released    mercury, arsenic, vanadium, etc.   would have amounted to some 100 000 tonnes.  These toxic wastes do not have a half life like
radioactive wastes.  They remain toxic forever and they remain at the surface of the earth.
<P>I submit to you that the world would look very different if other industries adopted concepts for their waste disposal that are as safe as the
civilian nuclear industries have   rightly   been obliged to work out.  It is not the nuclear waste of the civilian nuclear industry that causes acid rains,
dead forests and lakes, smog and corrosion in our cities and a possible greenhouse effect.  The wastes of uranium are put back in the crust of the
earth from where the uranium came.  The coal, oil and gas is also fetched from the crust of the earth, but as the final disposal site for their wastes we
historically have choosen the atmosphere and the surface of the earth.  The quantities are so great that we can hardly do otherwise.  But it is puzzling
that this overwhelming problem is tolerated, while the limited problem of civilian nuclear power waste disposal appears unbearable to many.
<P>Perhaps the increasing awareness of the greenhouse effect will convince the public that the risks connected with an expanding use of nuclear
power, although not zero, are more tolerable than the risks of an excessive use of fossil fuels.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Inspections in Iraq to the US House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Washington, D.C., USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>23 October 1991</H4>
<P><HR>I want to thank the members of this committee for asking me to appear here today. I do not intend to make a long presentation, as I feel I can be of most help to you by responding to questions.
<P>The International Atomic Energy Agency is an international organization, like the World Health Organization or the World Meteorological Organization. It has nearly 120 Member States, a budget of around 200 million dollars per year and about 2000 staff, most of them at our headquarters in Vienna. A Board of Governors consisting of 35 Member States is the policy making organ apart from the General Conference that meets once a year. Among the professional staff US citizens are the largest group. I am a Swedish citizen and I have been Director General for almost ten years now.
<P>Established as part of the Atoms for Peace in the late fifties, the IAEA was given the tasks of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to operate safeguards verification that the uses were only peaceful. A~ency projects would only be established subject to safeguards.
 With the conclusion of the Tlatelolco Treaty making Latin America a nuclear weapon free zone and the Non Proliferation Treaty, the Agency received a drastically increased job, namely to verify that all present and future nuclear material in States adhering to these Treaties remained in exclusively peaceful uses. There are now some 140 parties to the NPT.
<P>As a result of the Gulf War and Iraq's cease fire agreement with the United Nations, the Agency was given specific tasks by the Security Council. I must say we have learned a number of lessons in Iraq as we carry out this work.
<P>The deep secrecy in which Iraq conducted a massive nuclear weapons development and production programme   the extent of which we are still trying to determine   dramatically demonstrates the Agency's need for intelligence information in the future.
<P>In Resolution 687, which gave the IAEA unique rights, we were asked:
<P>To carry out immediate on site inspections to determine Iraq's nuclear capability;
<P>To develop a plan for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of nuclear related items which Iraq was not permitted to retain; and
<P>To develop a plan for future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations in the nuclear area under the Security Council's resolutions.These tasks have proven to be much larger, more complex and considerably more dramatic than we first expected, even though the IAEA has decades of on site inspections expertise, as well as state of the art equipment and laboratories in our Agency or at our command.
<P>The IAEA has conducted seven inspections in Iraq. They clearly show that Iraq blatantly violated its sworn pledges to not seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. This information was not disclosed by Iraq as it agreed to do under the terms of the cease fire, but was offered grudgingly when offered at all, only after inspectors had uncovered the existence of previously undeclared activities. And let me say that we are not at all confident that everything has been revealed, even now.
<P>As I noted earlier, our inspectors' discoveries have dramatically demonstrated our crucial need for information. It was intelligence information   high tech and human intelligence   that led to our teams uncovering the extent of Iraq's programme. The Agency's safeguards system is such that it cannot comb through every inch of a State, blindly searching for nuclear materials and installations. If the State fails to declare nuclear installations, as Iraq did, then we must learn through other sources where to look. The nuclear inspection teams that the IAEA and the Special Commission are sending to Iraq this year are provided with such information by Member States. This comes through the Special Commission which designates suspect sites for inspection.
<P>This convinces me that the ability of our inspectors to uncover possible undeclared nuclear material and installations would increase significantly if
the IAEA were routinely provided with relevant information available to Member<BR>~t,~t,~	h	have cei ~ about Irc<BR>
 I am now preparing to set up a small unit within my office to analyse information for any clues as to non declared material. It is intended to have two analysts plus two clerical staff for this purpose. They will examine inhouse information   mainly for the Safeguards Department. They should also follow media and periodicals for clues and information. And they should be ready to receive information from Member States, e.g. about any exports for sensitive equipment. They should also be ready to analyse information that Members may have from satellites and intelligence. They do not engage in intelligence collection   but in analysis and evaluation.
<P>There does not seem to be much point in laying down how Member States should convey information to the unit. It might be practical if a channel were established at the State's U~ Mission in Vienna. It might be practical further if there were routine, say quarterly reports and alarm reports, if anything urgent were to be transmitted.
<P>Any Member State could volunteer information to the unit and the unit would have to assess the value, and follow up. It would have to assess whether the information was credible.
<P>The unit would have to advise the Director General and the Deputy Director General for Safeguards whether explanations should be asked of a country because of specific information. And, if explanations were not deemed satisfactory, a special inspection should be requested.
<P>Tight rules regarding confidentiality would govern the work. (This applies already to the Safeguards Department). Selection of the personnel would evidently be such that Member States would be ready to work with them.
 In closing, let me say that the International Atomic Energy Agency ls an instrument of those who belong to it. The Agency's resources   both personnel and funds   have been severely strained by the ever increasing responsibilities being placed upon it. We welcome this acknowledgement of our capability, but feel it is past time to face the undeniable fact that additional work and responsibilities must entail additional funding. The success or failure of the International Atomic Energy Agency depends on its Members' will and commitment to the principles for which the IAEA stands.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Power in Perspective Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Power in Perspective </H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Elsinore, Denmark</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>31 August 1992</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
In a speech to the Rio Conference on "Environment and Development" a few months ago, I observed that nuclear power, which gives rise to practically no emissions, could be of significant help in providing electricity economically without releasing CO2 to the atmosphere and thereby adding to the risk of global warming.  Only one other speaker appears to have mentioned nuclear power in this context, and he warned against any reliance on this "discredited technology".  Some will probably see this paucity of pronouncements as evidence that nuclear power is becoming obsolescent.  They may see confirmation of their view in the fact that there is relatively little nuclear power plant construction practically everywhere except in the Far East and India.
<P>I submit, however, that conclusions about the demise of nuclear power are premature.  The vast majority of today's governments either favour the use of nuclear power or insist on keeping the option open.  A very small number Ä less than half a dozen Ä are declared opponents of nuclear power.  Further, there is an increasing awareness among governments that nuclear power can help resolve the dilemma of the need for more energy, notably electricity, and the need to restrain carbon dioxide emissions.  Both the Paris and the Houston summit meetings of seven industrialized States expressly pointed to nuclear power as a means of restraining greenhouse gas emissions.  Indeed, calculations show that if today's 415 or so nuclear power plants were closed and that if the electricity generated by them were instead generated by coal-fired plants, global carbon dioxide emissions would increase by some 7%.  A drastic expansion of nuclear power in the world would be a very significant factor, even though it alone would not eliminate the risk of global warming.  Indeed, apart from vigorous efforts to conserve energy, increased reliance on nuclear power is one of the few significant measures we can take that could restrain CO2 emissions in the next few decades.
<P>	Why then did the Rio Conference not talk about nuclear power?  The answers are simple.  The Conference adopted its conclusions by consensus and there is no consensus among governments about the use of nuclear power.  Oil-producing States Ä although not opposed to nuclear power Ä are averse to stressing the CO2 problems of fossil fuels and explicitly endorsing the merits of nuclear power.
<P>To assess the future role of nuclear power, it is not sufficient only to examine the declared current positions of governments.  It is necessary to look at nuclear power from a number of perspectives.
<P>The cost of energy Ä which alone used to be the decisive factor Ä certainly still remains very important, but the environmental perspective, the safety perspective, the military/security perspective and, related to that, the energy independence perspective are also of great importance today.
<P>I shall discuss the nuclear option from these various perspectives, but I shall begin with the premise for all these questions:  the need for more energy.
<P>No one denies that life styles could be developed in many industrialized States which used less neon light, fewer television sets and electric tooth brushes, or whatever consumes energy.  While such things may be obvious, the fact remains that large groups of people even in highly developed States are looking, not unreasonably, for a less burdensome existence through laundry machines, dish washers, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators Ä all demanding more electricity.  Especially the lives of women and their emancipation into the labour market are facilitated by all these electricity-consuming conveniences.  Moreover, energy and electricity consumption varies a great deal between different industrialized countries.  There is every reason to expect that those with a relatively low level will seek to raise it.
<P>Even more obvious is that developing countries will seek to use more energy.  The average North American uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent per year;  the average Chinese uses 590 kg, and the average Indian makes do with 280 kg of oil equivalent per year.  Developing countries, with three fourths of the world's population, use less than one third of the primary energy.  If these countries are to develop, they will certainly need more energy.  Population growth will only increase this demand.  The World Energy Council has estimated that global energy consumption can be expected to increase by 50-75% by the year 2020.  These figures assume vigorous efforts to conserve energy.
<P>There can be little doubt that the long-term trend is for greater use of energy, in particular electricity, which is a convenient, flexible form Ä as useful to large industries as to small households, as important in driving pumps for irrigation in developing countries as in driving public transport.  If we were to reduce oil-based transport by cars, trucks, buses and airplanes this would, of course require a switch to electric trains, tubes, trolley-buses and Ä eventually Ä electric cars.
<P>The prospect of greater future need for energy, especially electricity, is not inconsistent with the experience of many industrialized countries, which overestimated growth in their energy demand and invested accordingly, and which still have a relatively comfortable energy and electricity balance.  As this comfortable situation gradually disappears, governments and industry will be obliged to plan for additional energy/electricity supply and decide whether to maintain or modify their current energy mix.  Is the number of coal-fuelled plants to stagnate or fall, and the number of gas-fuelled plants and nuclear plants to grow?  Or are decommissioned nuclear plants to be replaced by coal- or gas-fuelled ones?  It is understandable at a time when the public is averse to any new power scheme Ä be it fossil- or uranium-fuelled, or hydropowered Ä that there may be an inclination to postpone the choice as long as possible.  Although more can be squeezed out of existing investments through better planning of demand, connection of grids and prolongation of the life of existing plants, the days when decisions have to be made will come.
<P>Power-starved developing countries, a few industrialized Western States Ä like Finland Ä and the economically booming Far East can no longer put off these decisions.
<P>The question of cost remains crucial, but is not the only factor.  Oil is not expected to be economically attractive as a fuel for electricity generation.  In contrast, gas is now being used increasingly, and its attraction seems to lie in its current cost advantage over oil and its environmental advantage over coal.  However, a question mark hangs over its future costs.  Where gas has to be imported, dependence on one supplier may also appear undesirable.  Coal remains a competitive fuel for electricity generation and supplies are ample.  For countries like China and Australia, with abundant coal supplies of their own, this option has evident economic attractions.  As concern grows about damaging emissions from the combustion of coal, there are increasing calls for technical systems to prevent pollution.  This will raise the cost of the coal option Ä as the Danish experience shows.  Even so, concern will remain about the environmental impact of CO2 emissions, for which no economically viable prevention system is likely to emerge.
<P>Nuclear power will remain costly in the construction phase and this characteristic and the fact that it is technologically very demanding will make it less attractive to capital-weak developing countries.  The world's ample uranium resources and their geographical spread are likely to make this fuel attractively priced and easily available, even with a much larger number of nuclear power plants around.  As nuclear power is a relatively young technology, moreover, it may be expected that many cost-saving devices and designs are yet to come which will reduce the cost of construction and more than offset the costs incurred for additional safety devices.  It can also be assumed that the regulatory process Ä which in some cases has led to prolonged and costly construction times Ä will be streamlined.  In the calculation of the cost of nuclear-generated electricity, it is already normal practice to include the costs of responsible waste disposal and decommissioning.  This is not Ä as is the case with coal Ä a sum to be added.
<P>In conclusion, therefore, it can be said that some important question marks hang over the future costs of gas- and coal-fuelled electricity generation, while the outlook for the cost of nuclear-generated electricity may well be positive.  In hydropower, the costs clearly depend on the location.  Hydro will remain an attractive source wherever its costs or environmental consequences are not exorbitant.  As for renewable sources of energy, considerable and interesting efforts are being made, not least regarding wind power here in Denmark.  These efforts, too, need to be viewed in perspective.  About 2% of Denmark's electricity is wind-generated.  Practically all the rest is coal-generated.  In the whole world, less than 0.5% of electricity is generated by renewable sources Ä other than hydropower.  Most of it, in fact, is geothermal.  Although these renewable sources may well become more important than they are today, they have a variety of limitations and are not expected to become competitive in the next few decades, except in particular locations and situations.  Even in a longer perspective, they are not expected to provide more than 3 to 5% of the world's energy (International Energy Agency, World Energy Council).
<P>I have already referred to the increasingly important environmental perspective.  Fortunately, techniques are available Ä at a cost Ä to avoid SO2 and NOx pollution from coal-fuelled power plants, and I understand that these techniques are increasingly being used in Denmark.  Great concern nevertheless remains as regards all fossil and other organic fuels because of the carbon dioxide they release during combustion.  Per energy unit, coal releases twice as much as gas, and oil lies somewhere between these values.  Although questions remain in the calculation of the greenhouse effect, the great majority of scientists dealing with this topic believe that a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases is needed.
<P>To work out an acceptable international response to this need is a formidable political task.  Indeed, the matter is already controversial.  It did not prove possible to attain agreement at the Rio Conference on the proposed target of a return to the 1990 CO2 emission levels by 2005, as was proposed by many governments, including the European Community.  Even such a target, however, is regarded as wholly insufficient by experts.  This subject may become a major international problem already during the present decade.  Developing countries may quite reasonably say that the excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, are mainly the doings of the industrialized countries and that it is the responsibility of those countries to use their resources to pull the world out of the mess into which they have dragged it.  Developing countries might suggest an international allocation of licenses for greenhouse gas emissions on the basis of population figures, and offer protection of forests provided resources and assistance are given.  Agreement may be elusive.
<P>What we can see already today is that pressure will build up in the industrialized countries for the restraint and reduction of emissions, particularly of CO2.  Although power plants are only a part of this problem and a part that does not change overnight, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that concern over global warming Ä apart from stimulating energy efficiency and renewable energy development Ä will favour greater reliance on CO2-free nuclear power and hydropower.  And it will work against fossil fuels.
<P>Of course, the public's major concerns about nuclear power also relate to the environment:  the concern that waste disposal and power plant accidents will lead to radioactive contamination.  
<P>Before I address these two important issues, let me make a comment on contamination due to the military use of nuclear power.  To the public, it evidently makes no difference if the sea or the land is contaminated through military or civilian activities.  However, practically everywhere the standards of safety applied in the military sphere are not open to public scrutiny and control.  It is evident that severe radioactive contamination has occurred in several places, especially in the former Soviet Union and in the United States, as a result of military activities.  More and more information is becoming available and it is clear that the clean-up bill will be large.  The problems are not strictly limited to the territories of nuclear-weapon States.  There are several known cases of sunken nuclear submarines, and a Russian-Norwegian investigation of Russian dumping of radioactive equipment in the Kara Sea Ä with participation from the IAEA Ä is now underway.
<P>The handling of waste from civilian nuclear activities is subject to national regulations.  In many developing countries, the regulation and control of radioactive waste from, say, medical activities are unsatisfactory and it is a priority activity for the IAEA technical assistance programme to help remedy these shortcomings.  The handling of high level radioactive waste from nuclear power activities raises a different type of problem.  The responsibility remains a national one but it is understandable that waste which will remain radioactive for many thousands of years will interest people, regardless of frontiers.  It is legitimate for the international community to be concerned about hazardous material that is put back in the crust of the earth.  This concern has not yet found any response through internationally agreed and binding standards for waste disposal or registers of disposal installations or obligatory reporting.  What guidelines are being developed internationally are no more than recommendations.  In addition, there are international reviews on a voluntary basis.  We are familiar with the term "an international nuclear safety regime", relating to the operation of nuclear power plants.  In my view, such a regime should extend to cover waste disposal also.
<P>There are grounds for optimism about our ability to dispose of high level waste in a safe manner.  The nervousness of the public in this regard is not shared by scientists and experts, who are fully confident about the techniques already at our disposal.  It is a bit paradoxical that the public opinion Ä which is so concerned about nuclear waste disposal Ä is often the very factor that prevents such disposal by opposing the use of any site that is found suitable.
<P>To be a bit provocative, one might say that high level waste is the greatest asset of the nuclear power industry Ä because it is so small in volume that it can be isolated and disposed of in its entirety.  There are in principle two methods of handling hazardous waste:  one is to dilute it until it becomes harmless, the other is to concentrate it and isolate it from the biosphere.  The wastes from fossil fuels have become so voluminous that isolation is impossible in practice.  The surface of the earth and the atmosphere are the final disposal sites, and we are now realizing that the volumes we emit are too large for the dilution method.  We must remove SO2 and NOx.  CO2 remains a big problem.  Some comparative data on volumes are illuminating.  By 1991 the spent fuel arising annually from all the world's nuclear power stations amounted to about 10,000 tonnes.  If the electricity that those plants generated had instead come from coal-fired plants, the residual toxic heavy metals alone found in the ashes after the burning of the coal Ä mercury, arsenic, vanadium, etc. Ä would have been in the range of 100,000 tonnes.  They don't have a half-life like radioactive wastes.  They remain toxic forever, and they remain on the surface of the earth.
<P>The timescale of nuclear waste disposal is long, but the technique is manageable.  Although the costs are high, they form a very small part of the cost of nuclear electricity, and in many countries they are included in the price for electricity, and are hardly noticed by the consumer.  The major problem today appears rather to be one of communication with the public and creation of confidence.  As more disposal installations are built and are seen to function well, this confidence should grow.  The Swedish and Finnish pioneering installations are a welcome and important step in this direction.
<P>I would now like to consider nuclear power from the safety perspective.  It is unquestionably here that the major objections exist in public opinion in many countries.  Lethal, invisible radiation is something scary and the explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the catastrophe at Chernobyl are concrete evidence of the effects of uncontrolled radiation.  Many people are so horrified by any risk of uncontrolled radiation that they wish to stop nuclear power altogether.
<P>It does not seem to help much to compare the risks of operating nuclear power plants with the risks we run in making use of other activities that raise our standard of living.  The World Health Organization has estimated that worldwide the use of pesticides cause the loss of some 15,000 human lives and more than a million cases of poisoning each year!  We must assume that these casualties are tolerated by the public because of the vital importance of pesticides for agriculture today.  The same attitude is not taken towards nuclear power.  A symposium in Helsinki in May 1991 on Electricity and the Environment, which compared the risks of different energy sources through the whole cycle from mining to waste disposal, found nuclear and renewables in normal operation to be at the low end of the risk spectrum, while coal and oil were found to be at the high end.  The risk of large accidents was found to be greatest with hydropower, where many dam failures have taken a heavy toll of lives.  These conclusions square with our daily experience of nuclear power and with the fact that Chernobyl is the only large radiation-releasing accident in a civilian nuclear power plant despite the experience of some 6000 years of civilian reactor operation.
<P>We must be aware, however, that the public, which seems to tolerate the risk that people may drown in hydro dam catastrophes, die in explosions in coal mines, or on oil platforms, or at gas cisterns and pipes, is less tolerant about the risk of anyone's health being affected by exposure to radiation Ä whether in the short or the long term.
<P>We can only respond to public attitudes in two ways.  First, by providing factual information about the risks of nuclear power use and waste disposal, and by comparing these risks with those of fossil fuels if these are the alternative.  Secondly, by strengthening the safety of nuclear power so that no accidents occur in which significant amounts of radiation are released.  This, of course, is what is being done Ä even without any public concern.  Safety is never static Ä whether in automobiles, airplanes or nuclear power plants.  Nuclear power is safer today in most countries than it was before the Chernobyl accident and it will be still safer tomorrow.  During a visit I made to North Korea last May, I was told that after the Chernobyl accident they had made several modifications in the nuclear power plants which they are building Ä although their type of reactor is different from the Chernobyl type.
<P>Let me make some comments on what can be done and what is being done to further reduce the risk of accidents.  There is, of course, the
technical evolution which will result in future reactors which draw on past experience.  There will also be more revolutionary designs available in the
years to come.  There is also backfitting, e.g., with filtered containment venting systems in existing plants.  Especially in several of the Soviet-designed
plants, back-fitting is necessary.  I shall come back to this point in a moment, but I should like to stress first the importance of the emergence of an
international nuclear safety regime.  Responsibility for nuclear power safety Ä as for nuclear waste Ä rests with national authorities.  The IAEA is no
supranational regulatory body that has been given powers to order a State to modify plants or to close them.  Yet, as experience from the Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl accidents shows, any big accident affects the acceptability of nuclear power the world over.  Thus, for example, there is strong
interest in Japan that the rest of the world should operate nuclear power plants safely and there is an interest in the whole world that Japan should
operate its many reactors safely.  Also, countries have a special interest that their neighbours handle their nuclear power plants prudently and safely.
Increasingly, special neighbour agreements are being concluded Ä as in the Nordic countries Ä to respond to the legitimate interests of neighbours.
<P>It seems to me that we are in a stage of transition as regards international nuclear safety norms.  We have a long period behind us during
which national authorities have exchanged their experience and even codified good practices as recommendations.  Little was done, however, to
verify whether the recommendations were actually followed by every State using nuclear power.  While everybody recognizes that such verification
must be achieved chiefly through a joint international instrument, there is reluctance among national authorities even to establish rules about periodic
international visits by safety experts, and there is a valid argument that no action should be taken that might remove responsibility from national
authorities.
<P>A sharp increase in the number of international visits to nuclear installations occurred after the Chernobyl accident, when the phrase "an
accident anywhere is an accident everywhere" was coined.  Within the IAEA, the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group, a committee of very
prominent nuclear safety experts from the national sphere, was set us to help give guidance on safety standards to the nuclear community and to the
IAEA.  Furthermore, a number of international expert services Ä Operational Safety Review Teams, Radiation Protection Advisory Teams Ä were
made available to Member States, mostly at some cost to them.  In parallel, the World Association of Nuclear Operators began its work with the aim of
ensuring, through direct contacts between nuclear plant operators around the world, that all of them partake of the best experience and Ä if they do not
make the best use of it Ä are at least subject to peer pressure.
<P>All of this Ä and I have only offered a few examples Ä can be seen as measures through which international interest in respect for good
nuclear safety standards is manifested.  The question that is now increasingly being raised is whether international interest requires that some norms
in the form of recommendations be transformed into legally binding rules and that periodic visits by international safety expert teams become a
commitment.  An affirmative answer is given to the first question in the current work on a nuclear safety convention, containing basic rules that are to
be legally binding on the parties.  From what we have seen so far, the rules are of a very basic character.  But they may develop further.  The second
question has not yet been answered in the affirmative.  The present system of services against payment has the merit that visits will not be requested
as a matter of bureaucratic routine, but only if they are really felt to be useful.  A drawback is that there is no guarantee that those installations which
really need an infusion of international advice will receive visits.
<P>What is the status of this advice?  In my view it is enough for the advice to remain "advice" to national regulatory authorities, thus
strengthening their hands, but not replacing them.  Competent and impartial international expert advice is not easily ignored.
<P>How do these considerations square with current activities aimed at strengthening nuclear safety in Soviet-designed nuclear power plants?
Certainly the strong international interest, manifested inter alia at the July summit in Munich and in the establishment among many industrialized
States of mechanisms for providing assistance, shows that the world at large cannot afford for nuclear safety to have severe deficiencies anywhere.
The approach to the East could have been tidier;  more effective use might have been made of the expertise and capacities of Russia;  more use
could have been made of the IAEA Ä as was done in respect of the inquiry into the VVER 440/230 type of reactor, the oldest Soviet-designed nuclear
power plant.  It is easy to be wise after the event.  Right now, the most important thing is to intensify and improve the organization of these efforts, in
which Nordic countries are playing an important and constructive role.  In my view it would be desirable for the diagnosis of deficiencies to be made Ä
systematically Ä by truly international teams of experts in co-operation with designers and other groups in the countries which have the reactors.  It
should thereafter be for the governments and authorities of those countries to decide on the remedies they will undertake and to negotiate with
lenders, donors and suppliers on conditions.  The final phase, the verification of the adequacy of remedies undertaken, should, again, be
internationally and impartially organized.
<P>Partly for reasons of speed, the initial phase of the process of assistance and co-operation has had considerable bilateral components.
<P>It is evident that Russia and other countries in the former East Bloc will continue to rely on nuclear power.  In 1990, the nuclear share of
electricity production was 51% in Hungary, 36% in Bulgaria, 28% in Czechoslovakia, 12% in the Russian Federation, 25% in Ukraine, 45% in
Lithuania, and 10% in Kazakhstan.  Governments may shut down some of the reactors, but many will continue to operate with a gradual
implementation of high-priority safety improvements.  As these countries emerge from their Communist isolation, we should welcome them in joining
other countries to establish the international nuclear safety which both they and the rest of the world need.
<P>I should like to end by looking at another aspect of safety:  prevention of the further spread of nuclear weapons.  An argument sometimes
advanced against the use of nuclear power is that it may contribute to the spread of nuclear weapons.  We have not so far seen any country advance
from a civilian nuclear programme to a military one.  The order has always been the opposite.  Nevertheless, it is true that a capacity to enrich uranium
can be used to make low-enriched nuclear fuel as well as high-enriched uranium for bombs.  And spent fuel from a research or a power reactor may,
after reprocessing, yield weapons-grade plutonium.  For a more peaceful world, we must seek both nuclear disarmament and assurances against the
production of fissionable material for bomb use.  For both we need inspection and verification.  The major instruments for achieving these ends are
agreements on nuclear disarmament Ä of which there are now dramatically important ones Ä and agreements on non-proliferation, of which the most
important are the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
(Tlatelolco Treaty).  The IAEA is providing verification as regards the treaties against proliferation, and it could provide verification also of the peaceful
uses or storage of fissionable material which is recovered for civilian use after the dismantling of weapons.  There will be considerable quantities of
such materials, and it is important that all of it is continuously accounted for.
<P>There has been much concern in the past year about the risk of the spread of nuclear material and know-how as a result of the break-up of
the Soviet Union.  After IAEA inspections in Iraq under Security Council Resolution 687, there has also been concern about the risk of some
developing countries acquiring nuclear weapons.
<P>One cannot ignore the danger that the disappearance of tight military and police controls in the former Soviet Union increases the risk of
material Ä even weapons Ä and experts "trickling" into the hands of potential proliferators.  Media have been full of reports Ä not least about the mystic
substance "red mercury".  Such inquiries as the IAEA has been able to make through contacts with authorities in the relevant cases so far, however,
have shown no ominous events.  Many crooks from the East and elsewhere are circulating, claiming to be able to sell bomb-grade material.  On
investigation, gram or milligram quantities of plutonium are sometimes found.  Natural, depleted or low-enriched uranium in small quantities has also
been found.  From the viewpoint of radiation protection, this traffic is disquieting.  From the viewpoint of non-proliferation, it is a warning signal Ä so far,
fortunately, not more.
<P>More worrisome is the case of Iraq, a country which had committed itself, by adhering to the NPT, not to make nuclear weapons and which
was found to have built large installations for the enrichment of uranium and to have made preparations for the making of nuclear bombs Ä all secretly
and escaping detection by IAEA safeguards control as well as foreign intelligence.  Are there more such cases, we are bound to ask, and how
effective is IAEA verification?
<P>Verification by the IAEA Ä or anybody else Ä must necessarily be based in the first place upon the declarations of the country accepting
inspection.  It is not unimportant that large known and declared nuclear installations and large quantities of declared nuclear material are checked and
shown not to have been diverted.  The techniques used Ä although there are some difficulties in large bulk handling facilities Ä are well developed.
The major problems are not in this area.
<P>The lesson of Iraq is rather that more must be done to increase the risk of discovery of secret, non-declared activity.  It is not practical or
possible to send in inspectors to roam the whole territory of States, searching in every nook and cranny for secret nuclear installations.  Inspectors
must have information about where they should look.  In the case of Iraq, this information came from defectors and satellites.  In the future, the IAEA
will make use of many sources of information apart from the declarations of inspected States:  from exporters, from the media, and from Member
States.  The risk that a secret programme will go undetected will probably not be reduced to zero, but it can be much lower than it was when the Iraqi
programme successfully escaped discovery.  Should a country deny IAEA inspectors access, the Security Council is also now ready to exercise
pressure.  It may be hoped that the existence of strengthened verification and Security Council determination will deter any State so inclined from
attempting to cheat.
<P>We must not lose sight, however, of the fact that basic assurances against proliferation lie in the political field.  Disarmament among nuclear-
weapon States and détente regionally and globally are disincentives to proliferation.  Universalization of non-proliferation pledges also strengthens
reliability.  It is easier for a State to commit itself if its neighbour does.
<P>I think there are reasons to be optimistic about non-proliferation.  In the past year, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil have committed
themselves to non-proliferation and are opening up for inspection.  So is North Korea.  There remain, essentially, India, Pakistan, Israel and Algeria
which have not made legally binding international non-proliferation commitments.  The solution of these cases requires détente and tailor-made
arrangements.  The outlook is not without hope, and there is certainly the possibility that in 1995 the Non-Proliferation Treaty will be prolonged
indefinitely.
<P>Let me conclude:  Mankind has bitten into the apple of nuclear knowledge, and the experience cannot be undone.  We can only try to tame
our use of this knowledge and exploit it to our advantage.  Enormous efforts have gone into and are going into achieving this Ä not least by the Nordic
States and by the IAEA, in which the Nordic States play such an important and constructive role.  May I end by expressing the appreciation of the
IAEA for the firm support of the Nordic States and the confidence that it will continue and help the world make safe use of the atom.  In particular, I find
it natural and desirable that the Nordic States make efforts and devote economic resources to co-operation with Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic States,
and with the IAEA and the new international project to strengthen nuclear safety in these countries.<HR>

<TITLE>Energy, Economics, Environment and Nuclear Power</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Energy, Economics, Environment and Nuclear Power</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix Hong Kong Seminar on Nuclear Energy</B>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hong Kong</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>21 May 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Let me begin by saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency is pleased to organize this seminar with the assistance of the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Company.
<P><B>East Asia and nuclear energy</B>
<P>East Asia is an economically booming region of the world.  Industries are sprouting from the ground and the standard of living is rapidly rising.  All this requires energy, not least electricity, and among the sources used to generate electricity is an increasing number of nuclear power plants - in Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan (China).  Interest in nuclear power is also rising in Indonesia and in the Philippines, where a plant has been ready for several years but has not yet been brought into operation.
<P><B>Role of media</B>
<P>It is easy for media to exploit the scare and concern many people feel about nuclear matters, and to make headlines out of small matters.  This happens only too often.  But media also have the ambition of responsibly serving society by straight news and by providing balanced judgements.  For this media people need some knowledge and understanding of the functioning, possibilities and problems of nuclear power.  This seminar is organized as a contribution to this end.
<P><B>What is the IAEA?</B>
<P>In the IAEA we are sometimes asked:  are you in the pockets of the nuclear industry?  The answer is that the IAEA is in the pocket of governments - 115 of them.  It is an intergovernmental organization in the United Nations family, like the World Health Organization or the International Civil Aviation Organization.  We have some 2000 employees.  The budget - of some 200 million dollar/year - is paid by the Member Governments.  Not all these Member Governments favour the use of nuclear power - but the vast majority does.  However, whether they favour or are sceptical about nuclear power, they wish the Agency to provide on-site inspection of nuclear non-proliferation commitments, and to help strengthen safety in nuclear power operations and in the disposal of nuclear waste.  They also want the Agency to contribute factual information for the public debate.  This is what we shall try to do here.  I shall try to give you an overview.  Others will give you more thorough descriptions of various subjects.
<P><B>Burning issue for the IAEA - non-proliferation</B>
<P>The IAEA is active in some of the burning problems of our days:  inspection and neutralization of the nuclear weapons capacity of Iraq, verification of the peaceful nature of the nuclear activities in most non-nuclear-weapon countries in the world.  You may be interested to know that I have just visited the DPRK which has recently ratified an agreement with the IAEA to submit all its nuclear material for Agency inspection.  An Agency inspection team will soon go to the DPRK to inspect the declared nuclear installations and material.  I went to the DPRK to familiarize myself with the nuclear programme of the country and to have discussions at the political level.
<P><B>Let me say one further word about the case of Iraq.</B>
<P>The discovery of the clandestine development of nuclear weapons in Iraq, a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, must lead to greater vigilance, but it should not cause us to ignore the fact that the international community has been rather successful in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  Instead of the dozens of nuclear weapons States, which President Kennedy feared would emerge, there are still only five declared ones, plus a few which are thought to be capable of assembling weapons in a short time, if they don't have them now. These have reduced in number, as have the number of nuclear weapons stockpiled in the US and the former USSR.  Over the past year, Argentina and Brazil have bound themselves to non-proliferation and are opening up all their nuclear installations for IAEA inspection.  South Africa, having adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is doing the same.  The DPRK has now ratified an agreement with the IAEA providing for comprehensive safeguards verification.  With China and France joining the Non-Proliferation Treaty, all declared nuclear-weapon States are now parties to that Treaty.  All this is positive and we hope that the States of the former Soviet Union will, likewise, join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States.  Russia, of course, will remain a nuclear-weapon State.
<P>Another burning issue for the IAEA:  CO2 emissions and global warming<BR>
	The Agency is also engaged in examining the relations between energy use and the effect of global warming.  In two weeks' time the World Conference on Environment and Development will open in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.  The risk of "global warming" - of an increase in the temperature of the world's atmosphere - will be uppermost in the minds of the delegates of this conference.  Although there are many unknowns and uncertainties attached to this problem, it is clear that the increasing volumes of certain gases, notably carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere contribute to the effect.  Attention is therefore focussed on how to restrain the emission of carbon dioxide, the largest part of which comes from the burning of coal, oil and gas.  Energy generation, conservation and substitutes for fossil fuels are at the centre of attention.  One might have thought that there would be much discussion about nuclear power, which gives vast amounts of energy without emitting any carbon dioxide or, for that matter, any sulphur dioxide (SO2) or nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are linked to acid rains.  However, I predict nuclear power will not be mentioned by many in Rio.  Why?  Because the conference acts by consensus and recommending an expanded use of nuclear power to avoid an alternative burning of fossil fuels would not have a consensus.  Nor would any recommendation opposing nuclear power have a consensus - or even a broad support.  The conference may advocate conservation and the use of environmentally "benign" energy sources - which each country can interpret as it likes.  Perhaps it will succeed in setting a target for the restraints in CO2 emissions.  Ambitious targets will hardly be attainable only through conservation and the use of renewable sources of energy.  A greater use of nuclear energy would be of significance.  A figure will illustrate.  If today's some 430 nuclear power plants were closed and the electricity which they generate were instead to be generated in coal-fired plants, the carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would increase by 7 percent.  It shows that already at present nuclear power is relevant in the discussion of global warming.
<P><B>Expanded use of energy and electricity</B>
<P>Now let me turn to our need for energy and electricity.  There is a clear relationship between the level of economic development and energy consumption.  The average North American uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent per year, the average Chinese uses 590 kg and the average Indian makes do with 280 kg of oil equivalent.  Almost one half of the world's primary energy is used by one sixth of the world's population in the OECD countries.  The developing countries with three fourths of the world's population use less than one third of its primary energy.
<P>The increase in the demand for electricity is conspicuous.  Over the past 15 years, total energy use increased by more than 100% in developing countries, but electricity use was double that.  Moreover, developing countries' demand for electricity is projected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 6%, into the next century.  We sometimes hear voices urging a return to lifestyles of minimal reliance on energy, including electricity.  A prudent and efficient use of energy must certainly be promoted but we cannot ignore the reality that electricity transports energy to our doorsteps and houses, that ample lighting prolongs our days and makes our streets light at night, that electric pumps bring water to fields and houses, that refrigerators and deep freezers keep our food fresh and reduces spoilage, television allows us to meet the whole world at home.
<P>The services which electricity provide may be taken for granted in industrialized countries but they are anxiously sought by the developing nations of the world.  In these countries the words of the famous Indian nuclear physicist, Homi Bhabha "No energy is more expensive than no energy" are well understood.
<P>An example:  China has the ambition to ensure that each household has a refrigerator - a basic improvement in the quality of life.  But it requires a good deal of energy.  Even with refrigerators of modest size and ofthe most current and efficient model available, a  base load capacity of some 20 000 MEe or 20 large nuclear power reactors will be needed.  It is not enough to plug in the refrigerator.  The electricity must be generated somewhere.
<P>One major driving forcebehind the appetite for energy, apart from development, is the explosive growth in the world's population.  At the birth of Christ there were some 350 million people of the Earth.  In 1900 there were 1.5 billion; in 1990 there were more than 5 billion and in the year 2000 there will be well over 6 billion.  Thus, in the last ten years of this century we expect to increase about as much as we did in the one thousand nine hundred years from the birth of Christ to the year 1900.
<P>With such population increase and demand for development, world wide consumption of energy is expected to increase by 50 to 75 percent by the year 2020 according to the World Energy Council.
<P>We must ask ourselves:  "Where will this energy come from?"  And, confronted with evidence that already the present level of consumption of energy has brought severe environmental damage world wide, we must understand that there is tremendous tension locally, regionally and globally between the demands for more energy and the demands for the protection of life, health and the environment.
<P><B>Environment and energy</B>
<P>Twenty years ago the first UN Conference on the Environment in Stockholm, called the world's attention to environmental degradation.  Today we are becoming painfully aware that environmental problems have not diminished, but escalated from local to regional pollution and now pose some threats to the entire planet.  The emissions of SO2 and NOx caused by the burning of coal and oil have led to the problems of acid rain, dying forests and decaying cities.  To these problems we must now add the threat of global warming which is linked to a great extent to the world's use of fossil fuels.
<P>It is calculated that certain gases released into the world's atmosphere - primarily chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane and carbon dioxide (CO2)   trap the heat in the atmosphere and this gradually leads to a higher temperature in the world's atmosphere   with consequent climate changes.  More research can be expected to give us greater certainty about the threat, but many scientists are convinced that we have already experienced a minor warming and that further warming is inevitable.  The question seems only to be whether, through determined action, we are able to slow this development and stabilize it.
<P>Carbon dioxide results from the burning of all fossil and all organic material, including wood.  There is no economically viable way in which CO2 emissions can be avoided in such combustion.  All fuel burning   in cars and other machines, in heating and in electricity generation   is thought to contribute about 50% of the greenhouse effect.  The current burning of rain forests is deemed to add some further 10 20%.  The different fossil fuels do not, however, contribute CO2 in equal measure.  Counted per unit of energy generated, the burning of gas yields about half as much CO2 as does coal.  The amount of CO2 produced by burning oil lies between those of coal and gas.
<P>We cannot change energy systems overnight.  In the foreseeable future there will be an energy mix, as there is today.  Fossil fuels   coal, oil gas   that now cover a little under 90% of the world's total energy use   are certainly not going to be phased out.  Nor is hydro - nor nuclear power.  But it does matter what share is given to the different energies in the mix.
<P>Looked at from a global standpoint it is reasonable to suggest that the least developed countries should be enabled to use the less demanding technologies, which are the fossil based ones and that the advanced countries should make greater use of the more demanding nuclear technology.  In reality we find that both industrially advanced States and some of the more technologically advanced developing countries are at present planning to use both more gas, coal and nuclear.  Mexico, that is now operating one nuclear power reactor and is scheduled to take another into operation in two years, is also building six coal fired plants to cover its growing needs for electricity.  China   while it is at present building a few nuclear plants   is also planning to double its coal use by the year 2000.  And India, which as a number of nuclear plants, is planning to treble its use of coal by the same year.  The coal consumption of China and India together would then be greater than the coal consumption of all the advanced industrialized States lumped together.  This will not reduce CO2 emissions.
<P><B>Energy planning</B>
	<P>Traditionally, energy planning took only the economic aspect into consideration.  The cheapest energy was the best energy.  After the oil embargo a number of countries, e.g. Japan and France, began to consider energy independence as a significant factor.  And today it is evident that we must take into account, not only the costs of generating and distributing energy, but also the costs in terms of life, health and environmental damage.  Environmental price tags must be put on different sources to allow us to compare.  It is important to recognize that the discussion of the merits and demerits of an energy option become meaningful only when this option is compared with its alternatives.
<P>Currently, about 63% of the world's electricity is generated by the burning of coal, oil and gas.  The technology is not very complicated.  From the point of view of economic cost, generation by coal is about equal with nuclear in many places.  From the viewpoint of safety, all three fossil fuels are accepted by the public, although the number of casualties is high in accidents related to coal mining, offshore drilling and gas transportation.  Oil is a much more expensive fuel for electricity production than coal. The price of gas used to be linked to that of oil, but we have seen recently how it has instead been linked to the price of coal, at least for electricity generation.  This makes gas economically attractive at present and there has been a decided trend in the past few years to make greater use of natural gas for electricity generation.  As the burning of gas results in half as much CO2 as does coal per energy unit, there is a net advantage in replacing coal by gas in terms of the greenhouse effect - if leakages of methane can be kept low.  Where gas is burned for additional energy generation, there will, of course, be additional CO2   though less than if coal had been used to generate that additional electricity.
<P><B>Conservation</B>
<P>Some people argue that the question about energy environment can be solved by conservation and a greater use of renewable energy sources.  The concept of conservation covers both a more descriminating and more efficient use of energy.  The difference between the two ways of saving energy is easily seen when we consider that we can save petrol by driving less or by using a more fuel efficient engine.  The latter form of saving is easily accepted   though it may be expensive if it requires a new car...  To limit reliance on energy   to drive less   is more difficult.  It is difficult to calculate how much energy we can save.  The quantities are significant, but no serious energy experts believe that one can achieve more than a partial off setting of the increasing demand for energy.  Certainly current energy plans in the world do not point to a reduced use of energy.
<P><B>Renewable Sources of Energy</B>
<P>The most important renewable and non CO2 producing source of electricity is hydro power.  At present, it generates some 20% of the world's electricity.  In the industrialized world, most hydro potential has already been exploited, but in some developing countries, notably Africa, significant resources remain.  In China, a giant hydro electric project on the Yangstse river will now be launched.  It is to yield enormous quantities of electricity, but will also, apparently, require the resettlement of large numbers of people.
<P>There is much talk about the use of biomass in the industrialized countries.  Rapidly growing trees, harvesting, burning and the planting of new trees would be a fuel cycle without any net contribution of CO2.  However, the economics of this source have not yet been established and so far it has not really been relied upon on a large scale anywhere.
<P>Solar power is making a substantial contribution in isolated locations and on a small scale and heating of water by solar energy is practical and economic in many places    not least in this part of the world.  However, solar cells for large scale economic  electricity production are still deemed to be far away.
<P>Windmills have a long tradition, but despite considerable experimentation and promotion, wind power has not become economic, nor does it yield the large quantities of energy we need.
<P>Taken together solar power, wind power, biomass and other commerical, new and renewable sources yield today less than 0.5% of the world's energy.  Most of it is actually geothermal   e.g. in the United States, Iceland and New Zealand.
<P>How does nuclear power compare with other sources of electricity from the standpoints of environment, economy, security and safety?
<P><B>Environment and Nuclear Power</B>
<P>Nuclear power   which provides about 17% of the world's electricity   has the great advantage of giving rise to no harmful emissions in normal operation.  This means that the use of nuclear power helps us to avoid CO2 and NOx and SO2 emissions.
<P>I am not suggesting that increased use of nuclear power alone can stabilize CO2 emissions, but I am certain that it must be part of the solution - if there is to be a solution.
<P>We come to the issue of security.  It is often alleged that nuclear power increases the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons.  It cannot be excluded that a State could try to make use of a nuclear power programme to hide a weapons programme.  However, stopping civilian 
nuclear power would be no guarantee against development of nuclear weapons.  Rather we must seek to create such political and security conditions that nuclear weapons do not appear desirable to any State.  In this regard the world has come a long way - though admittedly not yet all the way.  The ambition should be a drastic reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the five nuclear weapon States and acceptance of non-proliferation by other States by 1995.  This, I think, is not an unrealistic target.
<P>IAEA safeguards control is not a police power that can stop nuclear activities in a State.  But States which pledge themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons and promise to hold all their nuclear material, present or future, available for inspection, open themselves for considerable control.
<P>What is the risk that international inspection will not discover violations of nuclear non proliferations pledges?  It is simply not feasible to organize a control system under which inspectors systematically comb through every nook and corner of whole countries.  The present system is based upon States declaring nuclear material that they import, produce and possess and it is supplemented by declarations of other States exporting nuclear material.  This system does not create a guarantee against a State secretly mining its own uranium and itself secretly enriching it.  However, in today's world with many satellites and other information around, evidence is likely to become available of such clandestine programmes.  Uranium mining is mostly visible and enrichment and reprocessing plants are also likely to be seen from above.  Such observations, if made known to the IAEA, may trigger proposals for special inspections of possibly non declared nuclear material.  The risk of non detection is not great but the case of Iraq shows that it is not zero.  With greater alertness and more effective export controls it should be possible to make it minimal.
<P><B>Safety</B>
<P>My last points, but not the least ones, relate to the safe operation of nuclear power plants and the safe disposal of nuclear wastes.
<P>A Symposium in Finland in May 1991 on Electricity and Environment which compared risks of different energy sources through the whole cycle, from mining to waste disposal, found not surprisingly that all sources of electricity have some degree of risk.  
Nuclear and renewables were found in normal operation to be in the low end of the risk spectrum, whilst coal and oil were found on the high.  The risk for large accidents was found to be greatest in hydro power, where many dam bursts have taken heavy tolls of lives.  These conclusions square with our daily experience of nuclear power and with the fact that Chernobyl is the only large radiation releasing accident  in a civilian nuclear power plant despite the experience of some 6000 operation years of civilian reactors.  However, we must be aware that the public, which seems to tolerate the risk that people may drown in hydro dam catastrophes, die in explosions in coal mines, or oil platforms or at gas cisterns and pipes, is less tolerant about the risk that anyone's health is affected by the exposure to radiation   whether in the short term or the long term.  As individuals we are neither realistic nor logical in our attitudes to risk.  Let me cite an example.  The World Health Organization has estimated that worldwide the use of pesticides cause some 15 000 human lives and more than a million cases of poisoning each year!  We must assume that these casualties are ignored and tolerated by the public because of the great economic importance of pesticides.  We don't reason the same way about nuclear power although its casualties are few and it provides the world with about 17% of its electricity.  It is true that radioactive contamination may have rather long-lasting effects.  But the use of pesticides sometimes leads to mercury pollution which requires that lakes be black-listed for fishing.
<P>We can only respond to the public attitudes in two ways.  First, by factual information about the risks of nuclear power use and waste disposal and by comparing these risks with those that will be taken if fossil fuels are the alternative.  Second, by strengthening the safety of nuclear power so that no accidents occur in which significant radiation is released.  This, of course, is what is being done   even without any public concern.  Safety is never static   whether in automobiles, aeroplanes or nuclear power plants.  Nuclear power is safer today in most countries than it was before the Chernobyl accident and it will be safer tomorrow.  Some technical modifications have been made on many existing plants and the next generation of plants which will be ready for ordering within a few years will be improved compared to the present generation.
<P>Responsibility for nuclear power safety rests with national authorities.  The IAEA is no supranational regulatory body with powers to order a State to modify plants or to close them.  The Agency does, however, offer Member States safety reviews of various kinds through international expertise and these services are increasingly used and the expert advice offered is normally accepted and acted upon.  Discussions how the international community can better influence nuclear power safety in individual countries have also started and work has begun on an international convention on nuclear safety containing rules that would be binding on the parties.  There is also a considerable amount of activities under way to help strengthen nuclear power safety in ex-Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
<P><B>Nuclear Waste</B>
<P>Let me conclude by some comments on nuclear waste.  Nuclear experts are convinced that there are no scientific or technological breakthroughs needed for a waste disposal that is safe even for very, very long time periods.  The technological solutions favoured all around the world for highly radioactive waste are the same, namely to leave spent nuclear fuel at surface level to cool and lose in radioactivity for some 30 60 years and thereafter to isolate it from the biosphere by several barriers and place it in deep stable geological formations.
<P>This confidence of the experts is not yet conveyed to the general public.  The point is often made that we are dealing with waste that remains hazardous for many thousands of years.  This is true, but the quantities are so limited that they can be isolated. This is not the case with the larger quantities of toxic waste that result from the burning of coal.  By 1987 the high level nuclear waste arising annually from all the world's nuclear power stations amounted to about 6000 tons in the form of spent fuel.  If the amount of electricity that these plants generated had instead come from electricity generating coal plants, alone the toxic heavy metals released   mercury, arsenic, vanadium, etc.   would have amounted so some 100 000 tonnes.  These toxic wastes do not have a half life like radioactive wastes.  They remain toxic forever and they remain at the surface of the earth.  The wastes of uranium are put back in the crust of the earth from where the uranium came.  As the final disposal site for the wastes of coal, oil and gas we have chosen the atmosphere and the surface of the earth.  The quantities are so great that we can hardly do otherwise.  But it is puzzling that this overwhelming problem is tolerated, while the limited problem of civilian nuclear power waste disposal appears unbearable to many.  Perhaps the increasing awareness of the greenhouse effect will convince the public that the risks connected with an expanding us of nuclear power, although not zero, are more tolerable than the risks of an excessive use of fossil fuels.<HR>

<TITLE>Nuclear Energy and the Environment</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Nuclear Energy and the Environment</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix at the International Conference on the 50th Anniversary of the Fermi Reactor and on Peaceful Applications of Nuclear Energy</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Liege, Belgium</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>14 October 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Mr. Chairman, Rector of the University of Liège,
<P>	Before I present my prepared comments I should like to tell you how pleased I am to be in this historic city of Liège.  I should like to pay tribute to the Association des Ingénieurs de Liège, to the European Nuclear Society and to the University of Liège as principal sponsors of this European celebration of the first controlled nuclear chain reaction achieved by Enrico Fermi in Chicago in 1942.
<P>Some people wish that this experiment had never succeeded.  However, the apples which we pluck from the tree of knowledge remain plucked.  They cannot be put back.  We can only try to use them for good and not for bad.  That is up to us!
<P>Only a few years ago I felt the evolution was going in the wrong direction.  The lethal nuclear bomb arsenals were growing and the building of peaceful nuclear power plants was stagnating.  Today, at least the arsenals are shrinking and I am convinced the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will increase.  To me the environmental merits of nuclear power, compared to other energy sources, have always been their major attraction - far outweighing the risks it poses.  And I am glad to be invited to talk about this issue at the outset although a separate session is devoted to it.
<P>The world in which Enrico Fermi so brilliantly succeeded in bringing about the first controlled nuclear fission was a world of lethal conflict among great powers and the destructive force of the atom was demonstrated early.  For nearly fifty years thereafter the many thousands of bombs based on nuclear fission - and fusion - have constituted a sword of Damocles threatening the survival of humanity.  But during those fifty years a nuclear power industry has also grown up generating some 17% of the world's electricity and thousands of nuclear applications are used to promote our health and livelihood.
<P>Today the risk of major conflagrations is rapidly receding.  Production of weapons grade uranium and plutonium is being phased out and thousands of nuclear weapons in the US and Russia are being deactivated and will be dismantled.  In the world of ideological detente and accelerated nuclear disarmament, a complete ban on the testing of nuclear weapons and a drastic reduction in the nuclear weapon arsenals of the five permanent members of the Security Council are not just dreams but distinct possibilities.  While the risk of spread of nuclear weapons to further States is by no means eliminated - as we have seen recently in the case of Iraq - Argentina's and Brazil's decisions to fully open their nuclear programmes for IAEA inspection, South Africa's adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and acceptance by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of IAEA inspection are important and very encouraging steps.  So are the declarations by new States, like the Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan that they will join the NPT.  The task laid upon the IAEA of inspecting a growing number of nuclear installations will become even more important to give assurance that these installations are used only for peaceful purposes.  Other speakers will address this issue which remains a central one for the IAEA.
<P>In this world of decreasing global military threats, other threats and major problems have to be faced.  Among them are many armed conflicts between ethnic groups, the protection of minorities and human rights, development and a better management of the economy of the world and - not least - the protection of the global environment.  It is this last issue which I shall address, focussing on the significance of nuclear power and nuclear techniques for development and for the environment.
<P>Let me begin by saying that although our ancestors were perfectly capable of destroying their own environment - e.g. through excessive logging for shipbuilding leading to deforestation - they were fewer than we are and their technical tools were not so numerous and so powerful as those which we possess.
<P>The importance for the environment of population growth can hardly be overestimated.  It is calculated that at the time of the birth of Christ there were about 350 million people on the earth; in 1900 there were 1.5 billion; in 1990 there were about 5 billion and in the year 2000 we expect to be about 6 billion.  Thus in the last 10 years of this century it is expected that the world's population will increase almost as much as it did from the time of Christ to the year 1900.  As there are no virgin continents left, erosion, desertification and other environmental problems will drive people to emigrate to areas already well populated - with the risk of conflict.  The demand for reasonable standards of living by an ever increasing number of people is already placing terrible strains on global resources of soil and fresh water.  In my view none of the central problems of the next century - and certainly not the environmental ones - can be tackled with the hope of success, unless we vigorously address the issue of population growth.
<P>Environmental destruction and dangers have evolved from the local to the regional and now the global level.  The awareness of this is increasing rapidly.  No international conference has seen so many Heads of State and government as that on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil last June.  And nearly 10,000 media representatives helped to heighten global consciousness about the threats to our environment.
<P>Some people want to place the blame for environmental dangers and destruction on modern science and technology, e.g. on new compounds invented by the chemists, or nuclear techniques developed by physicists and engineers.  It is undeniable that many compounds designed - for instance - to help us increase agricultural production have proved to have dangerous effects, and it is true that many techniques, including nuclear power, give rise to problems and risks and yield not only benefits.  It is important that resources are devoted to non-chemical means of increasing food production and to sources other than nuclear power to increase energy production.  But it is naive and futile to turn our backs on chemistry or nuclear physics.  It is in large measure science and technology that we have to thank for our standard of living in the industrialized countries and it is to science and technology that we must turn to solve our problems - including those created by science and technology themselves.
<P>Some people want the world to close the nuclear chapter.  It would be most unwise, however, to disregard techniques that help to restore our health, increase food production and produce clean energy at competitive costs.  We would do better to analyse the cost benefits of nuclear techniques and compare them with alternatives.
<P>There are today many nuclear techniques directly serving environmental protection and effective resource utilization.  In agriculture, new strains of seeds are created through mutations induced by irradiation, strains that may be more pest-resistant or drought-resistant or have other desirable features.  Cotton crops in Pakistan and rice crops in Indonesia, to take two examples, have increased enormously thanks to the use of mutants.  Through the use of radioisotopes many difficult and important measurements can be performed which help identify water resources or paths of pollution, or measure the uptake of fertilizer in plants.  In Libya the FAO and the IAEA helped, through a nuclear technique, to eradicate an infestation of the New World screwworm, a pest which kills cattle as well as wild animals.  The technique consisted in releasing millions of insects which had been rendered sterile by irradiation.  They mated with fertile insects and no offspring resulted.  The insect population was eradicated in less than one year from the beginning of the campaign.  Only tiny quantities of insecticide had been used for treating wounds infested with the parasite.  The benefit cost ratio of this successful campaign was calculated to be 50 to 1.
<P>In industry, nuclear techniques offer unique ways of making exact measurements which saves raw materials and other resources.  A nuclear technique is even being tested to reduce pollutants arising from the burning of coal.  Flue gases from the coal burning are mixed with ammonia and subjected to electron beams from an accelerator.  The result is that most of the SO2 and NOx is removed from the emissions and a substance that can be used as fertilizer is obtained (ammonium nitrate and sulfate).
<P>I need hardly remind you of the many uses of nuclear techniques in modern medicine, not only to combat cancer where they remain a principal method of treatment, but to achieve many new forms of diagnostic imaging.
<P>Few people perhaps are ready to turn their backs on nuclear techniques such as these.  Indeed, relatively few are probably aware of the wide range of nuclear techniques which serve us in today's world.  The brunt of the opposition is directed against the use of nuclear power and it is based on the view that the costs of this source of energy are unacceptable in terms of risks to life, health and the environment.  We must, of course, analyse what these risks are.  We must also ask what risks are acceptable to society, and what risks we would be taking by relying on possible alternative means of energy generation, or by refraining from producing more energy.  And we must ask, lastly, to what extent risks connected with nuclear power can be further reduced.
<P>The question of what level of risk is acceptable to society in various activities - how safe is safe enough? - is not technical but political.  Governments answer it, influenced by political movements, parties and the media.  Technical data and facts, while not irrelevant to this process, are only a small part of the input.  Nor is there a single answer to the question.  The answers vary from country to country.  They may depend on local circumstances and they vary greatly from one human activity to another.
<P>Our attitudes to risk may, indeed, seem puzzling and inconsistent.  One of the everyday risks to life in modern society is the use of automobiles.  Statistics published a few days ago put the number of killed or injured annually per 10 000 cars at 203 in Belgium, highest in Europe, and 59 in Denmark, lowest in Europe.  Public opinion and governments in these countries, as in others, tolerate these risks, presumably because they are deemed to be outweighed by the benefits.  In both cases the risks can certainly be lowered - at some cost.  Another example:  a publication by the WHO (1990) on the "Public Health Impact of Pesticides used in Agriculture" estimates the global number of annual unintentional deaths caused by pesticide poisoning in 1985 at 20 000 and the total number of unintentional non-fatal poisonings caused by pesticides in 1985 at 1 million!  Presumably these high numbers of casualties are "accepted" by governments and public opinion because of the vital importance of pesticides to food production.  The Bhopal accident - with about 2500 dead - was much publicized but no one suggested a moratorium on the production of pesticides.
<P>While the continued use of automobiles and pesticides and continued coal mining are not questioned by any strong body of public opinion, despite the heavy toll of lives these activities take, the reliance on nuclear power is questioned and in several European States there are formal or informal moratoria on the construction of new plants.  There can be no doubt that this opinion has been influenced by the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island - where there were hardly any radioactive releases into the environment - and at Chernobyl, where there were vast releases.  It has no doubt been influenced also by the fear that toxic radioactive wastes would leak now or in the future from their disposal sites.
<P>No one can ignore the health and environmental impacts of the Chernobyl accident or the irresponsible handling of radioactive wastes that has occurred in the military sectors in the US and former USSR.  It is interesting, however, to see the conclusions of a Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and the Environment which took place in Helsinki in 1991 and which was organized by a large number of international organizations, including IAEA.  Comparing the health and environmental impacts of different electricity-generating systems and considering the impacts of the systems from beginning to end - e.g. from fuel extraction to waste disposal - the Symposium concluded - with some reservations due to incompleteness of data - that "under routine operation conditions, nuclear power and renewable systems tend to be in the lower spectrum of health risk and ... energy systems based on coal and oil are in the higher spectrum of health risk"; and that
"human health risks from severe accidents from nuclear, oil and natural gas are of the same order of magnitude and two orders of magnitude smaller than those from the hydroelectric option."
<P>The second conclusion may appear surprising until one looks at the number of hydro dams which have burst over the years drowning many thousands of people.  These dispassionate conclusions of an expert symposium deserve to be cited as they contrast with commonly held perceptions.
<P>It is often claimed that we can do without nuclear energy and its risks, either through energy savings or through greater reliance on renewable sources of energy.  Although both accelerated conservation and the development of solar power and other renewable sources are desirable, neither is credibly predicted to be alternatives to nuclear power.  The 15th Congress of the World Energy Council held in Madrid last month stated that "we cannot do without any of the sources of supply which presently exist, since renewable energy and new technologies will not be able to replace fossil fuel or nuclear".
<P>It is evident that developing countries in particular will seek to use much more energy than they do today.  The average North American now uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent per year; the average Chinese uses 590 kg and the average Indian makes do with 280 kg of oil equivalent per year.  It is not surprising that China is at present planning to double its use of coal by the year 2000.  The World Energy Council has estimated that global energy consumption can be expected to increase by 50-75% by the year 2020 - even assuming vigorous efforts to save energy.  And the same institution puts the contribution of renewable sources of energy at around 3% by that time.
<P>If fears about a global warming effect from the so-called greenhouse gases, notably CO2, are confirmed to be justified, we will face a dilemma:  how to reconcile the predicted greater use of energy with the need to restrain CO2 emissions - which are linked to the burning of all fossil fuel.  Nuclear power is of great importance in this situation, firstly as it is used primarily to generate electricity which is the fastest growing form of energy use, secondly because nuclear power plants do not emit any CO2 or other substances which would have an impact on global climate.
<P>It has been suggested that nuclear power, which today is responsible for about 5% of the world's energy and 17% of its electricity - a little less than hydro's 20% of electricity -is too small a source to be of any importance to global CO2 emissions.  No one has contended that nuclear power, alone, can be the answer to the threat of global warming, but it has been calculated that if today's 400 or so nuclear power plants were closed and the electricity generated by them were instead generated by coal-fired plants, total global CO2 emissions would increase by some 7%.
<P>Thus it does matter to global CO2 emissions if obsolescent coal plants are replaced by nuclear plants or if obsolescent nuclear plants are replaced by coal plants.  The relevance of nuclear power to CO2 emissions can also be seen from a comparison between the UK and France.  In the UK, where about 70% of electricity comes from coal combustion, average CO2 emission per kWh was 0.78 kg.  In France, where more than 70% of the electricity comes from nuclear power, the CO2 emissions per kWh are about one tenth of the British value (0.086 kg).
<P>At the present time when a fairly large sector of public opinion in many industrialized countries is still sceptical about a wider use of nuclear power, it is understandable if governments, aware of the need to limit CO2 emissions, either postpone decisions on power generation or opt for gas, which does contribute to CO2 but generates about half as much CO2 per energy unit as does coal.
<P>There is no doubt, however, that the awareness is increasing among governments that, although the problem of global warming cannot be answered by nuclear power alone, it can also not be answered without reliance on nuclear power.  Both the Paris and Houston summits of seven industrialized States pointed to nuclear power as a means of restraining greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>Even the Club of Rome seems - lately and reluctantly - to have come to the conclusion, in the face of the risk of global warming, that the use of nuclear power is necessary.  Coal and oil, it is said, are "probably more dangerous to society because of the carbon dioxide they produce ..." and "There are, therefore, strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open".
<P>At the level of the United Nations, e.g. at the Rio Conference, no such conclusion would have been possible.  Certainly, a vast majority of the world's governments either favour the use or expanded use of nuclear power or, at least, the retention of the option, and only a handful of governments are opposed.  Nevertheless conclusions at the UN level are mostly by consensus and there is clearly no consensus on the matter between governments.  At Rio a Framework Convention on Climate Change was concluded.  It failed to include the proposal that CO2 emissions by 2005 should have returned to the levels of 1990, but it did set as an ultimate objective the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.  The Conference and Convention refrained to tell us how this was to be achieved.  The real discussions on CO2 emissions and energy sources - including the merits of nuclear power -therefore lie before us in years to come.  My own conclusion is that the industrially advanced States will have to consider a continued, indeed, expanded use of nuclear power in order to enable many developing countries to expand their use of less demanding fossil fuel-based technologies.  I believe we must also develop nuclear power plants which are easier to operate for eventual use by the more advanced developing countries.
<P>Returning to the two principal points which underlie most of the scepticism about nuclear power - waste disposal and operational safety - one might conclude that in the environmental context, nuclear wastes are, in fact, the greatest asset of nuclear power.  They do not contribute to acid rain or global warming and they are so limited in volume that they can be disposed of and isolated in their entirety.
<P>Some figures and comparisons may be helpful.  A coal-fired plant of 1000 MW(e) will require about 7000 tons of coal per day - i.e. about five train loads.  A nuclear plant of the same electric capacity will use some 80 kilograms of uranium per day.  Even with excellent flue gas cleaning equipment the coal plant will annually emit some 9000 tons of SO2, 4500 tons of NOx, some 400 tons of various heavy metals and no less than 6.5 million tons of CO2.  The nuclear plant will produce 30 tons of highly radioactive waste per year.
<P>The methods which have been worked out for the disposal of the limited amounts of nuclear waste are designed to ensure isolation for tens of thousands of years.  They would seem vastly less risky than our current free release of most of the waste resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.  It would seem desirable, however, that the international consensus on responsible management, transport and disposal of nuclear wastes should be laid down in standards for both civilian and military wastes accepted and respected by all.  Such standards are, in fact, being worked out within the IAEA.
<P>With regard to operational safety it is understood by the nuclear power industry that the level world wide must be so high that accidents with significant releases will not occur.  This realization is leading to an intensification of international co-operation regarding nuclear safety.  The safety weaknesses identified in design and operation of nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are leading the countries of these regions to work together with other industrialized States to back-fit and upgrade plants or gradually to phase out plants which are not deemed able to attain an internationally acceptable level of safety.  Moreover, much more use is being made of international peer reviews in the nuclear safety field - both between operators and between regulators.  To existing non-binding standards regarding nuclear safety there will soon be added a convention containing safety fundamentals, which will become legally binding upon States adhering to it.
<P>The ambition is that through measures such as these, an international nuclear safety culture will emerge whose positive impact will be reflected in an excellent global operating record for nuclear power plants.  Such results, if attained over a period of time, I think will convince the public that the expanded use of nuclear power, which may be indispensable, is also fully acceptable.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Coping with Nuclear Danger in a Post-Cold War World</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix on the IAEA's Safeguards and Verification Role to the Council on Foreign Relations</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, NY, USA</H4>

<P><HR>
<P>
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on a subject which is central to the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  Some experts tell us that nuclear proliferation is the greatest military risk we face in the world today.  I shall describe these risks and responses, as I see them.  I should like to begin, however, by noting that there are several factors in the post-cold-war world which favour non-proliferation and which have already led to important positive results.
<P>The primary factor in the attitude of States to nuclear weapons is their perceived security interests.  Global and regional tensions and nuclear arms races are incentives to acquire such weapons; detente globally and regionally and nuclear disarmament are disincentives.  In the present global detente, with the major military powers helping to settle regional conflicts rather than competing in them, and with accelerating nuclear disarmament between the United States and Russia, the general climate is positive and there are good reasons to set our non-proliferation ambitions high.  In my view we should aim, firstly, at an unlimited extension of the NPT at the conference which will take place in 1995; secondly, we should seek to obtain non- proliferation commitments from all States except the five declared nuclear-weapon States - if possible by the same date.  Today, agreement on a final date for nuclear weapons testing does not seem totally excluded and an agreement on a cut-off of the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes should not be too difficult, considering that the disposal of fissionable material for dismantled weapons is already a problem.  Agreements on these two matters would be highly significant in the non-proliferation issue.
<P>Let me now point to some specific recent non-proliferation gains.  With Argentina and Brazil having declared themselves committed to non-proliferation and Cuba apparently ready to join the Tlatelolco Treaty, there are good prospects that this Treaty may enter into force for all parties next year.  Latin America would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>South Africa, dismantling apartheid and no longer feeling under a potential military pressure from the outside world, has ratified the NPT and is opening its nuclear installations to IAEA inspection.  Thereby the efforts of African States to make their continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone take on more realism.
<P>The States in the Middle East have long expressed a consensus support for the concept of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region and still do so.  At the recent General Conference of the IAEA I was instructed to consult with these States about comprehensive verification in the region and to work out a model safeguards agreement.  A nuclear-weapon-free zone is unlikely to be established except in the context of a negotiated peace settlement.  Today the chances for such a settlement are greater than ever before.  Agreement on a zone comprising all relevant States would not only be desirable per se.  Without it there could be reluctance among Arab States, now parties to the NPT, to support an unlimited extension of the Treaty in 1995.
<P>The security perspectives on the Indian sub-continent, where neither State is legally committed to non-proliferation, and in the Korean peninsula, where both States are so committed, are unclear.  A positive factor here as elsewhere in the post-cold-war world is that the declared nuclear-weapon States, which are also permanent members of the Security Council, co-operate in favour of non-proliferation.
<P>If there are reasons to be pleased that some of the old non-proliferation problems have been solved and that there might be gleams of hope in others, we also have to register some new problems.
<P>One question which has often been asked in the past year is whether the break-up of the Soviet bloc and the break-down of the firm communist state structures have increased the risks of nuclear weapons, material, know-how or scientists and engineers trickling out to would-be proliferating countries.  It would, indeed, seem plausible that a loosening of government controls and administrative order, coupled with desperate living conditions and increased criminality, could lead to proliferating acts.  Judging by media reports one would even think that there is a flourishing black market in plutonium and enriched uranium.  However, all news items which the IAEA has been able to follow up with governmental authorities have proved - so far - to be uninteresting from the viewpoint of proliferation.  Similar conclusions were reported by Mr. Gates of the CIA early this year.  Gram quantities of plutonium have been sold and the illegal transactions raise concern from the viewpoint of radiation protection, but not from the standpoint of proliferation.  We have also not seen any evidence so far of scientists or engineers emigrating from the Soviet bloc.  There is, however, no reason for complacency.  The best remedy is political and social stabilization in the former Soviet Union.
<P>An acute proliferation problem would arise if Ukraine, Belarus or Kazakhstan decided to try individually to control strategic nuclear weapons which remain on their territory.  I have no knowledge about current negotiations between these States and Russia and the United States.  I can only tell you that the IAEA is discussing with authorities in these States how to set up accounting and control systems for their peaceful nuclear installations to enable them to accept safeguards verification by the Agency once they have ratified the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States.
<P>I turn now to the risk that the case of Iraq has demonstrated, namely that some developing countries are reaching a technological level where they can produce enriched uranium and plutonium and design weapons.  When the NPT was concluded the fears were about countries like Germany, Switzerland and Sweden.  Later the fears were about a few technologically advanced developing countries, like Argentina and Brazil.  Today the concern is rather about countries like Algeria, Iran and North Korea.  Of these three only Algeria is not a party to the NPT.  What is the risk of another Iraq?  And what can be done about it?
<P>Iraq was a highly militarized society with well-trained scientific and technical cadres and a government able and willing to spend vast resources on the nuclear sector and motivated to do so by perceived strategic interests.  The conditions were unusual - but not unique.
<P>The means by which the world can discourage nuclear weapons development in technologically advancing developing States are largely the same as for advanced States.  The most important means lie in the political-security field:  regional detente, security guarantees, absence of military threats.  A peaceful settlement in the Middle East and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, comprising Iran, Iraq, Israel, Algeria, Libya and other States would be the most important measure.  Another barrier against nuclear proliferation lies in export restrictions on nuclear material and sensitive equipment.  After Iraq agreement has been reached among a number of States on a tightening of such restrictions.
<P>A third means of influence lies in economic favours for non-proliferation status and threat of action against proliferation - as declared by the summit-level meeting of the Security Council early this year.
<P>The safeguards inspectors of the IAEA are not nuclear police that stop proliferation by the use of force but the reports of the inspectors may trigger action by governments in the diplomatic, economic, political or military field.  It is the awareness of this that lends authority to the inspections.  However, the potential reactions of the outside world are only a deterrent to proliferation if the risk of detection is high.  Before the events in Iraq the membership of the IAEA asked the Agency primarily to verify that there was no diversion of nuclear material from declared nuclear programmes.  The safeguards system was well developed to do this.  After the events in Iraq the demand not surprisingly has been that the safeguards system should also verify that there exist no clandestine, undeclared nuclear installations.  This is harder to do.
<P>In the case of Iraq the Security Council asked the IAEA to map the nuclear capacity of Iraq through inspections, to destroy or otherwise neutralize Iraq's capacity to make weapons and weapons-useable material and to organize long-term monitoring.  The corresponding tasks regarding chemical and biological weapons and missiles were given to a Special Commission, to be nominated by the Secretary-General.  The Commission was also to assist and co-operate with the IAEA and - on the basis of information given to it - to designate sites and installations for the IAEA to inspect.
<P>Through the highly intrusive inspections which the IAEA has performed in Iraq on sites designated by the Special Commission, the nuclear enrichment and weaponization programme was uncovered.  The question has inevitably arisen:  Why did you not perform inspections of such thoroughness before?  Why did you only visit the nuclear facilities which Iraq declared?  Why did you give advance notice about inspections instead of performing surprise visits?  Why did you let Iraq reject inspectors proposed by you?
<P>Following on these questions, suggestions are made by some that for the future inspections might be more effective if directed from some organ under the Security Council -a permanent commission on the pattern of the Special Commission for Iraq, but with a mandate to look after all countries and all weapons of mass destruction, and with easy access to the Security Council and to national intelligence sources.
<P>It is clear that lessons must be drawn from the case of Iraq.  As I shall explain lessons are drawn.  It is also to be welcomed that the Security Council is ready to tackle cases of proliferation which may constitute threats to international peace and security.  It is not equally clear - at least not to me - that there would be any advantage in or need for a bureaucratic filter between the IAEA which is continuously responsible for the inspections all over the world and the Council which, if need be, supports the inspections and which may act on any violation reported by the IAEA.
<P>Let me now address some of the questions raised about inspections in the wake of the revelations in Iraq.  The first point to consider is the basis of information upon which inspections take place.  Inspectors cannot roam whole countries in blind search of nuclear installations.  They must have information on where they may reasonably look.  Under the IAEA safeguards inspection system the inspected State has a duty to declare all relevant material and all relevant installations.  It is certainly important that these be subject to inspection, that the large quantities of declared plutonium and enriched uranium be checked and accounted for.  But what about the possible undeclared material and installations?  In the case of Iraq information about them came from defectors and satellite pictures.  Such information was given by national governments to the Special Commission, which used it to designate sites for inspection by the IAEA - in the case of nuclear-related sites.  Such information was not available to the Agency before Iraq.  Under the safeguards system as it was designed before the events in Iraq, the Agency would get some information that did not originate in the inspected State itself, notably about nuclear material exported to that State.  In order to reduce the loss of commercial industrial secrets NPT-type safeguards were designed to focus on the nuclear material.  It is true that without such material you cannot make a weapon, but it is also true that a completely indigenous and undeclared production of nuclear material could go undetected.  This is what happened in Iraq as regards the enriched uranium emerging from the EMIS method.
<P>Post Iraq the IAEA has sought drastically to broaden its information basis.  It urges Member States to supply it with information about the export and import of sensitive equipment.  Had such information existed in the case of Iraq, suspicions and grounds for questions might have arisen.  Post Iraq the Agency also scans media for possible clues about undeclared material or installations.  Lastly, it asks Member States to provide any relevant information they may have, including information obtained through satellite photography.  There is, of course, a lot of disinformation circulating and even more poor or erroneous information.  Therefore, the assessment of all the information must be critical.  The Agency should not overlook material or installations which should have been declared but it should also not strike false alarms.  With the expanded information basis that is now being created the risk should be much reduced that sites calling for inspection are not identified.
<P>If access to information about sites is the first requirement for successful inspection, access to the sites is the second.  In the case of Iraq there is a right to "unimpeded" access under the Security Council resolution and an exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and Iraq.  This has meant the right to go anywhere, anytime, to look for anything relevant to that resolution.  No need for visas and no right for Iraq to reject inspectors.  It has allowed surprise inspections, visits to prisons, ministries, military sites and the search for documents.
<P>The inspection rights in Iraq contrast sharply with the rights which the IAEA used to be accorded under safeguards agreements.  It should be recalled, however, that the arrangements in Iraq were accepted by a defeated government in conjunction with a cease-fire.  The inspection rights laid down in the newly negotiated convention on chemical weapons are probably more indicative of how far States are willing to go.  It will be found that visas can still be required and that inspector designations rejected.  However, some progress has been made compared to inspection arrangements under safeguards agreements.  This should be allowed to rub off on the nuclear inspection system.
<P>A special question relates to the speed with which an inspection can be sent.  In the case of Iraq, surprise was very important to success in a few cases where the targets were mobile, namely documents and nuclear equipment on trucks.  These, however, are not typical objects of inspection.  The normal object would be reactors, enrichment or reprocessing plants and similar installations.  They do not move overnight.  A bomb-quantity of plutonium or enriched uranium, on the other hand, is so small in volume that it could be moved within hours, defeating the most ambitious surprise inspection.  It must be remembered that the inspectors work on the territory controlled by a government.  That government is physically capable of obstructing or impeding the inspection if it so chooses.
<P>The IAEA is now affirming a right which exists in safeguards agreements to perform so-called "special inspections" when the Agency has reason to believe that something that should have been declared has not been declared.  Such inspections will certainly not take place overnight if the recipient country is reluctant to receive them.  However, if access were resisted by the country and the matter were brought to the Board of Governors of the IAEA, the Board could submit the case without delay to the Security Council under the relationship agreement between the IAEA and the United Nations.  In any situation the Council could evidently also address an issue of apparent proliferation on its own and call on a State to accept Agency inspection.
<P>I have spoken in some detail about inspections, because it is a central function of the IAEA.  We have a department of some 600 people dealing with it, consuming about one-third of our budget of some $60 million.  Yet, there are many questions I have not answered.  I hope, however, that I have given you some ideas both on the nuclear proliferation dangers and the means of meeting them - including inspection.<HR>

<TITLE>Statement of IAEA Director General Hans Blix to the UN Security Council on IAEA Inspections in Iraq</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General Hans Blix to the UN Security Council on IAEA Inspections in Iraq</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>UN Security Council on IAEA Inspections in Iraq</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>11 March 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Mr. President,<BR>
<P>Under a series of Security Council resolutions beginning with Resolution 687 (1991) the IAEA has been mandated, working together with the Special Commission, to map nuclear programmes and facilities in Iraq intended for, or susceptible of being used for nuclear weapons production or the production of weapons-usable material; to remove, destroy or render harmless proscribed items; and, to plan and perform future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with all the Security Council resolutions. I propose to focus on the IAEA's work in these three areas.
<P>In the 11 months that have passed since the adoption of Resolution 687 the IAEA has sent ten inspection missions to Iraq, removed 12 kilograms of highly enriched unirradiated uranium from Iraq, ordered and supervised the destruction or rendering harmless of a considerable amount of proscribed equipment and prepared a plan for the long term monitoring of permitted nuclear activities. This considerable activity would not have been possible without a certain amount of cooperation by Iraq, but the results would have come much faster and with much less pain if Iraq had fully and spontaneously complied with its obligation under the resolutions of the Council and the exchange of letters with the Secretary General of the United Nations.
<P>As deseribed by the IAEA in the report submitted by the Secretary General on 25 January 1992 (S/23514), Iraq has often followed a pattern of denial of clandestine activities until the evidence is overwhelming, followed by cooperation until the next case of concealment is revealed. The denial of activities have in many eases been accompanied by active concealment and deception. In a number of cases serious confrontation occurred when Agency inspection teams were denied the right to unrestricted access to sites or the removal of pertinent documents.
<P>It is perfectly clear that in the face of these attitudes the IAEA could not have carried out the inspection programme and the mapping of the Iraqi nuclear programme but for the firm and consistent support of the Security Council. I should like to express the appreciation of the IAEA for this support. The present meeting of the Council is testimony to the continuation of this support in view of concrete difficulties which the Special Commission and the IAEA are currently encountering. Like several speakers this morning I hope that this meeting will contribute to a solution of these difficulties. I shall describethese difficulties but also briefly point to the results which have been achieved.
<P>Important results have been obtained in the identification and mapping of Iraq's extensive efforts to acquire nuclear weapons capability. After ten months of work, including ten inspections, after many sessions of intense questioning of Iraqi technical teams, after the screening of masses of documents and after assessment of the analytical investigations of many hundreds of samples taken in Iraq, a fairly consistent and coherent picture is emerging of the Iraqi nuclear programme. Information supplied by Iraq, often after prior lack of cooperation, has been of great importance in several ways but the picture that we draw is by no means a simple reflection of this information. It is based on direct observation and inspection of nuclear facilities, equipment and material, on authentic documents and proven information from other countries and on our own experts' considerable experience of nuclear programmes. There are, however still some gaps or "grey areas". In view of these gaps and Iraq's track record of non revelation, inspections need to continue. Further information obtained about sites having possible clandestine nuclear facilities must also be followed by inspection. Indeed we do not exclude that the need for further inspections can arise even as future ongoing monitoring and verification begin.
<P>A general shortcoming in Iraq's attitude has been the lack of full and explicit acceptance of the Council Resolutions 707 and 715. I fear this is an expression not only of reluctance but also of resistance which is incompatible with the binding nature of these resolutions. In raising this matter during his recent visit to the Government in Baghdad, the Chairman of the Special Commission, Ambassador Ekeus, was speaking not only for the Commission but also at the request of the IAEA. The Security Council's insistence on the matter is important not only as a question of the authority of the Council but as a matter that underlies the many specific points of non compliance that we noted. A detailed list of such points was prepared by the IAEA in document 8/23514, now supplemented by updated information in document 8/23687.
<P>While, as the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq said, the IAEA noted some improvement in the attitudes of the Iraqi authorities in the course of the recent IAEA inspections, lack of cooperation and non compliance still persist in the provision of information concerning sources of procurement of critical material and equipment. This information is of great significance since in many cases it is the only means for independent verification of the correctness of Iraqi statements and is basic to future monitoring. Further, the initial information needed to establish the future on going plan for monitoring and verification, required to be supplied by Iraq under Resolution 715, has been provided only in a partial and incomplete way. The Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq referred this morning to the readiness of his Government to cooperate to solve current difficulties. A statement by Iraq of readiness to provide procurement information and to complete information required under Resolution 715 would eliminate important hurdles.
<P>Mr. President, I now turn to the question of removal, destruction or rendering harmless of proscribed nuclear items. A large part of the Iraqi nuclear facilities, including most of the facilities known to us to have been used in the nuclear weapon development programme, were either fully destroyed or heavily damaged in the course of the Gulf War.
<P>This has been true in the case of:
<P>Tuwaitha, the main research and development centre of the Iraqi nuclear programme (total destruction of critical buildings);
<P>Tarmiya, the industrial complex for EMIS enriched uranium production (total destruction of some of the critical buildings);
<P>Ash Sharqat, the intended second site for EMIS industrial scale activities (total destruction of basic building);
<P>Al Jesirah, the large chemical complex, where the natural uranium feed material for enrichment activities was produced (total destruction);
<P>- Al Quaim, where uranium concentrates from indigenous uranium bearing phosphate ores were produced (total destruction of the uranium plant);
<P>In addition, by admission of the Iraqi authorities, a number of items such as components and equipment, were subsequently damaged or destroyed by the Iraqi military in an attempt to remove evidence of the clandestine nuclear programme. In spite of this extensive destruction there are still sites, facilities, equipment and materials which suffered little or no damage and therefore fall in the category of items requiring destruction, removal or rendering harmless under resolution 687.
<P>This is the case of the Al Atheer site, specifically designed for weaponization activities, and of some buildings in Tarmiya and Ash Sharqat. In addition some of the equipment, machine tools and materials with little or no repair or modification might be useful to Iraq should it seek to resurrect its nuclear weapons programme.
<P>The issue of destruction, removal and rendering harmless has been discussed at length between the IAEA and the Special Commission and we are agreed to implement these activities on the basis of a common approach.
<P>Progress to date in this area of destruction, removal or rendering harmless can be summarized as follows:
<P>  The removal of highly enriched uranium, suitable for direct use in nuclear weapons, has been given high priority. This material, in the form of fresh and irradiated fuel elements for the Iraqi research reactors has been in the custody of the Agency since the first inspection in May 1991; all the fresh fuel was removed from Iraq last November. Negotiations are being held with French and British companies to remove the remaining irradiated fuel for which adequate funding is still required;
<P>A large number of components of calutrons and ultracentrifuges relevant to the production of enriched uranium have been assembled and destroyed under the supervision of the Agency;
<P>Hot cells, glove boxes, remote handling manipulators and other equipment used in research activities for laboratory scale separation of plutonium from irradiated fuel have been destroyed or rendered harmless;
<P>Dedicated equipment and machine tools used in the manufacturing of these components have also been destroyed;
Dual use items i.e. equipment and machine tools which, in principle could be utilized in non prohibited as well as prohibited activities, are being inventoried and placed under Agency seal. The destruction or release of these items is being dealt with on a case by case basis. Obviously, release of any such items will only be made provided that there can be effective future monitoring of their agreed upon use;
<P>Buildings such as laboratories, plants and other facilities, where research and development, production or testing directly relevant to activities prohibited under resolution 687 were conducted, are currently being assessed for destruction. This is for instance the case of Al Atheer. A complete inventory of such facilities is being prepared. Any requests for use in non proscribed activities would have to be evaluated in the light of the possibility of effective monitoring of agreed upon use.
<P>Although the Agency has not so far met with resistance on the part of Iraq to its request for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of proscribed material, facilities or equipment, we are keenly aware that the Special Commission has encountered such resistance. The Security Council's support for the authority of the Commission and of the IAEA to determine what is to be destroyed, removed or rendered harmless and Iraq's corresponding duty to accept and to implement such requests is, therefore, much appreciated. The elimination of facilities and equipment that would be of use in a resurrection of the clandestine nuclear programme is clearly of great importance.
<P>Mr. President,
<P>Large facilities and large amounts of equipment required for the production of nuclear weapons usable material and nuclear weapons by Iraq have been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless. New facilities cannot easily be built without detection and the import or production of new relevant equipment will meet great obstacles. What certainly remains in Iraq, however, is a large number of highly trained scientists and engineers who were engaged in its nuclear programme. Information supplied to our inspection teams suggests that these people are currently engaged in the civilian reconstruction of the country. Needless to say, it is important that these highly qualified cadres remain engaged in non proscribed activities.
<P>Mr. President,
<P>It is essential that the measures prescribed by the Couneil for Iraq succeed, not only to allay fears about Iraq reviving a programme of weapons of mass destruetion, notably nuclear weapons, but also to demonstrate that international verification is a viable measure to create confidence. That experience is necessary if actions taken in Iraq are to represent steps towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, as envisaged in paragraph 14 of Resolution 687.
<P>The IAEA is committed to a successful implementation of the Council's resolutions on Iraq and looks to the Security Council for guidance and support in its effort to contribute to this result.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General to the UN Security Council on Inspections in Iraq</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>UN Security Council on Inspections in Iraq</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, NY, USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>23 November 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Mr. President,
<P>Under paragraph 13 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency was directed to carry out three tasks with a view to dismantling Iraq's nuclear capability:
<UL>
<LI>First, to identify through on-site inspections, Iraq's nuclear capabilities;
<LI>Second, to destroy, remove or render harmless all nuclear weapons, nuclear-weapons-usable material, any sub-systems or components, or any related research, development, support or manufacturing facilities;
<LI>Third, to develop and implement a plan for the future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the requirement not to acquire or develop a nuclear-weapon capability.
</UL>
Taken together, the implementation of these tasks and the completion of the necessary actions by Iraq, critically important in themselves, were seen as part of the steps towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  This makes the full and early implementation of these tasks, and the co-operation of Iraq all the more desirable.
<P>On 11 March of this year, I reported to the Council that after ten Agency inspection missions to Iraq much progress had been made in the first two tasks laid upon me by the Council, while implementation of the plan for long-term monitoring had not yet started.  Since March, five more Agency missions have taken place and considerable further investigative and other work has been carried out.  As a result important parts of the first two tasks have been fulfilled and the Agency has begun implementing elements of the third task - that of long-term monitoring and verification.
<P>The first task, the complete mapping of Iraq's nuclear capabilities, requires that we identify all Iraq's nuclear-relevant resources and the foreign sources of supply and technology.  In the course of the 15 missions undertaken to date in Iraq, our teams have visited more than 70 sites and gradually mapped a broadly-based secret nuclear programme aimed at the production of enriched uranium and at the development of nuclear weapon capabilities.  In the course of these inspection visits, the IAEA has held numerous discussions with the Iraqi authorities.
<P>Already in March I reported to the Council that a fairly consistent and coherent picture of Iraq's nuclear programme was emerging.  What we have seen and learnt since March has not modified that picture but added to it.  Although the picture is comprehensive and detailed, we cannot be certain that it is complete.  Iraq's unwillingness so far to reveal foreign sources of equipment, material and technology makes it difficult to ascertain whether all nuclear-related imported equipment and material has been identified.  New information, positively evaluated by the Special Commission and the Agency, could also point to sites which would require inspection - after designation by the Special Commission.  We therefore see a need for continued on-site inspection.
<P>Since March much work has been devoted by the Agency to the second task assigned to it, that of ensuring the destruction, removal or rendering harmless, as appropriate, of facilities and equipment related to the clandestine nuclear programme.  Key buildings, equipment and material have been destroyed or rendered harmless.  The installations at Al Atheer, Tarmiya and Ash Sharqat can no longer be used for the nuclear purposes for which they were intended.  The Iraqi authorities have actively co-operated in these operations under the direction of the IAEA inspection teams and we would expect that they would continue to be co-operative in these matters.
<P>The only  nuclear-weapons-usable material known to remain in Iraq at present is the highly enriched uranium in irradiated reactor fuel assemblies.  Removal of this material awaits conclusion of the necessary arrangements with recipient countries.  The material has been verified by the Agency's teams and is being kept under its control until it is removed.
<P>Mr. President,<BR>
The IAEA now has begun to phase in elements of the third task - the future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the Security Council resolution.  As may be concluded from my remarks, the steps taken are without prejudice to the continued investigative activities by the IAEA.
<P>The implementation of long-term monitoring meets some co-operation and also some resistance from the Iraqi side.  The Iraqi authorities continue to challenge the legitimacy of the plans approved by the Security Council under resolution 715.  It is of particular concern that the letter of 28 October 1992 addressed to the Secretary-General by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq (document S/24726) has restated Iraq's non-acceptance of resolutions 707 and 715 in strong terms.  I wish to reiterate the remarks I made last March before the Council that the lack of full and explicit acceptance of resolutions 707 and 715 ignores the binding nature of those resolutions.  It appears also to ignore Iraq's own explicit acceptance of resolution 687, which in paragraph 12 lays upon Iraq the obligation to accept the plan for the future ongoing monitoring and verification in the nuclear sphere.  Acceptance of resolutions 707 and 715 is essential in order to establish an effective and reliable system of ongoing monitoring and verification in Iraq.
<P>Mr. President, I must also report that the Iraqi authorities continue to delay their compliance with our repeated requests that they provide clear and complete information concerning the items which are to be reported to the Agency under the plan for future ongoing monitoring and verification.  They have still to provide information on all relevant items, including those which they have said were destroyed during and after the armed conflict, that is to say, all nuclear relevant items existing in Iraq as of 1 January 1989.  Iraq has only very recently indicated its readiness to submit before the end of this year information concerning all these items.
<P>Mr. President, while Iraq has provided much information to the IAEA under resolution 687, some on its own initiative, much prompted by discoveries made by the inspection teams, decisions have been taken at a political level in Iraq not to provide key procurement information.  This information is needed to dispel existing suspicions that more equipment and material may remain in Iraq than what has been identified.  These procurement data, which the Agency is now trying to acquire through the co-operation of a number of Governments, are needed to permit independent verification of the completeness of the disclosures made so far by the Iraqi authorities.  They are also needed to ensure that all nuclear relevant material, equipment and machine tools existing in Iraq are submitted to effective long-term monitoring.  Furthermore, data about past procurements may be critical to the establishment of a meaningful mechanism for import control, as called for in paragraph 7 of resolution 715 (1991).  Lastly, detailed information on the Iraqi procurement network would help to ensure that previous channels used to obtain proscribed items would not remain available to Iraq to resume prohibited programmes.  In the important area of procurement information there is no full, final and complete disclosure.  There is hardly any disclosure.
<P>Mr. President, <BR>
I must therefore report to the Security Council that I cannot conclude that Iraq has fully complied with its obligations under the relevant resolutions, as these resolutions relate to tasks laid upon the IAEA.<HR>

<P><HR><B>Introduction<BR></B>
<P>1992 marks the fiftieth anniversary of controlled nuclear fission and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the IAEA.
<P>The sustained, controlled chain reaction mastered by Enrico Fermi in early December 1942 in Chicago was an experiment that changed the world, creating both a new source of energy and a new source of destruction.  Ever since, mankind has had to face the dual challenge of the atom - how to preclude its military use and how to exploit its peaceful potential safely .  The IAEA has been assigned a major role by its member governments in both these regards.
<P>The two-pronged "Atoms for Peace" approach was chosen early whereby access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes was offered and undertakings regarding an exclusively peaceful use were simultaneously demanded.  Today the commitment to limit the use of fission to exclusively peaceful purposes is stronger and more widespread than ever and for the first time we may dare to hope for both a universal commitment to non-proliferation and drastic nuclear disarmament.  The creation of the IAEA in 1957 was an integral part of the efforts to realize the Atoms for Peace policy and to meet the dual challenge of the atom.
<P>The Agency's role to "promote" nuclear energy or - to use the terms of the Statute - to "accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world" is sometimes criticized.  It has been suggested that, whatever legitimate transfers of technology there might be, they could be taken over by other United Nations bodies, confining the Agency to what are termed "regulatory" functions - specifically nuclear safety and safeguards.  I submit that such surgery on the functions of the Agency would be unwise.  The Agency is there to serve all its Members and many of these see its greatest value precisely in "promotional" activities, notably in the transfer of technology.  Indeed, discussions and resolutions of the General Conference demonstrate convincingly that support for the Agency rests on the maintenance of an appropriate balance of activities.
<P>This is not, however, to suggest that the status quo is sacred and immutable.  After 35 years of operation it is by no means unreasonable to examine whether the Agency's programme mix responds to present priority interests of Members and - if need be - to adjust it to new circumstances.  An international organization is a living thing that must adapt to meet the challenges of a changing world.
<P>Thirty five years ago, governments' involvement in the nuclear field was mainly in research.  Today governments have many other interests in the nuclear sphere.  There is a large and mature nuclear power industry producing some 17% of the world's electricity.  There are major industrial suppliers building nuclear power plants and other nuclear equipment, and there are nuclear techniques routinely applied on a large scale in medicine, agriculture, industry.  The Agency must be available as an instrument which Members can employ to respond flexibly to emerging needs in a constantly changing world.  It is easy to see that the last 12 months have brought many changes which impact upon and may call for responses through the Agency.
<P>The agreements on rapid reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, and the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons help promote horizontal non-proliferation.  However, as security problems recede between the declared nuclear-weapon States, regional security problems - including nuclear-related ones - continue and need to be addressed.  The revelations by Agency inspections in Iraq under Security Council Resolution 687 have prompted not only a decision by the Council about the neutralization of a clandestine nuclear weapons development programme but also new thinking and action about safeguards verification.
<P>The emergence on the territory of the former Soviet Union of a number of States joining or about to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States drastically expands the area of non-proliferation - and the obligations of the Agency in the field of safeguards.  The same emancipation combined with changes in the political and economic systems lead to the recognition of urgent nuclear safety problems which must be addressed.  Here, too, the Agency and member governments are facing new challenges.  The cases of trafficking in nuclear material also place new demands of alertness on the IAEA.
<P>The list of changes which impact on our work can be made very long.  Let me only add the problems of environment and development, which were addressed at the global summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro last June.  Some of the outcome is directly relevant to the IAEA and we have highlighted this in an information document submitted to you.  There is in particular the question of defining the scope for nuclear power and nuclear applications to contribute to the twin goals of development and environmental protection.
<P>I would submit that the IAEA has shown itself to be a viable and versatile instrument.  We have seen this demonstrated at the time of the energy crisis, the Chernobyl crisis, the continuing environmental crisis and the Iraqi crisis.  The Agency must continue to be ready for new challenges.  And it must not be allowed to become paralysed by financial crisis.
<P>The Medium-Term Plan was an attempt to look systematically at the Agency's work and to define priorities for the 1993-98 period.  Even during this period new unexpected problems and challenges will arise and must be tackled.  It is rightly foreseen that the Medium-Term Plan should be periodically updated.  A large number of bodies exist which constantly monitor whether the Agency's various activities are responsive to Members' interests.  It is important in addition that the General Conference and Board watch the overall balance of the programme and take steps to adjust it, if changes seem needed.
<P>Let me mention some areas which governments may wish to examine:
<UL>
<LI>The first such area, nuclear safety, is already the subject of searching discussion but important questions remain to be addressed.  How extensive should a network of binding rules be?  What is the desired scope of the international safety convention?  How much use should be made of review services like OSARTs and ASSETs and what effect are they to have?
<LI>The safe disposal of radioactive waste in the crust of the earth from where the uranium once came is naturally of interest to present and future generations.  Should this interest be reflected in some binding international minimum standards?  Should there be an international register of all disposal sites, at least for high-level waste, so that there is one focal point where information about the location of all these sites is collected?
<LI>The way in which nuclear materials recovered from dismantled weapons is used, is of interest not only to weapon States.  The entire international community may wish to feel confident - through international verification - about the peaceful use or storage of this material.  Is this a role that the Agency should be asked to fulfil?
<LI>The stocks of plutonium will increase both from the dismantling of weapons and from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.  Should new international measures be taken to ensure and verify the peaceful use or storage of this material?  Should "international plutonium storage" again be on the agenda?
<LI>In a world of accelerated nuclear disarmament and of non-proliferation, do governments wish to examine the question of verified restrictions on the production of weapons-usable material?
</UL>
The general debate at this Conference offers an opportunity for governments to discuss whether issues and activities such as those which I have mentioned should be taken up - and, likewise, whether some other activities should be phased out.  As an introduction to your deliberations let me present an overview of some of the activities of the Agency.  I shall begin with the Agency's engagement in the transfer of nuclear technology and know-how.
<P>
<B>Transfer of Technology and Technical Co-operation</B>
<P>I have pointed to the importance which many of our Members attach to the transfer of nuclear technology and know-how.  I am glad to say there is not only attention, but also satisfaction.  A survey carried out in 1991 showed that national project counterparts in the field considered that the implementation of 95% of all projects should be rated as either excellent, good or reasonable.  Within this total 42% were in the category "excellent".  The two-year programming cycle, which in itself received overwhelming support, seems to have contributed to better project preparation.  Let me now add some specific points that I consider significant.
<P>First, a general precondition for all responsible transfer of nuclear technology is that there should be adequate safety, proper radiation protection and proper waste management.  These are not pro forma requirements, but statutory conditions that the Agency must take seriously to reduce to a minimum the risk of radiological accidents.  In fact nearly 20 percent of our TC programmes today are devoted to radiation protection and safety.  In addition, expert missions are sent to check conditions on the spot.
<P>Second, human resource development remains a major aim of the TC programme and a necessity for technology transfer.  This is particularly true in countries where nuclear technology is still in the early stages.  There is at present added emphasis on human resource development in African Member States, where a training survey is under way.
<P>Third, the introduction of a significant level of nuclear technology into industries in Asian countries with IAEA and UNDP assistance and extrabudgetary resources has been very successful.  A Regional Co-operation Agreement (RCA) project on industrial applications has helped convince emerging industries that applied nuclear technology could lead to industrial and commercial advances.  As a result of this project, investments of $190 million were generated, of which no less than $150 million was provided through the private sector.  I am glad to note that UNDP is now considering a new five-year proposal to build on these investments through a series of initiatives which will seek to introduce further nuclear applications to assist industry, with particular emphasis on the need for environmentally sustainable development.
<P>Fourth, irradiation of medical equipment for sterilization is already broadly practised.  Last week the Board of Governors endorsed a Draft Action Plan on "Assistance to Developing Countries in Introducing Commercial Food Irradiation", as suggested by India.  In the further work full co-operation with FAO and WHO and the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation (ICGFI) will be sought.
<P>Fifth, there is increasing interest in Agency assistance in the use of nuclear techniques for environmental monitoring purposes, an area in which the IAEA has much experience and capability.  Let me mention in passing that the Agency is the only body in the UN family to have a Marine Environment Laboratory, and its services are increasingly being used.  For instance, the Laboratory was instrumental in monitoring the environmental situation in the Persian Gulf after the armed conflict and it is now participating in a Norwegian-Russian investigation in the Barents and Kara Seas.  We are very grateful that the host authorities in Monaco have offered the Laboratory an excellent new home, which will further enhance its usefulness and capacity.
<P>Sixth, it should also be mentioned in this context that the Agency is giving increased assistance to Member States in Eastern Europe, which are operating WWER-type reactors to upgrade safety in plant management and in radioactive waste management.  It is fortunate that extrabudgetary resources have been forthcoming for this purpose so that the bulk of these new safety activities can continue to be met without drawing on resources needed for developing countries in other continents.
<P>Seventh, for the pursuit of activities such as these the financial health of the Agency's Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund is crucial.  The total value of the TC programme delivered in 1991 amounted to $43 million, having doubled in the last decade.  Now that a target for voluntary contributions to this fund has been agreed upon for the next three years, I must urge every Member State to meet the collective political commitment and pay its full share in timely fashion.
<P>Lastly, let me mention in this context that there are programmes for the transfer of technology partly or wholly outside the TC framework which are of direct importance to members in the developing world.  An example is the successful screwworm eradication campaign in Libya, which was financed by extrabudgetary contributions.  It has been calculated that the benefit to cost ratio of this project was 50 to 1.  Another example is the project examining the use of nuclear reactors for the desalination of water.  In all these subjects there is very substantial interest among governments.
<P>On the subject of water desalination, the economic assessment which has been carried out in compliance with General Conference resolutions has concluded that the use of nuclear energy for seawater desalination is technically feasible and in general economically competitive for medium to large cogenerating units producing electricity and steam for desalination.  The assessment has further concluded that large electricity-generating nuclear power plants which are integrated into the electricity supply system and which supply electricity to desalination plants at separate locations using the reverse osmosis process offer the most cost effective option.
<P>The increasing shortages of fresh water in many areas, not least on the Southern and Eastern shores of the Mediterranean, mean that attention will continue to be directed to desalination by nuclear power.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power</B>
<P>Let me now discuss some points regarding nuclear power, notably environmental aspects, economics, safety and waste disposal.
<P>The global summit in Rio last June was about environment and development.  There is no doubt that development will require the use of more energy, especially in developing countries, and that a dilemma is programmed in the circumstance that an increased use of fossil fuels, which is today's dominant energy source, would be on a collision course with the apparent need to reduce the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.  Although the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) set the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system, no agreement was reached on how this was to be done and no targets were adopted concerning CO2 or other greenhouse gas emissions.  The awareness is growing, however, that conservation and the exploitation of CO2-free renewable sources will not suffice to meet growing energy requirements.  There is also an awareness increasing that nuclear energy, though not a panacea, is one of the few options at the world's disposal for expanding energy production without significantly increasing CO2 emissions.  Nuclear power, alone, cannot solve the CO2 problem, but the CO2 problem cannot be solved without nuclear power.
<P>For a rational discussion of the world's energy options, comparisons of the economics,  health and environmental consequences of different energy sources will be important.  In a follow-up to the Helsinki Symposium in 1991 the Agency is seeking to stimulate a joint project on this subject involving a number of international organizations.  Here in Vienna we have created the group called the "Vienna Four", consisting of the IAEA, IIASA, UNIDO and OPEC - all strongly interested in energy questions.  This group has agreed to provide the Secretariat of the inter-agency project.
<P>While the environmental consequences of our energy/electricity sources are increasing in importance, the question of cost remains crucial.  Oil is not expected to be economically attractive as a fuel for electricity generation.  In contrast, gas is now being used increasingly, and its attraction seems to lie in its current capital cost advantage over oil and its environmental advantage over both oil and coal.  However, a question mark hangs over future gas prices.  Coal remains generally a competitive fuel for electricity generation and supplies are ample.  There is an increasing concern, however, about the extra CO2 emissions which it brings.
<P>Nuclear power will remain costly in the capital intensive construction phase.  This characteristic and the fact that it is technologically very demanding will make it less attractive to many capital-weak developing countries.  The world's ample uranium resources and their geographical spread are likely to make this fuel attractively priced and easily available, even with a much larger number of nuclear power plants.  Moreover, as nuclear power is a relatively young technology, it may be expected that many cost-saving features and designs are yet to come which will reduce the cost of construction and more than offset the costs which may be incurred for extra safety devices.  It can also be assumed that the regulatory process - which in some countries has led to prolonged and costly construction - will be streamlined.  A revival of the nuclear option in many industrialized countries where it is now dormant would render less problematic an increased use of fossil fuels by developing countries.  However, sight must not be lost of the need for simpler to operate, medium-sized nuclear power reactors for some developing countries - not least for the electricity needs of the growing number of huge cities in these countries.
<P>The nuclear option therefore remains important for the future.  In saying this, I am by no means underestimating the desirable contribution that can be made to the energy situation by conservation, and by solar, geothermal, wind and biomass energy sources.  But none of the renewable sources of energy is likely to make a real and substantial contribution for several decades.  The choice, particularly for large-volume, new base-load needs, will continue to be between fossil fuels and nuclear.  The outcome of this choice is not obvious.  It depends upon the actions of many people, governments and organizations, notably regarding safety in operation, in waste disposal and guarantees against the development of nuclear weapons.  It is to these issues and the Agency's involvement in them that I shall now turn.
<P><B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>Although nuclear safety has always been a part of the Agency's mandate, our programme in this area has grown sharply because so many of the actions which our member governments see as necessary in the area of safety are international in scope or character.
<P>"How safe is safe enough" is not a technical question but a political one.  The public answers it through movements, political parties and representative governments and the answers are influenced by people's perceived experience and feelings, opinion-formers, and political competition.  The technical data which expert bodies can contribute are by no means irrelevant to this process, but they are only a part of the input.
<P>There is no single answer to this question.  It varies from country to country and from time to time, but if one were to dare state some common line it would probably be that the level of nuclear safety must be such that no significant radiological releases occur to the biosphere.  If some releases occur or appear to occur or nearly occur, then nuclear activities in general are not deemed safe enough and calls come for freezes and phase-outs of nuclear power.
<P>Those engaged in nuclear work may often feel that this is an unduly harsh and somewhat irrational answer.  In particular, they may feel that, by comparison with other productive human activities, nuclear energy exploitation is required to have an excessively high safety standard.
<P>Comparisons are not irrelevant in the process through which the public and our political organs answer the question "how safe is safe enough".  It is our duty to present them, just as it is our duty to present factual data about nuclear incidents and about the risks of nuclear power and waste disposal.  The International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), to mention one example, has been a successful tool for presenting facts.  We must be aware, however, that as things stand the public is much less tolerant about anyone's health being affected by exposure to radiation than through coal mine accidents, the bursting of hydro dams, the explosion of gas cisterns or the burning of fossil fuels.  This knowledge about the public's answer to the question "how safe is safe enough" - whatever one may think of it - must form the point of departure for those who can influence the level of safety.
<P>The achievement of a desired higher level of safety is facilitated by certain factors and made more difficult by certain others.  It is facilitated by the fact that safety is never static.  We constantly learn and adjust.  The exchange of nuclear experience between operators and between countries is a very large activity and it results in learning and better safety.
<P>The achievement is complicated by the fact that the public is inclined to base its judgement of nuclear safety on worldwide performance.  Thus, the weakest performance - wherever it is - affects the judgement.  This is really the driving force behind the accelerated efforts that have been made in the last decade to advance from an international exchange of safety experience and compilations and codes of good practices to what is termed an "international nuclear safety culture" from which no country or nuclear activity will be exempted.  We see this most clearly illustrated in the efforts now being deployed to strengthen nuclear safety in Eastern and Central Europe.  Its level must be brought to a common international standard.  However, the increasing demand for minimum safety norms binding for all has to be reconciled with the diversity of national legal systems and local conditions.  Even more important, there is the need to ensure that national authorities remain fully responsible for safety.
<P>A new approach, currently evolving, is in the form of a nuclear safety convention containing norms which will become binding upon States which adhere to it.  The norms may develop through subsequent reviews and additions.  The main obligations currently considered are based in large measure on the principles contained in the recently developed "NUSSAG Safety Fundamentals".  Should the present momentum of preparatory work be maintained, which I hope will be the case, the convention might conceivably be ready by the time of the next General Conference.
<P>Another part of the response to the demand for more effective international measures to ensure an international safety culture lies in the various safety-related international expert reviews and peer reviews which are increasingly performed through the IAEA.  Such visits -whether OSARTs, ASSETs or others - have proved to be valuable to verify that nuclear authorities and facilities live up to a high international safety standard or, if need be, are advised and assisted on how to attain it.  A question which has not yet been answered is whether there should be some commitment to accept international review and advice teams periodically or otherwise.  The present system of visits upon invitation and against payment has the merit that visits are not requested as a matter of bureaucratic routine, but only if the service is felt to be needed and useful.  A drawback is that there is no guarantee that those installations which may best need an infusion of advice will receive visits.  I take it that in practice no Member would decline an advisory mission when one was suggested and good reasons were given for it.
<P>A comprehensive and complicated effort is now underway regarding safety in all types of power reactors in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern
and Central Europe.  The awareness has grown in these countries and outside them that these reactors and their operation have certain deficiencies,
some being design deficiencies, some operational deficiencies, and some manufacturing deficiencies.  The shortcomings vary with the type of reactor,
its age or generation and the country it operates in.
<P>Judgements have to be made as to how much backfitting can be made economically and when and at what stage the phasing out of some
reactors may be feasible.  As nuclear-generated electricity constitutes 12% of overall Russian electricity production and is up to 60% in some regions
like the Kola peninsula, the question of phasing out is not an easy one.  It seems clear that no more plants of the RBMK type will be built, but it is not
equally clear how long this type will remain in operation - with added safety features.
<P>While a major interest exists in many industrialized countries in mounting an assistance effort, we must not ignore the fact that the most
knowledgeable expertise on the types of nuclear power plants I am discussing is to be found in the countries which designed and operate these
reactors.  The effort must be one of co-operation in common interest and recognizing the economically precarious situation.
<P>The international effort is being mounted largely outside the mechanisms for intergovernmental co-operation which the IAEA offers.  There is,
above all, co-operation between Russia and other Eastern and Central European countries on the one side and individual industrialized countries or
groups of them on the other.  The chief mechanism created for co-ordination is through the so-called Group of 24, assisted by a Secretariat located in
the CEC.  The IAEA is invited to participate in this work with technical advice.  It also provides its own co-operation assistance to the East and Central
European countries, which is largely financed by extrabudgetary contributions and which aims, for instance, at providing a safety review of the RBMK
type of reactor.  Part of the Agency's contribution to the diagnostic phase will be in the shape of expert missions to individual reactors.
<P>A question of particular importance is assistance in creating or strengthening regulatory authorities.  In view of the existence of IAEA
guidelines relating to the work of such authorities, it is desirable that this assistance take place in a manner that pays full attention to the existing
guidelines.  The best way to achieve this would be through full participation of Agency representatives in the work.
<P>Before I leave the subject of nuclear safety I must briefly report on two related items:  liability and physical protection.  The conventions which
exist in these areas are part of the growing international legislative framework for nuclear activities.
<P>Efforts to strengthen the nuclear liability regime have resulted in concrete progress.  The Joint Protocol to the Vienna and Paris Conventions,
adopted in 1988, entered into force on 27 April of this year with ten Member States Party to it.  This means an improvement in the international liability
regime since the two basic conventions existing in the field of civil liability are in effect combined into one expanded regime.
<P>Furthermore, the work of the Standing Committee on Nuclear Liability has advanced.  In the context of the revision of the Vienna Convention,
a number of draft amendments have been provisionally agreed upon, which embrace many aspects where need for improvement was recognized.  On
supplementary compensation, the Committee has made progress in reducing the number of remaining alternatives.  As there are certain elements
common to the alternatives, it seems that there are good prospects for agreement.
<P>As far as the time schedule for future work is concerned, I note the view of the Standing Committee that efforts should be intensified in order
to expedite consensus-building so that a revision conference could be convened in the near future.
<P>It seems that the work can best be accomplished if the issues of the revision of the Vienna Convention and the development of a system of
supplementary compensation continue to be dealt with in conjunction with each other because it is difficult to obtain satisfactory results on one without
parallel progress on the other.
<P>The question of State liability appears to require more effort, in view of the existing fundamental differences.  Therefore, at this stage, attention
to this issue should be balanced with the task of completing consideration of the other issues within the planned timeframe.  It is understood, of
course, that some form of compensation from public funds would be considered within a system of supplementary compensation.
<P>Next week a review conference on the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material will be held.  It is to review not only the
implementation of the Convention but also its adequacy.  It is hoped that, as a result of the Conference, more States will take action to become parties
to the Convention.
<P><B>Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste</B>
<P>The question "how safe is safe enough" applies also to safety of nuclear waste.  Again the answer is political rather than technical and it is
given in the last instance by the public.  In a way this question is more difficult than the question of safety in nuclear power plants, because while in the
latter tangible improvements can be achieved, especially in some geographical areas, the technical experts generally will say that the solutions now
available for the long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste are fully adequate and that it is the public's resistance to the use of almost any site
for waste disposal that is the major problem.
<P>Information, explanation, patience, selection of appropriate sites, construction of proper installations for nuclear waste disposal and
responsible use of them over a period of time are likely to bring public confidence and acceptance - as we are in fact seeing in the case of some
installations for low and intermediate level waste.
<P>There are, however, some things that can and should be done.  At the level of individual States any past disposal of nuclear waste which was
not done at a responsible safety level must be cleaned up.  This applies in particular to waste from military nuclear activities in nuclear-weapon States.
To the public of today and to succeeding generations it does not really matter whether waste results from military or peaceful nuclear activities.
<P>A case in point is the dumping of radioactive materials, including reactor cores in the Barents and Kara Seas.  A Russian-Norwegian
investigation with participation of the IAEA Laboratory in Monaco has been underway in this matter.  As the IAEA is designated by the London
Dumping Convention as the competent international technical authority as regards the dumping of radioactive wastes at sea, our participation in this
fact-finding mission was both appropriate and necessary.
<P>At the international level, the establishment of safety standards regarding radioactive waste disposal and international expert missions to
promote the implementation of such norms through review and advice would be of help to assure the public that this area too is all part of the
international safety culture.
<P>International or regional efforts must also be made to promote the safe disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive wastes, e.g. from
medical activities.  These are now sometimes inadequately provided for.
<P>The Agency's main action so far in these fields has been to develop the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards - RADWASS - programme,
which provides Member States with a comprehensive series of internationally agreed documents to complement or form the basis of national
standards and criteria.
<P>Good progress has been made since work on the RADWASS programme started in 1991.  The first Safety Guides and Safety Practices in the
programme have been or will be submitted for publication in 1992.  Furthermore, in 1993 the Safety Fundamentals document and four Safety
Standards are planned to be submitted to Member States for review and approval.
<P>RADWASS will continue to be the main focal point of the Agency's Waste Management efforts, and Phase I of the programme is scheduled to
be completed by the end of 1994.
<P>In the waste disposal field as it is in the field of operational safety the best international approach is probably to offer advisory and/or peer
review services rather than supervision.  It does not impinge on the authority and responsibility of national institutions but may help to strengthen their
hand.
<P>For quite some time the Agency has been sending WAMAP missions to developing countries to advise on waste management and disposal.
We have now also begun to send advisory missions on the long-term storage of spent fuel from nuclear power reactors and/or research reactors.  The
first went to China in 1990, another to Hungary this year, and we have a request from Ukraine pending.  In the programme for 1993-94, the Agency
will offer this service on a regular basis in a technical co-operation programme called IFMAP - Irradiated Fuel Management Programme.
<P><B>The Case of Iraq</B>
<P>The revelation through IAEA inspection that Iraq - a party to the NPT and to a full-scope safeguards agreement - was engaged in a major,
secret programme to enrich uranium and to design a nuclear weapon and that Iraq had disregarded the safeguards agreement with the Agency by
successfully withholding information which should have been declared has led the Agency to a major effort to strengthen the safeguards system.
<P>Under Resolutions 687, 707 and 715 the IAEA was given three very substantial assignments by the Security Council as part of the United
Nations security system:
<UL>
<LI>The charting of Iraq's present and past nuclear activities;
<LI>The removal, destruction or rendering harmless, as appropriate, of materials, equipment and facilities used by Iraq in activities prohibited
under Resolution 687; and
<LI>The preparation and implementation of a long-term monitoring plan to verify Iraq's compliance with the requirements of relevant Security
Council resolutions.
</UL>
Fourteen IAEA on-site inspections have been conducted in Iraq since May 1991, with the assistance and co-operation of the Special
Commission of the United Nations.  More than 2700 inspection days have been carried out in Iraq.  Sixty-five sites have been inspected, most of them
several times, and many hundred samples of different nature, collected by the Agency's inspectors in Iraq, have been analysed by the Agency
Laboratory in Seibersdorf.  Over fifty thousand pages of documents in Arabic, taken by inspectors in Iraq, have been scrutinized and have provided
confirmation of the dimensions and objectives of the Iraqi clandestine nuclear programme revealed by on-site inspections.
<P>The picture emerging is that of a widely-based, well-funded, multipronged approach to the production of highly enriched uranium, combined
with a parallel programme to assess the requirements and make the necessary preparations for designing and manufacturing a nuclear weapon.  This
comprehensive project was secret.  Procurement from abroad of sensitive materials, equipment and technology was made through an elaborate
network of Iraqi-owned front companies in Europe and overseas.  In addition to Tuwaitha, the major Iraqi nuclear research centre, production facilities
had been established at Al Qaim (production of uranium concentrate), Al Jesira (uranium purification and uranium compounds), Tarmiya and Ash
Sharqat (electromagnetic enrichment of uranium isotopes), the Al Furat project site (centrifuge manufacturing) and Al Atheer-Hatteen, identified by the
Agency as the intended site for weaponization activities.
<P>The process of removal, destruction or rendering harmless of Iraqi nuclear-weapon capabilities under resolution 687 started in October last
year and has continued throughout recent months.  All of the highly enriched uranium contained in fresh reactor fuel has been removed from Iraq,
processed and diluted to less than 20% in U-235.  Negotiations are taking place about the removal of additional quantities of HEU contained in
irradiated fuel.  All identified calutron and centrifuge components and large stocks of materials intended for the manufacturing of centrifuges have been
destroyed.  Key buildings and heavy equipment of the sites of Al Atheer-Hatteen, Tarmiya and Ash Sharqat, linked to the weapons-related
programme, have been destroyed.
<P>On 11 October 1991 the Security Council adopted Resolution 715 approving inter alia the plan submitted by the Agency for future ongoing
monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with paragraph 12 of Resolution 687 and with the requirements of paragraphs 3 and 5 of Resolution
707.  In June 1992 Iraqi authorities provided the Agency with what they consider the full, final and complete description of their nuclear programme
and promised to update and complete a detailed list of facilities and equipment related to their nuclear programme.  This will be of use to the Agency in
completing its preparations for the full implementation of the long-term plan.
<P>The Agency's work under the three parts of the Security Council mandate is therefore continuing.  Through our inspections and the arduous
work by our Action Team, under the skilled, persevering and hard-working leadership of Professor Zifferero, a relatively consistent picture of Iraq's
clandestine nuclear programme is emerging.  However, details of varying degrees of importance are still missing and I trust will be added, e.g. full
information about procurement and technical expert assistance.
<P>The degree of Iraqi co-operation has varied - from zero or worse to helpful information and co-operation in the destruction of important
facilities.  It is a sad fact that while it takes time to build up credibility, it can be lost overnight.  Thus, although much information given by Iraq has
proved correct and useful, it is not relied upon without independent verification.  Even though at present there are diminishing returns of new data
through inspections and the Iraqi counterparts assure us that no more is to be found, we cannot exclude the possibility that some new information will
prompt further investigative inspections side by side with our long-term monitoring which must give the fullest guarantees that no clandestine nuclear
activities will be revived.
<P><B>The Strengthening of Safeguards</B>
<P>The safeguards system was designed to provide assurance that nuclear material and installations subject to safeguards are used for
exclusively peaceful purposes and are fully accounted for.  This assurance has important consequences for relations between States at the regional
and global levels as well as for nuclear trade.
<P>Under the safeguards system all the States party to the system accept to co-operate with and be open to the Agency in a number of stipulated
matters.  Through this institutionalized transparency, the Agency is to be enabled to verify the exclusively peaceful use of programmes, installations
and material subject to safeguards.  The case of Iraq demonstrated that nuclear activities which should have been declared but were kept secret,
could go undetected by the safeguards system as it was designed.  It was concluded that the Agency needs other sources of information notably in
case the information required from a State is withheld and that in certain circumstances the Agency may need to perform special inspections at non-
declared sites.
<P>I am pleased to report that over the past year the Board has taken several steps to strengthen the information basis of the safeguards system
and affirmed the Agency's right to conduct special inspections under the terms of comprehensive safeguards agreements.  Should a Member State
having such an agreement deny such a request, the Director General may submit the matter to the Board.  If the Board so decided, the matter could
go to the Security Council.  The Board also decided that the requirement in safeguards agreements to provide design information on nuclear facilities
"as early as possible" includes the requirement that preliminary information shall be provided as soon as a decision has been taken to construct a new
facility or to modify an existing facility.  Member States have been informed of the Board's decision and existing subsidiary arrangements are currently
being renegotiated to bring them in line with this decision.
<P>The Board has also considered the question of establishing a universal reporting system on the export and import of nuclear material and
relevant equipment and certain non-nuclear material and it will continue its examination of that question.  For the time being, the Board has indicated
that States which are in a position to do so may start reporting to the Agency on these items on a voluntary basis.  The Secretariat has informed all
Member States of that decision and is in the process of setting up the system.
<P>The combination of measures to strengthen the information basis of the safeguards system and its inspection range should considerably
reduce the risk of any undeclared activity that should have been declared going undetected.  This capacity of the Agency will be of increasing
importance in a world where accelerated nuclear disarmament and extended adherence to non-proliferation commitments call for highly reliable
safeguards.
<P>It is of course open to States to practise greater nuclear transparency than expressly required under safeguards agreements.  These
agreements establish a minimum, not a maximum, and it may well be in the interest of many States to practise a much greater degree of openness
about their nuclear programmes.  In the past year I have received with appreciation commitments by several States to open any site and any
installation to Agency visits - regardless of whether these sites and installations are covered by safeguards.  In some instances the Agency has made
use of such commitments.  For confidence building they are of high value - provided that they are fully accepted in practice.
<P>Let me conclude my comments on the safeguards system by reporting that efforts are underway to make safeguards not only more effective
but also more cost-effective.  This is by no means a new idea.  Over the past few years the Secretariat has been able to cut safeguards costs
significantly.  Some new savings have been achieved this year and have had an impact on the draft budget before you for 1993.  Some others have
been very actively discussed and will be the subject of close examination by outside experts in SAGSI - the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards
Implementation.
<P><B>Safeguards Implementation</B>
<P>Two important new safeguards agreements are now being implemented.  Following the agreement of 16 September 1991 with South Africa
and the submission of its initial report on 30 September 1991, the Secretariat has carried out a total of 77 inspections of South African facilities and
locations outside declared facilities.  We have carried out an extensive audit of historical operating and accounting records of selected facilities and
have performed a large number of destructive and non-destructive analyses.  In addition, significant progress has been made in the negotiation of the
subsidiary arrangements to the Agreement.
<P>There is an inherent difficulty in verifying the completeness of an original inventory in a country in which a substantial nuclear programme has
been going on for a long time.  It requires much effort both by the inspectorate and much openness and co-operation by the inspected party -
extending beyond declared facilities and current records.  Even so, as the Agency is to report what it has actually seen and verified it is hard, even in
the best case, to come to any better conclusion than that after intense analysis and inspection no evidence has been found suggesting that the original
inventory is not complete.  This conclusion you will find in para. 31 of the report on South Africa in document GOV/2609.
<P>Only a few months have passed since the Democratic People's Republic of Korea submitted its initial report on nuclear material subject to
safeguards on 4 May 1992.  We are thus in the early stage, but here, too, much verification work has already been achieved through three ad hoc
inspections, the third finishing only a week and a half ago.  Work on subsidiary arrangements and facility attachments has also progressed quickly with
good co-operation from DPRK.  The General Part of the Subsidiary Arrangements entered into force on 10 July and three Facility attachments are
operative.
<P>Like South Africa, DPRK has offered the Agency some original operating records and offered Agency officials to visit any place and facility
regardless of whether they are on the original inventory.  This commitment is helpful and is being made use of.
<P><B>Safeguards and Non-Proliferation</B>
<P>	The past twelve months have seen significant advances in the non-proliferation field.  Two nuclear-weapon States - China and France - have
adhered to the NPT which thereby has all five recognized nuclear-weapon States as parties.
<P>Through the agreement between Argentina and Brazil on a joint accounting and control system and a full-scope safeguards agreement with
the IAEA the prospect for bringing the Tlatelolco Treaty fully into force increased greatly.  Recently, a number of amendments to Articles of the
Tlatelolco Treaty were unanimously adopted at a conference in Mexico.  These amendments reinforce the role of the IAEA.  It is hoped that the Treaty,
with these amendments, can come fully into force for all countries in the region at an early date.
<P><B>Safeguards in the Middle East</B>
<P>As regards safeguards in the Middle East, last year's General Conference resolution requested the Director General "to take such measures
as are necessary to facilitate an early application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East, and in particular to
prepare a model agreement taking into account the views of the States in the region, as a necessary step towards the creation of a nuclear-weapon-
free zone".
<P>As you can see from the report contained in document GC(XXXVI)/1019, I have continued my consultations with States of the region.  I intend
to intensify these efforts.
<P>The report also contains an inventory of undertakings that could be incorporated in a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and a
number of verification modalities that could be applied.  I intend to seek the views of the States of the region on these undertakings and modalities.  A
model safeguards verification agreement can be drafted when the States concerned have formed views on the substantive obligations which are to be
verified.  As many modalities can be contemplated and the Agency's experience is extensive, the Agency could offer seminars in which interested
States may share the Agency's wide experience in this area.
<P><B>Extension of NPT</B>
<P>	In 1995 the extension of the NPT is to be considered.  If present trends in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation commitments continue,
the outlook will be for a successful conference.  The IAEA is prepared to undertake such preparatory analytical work as governments request.  A
strengthened safeguards regime and effective channels for the transfer of nuclear techniques and know-how are contributions that the Agency must
offer.  An extension of the Treaty must be coupled with increased confidence that observance of the commitments entered into under the Treaty is
being reliably verified.
<P><B>Financial situation and budget for 1993</B>
<P>Let me conclude this statement with some comments on the Agency's financial situation and the budget.
<P>With considerable difficulty the Board of Governors last June reached a consensus recommending a draft budget.  Modest increases in the
area of Safeguards and in Nuclear Safety were largely offset by reductions in other programmes, in particular Nuclear Power
and the Fuel Cycle.  The modest growth in the Agency's Regular Budget in real terms amounts to $1.5 million, or just 0.8%, for 1993.
<P>The increase in the Agency's Regular Budget, however small, is welcome, but would be of an almost purely theoretical interest if the shortfalls
in Member States' contributions were to continue.  Prolonged shortfalls in payments by major contributors inevitably have a very negative effect on the
Agency's ability to implement its approved programme.  Indeed, during the past year, we have had first-hand experience of the disruptive impact on
Agency programmes that results when a major contributor is forced to suspend payment to the Agency.
<P>At last week's Board of Governors meeting, we heard the Governor of the Russian Federation announce a plan to resume payments to the
Agency.  Also, several other members announced that arrears had been paid or made commitments to do so.  These are very welcome developments
and will allow us vigorously to address the important challenges facing the Agency.  Let me therefore conclude by reiterating my plea to all Member
States to pay their contributions in a timely fashion.<HR>

<TITLE>Statement of IAEA Director General  to the 47th Session of the UN General Assembly</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General  to the 47th Session of the UN General Assembly</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>47th Session of the UN General Assembly</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, NY, USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>21 October 1992</H4>
<P><HR>In December this year the 50th anniversary of the world's first controlled nuclear chain reaction will be celebrated.  The brilliant scientific feat of Enrico Fermi in Chicago has left a deep imprint on the world ever since.  The development to which his discovery gave rise raised hopes at one stage for electricity generation "too cheap to meter".  Later, it raised fears of the very extinction of humanity.
<P>For five decades we have lived with the dual challenge of preventing the use of the atom for weapons and of exploiting its many peaceful uses.  For most of its existence the UN has been inhibited in its actions by a cold war stalemate, the essence of which was an ever spiralling nuclear arms race.
<P>The IAEA was established 35 years ago to promote the peaceful uses of the atom for development and to verify that commitments to exclusively peaceful uses were respected.  This has been in no small measure a successful operation, part of the reason being that the IAEA has had a high degree of practical East/West co-operation despite the cold war.  The intergovernmental activities pursued in and through the IAEA have contributed to the evolution and worldwide use of a broad range of nuclear applications, including nuclear power plants generating some 17% of the world's electricity.  The activities of the IAEA have also constituted an important part of the international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
<P>The dual challenge which was presented by President Eisenhower in his Atoms for Peace speech before the United Nations General Assembly in 1953 is still valid.  Last month the General Conference of the IAEA left no doubt that it wished the Agency to meet vigorously both challenges.  It urged the Agency to continue promoting the use of nuclear technology, inter alia through work in the fields of nuclear safety and waste disposal and through the dissemination of numerous nuclear techniques in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry.  At the same time it welcomed the various measures taken in the past year to strengthen the IAEA's safeguards system as a part of the challenge to reduce the risk of a further spread of nuclear weapons.  When in my report today I devote the largest part to safeguards and non-proliferation it is because so much new has occurred in this area in the past year - not because larger resources or efforts have been devoted to it than to the promotion of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy.
<P>Thus, the two challenges of the early days of nuclear energy remain, but today's world is drastically different from that of the 1950s.  Most importantly, we are moving into a world where at long last less resources will be used for military purposes, including nuclear arsenals - a development that favours non-proliferation.  On the other hand many new serious problems now face humanity.  One of them, which has a bearing on nuclear power, is the need for a growing energy production at a time when there is increasing concern about the effects upon the global climate of emissions of greenhouse gases, notably the carbon dioxide emissions which are associated with the use of all fossil fuels.  I shall revert to this issue later.  At this point I should like to address the issue of non-proliferation and the IAEA's role in the efforts to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.
<P>Today the risk of military conflict between the great powers is rapidly receding and the consequences in the form of disarmament, including accelerated nuclear disarmament, are as visible as they are welcome.  The easier co-operation between the great powers is also helping to settle many long-standing local or regional conflicts.  This new climate as well as the process of democratization in a number of countries are factors which favour non-proliferation.  Let me cite some significant developments.
<P>Argentina and Brazil have decided to open all their nuclear installations to IAEA inspection and, following the recent adoption of some amendments, there is a very good chance that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Tlatelolco Treaty) will come into force and make the whole of Latin America a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
<P>South Africa has joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the IAEA has been invited to inspect all nuclear installations in the country.  In this new climate African States are renewing efforts to draft a treaty making Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has concluded the safeguards agreement required of it under the NPT and the first inspections have taken place.  China and France have joined the NPT, so that the Treaty is now supported by all declared nuclear-weapon States.
<P>In the Middle East there is new hope that peace talks will lead to agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone or a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  At the General Conference of the IAEA last month a resolution was adopted without a vote noting the consensus support for such a concept and calling upon the Director General of the IAEA to continue consultations with governments in the region and work on a model for safeguards verification.  I shall do so.
<P>A new wave of accessions to the NPT is coming or expected to come from States that formerly were parts of the Soviet Union:  the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belarus, etc.  The IAEA is in contact with several of them in order to prepare for the application of IAEA safeguards.
<P>All this augurs well for a successful conference in 1995 to extend the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  However, some other elements would be of signal importance for achieving a universal commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States to non-proliferation and an unlimited extension of the NPT.  An agreement through which a date for the cessation of all nuclear testing was accepted by all nuclear-weapon States would be such an element.  It would signal that the world would no longer try out new and "better" nuclear weapons.  
<P>Another highly positive element would be an agreement on a cut-off of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes.  Such an agreement would seem logical in a world moving toward nuclear disarmament - and perhaps not very burdensome in view of the difficulties which exist today in disposing of surplus weapons-grade material.
<P>The foregoing considerations may seem too optimistic.  Yet, at no time since disarmament talks began has the political climate seemed more favourable than now for far-reaching agreements.
<P>The safeguards system which the IAEA has now been operating for over 25 years was the world's first on-site inspection system.  It has great merits, but also limitations.  I shall discuss both and I will begin with some thoughts on the potential further use of the system in the context of nuclear disarmament.
<P>Given adequate resources, IAEA safeguards could be employed to verify the peaceful storage or use of fissionable material that is recovered from the dismantling of nuclear weapons, if the world wants international assurances that such material is not going into new weapons.
<P>A cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons purposes could also be verified by international safeguards.  The safeguarding of enrichment and reprocessing plants, though a difficult task, is a problem to which much international work has already been devoted and a task which is already one of the IAEA's duties.
<P>There could also be renewed consideration of the concept of a so-called international plutonium storage - i.e. arrangements under which the growing quantities of separated plutonium from the peaceful cycle and quantities of plutonium expected from dismantled weapons would be subjected to special controls, which would give additional assurances concerning non-diversion and an exclusively peaceful use.  The Statute of the IAEA envisages a function of this kind for the organization.
<P>While the IAEA's safeguards system is a resource that could be more extensively used by the international community, its limitations, too, must be considered - and remedied.  In a world of fewer weapons there needs to be great confidence that no State is violating commitments and secretly producing fissionable material for weapons or, indeed, making new nuclear weapons.
<P>The case of Iraq showed that it was possible in a very closed and controlled society to mount a sizeable secret effort for the enrichment of uranium and weapons development without this being detected by the safeguards system.  What can and what is being done to minimize the risk of the same happening again in the future?  Public discussion often focusses on forceful inspections.  While these are important, it must be recognized that information on where and what to inspect is the first and basic requirement.
<P>It is not possible for inspectors to visit and examine every building and basement in a foreign country, and random visits will not help very much.  Inspectors must have access to information leading them to sites and installations of possible interest.  In the case of post-war inspections in Iraq relevant information about sites has been obtained through the UN Special Commission from governments.  In the strengthened safeguards system now taking 
<P>shape in the IAEA, the information provided by the inspected State will be supplemented by other data, e.g. from other States concerning the export and import of nuclear material and certain types of equipment.  Had such data regarding Iraq been available to the IAEA and analysed, it is probable that special explanations and visits would have been requested by the Agency.  Any data, whether obtained by the IAEA through its analysis of declared nuclear activities or from external sources, must evidently be critically analysed and assessed to avoid unnecessary suspicions and false alarms.
<P>It must be recognized that there is a special difficulty in verifying the completeness of a nuclear inventory when the IAEA is given this task in respect of a nuclear programme which has been going on in the territory of a State for a long time and has attained a certain size - as is at present the case in South Africa and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and as will be the case in some countries which were part of the Soviet Union.
<P>In the case of South Africa the General Assembly has requested the Director General of the IAEA (A/RES/46/34A) to report on the completeness of the inventory of South Africa's nuclear installations and material.  The Agency has carried out a large number of inspections of South African facilities, and locations outside declared facilities.  It has carried out an extensive audit of historical operating and accounting records and performed a large number of analyses.  With the co-operation of the South African authorities, IAEA inspectors have been able to visit all the sites they asked to see - declared or not declared, military or civilian - and they have found no evidence that the inventory is incomplete.  Nor is the IAEA in possession of any other information suggesting the existence of any undeclared facilities or nuclear material.  Naturally, if relevant information were obtained suggesting the need for access to additional facilities, locations or data, the Agency would request such access.  The report of the Agency on this matter (GC(XXXVI)/1015) has been transmitted to the United Nations.
<P>A problem similar to the one I have described regarding South Africa is encountered in the verification of the initial inventory presented by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the safeguards agreement which entered into force on 10 April this year.  Here only three inspection missions have been performed so far and much work remains.  Certain steps taken by the DPRK have facilitated the task.  Some original historical operating records have been provided for examination and analysis.  Also - as in the case of South Africa - the Agency has been given a standing invitation to send officials to sites and installations regardless of whether they are included in the initial DPRK declaration.  Such invitations, if lived up to in practice, are, of course, useful.  The DPRK has co-operated with us in organizing a visit by IAEA officials in September, and I expect prompt assistance will be offered in connection with a further visit.  Over time, the acceptance of such visits and openness, and assistance to them will help to create a record of co-operation and transparency.
<P>A right of unimpeded access for inspectors to relevant sites and material is certainly of crucial importance when information is available suggesting the need for inspection of specific sites.  In the case of inspections in Iraq, the United Nations and the IAEA have obtained the right of unimpeded access under Security Council resolution 687 and an exchange of letters of 14 May 1991, between the Secretary-General and the Foreign Minister of Iraq.  This right relates to any sites, installations, equipment, persons or documents.  In the case of routine IAEA safeguards inspections, rules exist which allow a recipient State to reject inspector designations and to subject the visit of inspectors to visa requirements.  Once a designation has been accepted or a visa issued, however, there is a right to visit.  I have repeatedly urged that these restrictions should be eliminated and that all Agency inspectors should be accepted as the international civil servants which they are and that they should be exempt from visa requirements and be allowed entry on the basis of a UN laissez-passer and a certificate indicating that they are coming on inspection duty.  Some progress has been made toward abolishing visa requirements or issuing multiple visas or accepting inspectors without a special designation procedure, but much remains to be done to facilitate inspections.
<P>In the past year the Board of Governors of the IAEA has confirmed the right of the Agency to perform special inspections when there are reasons to believe that installations or material which should have been declared have not been so declared.  No use has yet been made of this right.
<P>There is no doubt that in the case of Iraq the readiness of the Security Council to support the right of unimpeded inspection has been of great importance.  It is reassuring that, in the summit statement of 31 January 1992, the Council emphasized the integral role in the implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty of fully effective IAEA safeguards and that the members of the Council declared that they "will take appropriate measures in the case of any violations notified to them by the IAEA".  The relationship agreement of 14 November 1957 between the United Nations and the IAEA contains rules allowing prompt interaction between the United Nations, including the Security Council, and the IAEA.  Any denials of access for inspection or any other apparent violations could speedily be placed before the Council.
<P>In the case of Iraq the IAEA has now performed 14 inspection missions, on which reports have been submitted to the Security Council through the Secretary-General.  In response to the first task laid down by the Council, that of mapping Iraq's nuclear programme, the Agency has been able over the past year to put together a picture that is relatively consistent and coherent.  However, as the Iraqi authorities have refused to provide information on sources of foreign procurement and foreign technical advice, there could still be missing elements in the picture.  Inspections must continue of any sites or objects that may be designated by the United Nations Special Commission on the basis of new information that may become available to it.  Some elements of the long-term monitoring have already been phased in - side by side with investigative inspections.  Considering that Iraq's scientific and technical knowledge remains largely intact, such monitoring is clearly of great importance, the more so as the clandestine procurement network is still in place.
<P>It must be kept in mind, on the other hand, that the vast infrastructure needed for any revival of a prohibited programme for the production of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material has been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless - reservation being made for the possible continued existence of undetected installations.
<P>Mr. President, I turn now to the other side of the nuclear challenge, that of exploiting the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology for development in medicine, agriculture and industry.  While at the time of Enrico Fermi's experiment in Chicago 50 years ago "nuclear" mainly meant research and science, the practical applications are now many and significant.  Let me give a few examples.  Today 17% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power reactors - slightly less than the 20% that comes from hydro power.  Today every third patient in industrialized countries is examined or treated by some nuclear-related method.  Today, the cotton crop in Pakistan and the rice crop in Indonesia have been greatly boosted by the use of suitable mutagens, i.e. new strains produced through mutations induced by irradiating seeds.  Today, nuclear methods are used in animal husbandry to measure the efficiency of protein uptake from various locally available foodstuffs.  Based on such measurements, optimum combinations of local feeding materials for buffaloes have been introduced in India and Indonesia which has led to a dramatic increase in buffalo milk and meat production.
<P>I shall not prolong this list of examples of nuclear techniques which help to maintain or restore health, boost industrial production and promote the production and preservation of food.  I should underline, however, in view of the expectations of the Rio Conference on Environment and Development that all organizations in the UN family should contribute to the fulfilment of the Agenda 21, that nuclear techniques have a remarkably wide use not only in development but also in the monitoring and protection of the environment.  Let me give two examples:
<P>Isotopes are a powerful tool in the fight against groundwater and soil contamination through excessive use of fertilizers.  They allow precise measurement of the amount of fertilizer that goes into the plant, so that the most appropriate fertilizer regime can be established for any particular agronomic system.  Similarly, nuclear techniques allow the determination of the amount of nitrogen which different crop plants obtain from the soil.  This has not only led to the development of better fertilizer strategies, but also helped in the selection of the most efficient nitrogen-fixing plant varieties within each species, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizer to the benefit of the environment and the economy of the countries involved.
<P>Most controversial - but also most interesting - is the question of how helpful nuclear power is and could be in generating the increasing amounts of electricity which the world will need without emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and thereby contributing to a possible global warming.
<P>The Framework Convention on Climate Change which was signed at Rio seeks to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, but does not prescribe how this is to be done or set any targets concerning CO2 emissions or other greenhouse gas emissions.  There is no doubt that global development will require the use of more energy, especially electricity, and that a dilemma is inherent in the circumstance that an increased use of fossil fuels, which is today's dominant energy source, would set us on a collision course with the probable need to reduce emissions of CO2.  There is a growing awareness that the saving of energy and greater use of renewable sources of energy, like solar power and wind power, will be very inadequate responses to this dilemma.  There is also a growing awareness that the use and, indeed, expanded use of nuclear energy is one of the few options at the world's disposal for increasing energy generation without significantly adding to CO2 emissions.  It is worth some reflection that, if the world's 400 or so nuclear power plants were to be closed and the electricity they generate were to be produced instead from the burning of coal, there would be an annual increase of some 7% in CO2 emissions.  Nuclear energy, alone, cannot solve the CO2 problem, but that problem can hardly be solved without nuclear power.
<P>It is still true, however, that the use or expanded use of nuclear power is opposed by a sizeable segment of public opinion in many countries, mainly for fear of radioactive releases from an accident or from the disposal over long periods of time of nuclear wastes.
<P>Comparisons with the risks associated with the generation of energy through coal or hydro power, gas or oil are certainly relevant and should be carried out to provide a basis for rational discussion.  However, we must be aware that the public might find damage to health and the environment through radiation less tolerable than injury through coal mine accidents, the bursting of hydro dams or the explosion of gas cisterns.  This is also the premise upon which extensive international co-operation is now taking place within and outside the IAEA to strengthen safety worldwide in the operation of nuclear power plants and in the disposal of radioactive waste.  In a year's time I hope a draft convention on nuclear safety will be ready containing rules which will be legally binding on all States adhering to it.  Such a draft is currently being negotiated within the IAEA, as recommended by the Rio Conference.  The attainment of a nuclear safety culture embracing all countries operating nuclear power plants is also the objective of present efforts to assist countries in Eastern Europe to upgrade nuclear power plants or in some cases where this may not be feasible or economic to phase them out.
<P>Agenda 21 of the Rio Conference contains a chapter on the safe and environmentally sound management of radioactive wastes.  Let me report in this regard that a Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste was adopted by the IAEA in 1990.  While cases have occurred in which chemical wastes have been exported to developing countries, no such case has been found involving radioactive wastes.  I should add that at the request of developing countries experts sent by the IAEA have investigated several cases - and found chemical but not radioactive waste.  I should also report that intensified efforts are under way in the IAEA to work out a comprehensive series of internationally agreed Radioactive Waste Safety Standards, which may form the basis of, or complement, national standards and criteria.  It is reasonable to require that radioactive waste be disposed of with the same level of safety all over the world - and regardless of whether the waste originates in military or civilian programmes.
<P>Mr. President, <BR>
If present efforts to ensure a uniformly high level of safety in the operation of nuclear power plants and in the disposal of radioactive waste around the world continue to be vigorously pursued within and outside the IAEA, I believe that the expanded use of nuclear power which may become indispensable may also become fully acceptable to most people.
<P>Let me conclude with some comments not on the past year but on the long-term role of the IAEA.  International organizations are mechanisms through which governments jointly meet international challenges.  I would submit to you that over the years the IAEA has been a useful and efficient tool of its Member States.  The energy crisis focussed attention on the practical and potential use of nuclear power and the role of the IAEA.  The Chernobyl crisis led the IAEA to launch the concept and principles of a nuclear safety culture accepted and respected by all; in the environment crisis, the IAEA has been able to show that peaceful nuclear applications, including the use of nuclear power for electricity generation, are of crucial value both for environment and development; in the Iraqi crisis, the IAEA has helped the United Nations to neutralize the nascent nuclear weapon capacity.  The Agency is also learning the broader lessons of Iraq and strengthening the verification system in order to increase the probability that any violation be detected and be dealt with by the Security Council, to which the IAEA reports in these matters.
<P>As the IAEA is obliged to undertake increasing activities in the fields of transfer of technology, nuclear safety and safeguards, the organization - like the United Nations - ought  to be spared financial crises.  This year we have been forced to reduce our activities in order to manage a shortfall of no less than 13 percent of the budget, due to non-payment, in particular by a large contributor.  Such financial crisis management in an organization inevitably undermines its capacity to address the serious issues it is asked to deal with.  The ongoing erosion of pay levels to our staff also reduces our ability to attract staff of the required calibre.  I submit that more mileage will be obtained from the mechanisms that governments create for our joint journey into the future, if these mechanisms are adequately financially fuelled and managed by well-motivated and competent crews.
<P>Lastly, I should like to express in this forum the thanks of the IAEA to the Government of Austria, which is an excellent host to all the international organizations located in Vienna.<HR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Speech by Dr. Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR> at the ANS/ENS/USCEA Nuclear Energy Forum</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Chicago, Illinois USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>17 November 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Today members of the world's nuclear community are gathering here in Chicago to celebrate the opening 50 years ago of a new chapter in science.  Indeed, the beginning of a new era, the nuclear age.  It is a moment to pay respect to Enrico Fermi and his colleagues, to the intellectual brilliance and perseverance of the pioneers and to those - many of whom are present here - who have contributed to the further pages of this new chapter.  It is also, I think, an appropriate moment to discuss the two principal challenges which have confronted the world ever since the first controlled chain reaction, how they have been met and how we can meet them in the future.  I have in mind, of course, the challenge not to use the atom for war and the challenge to exploit it safely for the benefit of mankind.
<P>That the military applications of the new knowledge would be a dangerous and dominating future factor was realized from the outset.  In his book "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" Richard Rhodes quotes Leo Szilard as saying "I shook hands with Fermi and said I thought this day would go down as a black day in the history of mankind".  Whether we share that judgement or not - I do not - we must recognize that the early demonstration of the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons in active war and the decades of testing of 
ever more destructive, ever more sophisticated nuclear weapons show that we do not yet have a sure answer to the question how to limit the use of the nuclear chain reaction to peaceful purposes.  We must also recognize that the evacuation of several hundred thousand of people affected by the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl and the fear that large segments of the public have of nuclear power show that we also do not yet have a fully satisfactory answer to the second question, how to effectively and safely use the nuclear discoveries for energy generation.  Saying this is by no means to ignore that the world has come a very long way in meeting the challenges that arose in 1942.  I should like to discuss the broad approaches that have been taken and how they can be further pursued.  In doing so I shall focus on the international political and legal frameworks and institutions that have been created to bring us to our goals.
<P>Although it is too early to feel confident that the risk of nuclear war has been eliminated, there exist today good reasons for some optimism.  At long last the nuclear weapons arsenals are shrinking and warheads are being pulled back from many areas.  The nuclear-weapon-free areas of our world are growing.  We can also note that the awareness is increasing that nuclear power - if properly handled and developed - is a viable means of meeting mankind's needs for more energy and can be used with less risk to our climate, health and environment than an expanded consumption of fossil fuels.
<P>It has taken much scientific, technical and political work, and many years, to bring us to this situation.  The development could have been different and disastrous.  Today we see mankind slowly moving away from the risk of nuclear conflagration.  We know now just how close the world came to nuclear catastrophe in the Cuban missile crisis.  And the employment of nuclear weapons might also have been contemplated in the Korean war.  Nevertheless, the step over the brink of disaster has been avoided.  The existence of nuclear weapons and their enormous power have acted as a deterrent from war between those who possessed them.  Together with accelerating global economic integration and global environmental interdependence these facts are leading us to search for the next phase in a still very primitive world order:  a stronger legal framework for our living together and more developed common institutions to cope with our joint problems.
<P>It was a tribute to the far-sightedness of a soldier turned statesman - President Dwight Eisenhower - that the first efforts were made in 1953 to come to terms with the duality of nuclear's potential and to find ways of harnessing it for mankind's benefit in peaceful applications while inhibiting simultaneously the spread of its military dimension.  This was in his "Atoms for Peace" initiative to which the International Atomic Energy Agency owed its birth 35 years ago and to which it still owes its dual mandate to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to help prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.
<P>The Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970 contained the same political thrust, enabling States to make binding and verified commitments to non-proliferation while promising to facilitate a transfer of peaceful nuclear applications to those making the commitment.  Today, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, together with some regional accords like the Tlatelolco Treaty in Latin America, are rightly seen as essential and successful legal instruments to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  In the past year there have been important new commitments to these treaties:  Argentina and Brazil in Latin America, South Africa and several other States in Africa.  And North Korea has accepted international verification.  A 
new wave of accessions to the NPT may soon come from former States members of the Soviet Union.  Some of them have, indeed, already joined the Treaty.
<P>Apart from some States of the former Soviet Union, only a handful of States - Israel and Algeria in the Mediterranean region and India and Pakistan on the Indian sub-continent being the most significant - have refrained from making legally binding non-proliferation commitments and possess significant nuclear installations.  It is not far-fetched to think that these countries, too, might legally commit themselves to a renunciation of nuclear weapons, provided inter alia that peaceful relations can be securely established in their respective regions and that nuclear disarmament progresses among the five declared nuclear-weapon States.  Further agreements in the nuclear disarmament sphere can also be expected to create a positive framework for an unlimited extension of the NPT when that question comes up for decision in 1995.  In the present international climate of global detente and surplus of highly enriched uranium and plutonium in the US and in Russia one might hope that these two States would take the initiative for a global agreement on a verified cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons use.  An agreement through which a date for the cessation of all nuclear testing was accepted by all nuclear-weapon States would also do much to solidify non-proliferation.  Such an agreement - which has been on the agenda for the last thirty years - would signal that the world no longer tries out new and "better" nuclear weapons.  Needless to say a continued and accelerated reduction in the stocks of nuclear weapons in all the States possessing them would be of importance in itself and a means of demonstrating the growing irrelevance of these weapons in the post-cold-war world that is now taking shape.
<P>I have painted the rosy side of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation picture.  It may seem to some of you too optimistic.  Yet, I would maintain that at no time since nuclear disarmament talks began has the political climate seemed more favourable than now for far-reaching agreements.  It is time to act.  The opportunities must not be lost!
<P>I am obliged, however, also to register the threats which exist for an evolution toward an increasingly nuclear-weapon-free world.  If for some reason tension were to recur between nuclear-weapon States, this would bring the disarmament process to a halt.  Two other risks are often pointed to.  One is the risk that a trickling of plutonium, weapons grade uranium, nuclear weapon technology or experts might occur from the former Soviet Union to potentially proliferating States.  Media serve almost daily stories about such trafficking.  While so far none of these has proved, upon analysis, to be serious from the viewpoint of proliferation, there is no ground for complacency.  Effective measures need to be taken by all States to prevent the export of sensitive nuclear material or equipment which may risk contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  It is true that the more detente and disarmament are consolidated globally and regionally, the less risk there will be of attempts by any State to acquire or develop nuclear weapons.  However, as the case of Iraq shows, the risk is still to be taken very seriously and to be countered by measures in the fields of foreign and security policy, export controls and verification.
<P>The case of Iraq demonstrated that, in addition to many industrially advanced countries, a number of developing countries have attained such a technological level that, given sufficient security and political incentive, they could develop a nuclear weapons capacity.  This reality underlines the urgency of removing the incentives through measures 
in the political security field, notably a peace settlement in the Middle East, of impeding efforts at importing material and techniques for weapons construction and of strengthening verification.
<P>The safeguards system of the IAEA forms an important part of the regime which has been established to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to create confidence that nuclear installations are used for only peaceful purposes.  The world's first on-site inspection system has now been in operation for over 25 years.  At a cost currently of some 60 million dollars per year and through a staff of some 600 people, including some 200 inspectors, the world has been given assurance that fissionable material in declared nuclear installations is not diverted for weapons use.  This remains a very important function, but the case of Iraq has raised the requirement that the system should also give warnings about any development of nuclear weapons or weapons-useable material through non-declared, clandestine activities and installations.  This clearly more difficult task is now being tackled through a variety of measures, the most important of which relate to the acquisition of information, the right to perform inspections at non-declared sites and the prospect of support by the Security Council of the United Nations.
<P>The most fundamental requirement for successful inspection is information.  Inspectors must know where to go and what to inspect.  It is not possible for inspectors to visit and examine every building and basement in a foreign country and random visits will not help very much.  Inspectors must have access to information leading them to sites and installations of possible interest.  In the strengthened safeguards system now taking shape in the IAEA, the information provided by the inspected States will be supplemented by other 
data, e.g. from other States concerning the export and import of nuclear material and certain types of equipment.  Had such data regarding Iraq been available to the IAEA and been analysed before the Gulf War, it is quite possible that special explanations and visits would have been requested by the Agency.  All data that may be made available to the IAEA, including such that may originate in satellite surveillance or other sources, must of course be critically analysed and assessed.  There is much erroneous information and disinformation in circulation.  It is the Agency's professional duty not to base its actions and conclusions simply on trust; it is also its duty to avoid voicing unnecessary suspicions and false alarms.
<P>A right of unimpeded access for inspectors to relevant sites and material is of crucial importance when information is available, suggesting the need for such inspection.  In the case of Iraq exceptionally far-reaching rights of access were obtained through Security Council resolution 687 and a subsequent agreement.  It is not likely that governments generally would accept such comprehensive rights of access.  The recently drafted Convention prohibiting the production of Chemical Weapons probably shows how far governments generally are willing to go in accepting international inspections in today's world.  A balance has to be struck.  On the one hand States wish to avoid revealing military, industrial and commercial secrets and are concerned that industrial activities not be burdened with too frequent visits or cumbersome accounting duties.  On the other hand, they have a mutual interest in creating the conditions necessary to make the inspection system credible.  The Convention probibiting Chemical Weapons shows that States today may be ready to go somewhat further in facilitating inspection than they were when the IAEA safeguards system 
was established 25 years ago.  However, we still have some way to go before an international inspector is admitted to all States by simply presenting a UN laissez-passer and a letter showing that he is coming on official duty.
<P>While it is important to continue strengthening and facilitating the right of access for international inspections, one must be aware that the inspectors are not an international police force that may be used, if need be, in some sort of commando raids.  The inspectors go to territory and installations which are controlled by national authorities and which are made available by those authorities for inspection.  The precise nature of that right of access, and effective international support for that right, therefore become crucial.  An international inspectorate has no means of its own to force its way to a target of inspection.
<P>In the case of inspections under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it has been confirmed by the Board of Governors of the IAEA that the Agency has the right to perform special inspections not only in declared sites and installations, but whenever there are reasons to believe that installations or material which should have been declared have not been so declared.  So far this right has not been used, but it is most important that it has been recognized and that States are fully aware of its existence.  It is equally important that after the case of Iraq and after the meeting of the Security Council in January 1992, all States are aware that the Council is likely to take what it called "appropriate measures", if any violation of a safeguards agreement is reported by the IAEA to the Council.  I might add that a safeguards agreement would be violated not only by non-declaration of the production of enriched uranium or plutonium, but also by a denial of the right of access stipulated for inspectors.
<P>In a world of few nuclear weapons there needs to be a high degree of confidence that no clandestine weapons production takes place.  Several elements will be needed for such confidence to exist and strengthened international verification is one of them.  I have described how the present nuclear inspection system is being strengthened after the experience in Iraq.  But even this reinforced system will have some limitations.   Indeed, the case of Iraq is the best evidence of this.  Even after 15 inspection missions, using rights that go much further than what States in general will accept, we still make the reservation that 
something could remain undetected and we stress the need for continuous and long-term monitoring.  The scientific and technical knowledge to enrich uranium and design nuclear weapons remains intact in Iraq.
<P>Confidence would be boosted in this case by a peace settlement in the Middle East removing essential incentives for all States in the region to make nuclear weapons.  Confidence could also grow from active co-operation in the peaceful nuclear sphere, e.g. desalination of water by the use of nuclear power.  But effective IAEA inspection is likely to remain an important element in any non-proliferation regime.  It is also a resource that 
may be harnessed to give assurance that the growing quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium recovered from dismantled warheads and reprocessing are peacefully stored or used in nuclear reactors.  It may also be used for the verification of a cut-off of production of fissionable material for weapons.
<P>I have now drawn the picture of important parts of the international efforts to prevent the use of the atom for weapons - from President Eisenhower's speech in 1953 to the various possibilities for action that exist after the cold war and after the Gulf War.  I turn to the 
other side of the nuclear challenge - that of safe and peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology in medicine, agriculture and industry and energy generation.  There is no need in this forum to cite examples of the beneficial uses of nuclear techniques in the fight against cancer, in imaging, or in mutation breeding, hydrology or environmental monitoring, all of which are generally accepted without difficulties in today's world.  Nor do I propose to discuss the economic viability of using nuclear power or the irradiation of food, both of which meet some public resistance.  I should like rather to focus on the international legal and institutional framework that has been and is developing to ensure a safe and rational use of nuclear techniques.
<P>Much, indeed most, of the international transfer of peaceful nuclear techniques occurs in the large non-governmental nuclear sectors which have grown up all over the world.  National rules provide most of the legal infrastructure for this transfer.  However, the Atoms for Peace Policy, the Statute of the IAEA and the Non-Proliferation Treaty all envisage international governmental activities to promote co-operation for the safe utilization and transfer of peaceful nuclear techniques - not least to the developing countries.
<P>While the international exchange of experience in various nuclear fields goes on in many fora and institutions, including the IAEA which remains an important meeting place, there are some vital and central activities that need to be performed on behalf of all States by an international authority.  I have already spoken in detail about safeguards inspection, which is one such activity, but I should also refer to the host of activities which consist in the compilation and dissemination of nuclear relevant information, e.g. the power reactor information system (PRIS) and the international nuclear information system (INIS) which 
provides an electronic bibliographic service covering practically everything published anywhere in the world in the nuclear field.  I should further mention the secondary dosimetry standards system which is of vital importance to ensure the right dosage of radiation in medical treatment in many parts of the world.
<P>I would like to focus in some more detail, however, on the international activities to promote radiation protection and safety in the operation of nuclear power plants and in the disposal of nuclear wastes.  It might seem surprising that binding international rules about nuclear safety are so far of modest coverage.  This applies in particular to nuclear power and nuclear waste.  In the case of radiation protection, however, the long-standing activities of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) have provided basic policies and principles, on the basis of which international organizations, including the IAEA, have prepared radiation protection standards that are universally accepted. 
<P>The reason why until now safety of nuclear power and nuclear waste have not been the object of internationally harmonized binding rules is that activities in these areas were felt largely to affect only the countries in which they took place.  The safety of a nuclear power plant or of a waste disposal site was felt to be an exclusively national matter.  It is true that there has been much international discussion and a great deal of international exchange of experience in this field, a great deal of mutual learning and influencing - but not internationally binding rules.  Until recently it might have been concluded that as States insisted on binding rules about international safeguards verification, but not on binding rules about safety, they worried more about diversion of nuclear material for possible proliferation 
than they did about nuclear safety.  The conventional wisdom, of course, was that diversion 
of nuclear material might in some cases be a temptation to a foreign country and needed to be countered by effective inspection, while lax safety would never be a temptation.
<P>After the Three Mile Island accident and even more so after the Chernobyl catastrophe the way of looking at these matters is changing.  It is still recognized, of course, that the national authorities have full responsibility for nuclear safety and that nothing should be done in the international sphere to detract from that responsibility.  It is also recognized, however, that some nuclear safety matters are of such direct international concern that they must be internationally regulated and that some others require certain minimum international standards, which cover essential points but leave detailed implementation to the national regulator.  In the quest for what is termed an "international nuclear safety culture", it is further recognized that services in the shape of international expert advice and peer review have roles to play.  Let me be more specific about the international normative infrastructure that has emerged - especially in the last decade.
<P>Not surprisingly, the first international regulations worked out were those governing international transport of nuclear material.  Here, there was no getting away from a common international concern that had to be satisfied.  The next area to mention is that of liability for damage in the case of accidents, where two conventions were negotiated and, after Chernobyl, were linked through a joint protocol.  This complex area, where national traditions and legal approaches vary greatly, will require further energetic work to ensure inter alia that transnational damage arising from any nuclear accident is subject to appropriate legal rules.
<P>After the Chernobyl accident two conventions were elaborated and adopted in record time, one concerning prompt notification of any nuclear accident which might have transnational consequences and one concerning emergency assistance in the case of accidents.  Although we hope that neither will have frequent use, exercises are arranged periodically with governments to make sure that the procedures laid down in these conventions remain viable.
<P>In the fields of nuclear power safety - siting, design and operation - and waste processing and storage many non-binding international guidelines and standards have been worked out over the years.  The NUSS - nuclear safety standards for design and operation of nuclear power plants - are comprehensive and systematic standards derived from the practical experience of the whole international community.  They have been of great use as reference for some countries and as models for others.  The Radioactive Waste Safety Standards - RADWASS - address safety requirements to be met in the management of nuclear waste and have a function similar to NUSS.
<P>It is only in the last few years that agreement has emerged that some rules are of such importance that they should be accepted not only as guiding but as binding by all States; that 
nuclear power plants and nuclear waste management and disposal everywhere in the world must respect certain standards.  Where such standards are not met, there must be assistance and advice to ensure that the situation is rectified.
<P>Last year negotiations began between governments under the auspices of the IAEA to formulate an international safety convention.  Although there are many difficulties in achieving agreement, it is hoped that a draft convention will be ready by autumn 1993.  In my view, the adoption of certain legally binding international norms concerning safety of nuclear power reactors and nuclear waste handling may help to convince a sceptical public that governments all over the world are agreed on the rules that must be respected.  I should add that such norms must be subject to review and be updated as we acquire more knowledge and experience.
<P>While the international community edges towards codifying safety norms binding on all, it has been grappling with the question of how to assist plants that have shortcomings which need be addressed and which affect global perceptions about nuclear power.
<P>International co-operation in practical measures to enhance radiation protection and nuclear safety worldwide has expanded rapidly in recent years though the services and peer reviews arranged by the IAEA and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), and through bilateral programmes.  In the last two years considerable effort has been deployed bilaterally and multilaterally to strengthen the safety of certain nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The absence in some countries of adequate regulatory infrastructures is an additional cause for concern.  There is a need for clearer direction and co-ordination of the many efforts underway.  The IAEA for its part became involved at a relatively early stage, when it organized an inquiry into the safety problems of the oldest type of Soviet-designed reactor, the WWER-440/230.  This systematic inquiry resulted in a diagnosis of some 100 safety issues related to plant design and operation.  The report of the inquiry may be fundamental to priority setting by the countries concerned and to decisions on backfitting measures.
<P>Another, much larger and more complicated effort is now underway regarding other types of power reactors in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern and Central Europe.  Judgements have to be made as to how much backfitting is possible and economic.  As nuclear-generated electricity is a vital part of the shaky economies of these countries, the question of phasing out is not an easy one.  It seems clear that no more plants of the RBMK type will be built, but it is not equally clear how long this type will remain in operation - even with added safety features.
<P>The current efforts to upgrade the safety of reactors built to earlier standards put to the test the determination of the international community to develop an international nuclear safety culture.  This task calls for understanding, co-operation and solidarity.
<P>Let me conclude:  the first controlled nuclear chain reaction placed mankind before the dual challenge of achieving the peaceful exploitation of the atom and of avoiding the painful explosion of the atom.  Fifty years later and fifty thousand negotiations later in a post-Cold-War and post-Gulf-War world, we have reason to begin feeling that the threat of destruction from nuclear weapons is helping to bring us into an era in which the big wars are against poverty and against environmental destruction and are fought not with weapons but with science and technology - including nuclear science and technology.
<P>While large segments of the public are not yet ready to accept an expansion of nuclear power and many governments are inclined to withhold active support for such expansion, the time should be used to complete the designs of the new generation of nuclear power plants, to establish all the elements of a nuclear safety culture accepted and respected by all States engaged in nuclear activities and to bring about a universal commitment to non-proliferation by non-nuclear-weapon States and far-reaching agreements on nuclear disarmament by nuclear-weapon States.  If we successfully use the next few years to further these ambitions, I am convinced that the expansion of nuclear power, which may soon prove indispensible if energy demands are to be reconciled with environmental demands, will also prove acceptable to the public.<HR>

<TITLE>Lessons of Iraq</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Lessons of Iraq</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>European Strategy Group and Aspen Strategy Group Conference on Proliferation in the 1990s Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix</H4>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Rome, Italy</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>28 October 1992</H4>
<HR>
<OL>
<LI>	I am pleased to address the question of "proliferation in the 1990s".  When I saw the title I asked myself if there was a pessimistic assumption in it.  My remarks will be the same as if I had addressed the issue "non-proliferation in the 1990s".
<P>Before I focus on Iraq and IAEA inspections, some broader and more fundamental questions may be appropriate.
<LI>To understand how we can best counter proliferation, we must identify what factors are incentives to it and disincentives.  The primary factor, most will agree, is perceived security interests.  Global and regional tensions and nuclear arms races are incentives, detente globally and regionally and nuclear disarmament are disincentives.
<LI>In the present global detente, with the major military powers helping to settle regional conflicts rather than competing in them, and with accelerating nuclear disarmament between the United States and Russia, the general climate is positive.  South Africa's adherence to the NPT and Argentina's and Brazil's movement toward acceptance of the Tlatelolco Treaty have several reasons, but the general climate, I think, is one.
<LI>	In my view, it is not naive to aim ambitiously now at<BR>
 <OL>
<LI>(a)	An unlimited extension of the NPT in 1995;
<LI>(b)	The universalization of non-proliferation commitments from all but the declared nuclear-weapon States.
</OL>
       Two agreements in the disarmament sphere would be helpful to these aims for the NPT and, indeed, be valuable in themselves:<P>
       <OL>
	<LI>(a)	An agreement on a final date for all nuclear weapons testing;
	<LI>(b)	A cut-off of the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes.
        </OL><P>
<LI>I am not claiming that a final date on testing is a sine qua non for an unlimited NPT extension, but I am convinced that it would be the right signal for the 1990s and that continued testing of "better" weapons would send the world the wrong signal.
<LI>	Even more important for an unlimited extension of NPT than a final date for testing may be agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Arab States now bound by NPT may not wish to bind themselves for an unlimited time, unless all States in the region - including Israel - did the same.  Paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 on Iraq does state that the resolution's provisions on the mapping and neutralization of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction represent steps toward the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction.  Maybe so, but agreement on a zone is likely to be reached only in the context of a peace settlement in the region.
<LI>	It seems clear, especially after Iraq, that a simple acceptance of NPT and NPT-type safeguards by all States in a region stretching from Iran to Algeria would be insufficient both for Israel and for the other States in that region.  The NPT does not explicitly prohibit the construction or possession of enrichment and reprocessing plants, nor the possession of highly enriched uranium or plutonium, so long as it is all declared and placed under safeguards.  It is hard to believe that this would be acceptable in the Middle East.  It is also hard to believe that NPT-type IAEA safeguards would satisfy the parties in this region.  Without going so far as the inspection rights in Iraq, safeguards verification in a nuclear-weapon-free zone in an extended Middle East would have to be much sharper and more intrusive than those under NPT, probably including both international and bilateral elements.
<P>A peace settlement and a closely verified nuclear-weapon-free zone embracing all States in an extended Middle East would remove mutual incentives which now exist to acquire nuclear weapons capacity.  It would cover a number of the countries against which suspicions are now directed from various quarters.
<LI>	As in the Middle East, non-proliferation on the Indian sub-continent probably requires a tailor-made agreement and presupposes regional detente and some steps toward global nuclear disarmament.  The bilateral agreement between North and South Korea also points to the need in that region for special rules that go beyond the NPT.
<LI>	I have now pointed to positive - and difficult - political action that would result in credible non-proliferation assurances regarding the countries which are most frequently mentioned as real or potential risks:  Algeria, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and the Koreas, in addition to Israel, India and Pakistan which are assumed to have the ability to make nuclear weapons.  Considering how few these States are, it is not unreasonable to look for tailor-made approaches.
<LI>	However, it is also necessary to consider general measures impeding proliferation especially if we take a pessimistic view of our ability to remove certain perceived security interests as incentives to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity.
<LI>	Restrictions on the export of sensitive technology generally make proliferation more difficult.  A tightening of international rules has been agreed upon as a lesson of Iraq and more States appear willing to join this effort.  A good deal of items were, indeed, imported by Iraq through a wide and clandestine procurement network which has not been declared.  We must be aware, however, that a country with a high degree of self-reliance will not be much affected by export restrictions.
<LI>	The break-up of the Soviet State and the break-down of rigid Communist structures are often cited as causing a risk of illegal and uncontrolled export, of the trickling of nuclear weapons or material or equipment or technology or scientists or engineers to potential proliferators.  This is a plausible risk and it calls for alertness.  The best remedy, surely, is stabilization of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Fortunately we have not so far seen any real export of weapons or weapons-grade material, but lots of scams.  Enriched uranium, so far, has turned out to be depleted uranium, natural uranium or low-enriched uranium fuel.  Plutonium has turned out to be gram quantities.  But there is no cause for complacency.
<LI>	Carrots and sticks, held by the outside world, play some role as incentives and disincentives.  The Security Council waved the stick in its summit statement of January this year.  The carrots are a major reason for many developing countries to formally commit themselves to non-proliferation.  But they don't work where perceived security interests point in the opposite direction, as in Pakistan.
<LI>	Safeguards verification cannot physically stop proliferation attempts.  The inspectors are not policemen with executive power.  They are observers who report and their reports may trigger action by governments, perhaps collectively decided by the Security Council.  Lax verification may invite cheating by a State inclined to acquire nuclear weapons despite a non-proliferation commitment.  Effective verification may constitute a deterrence.  Of course a State could renounce its NPT commitment and its safeguards obligations, but predictable reactions to such renunciation might deter from such conduct.  No State has done it so far.
<LI>	After the disclosure of Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme, the IAEA has been both praised for its inspections there and criticized for failing to have identified the programme before the war.  The questions asked are how could Iraq escape being found out by Agency inspectors, and are there more Iraqs?  Are we in a new era in which a number of developing countries are reaching a technological level enabling them to go for nuclear weapons?
<P>In my view, the current discussion focusses a bit too much on how the inspections are carried out and a bit too little on the information on which they are based.  It has been suggested, inter alia, that inspection would become much more effective if placed directly under the Security Council, as in the case of Iraq.  Short notice or no notice, aggressive snap inspections are described as an ideal by some contrasting with the IAEA's advance notice visits to declared installations under NPT safeguards.  The Agency has been described as sleepy or soft - or worse - by outside critics, mostly in the US.  Not so, however, by governments.  They have commended the Agency and its Action Team for Iraq.
<LI>	In a couple of cases, short notice inspections were highly successful and significant in Iraq, namely, against mobile targets:  nuclear equipment on trucks and documents.  However, it must be borne in mind that objects of nuclear inspection are normally highly sedentary:  research reactors, enrichment or reprocessing plants.  They do not move away overnight, or even in a week.  It must also be recognized that a country in which inspection is to take place is not like a flat that is raided by police.  A country is controlled by its own police and military.  They are physically actually capable of stopping international inspectors if they have their government's order to do so.  They did stop Mr. Kay, leading an IAEA team, from entering the truck park and they did prevent a UNSCOM team for several days from entering the Ministry of Agriculture.  Meanwhile mobile objects, like documents, can be removed.
<P>How co-operative an inspected regime may be will depend on the one hand on how embarrassed it would be by revelations that would result and what punishment it may risk for resisting inspection.  It is not self-evident that trade embargoes or punitive air strikes will be inflicted automatically for lack of co-operation.
<P>In Iraq the inspectors have had very extensive rights of access, granted by Iraq as a part of the cease-fire settlement.  This has been helpful - even though Iraq has not always respected the rights.  In other cases, the inspectors' rights will probably be less far-reaching.  The chemical convention probably shows what balance is acceptable today to States between the interest of rights of inspection and the interest of undisturbed State integrity.  This balance differs in some respects favourably from the balance struck in the 25 year-old safeguards system.  However, under the chemical convention, visas can still be required and designated inspectors can still be rejected.  Where the chemical convention is more favourable to inspection than safeguards, it should, if possible, be emulated by the IAEA.
<LI>	Now to the question of information.  It must be recognized that inspectors cannot roam foreign territories in blind search of clandestine installations.  They must have information about where to go.  Under the IAEA NPT safeguards system, the inspected State is obliged to declare all nuclear material and the installations in which it is produced or otherwise found.  This system was designed primarily with the industrialized advanced open democratic States in mind.  And it is not a matter of indifference that the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium in these States are declared and checked.  Limitations on the rights of inspection were set, however, in order to reduce the risk of revelation of commercial or technological secrets.  These limitations are hardly crippling, but they are unhelpful.  More important is the difficulty of getting information about possible clandestine installations.  If the State itself does not declare them, how will the Agency know?
	In no case has any Member State come to the Agency during my eleven years there to tell us that at such and such a geographic point there is an installation that should be inspected.  It is true that Iraqi procurement of maraging steel, end caps of centrifuges and krytrons was described in some newspapers.  In the absence of detailed data and knowledge about locations, however, there was a poor basis for requesting a special inspection, if this had been considered - which it was not, or if it had been suggested by any Member - which it was not.
<LI>	The situation regarding information is better today than before the war in Iraq. 
<P>Firstly, we expect Member States to inform us about export and import of certain equipment Ä in addition to nuclear material.  Although the risk of smuggling remains, much information can be expected through this new recommendation.
<P>Secondly, we scan media for information.  It is somewhat dismaying to see how much of the information turns out, upon checking, to be erroneous, but in the future as in the past, there could be some needles in a haystack, where much of the material consists of misunderstandings, perhaps disinformation or and certainly sensationalism.  Many of the stories published seem to have been too good for the publishers to check...
<P>Thirdly, we ask Member States to provide us with information they may obtain, whether through satellites or otherwise.  The satellites, in particular, are an obvious powerful source Ä but they only see what they are directed to.  The Argentine enrichment plant in Pilcanyo appears not to have been seen before the Argentine Government itself declared it.  And a research reactor in Algeria appears to have been under construction for a good number of years before it was reported in the US press.  In Iraq, information from defectors and satellite photography appear, however, to have been key elements in identifying sites for inspection.  This is an important lesson.
<LI>	I have mentioned the Security Council.  The Council does not have any satellite and cannot tell us where to go, but it can back up inspectors in their right to access to sites to be inspected.  This lesson of Iraq is not lost for the future.  There is no difficulty in liaison between the IAEA and the Council and the Secretary-General.
<LI>	I should mention one more novel feature, namely, the invitations to the Agency by some states to visit any site or installation, regardless of whether it is declared and regardless of whether the Agency has reason to believe that the site has something that should have been declared but was not.  Such invitations have been offered so far by Iran, Libya, South Africa and the DPRK, to cite the offers in the order they were made.  Such visits may have great advantages:  they may enable the Agency to ask to see something without it being implied that the State had been negligent in its duty to declare the site.  The information available may be too vague or uncertain for us to request a special inspection.  The invitation may also enable a country to clear itself of any allegation that a particular site or installation is clandestine and should have been declared.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General on the occasion of International Women's Day Celebration</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> International Women's Day Celebration</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna, Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>9 March 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Seventeen years ago, the United Nations launched the Decade for Women. At that time the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a Resolution requesting the Director General to give "... special consideration to the appointment of qualified women to policy making and other professional posts on the staff of the Secretariat." Since then, a number of steps have been taken resulting in an increase of some 60% in the number of professional women on the staff of the Agency. However, in spite of this considerable improvement, we are still far from the 30% target for women professionals and   I am sorry to say   we are still a male dominated organization with one of the highest proportion of professional men, about 86%.
<P>The reason for this is simple. We are dealing with very technical programmes for which mostly nuclear engineers or nuclear scientists are required. In these particular fields despite Marie Curie and Lise Meitner   the number of trained women worldwide is still rather limited. Although we have made special pleas to Govemments to ensure that qualified professional women be given every opportunity to apply for our announced vacancies on an "equitable basis with men", the number of women's applications received is still very disappointing. For instance, for scientific/engineering posts, only 29 out of 671 applications received last year   or 4%   were from women whereas for administrative or other posts the percentage is 17%, which is also low.
<P>In the Safeguards Inspectorate, however, a field where a few years ago supervlsors were hesitant to recommend the employment of women because of the physical strain involved and where some Governments, too, were reluctant to accept women inspectors, we have been able through a training programme to increase their number considerably. We now have 18 women inspectors, or assistant inspectors, who side by side with men are performing physically and technically difficult inspection tasks in nuclear facilities all over the world.
<P>Women professionals contribute to the Agency's work in an exemplary manner and so do the many other women in other categories of employment who are equally contributing to the success of our organization. In total they are more than 900 and I would like to THANK every one of them. Without their intelligence, knowledge, wisdom and dedication it would be impossible to accomplish what we do.<HR>

<TITLE>Statement of IAEA Director General Hans Blix to the UN Conference on Environment and Development</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement of IAEA Director General Hans Blix to the UN Conference on Environment and Development</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>UN Conference on Environment and Development</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>4  June 1992</H4>
<P><HR>Twenty years ago it was my privilege to participate as a representative of my country in the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and to take an active part in the drafting of the Stockholm Declaration.  Nuclear energy was not much in focus at that time, but we learned a great deal about the damage inflicted upon forests, lakes and cities by acid rain linked to energy generation through the burning of fossil fuels.  This damage continues.  Indeed, today, despite greatly increased awareness, the environmental problems have become even more menacing.  And energy generation's share of responsibility, notwithstanding the increasing use of pollution abatement equipment, is very substantial.  Its impacts have escalated from local to regional level and now pose a threat to the entire planet.
<P>Addressing today this second global conference on the human environment as the representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is appropriate for me to begin by noting that the past twenty years have brought a tremendous increase in the uses of various nuclear techniques.  And to note, at the same time, that opposition has grown to some of these applications, especially that of nuclear power.
<P>In the minds of many people the very words "nuclear energy" connote devastation and contamination from nuclear weapons, or from a large accident, or from careless handling of radioactive waste.  It is understandable that many who react strongly against the pollution of land and lakes, rivers and atmosphere will look critically at any risks of radioactive contamination.  Such critical scrutiny can be valuable.  The various applications of nuclear energy must be used responsibly and with full respect for the specific problems they can create.  However, they must also be looked at with a keen eye for the tremendous potential which they offer to help achieve sustainable development.
<P>In the field of medicine, for instance, radiation remains a principal means of treating cancer.  Radiation is also used to induce mutations in seeds and to obtain new crop strains that have useful characteristics, such as resistance to pests and disease.  Radioisotopes are used in the vital exploration of water resources, in the tracing of marine pollution and in the identification of pesticide and other chemical residues.  They have been used extensively in a large project for which the IAEA has assisted the Government of Brazil to map ecological consequences of changing land use in the Amazon region.
<P>In a brochure prepared by the IAEA for this Conference some of the uses of nuclear energy which are of direct relevance to Agenda 21 are described.  The IAEA is deeply and very actively engaged in the transfer to developing countries of radioisotope and nuclear techniques to assist in resolving problems as diverse as marine pollution - e.g. in the Persian 
Gulf - desertification, soil erosion, water resources and sewage treatment.  Our laboratories 
in Monaco and in Seibersdorf near Vienna already provide services and training for environmental investigations which could be expanded, if funds were available.
<P>Let me now focus on the use of nuclear power and some of the problems and possibilities it brings for sustainable development.
<P>The nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl in 1986, the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 though largely devoid of any radioactive releases and many minor incidents have certainly brought negative consequences.  But they have also prompted a large number of measures to strengthen nuclear safety further and to promote the gradual emergence of an "international nuclear safety regime" for all countries - be they industrialized, in transition, or developing.
<P>Let me mention a few of these measures.  Right now efforts are being made within the IAEA to draft a nuclear safety convention.  It will not change the basic principle that national authorities are responsible for nuclear safety, but is expected to lay down safety-related rules which are mandatory.  Much work is going into the construction of new generations of nuclear power plants which will be simpler to operate and have greater degrees of passive safety.  Of further and of immediate importance are the efforts to strengthen the safety of the some 430 nuclear power plants which are now in operation.  Special efforts are under way to improve the safety of nuclear power in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe.
<P>The question of safe and environmentally sound management of radioactive wastes is treated in Agenda 21, and I welcome the proposals
made.  It is clear that any human generation producing toxic and hazardous wastes has a responsibility to manage and dispose of this waste in such a
manner that it does not harm future generations.  A growing body of international regulations and safety standards now deal with nuclear waste, one of
the latest being the IAEA Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste adopted in 1990.  Nuclear scientists
and experts are confident about the technical feasibility of managing and disposing of radioactive waste and decommissioning nuclear reactors in
ways that are permanently safe.  The costs are by no means prohibitive.  The problems that have arisen in some countries are mainly related to
improper and inadequate procedures for handling of waste from the military sector.  These problems must be addressed.
<P>Let me conclude with some reflections on the possibilities offered by the use of nuclear power.  There is a levelling off at present in the share
of electricity generated by nuclear power.  The potential for growth, however, is considerable.  Uranium resources pose no constraints to a much
greater reliance on nuclear power and there is ample capacity to build more nuclear power plants.  There is a growing awareness that this potential
must be utilized - not least for environmental reasons.
<P>There is little if any doubt that demand for energy, and in particular electricity, will increase considerably in the decades to come, as a result of
population increases and efforts to raise living standards.  Three-quarters of the world's population today uses less than one-third of commercial
primary energy.  Faced with growing energy needs the world - and especially those countries with a full range of technology options available - will
have to assess carefully what mix of energy sources is compatible with sustainable development and how best to use energy.  Today fossil fuels make
up about 90% of the world's commercial energy, and this heavy use is at the root of some of the most serious environmental problems which we face.
It is increasingly recognized that even vigorous energy conservation and greater reliance on solar and other renewable sources of energy will not
suffice - by far - to reduce or even stabilize CO2 emissions significantly over the next few decades.  If, as seems certain, we shall use much more
electricity, nuclear power, as a non-CO2-producing source, can have an important role to play in combatting climate change and also other energy-
related problems such as urban air pollution and acid deposition.
<P>A greater use of nuclear power, alone, cannot provide a solution to restraint in CO2 emissions, but it is becoming increasingly evident that
expanded use of nuclear power must form a significant part of our attempt to meet growing energy needs in a safe and environmentally sustainable
way.

<TITLE>The Situation of Nuclear Power Today</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The Situation of Nuclear Power Today</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by IAEA Director General Hans Blix at the UNIPEDE Conference</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Stockholm, Sweden</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>22 June 1992</H4>
<P><HR>I should like to start my statement by summarizing my messages to you and thereafter develop them.
<P>The use of electricity is continuously increasing, especially in the developing countries.  Concern about an increased use of fossil-fuel-generation of electricity is growing.  Targets for restraint in CO2 emissions are demanded with increasing urgency and so are taxes on CO2 emissions.  Conservation and renewables are promoted but they will not by far offset the increased demand for electricity.
<P>The growth of nuclear power has been stagnating except in the booming Far East, especially Japan and the Republic of Korea.  There are a variety of reasons:  In some countries cost, in others regulatory uncertainty, in most public resistance linked to fears about safety and about waste disposal.  The shortcomings in Eastern Europe - the echoes of the Chernobyl disaster and the Sosnovy Bor incident - revelations about careless disposal of nuclear waste from the military sector, play a role.  Discussions about non-proliferation after the revelations from Iraq last year add some fuel on the anti-nuclear fire.
<P>It is characteristic that at the Rio Summit on the environment, where climate change and CO2 emissions were high on the agenda, hardly any speaker mentioned that nuclear power is one of the few significant ways through which we can reconcile electricity needs and environmental concerns.   I submit this was not so because governments are unaware.  Both the Paris and Houston summits mentioned this reality.  So did recently the German Minister of Economics, Mölleman, who said that without nuclear power German emissions of CO2 might increase - and not decrease - by 2005.  The reason for the silence at Rio was rather that the conference operated by consensus and there was not much point in raising a matter on which at present no world consensus is possible - even though most certainly a vast majority of governments favour the use of nuclear power or, at least, keeping the option open.
<P>Let me now give indications of what will - I am confident - lead to a relaunch of nuclear power in a few years time:
<P><OL>
<LI>	Economic competitiveness.  Through design, financing methods, the relative competitiveness of nuclear power will increase when the environmental price tag is included in the price of fossil-fuelled generation of electricity;
<LI>Regulatory streamlining is under way in the US, preventing a very unpredictable process of licensing;
<LI>Operational safety is continuously improving globally through new mechanisms, national and international.  OSARTs. WANO;
<LI>Safety in Eastern Europe's nuclear activities will be brought to satisfactory levels through major international assisted means;
<LI>International standards of nuclear power safety and nuclear waste safety will emerge, strengthening safety world wide and perceptions;
<LI>New generations of reactors will be even better than today's;
<LI>Non-proliferation commitments will approach universality apart from the nuclear-weapon States - which all reduce their arsenals.
</OL>
I shall now focus on some of the problems and prospects which I have mentioned and I begin with the Safety of Reactors in Eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union.
<P>There are 57 nuclear power reactors in operation and 29 under construction in this region.  Most of them are of two types designed in the former USSR:  pressurized-water reactors (WWERs) and graphite-moderated reactors (RBMKs); there are three generations of reactors belonging to each type.  To varying degrees, the design and operation of these reactors do not conform to international safety practices common to other nuclear power reactors.  The Chernobyl accident - even after 6 years - stands as a scary symbol of the shortcomings.
<P>These reactors represent about 15% of the world's operating reactors and some 30% of the reactors under construction.
<P>The dependence of Eastern European countries on nuclear electricity is considerable.  In 1990 the nuclear share of electricity production was 51% in Hungary, 36% in Bulgaria, 28% in Czechoslovakia, Russian Federation 12%, Ukraine 25%, Lithuania 45%, Kazakhstan 10%.
<P>Governments may shut down some of them, but it is likely that many will continue to operate for some years with a gradual implementation of high-priority safety improvements.  Plans for major reconstruction to permit long-term operation are being prepared and will need to be evaluated.  The more modern WWER 1000-MWe plants under construction or already in operation will also require some upgrading for long-term use.
<P>What is to be done?  Various bilateral and international efforts have already been started, but I submit a better co-ordination and co-operation is needed to avoid confusion and a waste of resources.  It is necessary in parallel to follow two basic lines of actions:
<P>First:  Bilateral or international projects must make strong use of the capability of institutions in user countries, and must address priority issues leading to immediate safety improvements.
<P>Wherever possible the basis for remedial action must be comprehensive safety assessments for each reactor type allowing a prioritization of safety measures and development and evaluation of long-term reconstruction plans.  Let me mention in this regard that the IAEA, co-operating with the countries in question and making use of available information and our own analyses, including on-site expert missions, performed such a safety assessment for the oldest generation of WWER-440/230 reactors.  Studies of other reactor types have been initiated.
<P>In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the regulatory authorities in these countries.
All this will cost money.  Analyses and assessments are comparatively cheap.  But implementation of hardware changes and improvements of operational safety will cost billions of dollars over the next years.  The Munich G-7 Summit in a few weeks time will, I am sure, address the problem of nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.  A major and concerted international assistance effort is needed.
<P>Let me now turn to the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries.  To some people a fear of proliferation of nuclear weapons is part of their scepticism to nuclear power.  In any case assurance against proliferation is an important condition for trade in the nuclear sphere.  The past year has seen both progress and a set-back in the sphere of non-proliferation.  It is gratifying that in the past year Argentina and Brazil have bound themselves to non-proliferation and are opening up all their nuclear installations for IAEA inspection.  The Latin American Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone may come into operation next year.  South Africa, having adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, is also opening up for IAEA inspection.  Further the DPRK has now ratified an agreement with the IAEA providing for comprehensive safeguards verification.  With China and France having joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty, all declared nuclear-weapon States are now parties to that Treaty.  All this is progress.  The set-back occurred in the case of Iraq.
<P>Until IAEA-led inspection teams acting under Security Council authority last year discovered a large programme for the enrichment of uranium in Iraq, no case was known in which clandestine violations of comprehensive safeguards have occurred.  This case has naturally and necessarily led to a searching debate about ways in which the verification system can be strengthened and several measures are underway in the IAEA to do this.
<P>The verification system created at the end of the sixties was designed to fit the area where it was felt that reassurance was most needed, namely industrially advanced States which were or would be capable of making nuclear weapons.  Verification under the NPT was focussed on and the fissionable material, rather than the nuclear programmes or nuclear installations.  One effect of the concentration of control on the fissionable material is, however, that today the larger part of verification efforts is aimed at Western Europe, Canada and Japan - where there is a lot of nuclear material.  We would like to achieve some of this verification with less effort.  A new partnership approach to the implementation of safeguards in the European Community by the IAEA and Euratom would be helpful to  achieve this.
<P>On the other hand, the case of Iraq showed that the verification system must be geared to detect non-declared nuclear material, and to do so not only in declared installations, but also in non-declared facilities.  This is not so easy.  The Iraqi multi-billion dollar programme was, of course, not declared.  In fact, it does not appear to have been known even to foreign intelligence organizations.
<P>While it is not certain that inspection systems can be devised which would give 100% guarantee of detection even of completely indigenous nuclear programmes in closed societies like Iraq, it is clear that several measures can be taken that considerably reduce the risk of non-detection in these cases.  The crucial point is to obtain information giving clues about such activity.  Inspectors cannot - and will not be allowed to - roam the territory of inspected States in a blind search for possible hidden nuclear material and installations.  Measures are now being taken to obtain such information in several different ways:  through more extensive reporting to the IAEA of the export of all nuclear material and of sensitive equipment, through a more intensive analysis of data obtained from the States concerned, through monitoring of the media and through Member States which may be willing to share satellite or other data available to them.
<P>Evidently, the information obtained will have to be assessed with great care to avoid false alarms and unjustified inspection requests.  Should the evidence leading to a request for a special inspection have been misleading and no undeclared nuclear programme in fact be underway, the country can be expected to accept or even invite the inspection to dispel the unfounded suspicions.  Where the inspection would uncover a nuclear programme which should have been declared, but was not, the State may well refuse any inspection.  Such a case would most likely pass through the Board of Governors of the IAEA and be transmitted to the Security Council for appropriate action.
<P>The break-up of the Soviet Union and the emergence of many independent States has raised several non-proliferation concerns.  These appear now to have been solved or nearly solved and we may expect all these States except Russia to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States, accepting IAEA safeguards inspection.
<P>There has been much concern and media reporting during the last year about the risk of nuclear bombs, sensitive nuclear equipment and technology and nuclear scientists "trickling" from the now less severely controlled States of the former USSR.  With respect to the scientists and engineers, the right approach must be the one currently being taken, namely to provide incentives for them to work in the peaceful nuclear sector or in nuclear disarmament-related work.
<P>The risks of clandestine transactions in nuclear hardware, material and technology may indeed increase in periods of disorganization.  I must note, however, that despite a flood of reported cases, e.g. about red mercury, no hard evidence seems to have been presented of cases which would be worrisome from the viewpoint of non-proliferation.
<P>Let me move from these problems of today to some issues of tomorrow.  Increasing the use of electricity is one of these issues.
<P>There can be no doubt that a growing world population, economic development, including a necessary increase of the standard of living in developing countries, will need much more energy in the future.  Over the past 15 years, total energy use increased by more than 100% in developing countries, whereas in OECD countries total energy use was about constant.  The increase in the demand for electricity has been enormous, 240% in developing countries and 40% in OECD countries, in the latter case closely following economic growth.  In particular in OECD countries, the use of more electricity is not only a matter of more convenience, like more electric household equipment, and of more efficient production like use of industrial robots, it is also a matter of energy conservation and environmental protection.  Fast-running electrical train systems have a potential to replace part of the air traffic.  Electrified public transportation systems could replace some individual car traffic in cities.  Various industrial heat applications, e.g. melting or drying, are being replaced by electrical technologies, saving energy, reducing emissions and providing healthier work conditions.  For many of the developing countries increase in the use of electricity is a matter of improving basic living conditions and helping in the struggle for survival.  Electric pumps bring water to the fields and clean water to the houses, refrigerators and deep freezers keep food fresh, reduces spoilage, and thus improves health conditions.
<P>An example:  China has the ambition to ensure that each household has a refrigerator - a basic improvement in the quality of life.  But it requires a good deal of energy.  Even with refrigerators of modest size and of the most current and efficient model available, a base load capacity of some 20 000 MWe or 20 large nuclear power reactors will be needed.
<P>We must ask ourselves:  "Where will this energy come from?"  When already the present level of consumption of energy has brought severe environmental damage world wide through acid rains and the risk of global warming, we must understand that there is tremendous tension between the demands for more energy and the demands for the protection of life, health and the environment.  Conservation will only offset part of the increasing demand for electricity and economically viable renewable sources of electricity - apart from hydro power - still seems far away.
<P>We cannot change energy systems overnight.  In the foreseeable future there will be an energy mix, as there is today.  Fossil fuels - coal, oil, gas - that now cover a little under 90% of the world's total energy use - are certainly not going to be phased out.  Nor is hydro -nor nuclear power.
<P>Looked at from a global standpoint it is reasonable to suggest that the least developed countries should be enabled to use the less demanding technologies, which are the fossil-based ones and that the advanced countries should make greater use of the more demanding nuclear technology.  In practice both industrially advanced States and some of the more technologically advanced developing countries are at present planning to use both more gas, coal and nuclear.  Mexico, that is now operating one nuclear power reactor and is scheduled to take another into operation in two years, is also building six coal-fired plants to cover its growing needs for electricity.  China - while it is at present building a few nuclear plants - is also planning to double its coal use by the year 2000.  And India, which has a number of nuclear plants, is planning to treble its use of coal by the same year.  The coal consumption of China and India together would then be greater than the coal consumption of all the advanced industrialized States lumped together.  This will not reduce CO2 emissions.
<P>As could be expected, no such comparisons were made at the Rio United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which limited itself by advocating conservation and the use of environmentally "benign" energy sources - which each country can interpret as it likes.  Several countries suggested targets for restraint in CO2 emissions.  However, ambitious targets will hardly be attainable only through conservation and the use of renewable sources of energy.  A greater use of nuclear energy would be of significance.  A figure will illustrate.  If today's some 430 nuclear power plants were closed and the electricity which they generate were instead to be generated in coal-fired plants, the carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere would increase by some 7 percent.  It shows that already at present nuclear power is relevant in the discussion of global warming.  Even if it is clear that nuclear power alone cannot solve the problem of restraining CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions, its potential role is very significant.
<P><B>Present Nuclear Power Programmes</B>
<P>In most industrial countries nuclear power is now in holding pattern.  In the booming economies of East Asia the situation is different.  In Japan the 43rd nuclear unit (unit 4 of Ohi) is due to be connected to the grid and two more units (Koaskiwazaki Koriwa - 3 and Shika) are due to obtain criticality in November of this year.  In addition to the six units (including the FBR) under construction work has also started on two Advanced Light Water Reactors.
<P>In the Republic of Korea work has started last month on two new units (Ulchin 3 and 4).  At the ground-breaking ceremony, Korea's ambitious plans to build 18 new nuclear power units by the year 2006 were reaffirmed.  China will soon start their first commercial nuclear operations.  Interest in nuclear power is also rising in Indonesia and in the Philippines, where a plant which has been ready for several years may be brought into operation.
<P>I predict Western industrialized countries will return to nuclear power as an abundant environmentally benign enervy source.  Technological improvements will help bring this about.
<P>Nuclear plant designers are developing new approaches to address the issues of increasingly demanding safety requirements and economic competitiveness.  The large base of experience accumulated is being used and advanced reactors are being developed for all principal reactor types, i.e. the light and heavy water-cooled reactors, the liquid-metal-cooled reactors and the gas-cooled reactors.  Developments are primarily of an evolutionary nature, but typically also incorporate innovative features such as passive systems to assure safety.  In addition, new innovative reactor concepts are being developed.
<P>Extensive consideration is also being given to human factors so as to enable easier operation of the plant from the main control room.  The goal is to minimize the potential for human error by providing a high degree of automation for all situations and to design advanced nuclear plants which would have a minimal off-site impact as a result of any accidents.
<P>Let me conclude:<BR>
It is of crucial importance to satisfy energy and electricity requirements of the world without jeopardizing our environment and health, regionally or globally.  Nuclear generated electricity has potentially a much greater role to play than it does today to help achieve this.  It is unrealistic to believe that conservation and renewables will go very far to provide an economically viable answer.
<P>Great efforts are underway to ensure that nuclear power safety is high everywhere, including Eastern Europe.  Living up to international standards will be required of all, both in the operation of power plants and the disposal of waste.  Further proliferation of nuclear weapons can be avoided and nuclear disarmament is making headway.  New nuclear technology is underway that will build on much experience gained.
<P>The nuclear industry is readying itself for the challenge to come.  The regulators must give clear signals of the high standards of safety they require and through international measures these should be at the same high level all over the world.  The users should be alert to the changes which occur.  Not least should they be aware of the environmental price tags that different modes of electricity generation carry.<HR>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>"Lessons of Iraq", Opening Address by Hans Blix</H4>

<HR>
<OL>
<LI>I am pleased to address the question of "proliferation in the 1990s".  When I saw the title I asked myself if there was a pessimistic assumption in it.  My remarks will be the same as if I had addressed the issue "non-proliferation in the 1990s".
<P>Before I focus on Iraq and IAEA inspections, some broader and more fundamental questions may be appropriate.
<LI>To understand how we can best counter proliferation, we must identify what factors are incentives to it and disincentives.  The primary factor, most will agree, is perceived security interests.  Global and regional tensions and nuclear arms races are incentives, detente globally and regionally and nuclear disarmament are disincentives.
<LI>In the present global detente, with the major military powers helping to settle regional conflicts rather than competing in them, and with accelerating nuclear disarmament between the United States and Russia, the general climate is positive.  South Africa's adherence to the NPT and Argentina's and Brazil's movement toward acceptance of the Tlatelolco Treaty have several reasons, but the general climate, I think, is one.
<LI>	In my view, it is not naive to aim ambitiously now at
<UL>	
 <LI>(a)	An unlimited extension of the NPT in 1995;<P>
<LI>(b)	The universalization of non-proliferation commitments from all but the declared nuclear-weapon States.
</UL>
Two agreements in the disarmament sphere would be helpful to these aims for the NPT and, indeed, be valuable in themselves:
<UL>
<LI>(a)	An agreement on a final date for all nuclear weapons testing;
<LI>(b)	A cut-off of the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes.
</UL>
<LI>	I am not claiming that a final date on testing is a sine qua non for an unlimited NPT extension, but I am convinced that it would be the right signal for the 1990s and that continued testing of "better" weapons would send the world the wrong signal.
<LI>Even more important for an unlimited extension of NPT than a final date for testing may be agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Arab States now bound by NPT may not wish to bind themselves for an unlimited time, unless all States in the region - including Israel - did the same.  Paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 on Iraq does state that the resolution's provisions on the mapping and neutralization of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction represent steps toward the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction.  Maybe so, but agreement on a zone is likely to be reached only in the context of a peace settlement in the region.
<LI>It seems clear, especially after Iraq, that a simple acceptance of NPT and NPT-type safeguards by all States in a region stretching from Iran to Algeria would be insufficient both for Israel and for the other States in that region.  The NPT does not explicitly prohibit the construction or possession of enrichment and reprocessing plants, nor the possession of highly enriched uranium or plutonium, so long as it is all declared and placed under safeguards.  It is hard to believe that this would be acceptable in the Middle East.  It is also hard to believe that NPT-type IAEA safeguards would satisfy the parties in this region.  Without going so far as the inspection rights in Iraq, safeguards verification in a nuclear-weapon-free zone in an extended Middle East would have to be much sharper and more intrusive than those under NPT, probably including both international and bilateral elements.
<P>A peace settlement and a closely verified nuclear-weapon-free zone embracing all States in an extended Middle East would remove mutual incentives which now exist to acquire nuclear weapons capacity.  It would cover a number of the countries against which suspicions are now directed from various quarters.
<LI>As in the Middle East, non-proliferation on the Indian sub-continent probably requires a tailor-made agreement and presupposes regional detente and some steps toward global nuclear disarmament.  The bilateral agreement between North and South Korea also points to the need in that region for special rules that go beyond the NPT.
<LI>	I have now pointed to positive - and difficult - political action that would result in credible non-proliferation assurances regarding the countries which are most frequently mentioned as real or potential risks:  Algeria, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and 
the Koreas, in addition to Israel, India and Pakistan which are assumed to have the ability to make nuclear weapons.  Considering how few these States are, it is not unreasonable to look for tailor-made approaches.
<LI>	However, it is also necessary to consider general measures impeding proliferation especially if we take a pessimistic view of our ability to remove certain perceived security interests as incentives to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity.
<LI>	Restrictions on the export of sensitive technology generally make proliferation more difficult.  A tightening of international rules has been agreed upon as a lesson of Iraq and more States appear willing to join this effort.  A good deal of items were, indeed, imported by Iraq through a wide and clandestine procurement network which has not been declared.  We must be aware, however, that a country with a high degree of self-reliance will not be much affected by export restrictions.
<LI>	The break-up of the Soviet State and the break-down of rigid Communist structures are often cited as causing a risk of illegal and uncontrolled export, of the trickling of nuclear weapons or material or equipment or technology or scientists or engineers to potential proliferators.  This is a plausible risk and it calls for alertness.  The best remedy, surely, is stabilization of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Fortunately we have not so far seen any real export of weapons or weapons-grade material, but lots of scams.  Enriched uranium, so far, has turned out to be depleted uranium, natural uranium or low-enriched uranium fuel.  Plutonium has turned out to be gram quantities.  But there is no cause for complacency.
<LI>	Carrots and sticks, held by the outside world, play some role as incentives and disincentives.  The Security Council waved the stick in its summit statement of January this year.  The carrots are a major reason for many developing countries to formally commit themselves to non-proliferation.  But they don't work where perceived security interests point in the opposite direction, as in Pakistan.
<LI>	Safeguards verification cannot physically stop proliferation attempts.  The inspectors are not policemen with executive power.  They are observers who report and their reports may trigger action by governments, perhaps collectively decided by the Security Council.  Lax verification may invite cheating by a State inclined to acquire nuclear weapons despite a non-proliferation commitment.  Effective verification may constitute a deterrence.  Of course a State could renounce its NPT commitment and its safeguards obligations, but predictable reactions to such renunciation might deter from such conduct.  No State has done it so far.
<LI>	After the disclosure of Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme, the IAEA has been both praised for its inspections there and criticized for failing to have identified the programme before the war.  The questions asked are how could Iraq escape being found out by Agency inspectors, and are there more Iraqs?  Are we in a new era in which a number of developing countries are reaching a technological level enabling them to go for nuclear weapons?
<P>In my view, the current discussion focusses a bit too much on how the inspections are carried out and a bit too little on the information on which they are based.  It has been suggested, inter alia, that inspection would become much more effective if 
<P>placed directly under the Security Council, as in the case of Iraq.  Short notice or no notice, aggressive snap inspections are described as an ideal by some contrasting with the IAEA's advance notice visits to declared installations under NPT safeguards.  The Agency has been described as sleepy or soft - or worse - by outside critics, mostly in the US.  Not so, however, by governments.  They have commended the Agency and its Action Team for Iraq.
<LI>	In a couple of cases, short notice inspections were highly successful and significant in Iraq, namely, against mobile targets:  nuclear equipment on trucks and documents.  However, it must be borne in mind that objects of nuclear inspection are normally highly sedentary:  research reactors, enrichment or reprocessing plants.  They do not move away overnight, or even in a week.  It must also be recognized that a country in which inspection is to take place is not like a flat that is raided by police.  A country is controlled by its own police and military.  They are physically actually capable of stopping international inspectors if they have their government's order to do so.  They did stop Mr. Kay, leading an IAEA team, from entering the truck park and they did prevent a UNSCOM team for several days from entering the Ministry of Agriculture.  Meanwhile mobile objects, like documents, can be removed.
<P>How co-operative an inspected regime may be will depend on the one hand on how embarrassed it would be by revelations that would result and what punishment it may risk for resisting inspection.  It is not self-evident that trade embargoes or punitive air strikes will be inflicted automatically for lack of co-operation.
<P>In Iraq the inspectors have had very extensive rights of access, granted by Iraq as a part of the cease-fire settlement.  This has been helpful - even though Iraq has not always respected the rights.  In other cases, the inspectors' rights will probably be less far-reaching.  The chemical convention probably shows what balance is acceptable today to States between the interest of rights of inspection and the interest of undisturbed State integrity.  This balance differs in some respects favourably from the balance struck in the 25 year-old safeguards system.  However, under the chemical convention, visas can still be required and designated inspectors can still be rejected.  Where the chemical convention is more favourable to inspection than safeguards, it should, if possible, be emulated by the IAEA.
<LI>	Now to the question of information.  It must be recognized that inspectors cannot roam foreign territories in blind search of clandestine installations.  They must have information about where to go.  Under the IAEA NPT safeguards system, the inspected State is obliged to declare all nuclear material and the installations in which it is produced or otherwise found.  This system was designed primarily with the industrialized advanced open democratic States in mind.  And it is not a matter of indifference that the large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium in these States are declared and checked.  Limitations on the rights of inspection were set, however, in order to reduce the risk of revelation of commercial or technological secrets.  These limitations are hardly crippling, but they are unhelpful.  More important is the difficulty of getting information about possible clandestine installations.  If the State itself does not declare them, how will the Agency know?
In no case has any Member State come to the Agency during my eleven years there to tell us that at such and such a geographic point there is an installation that should be inspected.  It is true that Iraqi procurement of maraging steel, end caps of centrifuges and krytrons was described in some newspapers.  In the absence of detailed data and knowledge about locations, however, there was a poor basis for requesting a special inspection, if this had been considered - which it was not, or if it had been suggested by any Member - which it was not.
<LI>	The situation regarding information is better today than before the war in Iraq. 
<P>Firstly, we expect Member States to inform us about export and import of certain equipment Ä in addition to nuclear material.  Although the risk of smuggling remains, much information can be expected through this new recommendation.
<P>Secondly, we scan media for information.  It is somewhat dismaying to see how much of the information turns out, upon checking, to be erroneous, but in the future as in the past, there could be some needles in a haystack, where much of the material consists of misunderstandings, perhaps disinformation or and certainly sensationalism.  Many of the stories published seem to have been too good for the publishers to check...
<P>Thirdly, we ask Member States to provide us with information they may obtain, whether through satellites or otherwise.  The satellites, in particular, are an obvious powerful source Ä but they only see what they are directed to.  The Argentine enrichment plant in Pilcanyo appears not to have been seen before the Argentine 
<P>Government itself declared it.  And a research reactor in Algeria appears to have been under construction for a good number of years before it was reported in the US press.  In Iraq, information from defectors and satellite photography appear, however, to have been key elements in identifying sites for inspection.  This is an important lesson.
<LI>	I have mentioned the Security Council.  The Council does not have any satellite and cannot tell us where to go, but it can back up inspectors in their right to access to sites to be inspected.  This lesson of Iraq is not lost for the future.  There is no difficulty in liaison between the IAEA and the Council and the Secretary-General.
<LI>	I should mention one more novel feature, namely, the invitations to the Agency by some states to visit any site or installation, regardless of whether it is declared and regardless of whether the Agency has reason to believe that the site has something that should have been declared but was not.  Such invitations have been offered so far by Iran, Libya, South Africa and the DPRK, to cite the offers in the order they were made.  Such visits may have great advantages:  they may enable the Agency to ask to see something without it being implied that the State had been negligent in its duty to declare the site.  The information available may be too vague or uncertain for us to request a special inspection.  The invitation may also enable a country to clear itself of any allegation that a particular site or installation is clandestine and should have been declared.<HR>

<TITLE>Peaceful Nuclear Development</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Peaceful Nuclear Development</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by Hans Blix at the <BR>Nairobi Seminar on Nuclear Law</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Nairobi, Kenya</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>6 March 1991</H4>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Sustainable development</H3>
<P>The World Commission on Environment and Development defined "sustainable development" as "development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."  I agree with this basic thought.  We must not ruin the resource base off which future generations will also need to live.  Nor should we leave chemical or other wastes that could bring disaster for them.  These principles are easy to articulate but less easy to put into practice.  We are often groping in the dark.  For instance, we do not always know what the long term effects may be of using certain new chemical compounds.  A little later I shall tell you that in my view the peaceful nuclear industry is able and willing to take very safe care of its wastes.
<P>Before I address the positive role that nuclear applications play to bring about sustainable development, I want to make a few points that seem to me fundamental in this context.
<P>The first relates to the size of the world's population.  At the time of the birth of Christ there were   it has been calculated   some 300 400 million people on the earth.  In l900, there were l.5 billion, we have now passed 5 billion and by the year 2000 we shall be 6 billion.  Thus, in the ten years between 1990 and 2000, we expect to increase almost as much as we did in the preceding 2000 years!  If the world's population were to double in the next 40 to 60 years, it is hard to see how desertification, deforestation, climate change and urban decay could be arrested.  In my view, any strategy for sustainable development pre supposes population restraint.
<P>Second, the most important areas in which sustainable development must be sought are, of course, food production, availability of water and energy generation.  To achieve it requires efforts by all countries and it is of mutual interest that the North provides financial assistance and facilitates a transfer of technology to the countries of the South.
<P>Third, the new climate of East West relations, which we hope will remain, holds out the prospect of a much more ambitious international co operation and calls for greater and better use of international organizations, including the IAEA.
<P>A lessening of tensions and a reduction of military arsenals among industrial and developing countries alike would release very substantial resources.  Large parts of these resources will no doubt be used for domestic purposes.  However, it will be important to insist that significantly increased resources be devoted to assistance to poor countries and to the protection of the environment.
<P>A world in which half of humanity lives in misery and a minority enjoys an ever improving standard is not a stable world.  The wall between East and West has fallen.  It cannot be followed by a wall between the North and the South.  Development from poverty is a global issue   not only for humanitarian but also for political reasons.
<P>Transfer of technology and know how is vitally important for development, and nuclear techniques are of great use   also to Africa, where our Agency has a substantial technical co operation programme.
<P>Let me give you a few examples of such nuclear applications.
<H3>Food and agriculture</H3>
In agriculture, for instance, radioisotopes and radiation help us:
<P>To optimize fertilizer and water use and improve biological nitrogen fixation.  Inter alia this provides higher protein content in plants;
<P>Radiation induced mutations help us to breed high performance, well adapted and disease resistant crop varieties;
<P>Using insects that have been radiation sterilized or genetically altered helps us to eradicate or control insect pests;
<P>Reproductive performance, nutrition, and health of animals is improved by nuclear methods.
<P>Water is the most important limiting factor for crop production in many areas of the world.  The efficient use of water in irrigation systems requires continuous monitoring of the moisture content of soil.  Moisture gauges using neutron techniques are ideal instruments for this purpose.  Through these methods, traditional irrigation methods are being improved and in some cases up to 40 percent of the water can be saved.
<P>Radioisotopes have proved to be ideal tools for studying the behaviour, breakdown, and residues of agrochemicals in soil, water, plants, animals and their products.  Through the use of isotopes it has been possible to devise safer ways to apply agrochemicals and formulations which are effective and environmentally benign in controlling pests and promoting growth.
<P>For centuries, mankind has tried to improve the quantity and quality of crops.  Natural evolution of plants results from spontaneous mutation and selection of the fittest mutants.  By radiation treatment the rate of mutation occurrence can be multiplied, thereby accelerating evolution and the selection of superior crops.
<P>The number of mutant induced crop varieties now exceeds 1500 worldwide with billions of dollars added to farmers' incomes annually.  One striking example is a cotton mutant developed in Pakistan in the early Eighties which helped to double the country's output.  And China has had such remarkable success in improving its rice crops through mutations that about one tenth of its total acreage is now mutant derived.
<P>In Africa, nuclear methods are helping to fight two devastating diseases   rinderpest and trypano somiasis   thereby increasing food production and incomes for small farmers.
<P>Controlling or eradicating insects can be achieved without the use of chemicals through the sterile insect technique (SIT).  In this approach, insects are produced in large rearing plants, sexually sterilized using gamma radiation, and released into the native insect population.  When the sterile insects mate with the wild insects, no offspring are produced.  This approach is not only environmentally sound, frequently it is the only practical means of insect eradication.
<P>The first successful use of the SIT related to the New World screwworm, a devastating pest of livestock and wild life, on the island of CuraÜao in 1954.  Later the screwworm   which can also attack humans   was eradicated from the USA and then Mexico.  In 1989, however, the New World Screwworm was reported in Libya and the SIT is now being applied there to try to stop this new introduction.
<P>The SIT has also been used against tsetse flies which, as you know, have prevented settlement and development of large areas of Africa.  One species of tsetse flies has been eradicated from parts of Nigeria and three species from parts of Burkina Faso using the SIT.
<P>Much more food would be available to people if harvested food were better preserved and protected against contamination and pests.  Preservation methods have evolved from sun drying to salting, smoking, canning, freezing, heating, and the addition of chemicals.  The latest addition to this list is the exposure of foods to carefully controlled amounts of ionizing radiation.
<P>All the research and testing have been made that is needed for a safe use of this method and all the necessary rules and regulations to irradiate certain foods have been adopted by the WHO and the FAO, but there is still public reluctance in many places over the acceptance of such foods.  This, we believe, will fade in due course.  In future food irradiation will certainly be of considerable use, not least to the developing countries.  It is potentially of great use and is at present really the only a viable method to eliminate health risks in some food.  It is particularly useful to disinfest stored products such as grain, beans, spices, fruit, and dried fish.
<P>Human health applications of nuclear techniques are doubtless well known to you.  One of particular interest to Africa is brachytherapy, which has become the method of choice for treatment of cancer of the cervix.  It is both relatively cheap and effective.  One of the first big projects of this kind in a developing country was organized in Egypt.  Trainees from various African countries have now learned this technique and introduced brachytherapy to the hospitals in their home countries.
<P>A final area of application I might mention is hydrology.  The problems where isotopes play an important role here include testing ground water for:
<P>Origin;<BR>Age;<BR>Distribution;<BR>
Water quality;<BR>Occurrence and recharge mechanisms; and<BR>Interconnections between groundwater bodies.
<P>They also permit testing surface water with regard to 
<P>Dynamics of lakes and reservoirs;<BR>Leakage through dams;<BR>Seepage to subways;<BR>
River discharge measurements; and<BR>Sedimentation rate.
<P>In the future, we may use nuclear generated heat to desalinate sea water.  This is a project which the IAEA is currently developing, and in which Libya and some other North African countries are showing special interest.
<H3>Nuclear power</H3>
I turn now to nuclear power.  There are today some 430 commercial nuclear power plants in operation.  Nuclear power provides about 5 percent of the world's energy and 16 percent of its electricity.  As I mentioned, some industrialized countries with scant energy reserves of their own have opted for nuclear as offering a measure of energy independence.
<P>There is another, and increasingly important reason for using the nuclear option and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.  That is the negative effects that their burning has on our planet's atmosphere:  acid rains and greenhouse effect.
<P>The use of coal and oil at current levels, and without abatement of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, has led to severe damage to the environment and the atmosphere.
<P>While solutions exist for reducing these two emissions, albeit at substantial cost, we cannot see any for the carbon dioxide emissions that stem from the burning of all fossil fuels, most in coal, least in gas.  CO2 is considered to be responsible for 50 percent of the so called greenhouse effect.
<P>How are we to reduce CO2 emissions?  There is no viable way of neutralizing or removing the CO2.  Only less burning of the dominant part of the world's energy   fossil fuels   will reduce CO2 emissions.
<P>Most so called environmentalists feel conservation   meaning both a more efficient use of energy and less reliance on energy   and renewable sources of energy are the best answer.
<P>Everybody is for conservation and we need to pursue it vigorously everywhere because significant savings can be made.  However, we need to be realistic about what conservation is likely to achieve.  The World Energy Council calculates an increase of 50 75% in energy demand by 2020   even with vigorous energy conservation.  As to renewable sources of energy   solar power, wind power, geothermal power, etc.   the same Council calculates that they could give some 3% of the world's energy by 2020.  Today they yield less than 0.3%, most of which is geothermal.  I am not, of course, here including hydro.
<P>Nuclear energy has the advantage of releasing no C02, SO2 or NOx.
<P>If the scientific warnings remain firm that we need to reduce global CO2 emissions drastically to avoid a severe climate change, I predict we are in for an agonizing public debate in the l990s on how to achieve this.  Who will reduce CO2 emissions how much   and how?
<P>I do not suggest that nuclear power is the answer.  I am not even sure there is an answer.  But I would note that, if today's some 430 nuclear power stations were switched off, and were replaced by coal burning plants, global carbon dioxide emissions would rise annually by about nine percent.  This, I submit, is not an insignificant amount.
<P>A doubling of nuclear power would not remove the threat of global warming, but it would certainly alleviate the problem.  At a time when the scientists tell us that drastic targets are needed to stabilize or reduce the level of CO2, I submit it would not be responsible to brush the nuclear option aside.
<P>My own belief is that, even with conservation, more renewable energy sources and more nuclear power, the greenhouse effect will still be very difficult to bring under control.
<P>This is not just a problem for the industrialized world:  the burning of coal in the developing nations is set to rise substantially over the next ten years. Countries such as China and India plan to double or even treble their coal burning capacity to try to keep pace with their energy needs.  This would not reduce CO2.
 <P>Today, only a minority of developing countries can look to nuclear power as part of a solution to their urgent energy needs.  This advanced and demanding technology requires adequate local infrastructures, industrial support, trained personnel and much capital.  In a decade or two, conditions may have changed in a number of developing countries and there will in all likelihood also be new types of nuclear power reactors that are smaller, simpler to maintain and operate than the current types.  For their future energy needs, developing countries, especially those poor in hydropower and fossil fuels, have a great stake in the development of this new nuclear power technology   as well as of solar power and other techniques.  They also have a strong interest in the advanced countries' making use of advanced energy technologies so as to reduce the pressure on, and prices of, oil and gas resources.
<P><H3>Nuclear waste</H3>
<P>I should say a word about nuclear waste.  It is a common view that the disposal of radioactive waste is an unsolved problem.  The only sense in which this is true is that no disposal facilities for high level waste   as distinct from low and intermediate waste   have yet been built.  But this is not due to an inability to isolate such waste from the biosphere.  This is done through the construction of deep, multi barrier facilities in stable geological areas.  Nor is it due to any lack of international criteria on how to set about it.  It is due rather to two simple facts.  First, it is desirable to delay ultimate storage of high level waste   or unprocessed spent fuel   for 30 to 50 years to allow it to lose much of its heat and radioactivity before packaging and depositing it.  Secondly, there is the political problem of                                       
public acceptance of possible sites.  It is connected with our will, not to our ability.  It is sometimes stressed that nuclear waste may retain radioactivity for many thousands of years and that it is irresponsible vis à vis future generations to produce such waste.  The first answer is that it is possible safely to isolate the waste for these long periods.  The second point to make is that alternative fossil fuels   coal and oil   give rise to some waste products that remain hazardous forever.  And they are not isolated!
<P><H3>Nuclear law</H3>
<P>May I conclude by some comments on nuclear law.  Nuclear law is a newcomer in the national and international legal systems.  It is new because the object it regulates   the various uses of nuclear energy   is new.  It is rapidly growing, and it is important that all countries have lawyers who are familiar with it.  The purpose of this training course is precisely to boost knowledge of nuclear law in Africa.
<P>Almost every branch of law nowadays has a domestic part and an international part and these parts communicate a great deal.
<P>It is easily understandable that rules regarding the international transport of nuclear material need to be international.  
<P>It might be thought, on the other hand, that how a country regulates the safety and use of radioactive sources, say, in hospitals, would be exclusively a matter of domestic law.  Yet, we find strong tendencies to develop and use international standards as models.  This has great advantages.  World wide                                       
experience can be pooled and expertise can be available for the elaboration of guidelines or rules.  Standardization of rules worldwide gives confidence and facilitates operation.
<P>	Unlike aeroplanes that fly around the world, nuclear power plants sit firmly on the ground and again one might think that national rules and
measures would be enough.  However, we find that a large number of rules and measures are still needed at the international level.  Accidents must
be prevented everywhere, and the only way in which States can exercise influence outside their own borders is through joint international rules and
measures.  Reducing the transboundary impact of accidents   if any should occur   requires international preparedness.  Aspects of this international
regulation of nuclear energy, is what I shall discuss in the remainder of my address.
<P>The IAEA is the central instrument   but not the only instrument   through which States create an international framework within which nuclear
energy is used.  The working methods vary from simple international exchanges of views through meetings or publications to the working out of joint
recommendations or binding norms, the provision of services upon request and the conducting of obligatory inspections.
<H3>Safeguards</H3>
The safeguards system of the IAEA has existed for over 25 years.  Its purpose is to create confidence that civil nuclear installations and
nuclear material are only used for peaceful purposes.  States supplying nuclear technology, hardware or fuel want to be sure that there is no military
use of what they export.  Mere assurances do not suffice.  They require that inspection takes place.  Such inspection need by no means be seen by
the recipient State as an imposition.  This State may well, itself, have a strong interest to demonstrate to its own public opinion, to neighbouring States,
to the State from which it imports nuclear material and to the world at large, that it is using nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes.
Inspection through an impartial international organization will give much greater confidence than any self inspection could do.  This, in simple terms, is
the background of the safeguards system.
<P>The IAEA's safeguards system at present employs some 200 inspectors who travel all around the world to inspect nuclear installations and
material.  Some 95% of all nuclear installations outside nuclear weapon States are inspected and the annual cost of the system is some US$ 60
million.
<P>During the seventies, the Agency safeguards system underwent a major transformation in character and scope.  The change was the result of
the "non proliferation regime";  that is, the set of treaties, legal norms and voluntary undertakings which were developed to deal with the peaceful uses
of nuclear energy and to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation.
<P>Let me mention the l967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Tlatelolco Treaty), the l968 Treaty on the Non
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the NPT) and, more recently, the South Pacific Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty (the Rarotonga Treaty).  All
these treaties require the application of safeguards by the Agency to all peaceful present and future nuclear activities in a State.  Thus, for the 137
non nuclear weapon States Party to the NPT, for the 23 States for which the Treaty of Tlatelolco is in force, all of which are also Parties to the NPT,
and for the nine Parties to the Rarotonga Treaty, IAEA safeguards have become obligatory in character and comprehensive in scope.  In some States
not parties to these treaties, there are installations not subject to safeguards.  This is   until now   the case of Argentina and Brazil, Israel, South Africa,
India and Pakistan.  However, South Africa recently opened talks with us on a comprehensive safeguards agreement, and Argentina and Brazil are
doing the same.
<P>By last year, the Agency safeguards system, including agreements concluded pursuant to treaty obligations and voluntary undertakings,
encompassed l72 safeguards agreements with l0l States and was applied to 922 facilities and locations throughout the world.
<P>The safeguards system is not an international nuclear police.  The inspectors cannot stop diversion of nuclear material.  Only report it.  The
same will be true, however, of inspection of disarmament measures.  The verification is a confidence building measure, not a policing.  This does not
mean, however, that inspection is without teeth.  Discovery of diversion would have serious consequences.  There would be a report to the Agency's
Board of Governors that would report further to the Security Council of the United Nations.  Even before such procedures take place, reactions would
probably have occured.  Indeed, even poor co operation by a State in safeguards may raise suspicions and lead to political and economic reactions.
<H3>Nuclear safety</H3>
Responsibility for the safe use of nuclear energy rests with the State within whose territory or under whose jurisdiction or control the nuclear
activity takes place.  States enact legislation that is designed to prohibit any activity making use of nuclear energy or radioactive materials without a
license, specify the safety norms to be observed in all such activities, provide for inspections to be made to ascertain whether there is compliance with
the requirements of the legislation and prescribe penalties for failure to observe the requirements of the Act.  A nuclear regulatory authority,
independent of the executive government, is usually charged with the implementation of this legislation and it is this authority, together with the plant
owner, which has to lead the efforts to achieve the excellence in safety which is imperative.
<P>The national regulatory structure in the area of safety is complemented by an international structure that consists of norm setting and service
mechanisms.  In addition there is a vast amount of exchange of experience.  Nuclear institutions learn from each other how best to maintain safety.
<P>Under its Statute the IAEA is empowered to establish or adopt standards of safety for the protection of health and the minimization of danger
to life and property.  The standards are not obligatory for Member States except in relation to Agency projects in a Member State.  Agency standards
are general in content but provide enough guidance to be used by national authorities, sometimes directly but more often with some additions of detail.
<P>The Agency's basic standards for radiation protection constitute one example.  They are the authoritative international translation of principles
and recommendations of the International Commission for Radiation Protection into practical standards and they have found very wide use.
<P>The Agency has developed many other safety standards.  Some examples may be given.
<P>The Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material have been adopted as requirements for the transport of such
material by the competent international bodies for transport.  They are kept up to date and some l0 million packages are transported each year in
accordance with these regulations.
<P>Standards for the protection of nuclear material in domestic use, storage and transport against theft, have also been developed by the
Agency.  As a result of a revision made last year, these guidelines now also deal with the protection of nuclear facilities against sabotage.
<P>The Board of Governors of the IAEA has adopted a Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste.
The Code prescribes that the movement of such waste should take place only when authorized by all States involved   that is "with the prior
notification and consent of the sending, receiving and transit States".  A further requirement is that all States involved should have the administrative
and technical capacity and the regulatory structure needed to fulfil their respective responsibilities.  The Code was worked out by an IAEA expert
working group
after complaints by African countries that toxic and nuclear waste was being dumped in the territories of developing countries.  While chemical waste
has been dumped, no case has, in fact, been identified of illicit transfer of radioactive waste.  Nevertheless, the existence of a code is important as a
preventive measure and to assure the public that the nuclear community is acting in a responsible manner.
<P>In addition to the recommendatory safety standards, there are a number of legally binding international conventions, concluded within the
framework of the IAEA and regulating various aspects of nuclear safety.
<P>The l979 Convention on Physical Protection establishes binding standards for the protection of nuclear material in international transport.  The
Convention, although legally binding, is narrower in scope than the Guidelines I mentioned earlier.  It does not deal with the protection of nuclear
facilities against sabotage.  An international conference is, however, to be convened in l992 to review the implementation and adequacy of the
Convention.
<P>The 1986 Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident was adopted after the Chernobyl accident and seeks to assure through a
notification procedure that any nuclear accident with possible transboundary effects be instantly brought to the attention of all so that they can take
protective measures.  The Convention does not formally cover military nuclear activities.  However, all nuclear weapon States have made a voluntary
commitment to apply the provisions to any accident involving releases not formally covered by the Convention.  To other States it obviously does not
matter if radioactive fall out is from peaceful or military sources.
 <P>The Chernobyl accident resulted in some radioactive fall out in large areas of Europe.  States established very different levels of radioactivity
above which foodstuffs would not be permitted on the market, so called intervention levels.  There could be differences of l00 times and more in levels
set by neighbouring States.  Needless to say this caused some confusion and undermined people's confidence in authorities.  Two years later the
Codex Alimentarius Commission of the FAO and WHO, using the IAEA's expertise and advice, agreed on contamination levels below which there
should be no concern for foodstuffs in international trade.  This is an example of a useful effort of standardization.
<P>The l986 Emergency Assistance Convention, likewise adopted after the Chernobyl accident, establishes an international framework to
facilitate prompt provision of assistance in the event of a nuclear accident or a radiological emergency.  States have undertaken to co operate in case
of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency in order to minimize its consequences and protect life, property and the environment.  The Emergency
Assistance Convention was invoked by Brazil in the radiological accident in Goiania in September l987.
<P>To fulfil its functions under the Convention on Early Notification and the Convention on Emergency Assistance, the IAEA has established an
emergency response system that is designed to ensure prompt communciation of information and co ordination of action.  We have tested the system
together with governments several times.
 <P>The mitigation of the consequences of an accident through prompt and adequate compensation is an important component of the regime for
the safe utilization of nuclear energy.  Today there exist two international conventions that regulate liability for nuclear damage.  The Vienna
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage concluded under the auspices of the IAEA and the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the
Field of Nuclear Energy which was concluded in l960 within the framework of the OECD.
<P>The Chernobyl accident has made it clear that the existing liability system is not adequate to ensure equitable and rapid compensation,
particularly in the event of large scale damage.  This is because of its limited territorial application, its narrow definition of damage and the low level of
guaranteed compensation under it.
<P>New attention has therefore been devoted to the question of nuclear liability and over the last four years some progress has been made.  In
l988 a Joint Protocol linking the Vienna and Paris Conventions was concluded to expand the scope of their application.  Parties to the Vienna
Convention have also made a formal request for the revision of that Convention.  A revision conference will be convened to that purpose after the
necessary preparatory work has been completed.  As you know, work is also being carried out on the feasibility of establishing an additional system of
State liability to provide for interstate settlement of claims.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
Summing up, society's regulation of the use of nuclear energy is a combination of national and international rules.  These have changed over
the years and may be expected to change in the future.
<P>The Agency has a central role in this process.  It collects and disseminates objective data and facts.  It provides a forum for discussion   and
for co ordination between States   also between international organizations such as CMEA, CEC and OECD.  It further offers a framework within which
standards and regulations are developed and expert services are provided.  The results that have been achieved by and through the Agency are
significant.  Safety is improving.  Technical solutions to waste disposal issues have been developed.  Radiation is better understood.  The non
proliferation regime has been gradually strengthened.  The key to this success,
of course, has been the extensive co operation among Agency Member States.
<P>There is now a mix of legally and non legally binding standards and rules.  However, some standards that were recently non binding have
today been transformed into binding commitments.  The new conventions in the area of Physical Protection, Notification and Emergency Assistance
are examples.  The fact that many regulations are still non binding should not be a matter for concern.  Many States have accepted such standards as
a basis for their national legislation.  The focus need not be on the formal character of the rule, but rather on the degree of compliance.
<P>Our societies must set the framework within which they accept that nuclear energy is used.  That framework must include guarantees that
peaceful nuclear installations are not misused for military purposes and verification that creates confidence.  It must include a combination of national
and international rules, arrangements and services to help ensure that nuclear installations are used safely all over the world and that the safety is
continuously strengthened.  The same high standards are required the world over regarding the management, transport and disposal of waste.
<P>I hope I have showed to you that we have come a long way to meet these conditions, that there is still work to be done and that the IAEA is a
useful instrument for the States of the world to create a solid, social framework for the use of nuclear energy.<HR>

<TITLE>The revival of the nuclear power option</TITLE>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The revival of the nuclear power option </H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by Hans Blix at the <BR>Neuntes Deutsches Atomrechts-Symposium</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Munich, Federal Republic of Germany</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>24 June 1991</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
Let me tell you at the outset that I believe there will be a revival of the nuclear power option in the course of this decade.  The global demand for energy is going to increase despite ambitious and necessary efforts to generate and use energy more efficiently.  Commercial renewable sources of energy like solar power, wind power and biomass, will remain too expensive to be made use of for large scale contributions to our energy needs.  The real choice to meet substantial energy needs in an economically acceptable way in the next decade is between fossil fuels and nuclear power.  Both will continue to be used, but the mix may be modified.  Neither can be used at zero risk to life, health and the environment, but all the fossil fuels present the disadvantage of adding to the CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.  If the world concludes that these emissions must be reduced and at the same time demands more energy, there is at present no other CO2 free way than increasing nuclear power and   in some developing countries   hydropower.  The widespread uneasiness about nuclear power in the public will be met in two ways:  by continuous improvements in the safety, reliability and performance of nuclear power and by more information.  In my view, only another nuclear accident involving a large release of radioactivity will block this evolution.  Further international measures are necessary to ensure that nuclear safety is at a high level in all countries.
<P>Lawyers are an important group, accustomed to dispassionately
weighing arguments and evidence.  Not only their professional assistance but also their consideration of and judgement in the energy questions is desirable.
<P>Everybody will not share my conclusion about the future of nuclear power. I shall now develop my thoughts in greater detail and begin with a description of the current global situation of nuclear power which offers a very heterogeneous picture. In some countries the construction of nuclear power plants is stopped by public referenda.  This is true of Austria, Italy and Switzerland.  In others orders for new plants are politically out of the question for the time being without any referenda, e.g. the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain.  In a number of countries where for various reasons opposition was not heard earlier, it is now articulate, e.g. the Soviet Union and Japan.  Active programmes for the expansion of nuclear power continue in the booming Far East:  South Korea, Japan and China and in India.  In Europe, France continues to construct nuclear power plants   though at a slower pace.  In the United Kingdom a pro nuclear government has placed further construction decisions on ice for a few years.
<P>More interesting, but more difficult, is to identify tendencies for the next few years.  The US government explicitly favours more nuclear power and is slowly trying to create an institutional climate in which the next generation of nuclear power plants can be ordered.  The Canadian government is similarly clearly favouring more nuclear power and is facing a public opinion that is relatively positive.  The Dutch government is still analyzing the conditions for a possible resumption of the nuclear power option.  The Finnish government is perhaps the one in Europe that is most actively considering                                       
further nuclear plants.  My own country, Sweden, is an interesting case.  A referendum in 1980 decided after the Three Mile Island accident that the country was to have the 12 reactors planned and no more.  When these had reached the end of their economic life   which Parliament decided would be in 2010   other sources of energy, preferably renewable indigenous ones, like biomass, would hopefully have been phased in.  After the Chernobyl accident the government decided that the phase out of nuclear power should start with the closure of two reactors in the middle of the nineties.  After much agony this plan was dropped by agreement between the government and two major opposition parties by the end of last year.  It is fair to say that this turnabout was caused by fears that more expensive alternative and CO2 
emitting gas generation of electricity would result in difficulties for Swedish industry and employment and by limited confidence in energy sources like biomass, solar and wind power.
<P>The case of Sweden may be instructive.  It would be wrong to say that the Swedish public has come to positively embrace nuclear power.  There would not today be a majority for the construction of additional plants.  But even to begin phasing out a nuclear programme that gives the country nearly half of its electricity, was also not acceptable.  It is tempting to conclude that a fully grown nuclear programme does not easily die, while fledgling ones can be knocked out   as the cases of Austria and Italy show.  Less is at stake economically in these cases.  It is increasingly realized in Sweden and elsewhere that renewable sources of energy and conservation are not going to offset the substantial needs of electricity that would arise from a phase out of nuclear power.  It is also understood that the realistic alternative sources for electricity generation will be found in fossil fuels, gas and coal.  These alternatives are not very attractive to a public increasingly concerned with CO2 emissions and global warming.
<P>The apparent inconsistency in the present mind of the public   no nuclear phase out, but also no new phase in   is not hard to understand.  Doubts about nuclear power come from concern about the safe operation of nuclear plants and the safe disposal of nuclear waste.  Doubts about the fossil fuels come from fears about increasing CO2 emissions and   in the case of gas and oil   energy independence and cost.  Doubts about commercial renewable sources of energy come from the fact that despite the enthusiastic support they have from some and a good deal of government subsidies, they still cover less than 0.5% of the world's energy   if hydropower is not counted.  The doubts about offsetting new power demand by conservation stems from the experience that electricity consumption is continuously going up despite increases in efficiency.
<P>It is a sad reality that the state of the public mind makes it very difficult for democratic governments in most countries to shape energy policies.  To emerge from this paralysis we need to make efforts of two kinds.  First, to further enlighten the public through facts and discussion.  Second, to further reduce the risk of nuclear accidents and to demonstrate that safe waste disposal installations can be built.
<P>In the International Atomic Energy Agency both pro nuclear and anti nuclear member governments support the Agency seeking and disseminating factual information and analysis and making efforts to strengthen safety.  Current examples of such activities are a recent expert symposium arranged in Helsinki by the Agency and ten other international organizations comparing the impacts upon life, health and the environment of different ways of generating electricity.  Another example is the large inquiry which we organized   again                                       
together with several other organizations, including the WHO and the CEC   about the radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident for the population living in the most affected States.  A third example is an international project examining safety problems in the oldest type of 440MW(e) Soviet designed pressurized water reactors.
<P>Let me now turn to discuss in greater detail some facts that are relevant to my thesis that the nuclear power option needs to be revived.
<P>The global need for more energy in general and electricity in particular.
<P>A major driving force, of course, is the population development.  At the time of the birth of Christ there were some 350 million people on the Earth.  In 1900 we were 1.5 billion; in 1990 we were 5 billion and in the year 2000 we shall be over 6 billion.  Thus in the last ten years of this century we expect to increase about as much as in the 1900 years following the birth of Christ.  No environmental problems, I fear, can be meaningfully tackled without the world jointly addressing the population problem.  But even a very slowly growing world population will need more energy and we must not forget that the majority of the world's population live in countries where much more energy will be demanded, at least if there is to be development.  Taking electricity use as an example, I might mention that Bangladesh uses less than 100 kWh/capita and year, while Italy uses about 3500, France and Germany some 7000 and Norway some 25 000.  But for prohibitive pricing policies or rationing, demand for and use of more electricity will increase globally and nationally.  On this practically all expert assessments agree.
<P>Many switches to electricity from fossil fuels in end use are desirable because they may save primary energy, but also because they help to avoid pollution.  We have reasons to wish more electricity powered transport   trains, trams, tubes and trolley buses.  As a European I would wish to see the new Europe tied closer together by fast electric trains from East to West and North to South.  To lift us up to 10 000 metres in order to transport us even moderate distances is a method wasteful of energy and generous in emissions.  Cars, indeed, give us a dimension of freedom that is precious, but we should wish a speedy development of the electric car to avoid the automobile emissions that now add to local, regional and global environmental problems.
<P>If it is clear that more energy, particularly electricity, will be needed,
the question is how this energy will be generated.  The answer is most certainly that there will have to be a mix   as there is now.  Fossil fuels that now cover a little under 90% of the world's energy use are not going to be phased out.  Nor is hydro or nuclear power.  But are ageing coal  and oil fuelled electricity generating plants in industrially advanced countries to be replaced by new fossil fuelled plants   or by nuclear?  Or   conversely   are old nuclear power plants to be replaced by fossil fuelled plants?  In industrialized countries little hydro potential remains to be exploited and the commercial renewable sources of energy   e.g. biomass, solar and wind power   which now give less than 0.5% of the world's energy, mostly geothermal,
are not believed by experts to be able to offer more than 3 5% by 2010.  This leaves us in reality with the choice between fossil fuels and nuclear power for the foreseeable future.
<P>It is reasonable to suggest that the least developed countries should be enabled to use the least demanding technologies viz. the fossil based ones.  Indeed, we know that even some technologically advanced developing countries are planning to increase their use of coal.  China is to double its coal use by the year 2000 and India is planning to treble its use of coal by the same time.  The coal consumption of these two countries together would be greater than the consumption of all OECD States together.  There is no doubt that from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and the risk of a greenhouse effect, an increased use of fossil based energy in developing countries would make an expanded use of nuclear power desirable in technologically advanced countries.  A speedy development of simpler and safer nuclear power reactors would be highly desirable to generate electricity especially for the fast growing cities in the poor countries.  It is expected that by the year 2000 there will be more than 15 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants in devloping countries.
<P>What I said a moment ago that the realistic energy choice boils down to one between fossil fuels and nuclear power is demonstrated by experiences in Europe.  Let me give you some examples.  Denmark, that rejects nuclear power, is often cited as a country with an ambitious wind power programme, but only a percent or two of the Danish electricity originates in wind power, while the capacity of coal generated power stations has been allowed to expand fast and covers some 95% of the Danish electricity generation.  In Austria a nuclear power station of 725 MW(e) was mothballed after a referendum.  A 725 MW(e) coal generated plant was built instead.  In Belgium the request of industry to build another nuclear plant a few years ago was rejected by the government.  The alternative proved to be gas.  And gas on a large scale would also have been the replacement for Swedish nuclear power, if a phasing out would have started in the middle of the nineties.  For Finland the choice at the present moment seems to be nuclear or coal.
<P>What is there to say about this choice from the viewpoints of economy, security, environment and safety?
<P>In terms of economics, there is today not much difference between nuclear power and coal generated electricity.  But in the long term nuclear power should present significant advantages.  The potential for reducing the production costs of nuclear power is still large.  Standardization of construction, serial fabrication of main components, improved efficiency of load following systems are examples.  On the other hand, the coal burning techniques appear to reach the limit of industrial improvements and modifications imposed for environmental reasons could add to the production costs.
<P>Assumptions regarding discount rates, number of years for construction have a heavy influence on cost calculations.  Since privately owned utilities in several countries wish to build more nuclear power plants and it may be assumed that they do not wish to lose money, they must be expecting that they can generate electricity by nuclear power at a profit.  It is expected that at current prices gas is going to look attractive for electricity generation in several countries.  Since the environmental impact of the burning of gas is much less than the impact of burning of coal, gas will very likely be chosen in places where resistance to nuclear power is strong.  In the longer term and with greater consumption a question mark would attach to the price of gas, while the price of uranium can be expected to remain low even with a much increased number of reactors.
<P>There are several kinds of security to discuss in relation to energy.  One is security of supply.  Perhaps coal offers the greatest security of supply, there being many different suppliers and an ample supply available.  To be at the end of a gas pipeline offers much greater supply risks.  As to oil, a nervous world was reminded during the Gulf crisis that both price and availability depend too much on the political conditions in a volatile part of the world.
<P>The risk of supply that exists for nuclear power hardly relates to uranium which is in ample supply from many different regions and countries, like Australia, Canada, Namibia, Niger, China, USSR.  The number of States able to supply enrichment services was for a long time very limited.  This is no longer true.  The energy density of uranium is also such that a utility can store fuel for several years' use and, thereby, acquire very substantial energy independence   even without an indigenous supply of uranium and enrichment services.  A 1000 MW(e) nuclear plant consumes about 80 kg of uranium per day. A coal fired plant of the same capacity uses about 7000 tons of coal per day   i.e. about five train loads.  It goes without saying that the coal plant is dependent upon a well functioning vast transport apparatus.
<P>We can also speak of security of operation, in the sense of reliability.  Available statistics do not point to more frequent or longer stoppages in nuclear plants than in fossil fuelled plants, though one might get such an impression from media that are inclined to report all nuclear stoppages and ignore those in coal  or oil fired plants.
<P>Another security aspect relates to physical protection of plants.  Opponents of nuclear power used to maintain that nuclear power required so much police protection that it was incompatible with democracy.  However, democracy seems to survive in many countries with nuclear power.  It is somewhat of a paradox that it is precisely those who pretend they worry about the democracy, that are likely to try to stop nuclear activities which have been properly authorized by the democratic society.
<P>One cannot completely rule out the risk that terrorists could try to occupy a nuclear plant, although fortunately it has not happened so far.  If they were not experts the chances are that their actions would only achieve automatic stoppages.  It must be recognized, however, that modern society is vulnerable to many other risks from terrorists.  None can be ignored, but I shall refrain from offering a check list.
<P>Reference is sometimes made to the risk that nuclear power plants present in time of war.  It cannot be ignored or denied, but if we think of war, it seems more justified to look first at the risk of some 60 000 nuclear warheads.  In the region of the Persian Gulf nuclear reactors have been bombed three times.  Twice there was no nuclear fuel present:  when Israel bombed a big research reactor in Iraq in 1981 and when Iraq sent rockets on Iranian power reactors under construction during the Iraq Iran war.  Only the American action during the recent UN operation against Iraq involved the bombing of two smaller research reactors containing nuclear fuel.  Fortunately, as IAEA inspection has found, the fuel was not damaged and no radiation hazard arose.
<P>The bombing of coal mines is not likely to pose a great war hazard, but as we all know the burning of oil wells can cause grave damage, and attacks on gas cisterns or big hydro dams may have devastating consequences.
<P>Perhaps it should also be recalled that one major reason why the Middle East is such an explosive region is that it holds a large part of the world's oil reserves.  Violence and wars are linked to oil resources, not to the well spread uranium resources of the world.
<P>It is often alleged that nuclear power increases the risk of a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries.  As is well known President Kennedy prophesized about a world with dozens of nuclear weapon States.  This fear has not materialized, but the risk of proliferation cannot be ignored   least of all these days.
<P>I shall make some comments on Iraq in a moment, but I would like first to note that the risk of some country developing a nuclear weapon capacity exists regardless of whether it has civilian nuclear power.  All the five recognized nuclear weapon States developed weapons first   nuclear power second.  And Israel, which many believe have developed nuclear weapons, does not have any nuclear power.
<P>It cannot be completely excluded that a State could try to make use of a nuclear power programme to hide a weapons programme.  However, not even the dismantling of all peaceful nuclear power in the world would be a guarantee against development of a nuclear weapon by a State which was determined to have one.  The nuclear genie has been out of the bottle for a long while.
<P>The non proliferation regime, verified by IAEA safeguards, is not a police
power that can stop nuclear activities in a State.  But States which pledge themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons and promise to hold all their nuclear material, present or future, available for inspection, open themselves for considerable control.  A misuse of the verified programmes could not be physically stopped by inspectors but would be reported.  The Security Council and individual States would react to such reports by different means.  In the case of Iraq the suspicion of a clandestine weapons programme led the United States to bomb nuclear installations in Iraq during the UN sanctioned action.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement by IAEA Director General Hans Blix on IAEA Inspections in Iraq
to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</H3>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Inspections in Iraq to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Washington, D.C., USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>23 October 1991</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
I want to thank Chairman Pell, Senator Helms, and the rest of the Foreign Relations Committee for giving me the opportunity to come here today and discuss the implications of the IAEA's inspection activities in Iraq for the future of the Agency and non proliferation.
<P>Truly, this has been a remarkable year, particularly in the arms control and non proliferation area.  During 1991, dramatic arms control agreements have been reached; even more sweeping ones have been suggested.  The spectre of a nuclear war between the two great powers no longer hovers over us.  Moreover, a number of countries have come forth willing to sign non proliferation pledges and allow IAEA inspectors into their nuclear facilities that, up until now, were most reluctant to do so.
<P>However, at the same time, IAEA inspectors in Iraq have recently uncovered vast unknown, undeclared uranium enrichment programmes in the billion dollar range and documentary evidence of an advanced nuclear weapons development programme.  This is a direct and flagrant violation of Iraq's non proliferation pledge.
<P>It demonstrates with shocking clarity that international non proliferation
is a vital component of all countries' national security.
<P>Argentina and Brazil are among the countries that recognize this.  Not only did these two threshold nations sign agreements between themselves for close nuclear co operation, but they agreed to open their nuclear installations to the IAEA inspectors for the safeguarding of nuclear materials.
South Africa is another such nation.  It recently signed the Non Proliferation Treaty   perhaps the most successful arms control agreement in the world.  In doing so, it joined the more than 140 non nuclear weapon States that have committed themselves under the NPT to remain without nuclear weapons and to accept on site verification by IAEA inspectors.  Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia have followed suit.
<P>France and China have also come forward, saying they are ready in principle to join the other three declared nuclear weapon States in adhering to the NPT.  This means all five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council now agree to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, North Korea, which adhered to the Treaty in 1985, recently accepted the IAEA's standard agreement for safeguards verification under the NPT.  These agreements should give the world reason for optimism, and a receding fear of nuclear war.
<P>However, there is the ominous shadow of Iraq.  Iraq is, of course, a special case.  There is reason to believe most States that adhere to the NPT and other non proliferation treaties are sincere in their commitment and they accept international inspections to strengthen confidence in their pledge.  At the same time, Iraq shows we cannot accept such an assumption blindly, and without examining possible contradictory evidence.
<P>The IAEA's present system of verification and inspections under the NPT was the first on site inspection system in the world.  Although it was revolutionary when it was negotiated around three decades ago, it reflects the reluctance of the industrial States which created it to confer far reaching rights on international inspectors.  However, lessons learned from our unique, wide ranging inspections in Iraq show us some ways the IAEA's safeguards inspection system should be given sharper teeth.
<P>First of all, the IAEA must have access to information from sources besides the country where inspections are being conducted.  If the State itself does not declare nuclear installations, we must learn through other sources where to look.  The nuclear inspections teams sent to Iraq this year have been provided with such material by Member States, through the Special Commission, designating suspected sites for inspection.  Our inspectors cannot comb through every inch of a State's territory blindly searching for nuclear material and installations.  We need and receive information from supplier States on exports of such material.  But a system where the IAEA was informed by Member States of relevant data obtained through national technical means   satellite cameras and other intelligence gathering activities   would dramatically strengthen the Agency's inspection teams   as it has in Iraq.
<P>Providing, of course, that these teams are entitled to go to locations which are under reasonable suspicion.  The IAEA cannot engage in intelligence activities, but I see no reason why a special unit in the Agency should not receive selective information from Member States' national satellites.  These are used for national security and preventing nuclear proliferation is surely a
national security activity.  Such information would allow our inspectors to identify targets that require special inspections.
<P>That brings me to my second point.  The Agency must have the right of free access to locations pinpointed by the intelligence reports.  Although the Agency is given the right to perform special inspections in safeguards agreements, it has never been used for the purpose of inspecting undeclared locations.  This is primarily because up until recent events in Iraq, there was never any information indicating a need for such inspections.  Such inspections would obviously have to be approached carefully and be subject to control by the Board of Governors.  Other improvements to the right of access should be made by extending the right to unannounced inspections and providing the right of entry for inspectors without visa requirements.
<P>Third, the right of access must be linked to an enforcement mechanism.  Inspectors cannot shoot their way into locations and installations they are entitled to visit and inspect.  As we saw in Iraq, they can be shut out   or shut in.  The inspected State must know that the Security Council will intervene and enforce the right of the inspectors  as it did in Iraq.
<P>The challenge of Iraq has provided the international community and the IAEA with the opportunity to develop a much strengthened safeguards system that can give assurance non proliferation pledges are being respected.  We are anxious to meet this challenge and others such as those related to nuclear safety and technology transfer.  Our task in Iraq is much larger, more complex and more dramatic than we ever suspected.  The IAEA is able to draw on decades of experience in the field of nuclear inspection and use our own inspectors, equipment and laboratories, but the work has been very exacting.
<P>For example, our inspection teams have brought great quantites of documents out of Iraq.  These documents must be catalogued, translated and evaluated before we can even begin to judge the value of their contents and put pertinent information into place.  The material contains a considerable amount of evidence of procurement activities for materials and goods for the Iraq nuclear weapons programme.  Perhaps most of this may turn out to be perfectly legitimate, normal trade in items that may have an innocent use, but which can also be used in nuclear weapons programmes.  At this time, we are translating and analysing the information and the names of firms relevant to our work will be given to the governments in question.
<P>Let me say here that barring any directive to the contrary from the Security Council, we will make public names of firms which appear to have been involved in trade in sensitive items.  We have no wish to protect any firms violating national regulations.  But we must handle this responsibly.
<P>This is just one example of the overall massive effort the Agency is engaged in under Resolution 687.  I should note here that this effort is not funded out of our Regular Budget, but from special UN funds.  However, the very size of this work stresses the entire Agency.  In addition to the Iraq project and the programme to strengthen safeguards overall, as well as the necessity to expand the programme to cover the new Member States and inspections in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, we have expanded programmes or requests to expand almost every area of the Agency.  Willingness to undertake these tasks is not enough.  There must be resources.  We have serious budget concerns which we know do affect our ability to respond.
<P>The Agency learned another lesson in Iraq.  We learned that measures undertaken over seven years of zero real growth budgeting, measures considered rational and cost effective at the time when they were taken, may have affected the Agency's capability.
<P>The Agency's annual safeguards budget totals about $60 million.  There are only 200 inspectors for almost 1000 installations, worldwide.  Some believe this level of funding would be adequate if less attention were paid to countries that no one suspects and more attention were devoted to some other countries.  This sounds good, but it raises the question of who grades the credentials of the States and with what criteria?  The safeguards inspections system is set up to be as equal as an airport monitoring system and prejudice towards any countries without reasonable cause would endanger acceptance of the non proliferation regime.
<P>Reverting to Iraq for a moment, this need to have conformity of inspections set the standard of inspection frequency on research reactors, to two a year.  In hindsight, this was unfortunate, for with more frequent inspections, we might have deferred Iraqi authorities from the nuclear weapons effort.  Determining the number of inspections at any installation also raises questions of budgetary concerns.
<P>When the zero growth policy was first imposed it prompted genuine budget and programme reform within international organizations.  But the consequences of the continued application of this policy are beginning to alarm us.  Every year greater demands are being made upon the Agency's resources.  Although we welcome this recognition of our capability, we are rapidly approaching the time when the world's expectations of the Agency are inconsistent with our available resources.  Contributing to the problem is the manner in which several countries delay their payments against their regular budget assessments
until late in the calendar or programme year so that we are perennially in economic disaster.  Regrettably, the example of the United States is rubbing off on other countries.
<P>Let me close by saying the safeguards situation in Iraq is unprecedented, but the lessons it has taught us, if learned, should be valuable in the future.  The success of the IAEA has direct implications for all countries' national security.  The success of the Agency depends upon the will of the members of the organization.  I hope this committee will continue to recognize and support the principles for which the IAEA stands.<HR>

<P><HR>
<P>
I want to thank the members of this committee for asking me to appear here today. I do not intend to make a long presentation, as I feel I can be of most help to you by responding to questions.
<P>The International Atomic Energy Agency is an international organization, like the World Health Organization or the World Meteorological Organization. It has nearly 120 Member States, a budget of around 200 million dollars per year and about 2000 staff, most of them at our headquarters in Vienna. A Board of Governors consisting of 35 Member States is the policy making organ apart from the General Conference that meets once a year. Among the professional staff US citizens are the largest group. I am a Swedish citizen and I have been Director General for almost ten years now.
<P>Established as part of the Atoms for Peace in the late fifties, the IAEA was given the tasks of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to operate safeguards verification that the uses were only peaceful. A~ency projects would only be established subject to safeguards.
 With the conclusion of the Tlatelolco Treaty making Latin America a nuclear weapon free zone and the Non Proliferation Treaty, the Agency received a drastically increased job, namely to verify that all present and future nuclear material in States adhering to these Treaties remained in exclusively peaceful uses. There are now some 140 parties to the NPT.
<P>As a result of the Gulf War and Iraq's cease fire agreement with the United Nations, the Agency was given specific tasks by the Security Council. I must say we have learned a number of lessons in Iraq as we carry out this work.
<P>The deep secrecy in which Iraq conducted a massive nuclear weapons development and production programme   the extent of which we are still trying to determine   dramatically demonstrates the Agency's need for intelligence information in the future.
<P>In Resolution 687, which gave the IAEA unique rights, we were asked:
<P>To carry out immediate on site inspections to determine Iraq's nuclear capability;
<P>To develop a plan for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of nuclear related items which Iraq was not permitted to retain; and
<P>To develop a plan for future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations in the nuclear area under the Security Council's resolutions.
 These tasks have proven to be much larger, more complex and considerably more dramatic than we first expected, even though the IAEA has decades of on site inspections expertise, as well as state of the art equipment and laboratories in our Agency or at our command.
<P>The IAEA has conducted seven inspections in Iraq. They clearly show that Iraq blatantly violated its sworn pledges to not seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. This information was not disclosed by Iraq as it agreed to do under the terms of the cease fire, but was offered grudgingly when offered at all, only after inspectors had uncovered the existence of previously undeclared activities. And let me say that we are not at all confident that everything has been revealed, even now.
<P>As I noted earlier, our inspectors' discoveries have dramatically demonstrated our crucial need for information. It was intelligence information   high tech and human intelligence   that led to our teams uncovering the extent of Iraq's programme. The Agency's safeguards system is such that it cannot comb through every inch of a State, blindly searching for nuclear materials and installations. If the State fails to declare nuclear installations, as Iraq did, then we must learn through other sources where to look. The nuclear inspection teams that the IAEA and the Special Commission are sending to Iraq this year are provided with such information by Member States. This comes through the Special Commission which designates suspect sites for inspection.
<P>This convinces me that the ability of our inspectors to uncover possible undeclared nuclear material and installations would increase significantly if
<P>the IAEA were routinely provided with relevant information available to Member<BR>
~t,~t,~ h<BR>   have cei ~ <BR>about Irc<BR>I am now preparing to set up a small unit within my office to analyse information for any clues as to non declared material. It is intended to have two analysts plus two clerical staff for this purpose. They will examine inhouse information   mainly for the Safeguards Department. They should also follow media and periodicals for clues and information. And they should be ready to receive information from Member States, e.g. about any exports for sensitive equipment. They should also be ready to analyse information that Members may have from satellites and intelligence. They do not engage in intelligence collection   but in analysis and evaluation.
<P>There does not seem to be much point in laying down how Member States should convey information to the unit. It might be practical if a channel were established at the State's U~ Mission in Vienna. It might be practical further if there were routine, say quarterly reports and alarm reports, if anything urgent were to be transmitted.
<P>Any Member State could volunteer information to the unit and the unit would have to assess the value, and follow up. It would have to assess whether the information was credible.
<P>The unit would have to advise the Director General and the Deputy Director General for Safeguards whether explanations should be asked of a country because of specific information. And, if explanations were not deemed satisfactory, a special inspection should be requested.
<P>Tight rules regarding confidentiality would govern the work. (This applies already to the Safeguards Department). Selection of the personnel would evidently be such that Member States would be ready to work with them.
 In closing, let me say that the International Atomic Energy Agency ls an instrument of those who belong to it. The Agency's resources   both personnel and funds   have been severely strained by the ever increasing responsibilities being placed upon it. We welcome this acknowledgement of our capability, but feel it is past time to face the undeniable fact that additional work and responsibilities must entail additional funding. The success or failure of the International Atomic Energy Agency depends on its Members' will and commitment to the principles for which the IAEA stands.<HR>

<P>
Mr. President,
<P>I appreciate the opportunity to offer some information and comments to the Council regarding the fulfilment of the tasks laid upon the International Atomic Energy Agency in Resolution 687 (1991).  Needless to say the IAEA is at the disposal of the Security Council, through the Secretary General, at any time to give information regarding the mandate which the Council has given to the Agency.  With me is Professor Maurizio Zifferero, who is the Head of the Action Team for the Agency's work under the resolution.  Mr. Zifferero was himself leader of the second IAEA inspection team when the first denial of access occurred at Abu Ghareb.  If the Council so wishes, he will give information regarding the results of the first two inspections which were completed before Iraq made the declaration on 7 July.  He can also, if so desired, analyse that document and comment on what is covered by it and what may yet be missing.  Lastly he can give you an account of the findings of the third inspection team as of yesterday, Sunday.  Professor Zifferero will be assisted by several experts present here.
<P>Mr. President,
<P>In Resolution 687 (1991) the Security Council entrusted the Director General of the IAEA through the Secretary General with four tasks in which he should have the assistance and co operation of the Special Commission:
<P>First, to carry out immediate on site inspection of Iraq's nuclear capabilities based on Iraq's declarations and the designation of any additional locations by the Special Commission;
<P>Second, to develop a plan for submission to the Security Council within 45 days, i.e. 3 June, for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all nuclear related items which were proscribed
by the Council;
<P>Third, to carry out this plan within 45 days following approval by the Council;
<P>Fourth, to develop a plan within 120 days, i.e. 1 August, for the future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligation in the nuclear sphere under the resolution.
<P>The plan thus established by the Council is moving to fulfilment, although we all know not without difficulties.
<P>Although the first team of the IAEA went to Iraq in May, the phase of "immediate on site inspection" is still on, with some 35 inspectors currently working long hot days to inspect equipment and sites recently declared by Iraq or designated by the Special Commission.
<P>The reason for the extension of the inspection phase is, of course, that the inspection task has proved to be both large and complex and that Iraqi declarations have been incomplete.
<P>The Council did not prescribe that reports should be submitted to it on the results of immediate on site inspections, only that a plan be submitted concerning the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of proscribed nuclear items.  As a result of the denial of access by Iraqi military authorities to nuclear inspection teams and incomplete Iraqi declarations, the Council has nevertheless had to intervene in order to make full inspection of the Iraq nuclear capability possible.
<P>With increasing importance attached to the inspection process and its results, the IAEA has now submitted to the Council, through the Secretary General, a consolidated report on the first two inspection missions, which were completed before Iraq itself declared the existence of uranium enrichment programmes.  Even before results are available from analysis of samples taken, the findings of these two missions point clearly, as Professor Zifferero can explain, to uranium enrichment activities and even provide an assessment of the scope of these activities.
<P>The question is often asked whether there is any way in which through inspection we can be certain of obtaining knowledge about every gram of enriched uranium or about every relevant piece of nuclear equipment in a country.  The answer to this question, whether in the case of Iraq or any other country, is negative.  It is not possible for an international inspectorate to go to every building and basement in a country in search of nuclear relevant objects and material.  However, the right of the inspectorate to go to undeclared locations, even at short notice, a right which is unequivocally given for inspections in Iraq, which I think would be indispensable in a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East, and which I consider exists and can be used also in the safeguards system of the IAEA under the Non Proliferation Treaty, gives considerable teeth to the inspection system.  This presupposes, of course, that information on relevant undeclared locations is made available.  In the case of the immediate on site inspections in Iraq, the right to inspect undeclared locations is linked to designations by the Special Commission.
<P>In the case of the long term monitoring and verification in Iraq the preservation of the right to inspect undeclared locations on the basis of relevant information and the Security Council's continued backing and support would, I trust, provide the necessary means to assure the international community that there will be no prohibited nuclear activities in Iraq in the future.
<P>In this context let me report to the Security Council that I have concluded that the non declaration by Iraq to the IAEA until 7 July of a number of nuclear activities and of nuclear material relating to enrichment of uranium, constitutes non compliance by Iraq with its NPT safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  I have informed the Government of Iraq of this view in two letters and I have received replies which seek to explain the absence of declarations.  I have not found these explanations adequate and I have accordingly called a special meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA for Thursday, 18 July.  If the Board determines, as I expect it will, that there has been non compliance by Iraq of its safeguards obligations, it will report this conclusion pursuant to Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute to the Security Council and to the General Assembly.
<P>Mr. President,
<P>I have already touched on important points to be dealt with in the plan which the IAEA is requested to submit to the Council before 1 August concerning the future ongoing monitoring and verification in the nuclear field in Iraq.  Let me only add that the Agency's elaboration of this plan is on schedule.  We are basing our proposed plan on more than two decades of IAEA inspection experience and on the novel experience which we are gaining in Iraq.  We are also benefiting from comments by the Special Commission with which we are consulting about the plan.  As required by the Council the plan will take into account both the rights and obligations of Iraq under the NPT.  In view of Resolution 687 (1991) the plan will not allow any enrichment or reprocessing activities which are otherwise permissible under the NPT if declared and placed under safeguards.  We have also sought to elaborate this verification plan in such a way that it might be susceptible for use in discussions and negotiations on a nuclear weapon free zone or zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.
<P>Lastly, Mr. President, I would turn to the plan which the Security Council requested the Director General of the IAEA to submit for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of nuclear related items prohibited under Resolution 687 (1991).  A preliminary plan was submitted to the Council early in June.  It could not be completed as the inspection activities were not completed and also because the removal of highly enriched uranium, especially when irradiated, is a complex task that requires extensive planning.  I am pleased to report to the Council that this plan is moving forward satisfactorily.  The governments of France and the United Kingdom have  indicated to us that commercial nuclear enterprises in these two countries are ready to undertake the operation of removal and the further handling of the material, provided that we can give assurances about the financing.  Experts from these two countries are already in Baghdad with our inspection team to assess how the operation can best be carried out.  The IAEA will submit supplementary reports to the Council as it becomes clear to us what needs to be removed, destroyed or rendered harmless and how this is to be done.  Our expectation is that the some 12.5 kg of non irradiated, highly enriched uranium now in Agency custody can be removed by September.  Removal of irradiated, highly enriched uranium likewise under Agency custody will require a few months more of preparations.<HR>

<P><HR>
<P>
I appreciate the opportunity again informally to provide the Security Council with some information concerning the fulfilment by the IAEA of tasks given to it by the Council under Resolution 687 (1991).
<P>On 15 July, Professor Zifferero, the Leader of the Agency's Action Team reported to the Council on what we had learnt about the Iraqi nuclear capability through our first two inspection missions.  Today, Mr. Perricos will tell you about the considerable amount of knowledge which was gained by the third team, which he headed and which came to Baghdad one day before the Iraqi declaration of 7 July.  With Mr. Perricos today is Mr. Thorne, who has been on several missions to Baghdad and who was one of the inspectors involved in the shooting incident.  The fourth member of the IAEA Action Team is. Mr.Kay, who headed the team which was denied access at the Falluja site and which identified the caravan of trucks.  He is again in Baghdad now, leading the fourth inspection mission.
<P>The Action Team of the IAEA for activities under Resolution 687 (1991) consists of only these four full time professionals and two secretaries.  However, our Safeguards Department provides many inspectors to the teams and the participation of some experts is arranged through the Special Commission in New York or through governments.  To date we have performed altogether around 1000 inspection man days.
<P>The fourth team is expecting to stay aabout two weeks, following up on the findings of the third team and inspecting further sites designated by the Special Commission.  A list, which was promised in a letter to Mr. Perricos on 24 July and which has now been given to Mr. Kay of nuclear material and equipment, some of which was found after Mr. Perricos' departure, does not seem to provide anything dramatically new, but adds to the picture that Mr.Perricos will give you.
<P>I think you will find that the picture of the EMIS programme is now a rather detailed one.  This, of course, is not to say that it is a full picture.  We are not, for instance, in a position to confirm Iraq's statements that only about half a kilogram of uranium at an average enrichment level of 4% had been produced.
<P>At the informal meeting of the Security Council on 15 July I said I could not see any peaceful purpose in Iraq's enrichment programme.  The method used for enrichment, EMIS, was extremely expensive and it would be uneconomic to produce enriched uranium by this method, when enriched material for peaceful purposes is abundant in the world market.  Moreover, Iraq's nuclear power programme was not very advanced.
<P>In the report of the third inspection team, it is recorded that the leader of the Iraqi enrichment programme, Dr. Jaffar, explained that the primary aim of the programme was to develop a technological and industrial infrastructure.  Secondly, it was suggested, enriched uranium was needed for the research reactors and for a future nuclear power programme.  Neither explanation is convincing.  A technological and industrial infrastructure may                                       
be a spin off of a programme of enrichment but hardly the primary aim of it.  As regards fuel for research reactors and a future power programme, I must reiterate the comment that low enriched uranium is available at a much lower production cost than that which could have been achieved in Iraq.  The third inspection team report notes another detail that seems of interest in this context, namely the combination in the Iraqi EMIS programme of high capacity/modest separation and low capacity/high separation would be particularly useful if the goal was to produce highly enriched uranium.
<P>With your permission, I shall report today on two important matters.  First, the action by the Board of Governors of the IAEA on 18 July to declare Iraq in non compliance with the safeguards obligations of the country.  Secondly, the plan which has just been submitted by the IAEA concerning the future ongoing monitoring and verification in Iraq as required in paragraph 13 of Security Council Resolution 687 (1991).
<P>An examination by the IAEA of the lists that were attached to Iraq's  declaration of 7 July showed that some of the nuclear material should have been reported to the Agency under the safeguards agreement concluded by Iraq pursuant to the country's adherence to the Non Proliferation Treaty.  This conclusion was communicated by me to Iraq, which made two principal points in reply.  First, that the quantities of material which should have been declared were insignificant.  Secondly, that having now declared them, Iraq was no longer in non compliance with its safeguards agreement but had taken requisite corrective action.
<P>This correspondence was reported to the Board of Governors of the IAEA with the comment that the duty to report nuclear materials exists regardless of what the quantities are.  When the Board met, it had furgher been made clear that the Tarmiya site had been in operation and that some uranium had, in fact, been enriched there.  Accordingly, design information about Tarmiya should have been given to the Agency.
<P>As reported to the Security Council, in accordance with Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute and Article III:2 of the Agreement governing the relationship between the United Nations and the Agency, the Board of Governors of the IAEA found that Iraq had not complied with its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency.  It condemned this non compliance and called on the Government of Iraq to remedy its non compliance and to place all nuclear material, regardless of quantity and location, under Agency safeguards.
<P>Subsequent to the action by the IAEA Board, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, in a letter addressed to the Secretary General of the Unted Nations<HR>

<P>
Mr. President,
<P>Security Council resolution 687 did not foresee any reporting to the Council on the results of the IAEA's immediate on site inspection of Iraq's nuclear activities.  As I have the privilege today, for the third time, of briefing the Council, it is mainly because the task of mapping Iraq's nuclear activities has proved to be much larger and much more arduous than expected.
<P>Up to the present time the six teams sent to Iraq by the IAEA have devoted over 2000 man days to inspection tours to Iraq under the direction of the Action Team in Vienna and our own laboratories have devoted many man months to analysing samples taken in Iraq.  Despite this considerable effort and the uncovering and mapping of large nuclear programmes we cannot report that we have yet mapped the total programme.
<P>One would have hoped that when explicitly accepting resolution 687, Iraq would have been determined fully and sincerely to comply with the duty to declare "any research, development, support or manufacturing facilities" related to nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons usable material".  Yet, it was only after the IAEA team in dramatic circumstances obtained pictures revealing                                       
the EMIS enrichment programme, that Iraq began to provide information about the enrichment programmes.  And although it would seem evident that designing and experimenting for the production of nuclear weapons constitute "research and development" in the language of resolution 687, Iraq chose not to declare the activities which produced the documentary material discovered by the Agency team on 23September.  It would evidently save much time, effort and pain if Iraq took a new look at resolutions 687 and 707, decided to make a clean break with the past, declare all that there is to declare and co operate with the IAEA in destroying, removing or rendering harmless what cannot be retained.  On Friday last week   4 October   I sent a letter to the Foreign Minister of Iraq urging that such an attitude be at last taken.
<P>Failing such an attitude the patient compilation of facts through mission after mission will continue.  The seventh team will be on its way this week.
<P>I should like to report today on the results of the fifth and sixth IAEA nuclear inspections, on some questions they have given rise to, on the plan submitted by the Agency for future ongoing monitoring and verification and on our work to prepare for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of items which are in contravention of resolutions 687 and 707.
<P>May I preface these remarks by telling the Council that the Board of Governors of the IAEA on 13 September concluded a second time that Iraq was in non compliance with its nuclear non proliferation obligations and the General Conference of the IAEA adopted a resolution to the same effect   GC(XXXV)/RES/568.  These actions have been reported to the United Nations.
<P>The fifth inspection team, consisting of 11 IAEA staff members and four non IAEA experts, had an uneventful but productive visit, adding to our knowledge about the Iraqi nuclear programme.  It had barely left Iraq when the sixth team went in and, in dramatic circumstances, during its first two days, uncovered documentary material showing, inter alia, that an advanced and sophisticated nuclear weapons programme was underway.
<P>I shall not dwell on the violations by Iraqi authorities of the rights of the inspectors, e.g. in forcibly taking back documents, and in denying the inspectors freedom of movement.  The Chief Inspector of the sixth team, Mr.David Kay, is with me and can answer any questions you may wish to put to him.  The Council was itself very actively involved in protecting the security and release of the team.  I should like to express the appreciation of the IAEA for the effective backing given to the team by the Security Council and the Chairman of the Special Commission.
<P>The report is self explanatory, but a few comments may be appropriate.
<P>This was the first time that a team went to examine documents in order to map the programme.  The results show that the approach was amply justified.  Although much documentation had been removed from the first inspection site before the inspectors arrived and although some documents and microfiches forcibly taken from the inspectors on Monday, 23 September were not returned to them, enough material remained to offer dramatic revelations.
<P>The sixth inspection team had 45 members:  44 men and one woman.  Owing to its special task of scanning documents in Arabic in search of evidence regarding the nuclear programme, the composition was somewhat special.  There were three members from the IAEA:  Mr. Kay and two Arab speaking staff members with nuclear training.  One member came from UNSCOM, namely its Deputy Executive Chairman, Mr. Robert Gallucci.  The 41 other members were recruited from the outside, many from the United States, others from Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, UK and other countries.
<P>The next point I should like to make is that the report submitted to you through the Secretary General is a first report.  The results which were uncovered by scanning of documents and by the translation and analysis of some documents were such that a delay in reporting to the Council was not deemed acceptable.  A vast amount of documentary material in Arabic is now collected and must be more closely scanned and, in part, translated and analysed.  When this is done a full report will be drafted.  We must also insist that Iraq provides relevant documents, including those which we have not succeeded in securing.  I have been informed that the Chairman of the Special Commission during his visit to Baghdad a few days ago has transmitted such a request, on behalf of UNSCOM.  This parallels my letter of 4 October to Iraq's Foreign Minister, which I mentioned a moment ago.  I hope Iraq will fully and speedily respond to our respective requests by an additional declaration directed in accordance with resolution 687 to the Secretary General and the Director General of the IAEA.
<P>The key result of the sixth inspection is the uncovering of documents that show conclusively that Iraq was very well advanced in a programme to develop an implosion type nuclear weapon and that links existed to a surface to surface missile project.  Indeed, so advanced has the programme been deemed to be that the time needed to reach bomb making capacity seems to have been determined by the time required for the enrichment activities rather than the weapons design activities.  A significant document secured on 23September and translated into English is now appended to the report of the sixth inspection.  The document is available also in the Arabic original.  I have requested that both the report and the appended document should be circulated as a Security Council document.  Other documents will undoubtedly provide further insights.  One such document shows that an effort was underway to produce Lithium 6, a substance that has only one use   namely, in thermo 
nuclear weapons.
<P>The sixth inspection has also found evidence of broad based Iraqi international procurement efforts.  It is possible   even probable   that some of the procurement that has taken place, e.g. of sensitive equipment or material, has occurred in violation of laws of States from which the export originated.  However, much, if not most of the procurement of which evidence will be available, will be found to pertain to equipment and material not subject to export controls anywhere.  The material must therefore be handled responsibly.  The IAEA and UNSCOM are consulting on guidelines for the handling of this documentary material and other such material that may be secured in Iraq.  Some time will be needed simply for translation and analysis.  As the inspections take place under a mandate from the Security Council, it goes without saying that any directive which the Council may adopt, would be followed.
<P>Just as the evidence concerning a broad based Iraqi international procurement programme raises questions regarding the effectiveness of various international efforts to prevent trade in nuclear weapons relevant equipment, the uncovering of the undeclared facilities for uranium enrichment has led to public criticism of the safeguards system linked to the NPT, as presently organized.
<P>The lessons from Iraq are almost written on the wall.  No inspection system can blindly grope for undeclared facilities.  In the case of Iraq information secured by Member States has been made available to the inspecting teams, thereby leading them with great success to sites deserving inspection. 
<P>At the request of the Board of Governors of the IAEA I am now preparing a proposal for a mechanism and a procedure in the IAEA through which Member States may make information available to a special secretariat unit in the IAEA regarding the possible existence of undeclared nuclear facilities in NPT States.  If such information is deemed credible, the Secretariat may request a special inspection to verify it.  Should the State in question decline such an inspection, the Board of Governors could, in the last instance, submit the matter to the Security Council.  The inspectorate cannot force its way to an inspection and even the Board of Governors does not dispose of powerful sanctions.  If enforcement were to be needed, the right to bring it about is vested in this Council.
<P>In a world of accelerating nuclear disarmament and universal or near universal adherence to non proliferation agreements, regional or global, it becomes even more important that confidence can be placed in the non proliferation pledges.  Truly effective verification is indispensible.  The procedure and mechanism which I have described would draw on the vast nuclear inspection experience and capacity which exists in the IAEA   and which has been successfully used in Iraq.  They would build on already existing rights of inspection under safeguards agreements and they could, in the last resort, be backed up by the Security Council.
<P>With your permission, I would like now to make a few comments on the IAEA's plan for the future ongoing monitoring and verification of nuclear activities in Iraq.  A great deal of consultation has taken place between the Agency and UNSCOM to ensure that the two plans are consistent.  The far 
reaching provisions of Security Council resolutions 687 and 707 have necessitated correspondingly far reaching rights for the monitoring and verification.  Indeed, so long as it is not absolutely certain that immediate on site verification has successfully uncovered and mapped all nuclear facilities, it will be vital to apply continuous extensive and intensive monitoring and verification.
<P>On one minor point I should like to introduce a correction in the Agency's draft.  In paragraph 18 it is stated that the "Agency will continue to provide information concerning the conduct and results of Agency inspections and related activities in order to assist the Special Commission in carrying out this task."  It should be corrected to read "its tasks under resolution 687, in particular the task to designate sites for nuclear inspection."  It is obviously especially important that results from nuclear inspections under Agency authority should be fed back to the Commission to assist it in its task of making further designations.
<P>The last point I should comment on is the duty of the IAEA under resolution 687 to prepare for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of items which Iraq is forbidden to retain under resolutions 687 and 707.  In compliance with paragraph 13 of resolution 687 a plan was submitted to the Council on this matter on 16 May 1991 (document S/22615).  In implementation of this plan, which we have assumed is acceptable to the Council, arrangements are underway for the removal from Iraq of its declared nuclear weapons usable material.  I expect that the fresh fuel will be removed from Iraq within the next month and the irradiated fuel   provided that funds are available   toward the end of the year.  Arrangements are also underway for the destruction under Agency supervision of equipment and material which is evidently and directly linked to the items prohibited under paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991).  This includes equipment such as that covered in the electromagnetic isotope separation programme, the centrifuge programme, weaponization activities, etc.  Plans regarding destruction or rendering harmless of buildings of the facilities related to the programme may be submitted to the Council as a supplement to the Agency May plan.
<P>One nuclear capacity that remains in Iraq are the many well trained scientists and engineers, and this was part of the reason for the effort during the sixth inspection to identify the scientific and technical cadres involved in the clandestine Iraqi nuclear programme.  However, it should be possible to ensure through close future ongoing monitoring of nuclear activities in Iraq that this wealth of talent and skill will be used only for peaceful purposes.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Statement to the Forty-sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly</H3>    
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix, IAEA Director General</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New York, USA</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>21 October 1991</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
It is my privilege to present the Annual Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency for 1990 to the General Assembly and to describe the activities of the Agency up to the present moment.  I think it is true to say that at no time have the wheels of Agency machinery spun faster than during the year that has passed since I last reported to the Assembly in October 1990.  I propose to report today on our activities under six different headings:
<P>The Agency's work in Iraq on the basis of Security Council resolutions;
<P>The lessons of Iraq and the progress in the non proliferation regime;
<P>The Agency's work in the field of nuclear safety;
<P>Environment, development and energy;
<P>The transfer of nuclear techniques for development;
<P>The role of the IAEA in the medium term.
<P><B>IAEA's work in Iraq on the basis of Security Council resolutions</B>
<P>In resolution 687 (1991) the Security Council requested the Director General of the IAEA to undertake three tasks:
<P>To carry out immediate on site inspection of Iraq's nuclear capabilities;
<P>To develop a plan for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless of nuclear related items which Iraq was not permitted to retain;
<P>To develop a plan for future ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations in the nuclear sphere under the Security Council resolutions.
<P>The tasks thus laid upon the Agency have proved to be much larger, more complex and more dramatic than first expected.  Even though the Agency is operating the world's first on site inspection system and is able to draw on decades of experience in the field of nuclear inspections and utilize many inspectors of its own as well as expertise, equipment and laboratories of its own, the work is very exacting.
<P>Iraq is a party to the Non Proliferation Treaty and has pledged under that Treaty not to develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.  It has also pledged under a safeguards agreement with the IAEA to place all its nuclear material under safeguards.  To the regret and shock of the world community, Iraq has been found not to have respected these pledges.  The Board of Governors of the IAEA has twice declared Iraq in non compliance with its safeguards obligations and the General Conference of the IAEA last month condemned Iraq's non compliance with its nuclear non proliferation obligations, including its safeguards agreement with the IAEA (GC(XXXV)/RES/568).
<P>In performing the tasks laid upon it, the Agency has the assistance and co operation of the Special Commission which has been set up by the Secretary General as requested by the Security Council and which   on the basis of information made available to it by Member States   designates sites for nuclear inspection in addition to such sites as have been declared by Iraq.  The Commission, which in the fields of biological and chemical weapons and missiles has tasks similar to those entrusted to the Agency under the Security Council resolution 687, also provides the Agency with logistics and some expertise.
<P>Iraq expressly accepted resolution 687 and thereby obtained a cease fire ending the armed action authorized by the Security Council.  Had Iraq disclosed the whole of its nuclear programme within the time specified by the Council, the inspection task laid upon the IAEA would still have been large but not so difficult.  As it is, Iraq has reluctantly made disclosures and then only when enough evidence had become available through inspections to allow conclusions about the existence of previously undeclared activities.  This, indeed, is a painful and laborious way of having the programmes disclosed.  Moreover, as no one feels confident that everything has been revealed, close future monitoring is a necessity to preclude new surprises.
<P>As of now the IAEA has sent seven inspection teams which have spent altogether over 2000 person days on mission.  Our Action Team in Vienna has devoted many man months directing the activities and large numbers of samples have been taken and been analysed in the Agency's own laboratories.
<P>What has been disclosed through the missions sent by the IAEA has stunned the world:  vast undeclared and unknown programmes in the billion dollar range for the enrichment of uranium and   recently   documentary evidence of an advanced nuclear weapons development programme.  The reports which I have from the seventh team sent by the IAEA and which has just concluded its mission, is that although Iraq asserts that no political decision was taken to make a nuclear bomb, the scientific and technical programme for weapons development is affirmed and information is given about it.
<P>The immediate further tasks before the IAEA in Iraq are to remove some quantities of highly enriched uranium fuel, which were under safeguards and to plan the destruction or neutralization of nuclear related items which Iraq is not allowed to retain.  Lastly the Agency is to organize and maintain future ongoing monitoring as a check against any possible revival of the clandestine programme.  The Agency plan in this regard was approved recently by Security Council resolution 715 (1991).
<P><B>The lessons of Iraq and the non proliferation regime</B>
<P>How is it that the large nuclear programme that has been mapped through half a dozen inspection teams sent by the IAEA escaped the Agency's regular NPT inspections in past years?  What lessons are we to draw to avoid any further surprises of this kind?
<P>The first lesson is the crucial importance of information.  The safeguards system is expected to discover the diversion of a significant quantity of nuclear material in installations which are under safeguards but no inspectorate can comb through the territory of a State in blind search of nuclear installations and material that should have been declared and placed under safeguards.  If the State itself fails to declare nuclear installations   as Iraq did   the inspectorate must learn through other sources where to look.  The nuclear inspection teams sent to Iraq this year have been provided with such information by Member States, through the Special Commission, designating suspected sites for inspection.
<P>The second lesson is the importance of an unequivocal right of inspectors to go anywhere unimpeded and the third lesson is the value of powerful support when this right of access is not respected.  Resolution 687 and the Security Council provide these two elements.
<P>What we can learn from these lessons is that the ability of the regular IAEA inspections under the NPT, Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties to uncover possible undeclared nuclear installations and material would increase drastically if the IAEA were to be routinely provided with relevant information available to Member States, e.g. through satellites.  The right which exists under IAEA NPT type safeguards agreements to perform so called "special inspections"   and which has so far been used only with regard to declared installations   might then be used to request inspection of undeclared installations and material which, it is reasonably believed, should have been declared.  If such a request were to be rejected, the Board of Governors of the IAEA might submit the matter to the Security Council.  In this manner a procedure would be in place to uphold obligations under non proliferation treaties and safeguards agreements.  Within the IAEA, discussions about a procedure of this kind have already begun.
<P>Some additional comments are warranted on this important matter.  First, the further nuclear disarmament advances among nuclear weapon States and the closer non proliferation commitments approach universality, the more important becomes full compliance with the non proliferation commitments.  Second, it may be assumed that the very existence of a verification system with more teeth would have a certain deterrent effect on potential violators.  Thirdly, although another case like Iraq may not occur again in a world moving toward nuclear disarmament and non proliferation   whether under global or regional treaties   the eventuality cannot be excluded and effective procedures must be in place to meet it.
<P>The defiance of the Non Proliferation Treaty by one State should not lead us to overlook that significant progress has recently been made in the field of non proliferation.  Argentina and Brazil agreed to open up their nuclear sectors to each other and are in the process of concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  South Africa has adhered to the NPT and concluded a full scope safeguards agreement with the IAEA.  Several other States in Southern Africa have, likewise, recently joined the NPT, making the objective of a nuclear weapon free African continent seem attainable.  I should also mention that Lithuania has acceded to the Treaty, and the Ukraine has declared its intention to do the same.  This means that many nuclear installations not previously covered by IAEA safeguards will, in future, be safeguarded.  In addition, China and France have made it clear that they will adhere to the NPT, thus including among the parties to the treaty all declared nuclear weapon States.
<P>In the Middle East a nuclear weapon free zone, although a difficult objective, is on everybody's agenda and could be a realistic possibility with the convening of the peace conference.  There is already a recognition among the States of the region that in such a zone with a legacy of fear and suspicion there is a need for a comprehensive verification regime.  Concepts such as mutual inspection between the parties and challenge inspections are already being discussed as important features of such a regime.  Last month, the General Conference of the IAEA decided by consensus to request the Director General of the Agency "to take such measures as are necessary to facilitate the early application of full scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East, and in particular to prepare a model agreement taking into account the views of the States in the region, as a necessary step towards the creation of a nuclear weapon free zone."  While it is obvious that a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East will have to be negotiated between the parties, a technical input provided by the Agency with its broad experience of verification measures, could be a useful contribution to the negotiating process.
<P>Considering all these facts, it does not seem too daring, in the present international climate, to aim at and hope for both accelerated nuclear disarmament by nuclear weapon States and universal commitment to non proliferation on the part of non nuclear weapon States by 1995, when the extension of the NPT is to be examined.  This should be our ambition.
<P>The Agency's work in the field of nuclear safety
<P>Next I should like to make some comments on the activities of the IAEA in the field of nuclear safety.  Anti nuclear critics of the Agency sometimes urge that the Agency should not "promote" the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Maybe this criticism is based on a misunderstanding.  The principal means through which the IAEA "promotes" nuclear energy are through international measures to strengthen safety in the operation in nuclear power plants and in the disposal of radioactive waste.  This type of "promotion", one would think, should be acceptable to all.
<P>Although the operators and owners of nuclear plants and the authorities of the States in which they are located carry the responsibility for the safety of the plants, there is more and more international co operation, harmonization and even legislation relating to nuclear safety.  The IAEA is the centre of many of these activities.
<P>The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was subjected within months to an international inquiry at the IAEA in Vienna to enable nuclear scientists and engineers from all over the world to understand the causes of and the course of the accident.  Since then the Agency has assisted Soviet, Ukrainian and Belarussian institutions in organizing a permanent international research centre in the Chernobyl area, where scientific institutes from all over the world can undertake joint research.  At the request of the Soviet Government the Agency has also helped in the last two years to organize an international assessment of the radiological and health consequences of the accident.  Together with six other international organizations, including the WHO, FAO and the Commission of the European Communities, the Agency sent nearly 40 technical missions involving about 200 independent experts to the areas affected by the Chernobyl accident to obtain data for scientifically based conclusions in these controversial matters.  Thousands of persons were examined and thousands of samples of food, soil and water were analysed.
<P>An international scientific committee, headed by Professor Itsuzo Shigematsu, Director of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima, Japan, was responsible for the working plan and for the report, which was subjected to discussion at a conference in Vienna in May this year.  Although the psychological consequences of the accident were found to be grave   with much anxiety, fear and lack of confidence in authorities   and although the general health situation showed deficiencies, significant differences were not found in the health of people living in villages with relatively high radiation contamination and those living in villages with low contamination.  This conlusion is not accepted by everyone and it is at variance with the images that some of the media have transmitted   but it is consistent with prior, more limited, reports by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), WHO and of the League of Red Cross Societies.  Follow up studies are needed of many people who took part in the clean up operations and of people who were evacuated.  Long term national and international studies of the health of the population and of the areas most affected by the accident are organized and will eventually give the world a full and hopefully final picture of the health and environmental consequences of the accident.
<P>The study undertaken in 1990 and 1991 left no doubt about the very difficult social and economic situation of the people living in the area affected by the Chernobyl accident and the IAEA supports the work undertaken by the Inter Agency Task Force on Chernobyl established following consideration of the consequences of the accident by ECOSOC and the General Assembly last year.
<P>The developments in Eastern and Central Europe, including the Soviet Union, have led to a strong interest   not only within the countries in the region but also internationally   in examining and upgrading nuclear power safety in the region.  The Agency is intensely engaged as a focal point for and as an instrument of efforts in this regard.  A special project was set up to examine the safety of the oldest type of Soviet designed reactors, the WWER440/230.  Some reactors of this type were closed in Germany following the reunification of the country.  Particular attention has been given to the reactors of this type at Kozloduy in Bulgaria.  Following a report by the IAEA that the safety of this plant was unsatisfactory, broad international efforts, including the Commission of the European Communities as well as individual European countries, the United States and others were initiated.
<P>Recently the Soviet Union proposed that the IAEA should undertake another special project   namely examining safety questions relating to the RBMK type   or Chernobyl type   of reactor.  I am confident that the Agency can bring together nuclear experts to analyse, assess and advise on the safety problems of this type of reactor, which is found in the Russian Federation, in the Ukraine and in Lithuania.
<P>The Chernobyl accident in 1986 triggered a broad IAEA programme aimed at the gradual creation of an international nuclear safety regime.  Basic principles of nuclear safety have been worked out, nuclear safety standards have been updated and many new services using international experts have been offered to Member States   often against payment by them.  This year a special conference of government policy makers in the field of nuclear safety met in Vienna and charted the next leg of the journey to an international nuclear safety regime.
<P>Among the many proposals from the Conference was one aimed at the elaboration of a binding framework convention on nuclear safety.  While individual countries will no doubt continue to assert their exclusive responsibility for the safety of nuclear installations on their territories   and indeed nothing should be done to relieve them of that responsibility   a framework convention, in my judgement, may mark the beginning of a recognition that some standards and rules in the field of nuclear safety must be defined internationally and must be made mandatory, e.g. relating to basic principles of nuclear safety, incident reporting and the transboundary movement of radioactive waste.  The range of rules and standards included in a framework convention may be limited at the beginning and may expand as experience is gained.  They would be based on the awareness that it is unacceptable to the international community that nuclear safety is substandard anywhere in the world.
<P><B>Environment, development and energy</B>
<P>In response to a request by the General Assembly following the so called Brundtland Report a few years ago, the IAEA surveyed its programmes and reported on the extent to which they were relevant to the subject of Environment and Development.  A follow up of this survey is being prepared in time for the UN Conference in Rio next year.  A large number of the Agency's development co operation programmes, especially in agriculture and in industry, are directly beneficial not only for development but also for the environment.  For instance, nuclear techniques frequently offer the best means of monitoring the presence and concentration of pollutants.  The IAEA's Marine Laboratory in Monaco which has much experience in monitoring pollution in the Persian Gulf and possesses an important data base from this work, is now playing an important role in the international efforts regarding the Gulf.  Continued emphasis on environmental monitoring and protection is being maintained in our programme.
<P>Most interesting   but also most controversial   is the question of the potential importance of nuclear power to help reduce the emissions of CO2 which result from the burning of all fossil fuels and which are believed to contribute to global warming.
<P>The summit meetings of industrialized States have repeatedly recognized that "nuclear energy can play a significant role in reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions".  Such a role is so far vehemently opposed by various anti nuclear groups which usually recommend energy saving and a wider use of renewable sources of energy.  The adequacy of these methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is doubted by others and no consensus has yet emerged.
<P>There is no intergovernmental organization which deals with all sources of energy and which is capable of studying and comparing the health and environmental impacts of various sources and uses of energy.  Therefore a number of organizations, including the IAEA, the World Bank, WHO, UNEP and the Commission of the European Communities decided to organize a joint comparative study of the environmental and health effects of different energy systems for electricity generation and of the prospects of increasing efficiency in the energy use or of foregoing energy services.  The study was discussed last May in Helsinki at a Senior Expert Symposium, and several of the important conclusions reached at the Symposium have been submitted to the Preparatory Committee for the Rio Conference. Among these I might mention:
<P>That the global demand for electricity will continue to increase, subject only to constraints on economic growth;
<P>That efficiency improvements have a substantial potential to reduce environmental impacts and should be pursued vigorously.  However, such improvements will not eliminate the need for new plants to meet the growing demand; and
<P>That nuclear power is the most likely non fossil source which can be deployed on a large scale and with costs competitive with fossil fuels for base load generation.  Nuclear energy has therefore the potential to make a significant contribution toward a reduction in carbon emissions, but its social acceptability remains in question.
<P>The possible greenhouse effect and the ways which are open to the world to counter it are among the most important topics on the global agenda.  It would be desirable that dispassionate studies be made as input to this discussion.  The conclusions of the Helsinki Symposium are intended to constitute such inputs.
<P><B>The transfer of nuclear techniques for development</B>
<P>A few developing countries are successfully making use of nuclear power and this source of energy is of potential future interest in the developing world especially where there is a lack of indigenous sources of energy or a need to desalinate sea water.  However, the primary interest of most developing countries in the IAEA lies in non power related nuclear techniques:  in medicine, agriculture and industry.  Let me mention only two examples among many to give an idea of the type of technical co operation activities that are currently pursued in the field of nuclear energy.
<P>The sterilization of insects through the irradiation of pupae has proved to be a very effective way to eradicate some insect pests.  When released in overwhelming numbers in a particular zone, sterilized males mate with fertile females but no offspring are produced.  This technique   the so called Sterile Male Technique   has been championed by the IAEA.  In a large programme led by the FAO, the Agency recently helped to eradicate the New World Screwworm in Libya with the help of this technique.  In 1990, over 12 000 livestock were found infested with this lethal pest in Libya.  This year, 1991, only six cases were recorded and, since April, not one single case!  It is certainly a relief that this pest, which might have spread and affected livestock and wild life in the whole African continent, has been eradicated   and this without an extensive use of chemical pesticides.
<P>A second current example of the Agency helping to transfer a nuclear technique relates to the removal of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from flue gases in coal power stations.  Through the use of electron beams those gases are transformed into fertilizers.  In April this year, a pilot plant, installed at a thermal power station in Warsaw, started up.  It is the largest demonstration plant of its kind in the world,.  Approximately 90% of the sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in flue gases can be removed by two electron beam machines of 50 kW each.  This project will show how promising the technique may be to clean up exhaust gases from commercial power stations, incineration plants and other industrial plants.
<P><B>The role of the IAEA in the medium term</B>
<P>A few comments summing up the Agency's principal tasks in the medium term.  The central task of the Agency has always been to contribute to the "taming" of nuclear power:  to promote nuclear arms control and confidence in such control by safeguards verification and to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy by the transfer of technology and by co operation.
<P>In today's international climate new challenges and opportunities arise and the IAEA and other intergovernmental organizations must adapt their programmes to meet these challenges.
<P>Effective verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is becoming increasingly needed for regional and global confidence and for nuclear disarmament.  In a new international order, a much strengthened safeguards system is required to give assurance that non proliferation pledges are respected   whether globally or in nuclear weapon free zones.  Perhaps one day also to verify that nuclear material released through nuclear disarmament and transferred to peaceful uses, remain in such uses.
<P>What we may term an international nuclear safety regime must evolve to give confidence that the safety of nuclear power operations and of nuclear waste disposal is high everywhere in the world.  The Agency is the natural birthplace for such a regime, which is also required for nuclear power to become a viable option to meet a substantial part of the world's future energy needs.
<P>The Agency must further increasingly assist developing countries in making use of nuclear techniques in their efforts to catch up with the industrialized countries.  To take a few examples:  they can use irradiation techniques to produce new useful mutants of many plants.  They can employ nuclear techniques for medical diagnosis and for the combat of cancer and they can adopt nuclear techniques for non destructive testing to achieve quality control in the industrial sphere.
<P>In addressing squarely new issues concerning safeguards, nuclear safety and the transfer of technology, the IAEA is adapting to face the problems of a continuously changing world.
<HR>
<P>A political readiness to identify and meet new challenges, regrettably, is not enough to achieve results.  Adequate resources in personnel and money are also crucial and I shall conclude with a brief comment on each of these two matters:
<P>If, during the past seven years, the Agency has been able to deliver an increased programme with a zero real growth budget and to respond promptly to unforeseen important tasks, it is in great part due to the enthusiasm, dynamism and versatility of our staff.  The way in which we recruit and remunerate staff is important for our ability to accomplish our objective.  We pursue in the Agency a policy of staff rotation.  The majority of professional staff serve five to seven years.  This has enabled us to have a continuous inflow of fresh talent and a corresponding outflow into the national nuclear communities of professionals who know how the Agency functions can best be used by their countries.  We have every intention to continue this policy, but I must report that we find it increasingly difficult to attract highly technical specialists in some sectors of our work.  The pay and conditions of service offered by the United Nations Common System are no longer attractive for many specialists.  If we are to remain highly effective a way must be found to allow for some flexibility in the conditions of employment of professional staff.
<P>As to financial resources, let me say it cannot be a rational order for major contributors, who eventually do pay their dues, to do this so late in the budgetary year that the international organizations which receive the dues   including the IAEA   are perennially on the brink of economic disaster.  Nor can it be a rational order to be so wedded to the concept of zero budgetary growth that vital international needs are inadequately looked after.
<P>A new international order must have effective international organizations.  This requires effective co operation between Member States, skilled and motivated Secretariat staff and adequate and timely financing.
<P>Lastly, I should like to express in this forum the thanks of the IAEA to the Government of Austria, which is an excellent host to all the international organizations which are located in Vienna.<HR>

<TITLE>STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL TO THE INFORMAL MEETING OF MEMBER STATES</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN =CENTER>STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL TO THE INFORMAL MEETING OF MEMBER STATES
ON PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 1991- 92 </H3>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna,Austria</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>19 February 1990</H4>
<P> 
<HR>    
<P>
In my statement to the Board a year ago, I indicated that the work on
formulating the 1991- 92 programme and budget would take place in three stages:
<P><UL>
<LI>(i)  Assessment of trends in the nuclear field and an outline of the proposed programme   July 1989;
<LI>(ii)  Preparation of the revised outline of the programme and initial budget estimates    October 1989;
<LI>(iii)  Preparation of the detailed programme and a draft budget January 1990;
</UL>
<P>With some delays the above information was distributed to Missions, and that related to the first two stages was the subject of active consultations. We are now in the middle of consultations on the detailed programme and budget, of which today's meeting is an important element.  The documentation distributed in the second and third stages also contained information on changes introduced in the content of the programme and budget in response to
the .
<P>The documentation made available to you so far contains ample information both on general aspects of the programme   for example, changes in comparison with 1989 - 90 and the identification of problems and their priority ranking as well as a detailed list of tasks planned for implementation during 1991 - 92.  Detailed budget figures for both 1991 and 1992 have also been provided.  There seems to be no need for me to go into details on the programme and budget today.  As on previous occasions we are ready to provide you with any explanations or additional information requested either in the course of this meeting or later.
<P>I would like to make some general observations concerning the budget. The initial budget estimates made in October last year indicated that our needs exceeded the 1990 level by US $6.4 million, which is 4.1% in real terms.  This growth was mainly the result of growing needs in the area of "Safeguards" and '"Direction and Support"", which were explained both in the documents distributed and at the briefing meetings.  Almost no further budget growth was planned for 1992.  Being aware of potential reservations that many countries might have regarding such growth in the budget, in my paper of 7 November 1989 I put forward the idea of seeking voluntary contributions which would be earmarked for specific activities or equipment and which would reduce the level of Regular Budget funds needed.  Specific activities that could be financed from such voluntary contributions were suggested in the paper of 7 November.  In the responses received from groups of Member States no specific offer of voluntary contributions was made.  Rather" I was given to understand that the overall level of the Regular Budget in real terms for 1991 should remain at the 1990 level.
In my Note of 2 February 1990 I explained the reasons for my concern in this connection.  As it was not possible to achieve zero real growth in the budget for 1991 by introducing economy measures, cuts in the substance of the programme were necessary.  I considered it important, for the sake of transparency in the programme budget process, to explain which activities had been reduced as a result of budget reductions.  These are shown in Annex B to my Note.  It should be pointed out that a substantial part of these reductions was achieved through the proposed postponement to 1992 of part of actions originally planned for 1991.
<P>In the light of the information on how the 1991 budget was reduced practically to the zero growth level, Member States may wish to revert to the idea of providing the Agency with some additional resources either through voluntary contributions or by agreeing that, by rearranging the time scale of certain activities, the higher budget increase now planned for 1992 would be effected partly in 1991.
<P>One final point, Mr. Chairman.  In the paper outlining the safeguards programme distributed with my Note of 31 July 1989, information was provided on a number of options for expanding the level of safeguards in nuclear weapon States.  The option with the smallest budget implications would be to receive and to store in the safeguards data base information on the status of and changes in nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear facilities in nuclear weapon States.  The annual cost of so doing would be US $l50,000.
<P>In the absence of comments by governments urging this action we have however, refrained from adding even this amount to the Budget.<HR>

<TITLE>STATEMENT AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM </TITLE>
<BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>STATEMENT AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM </H3>
<H4 ALIGN =CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>
Director General<BR>
International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Davos,Switzerland</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>5 February 1990</H4>
<P><HR>Last summer the participants in the Paris summit declared:<BR>
"We recognize that nuclear power [also] plays an important role in limiting the output of greenhouse gases".
<P>A few months later many environment ministers met in the Netherlands to discuss climate change. Although they could not reach agreement on a specific target for reductions in C02 emissions, they urged energy conservation and the promotion of renewable sources of energy as means of restraining CO2 emissions. Only one of the participating ministers mentioned nuclear power. He warned against any use of it.
<P>I relate this to illustrate how negative or mute most of the present leaders in the field of environment are in the question of use of nuclear power   even though they are desperately looking for energy systems that reduce CO2 emissions.
<P>And yet, the reality is that 17% of the world's electricity is generated by nuclear power today without adding any CO2 to our atmosphere. If this electricity had been generated instead by the burning of coal, about 1800 M.t. of CO2 would have been added to the 20,000 M.t. that already go into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. An increase of 9%.
 I am not going to suggest to you that an expanded use of nuclear power is a panacea for global warming, nor that it is without some problems, but I do submit that if we are serious about limiting CO2 emissions, we cannot afford to do without an expanded use of nuclear power in the world's energy mix.
<P>Conservation and greater energy efficiency can help us over time to avoid a good deal of CO2 but such measures are not likely to do more than partly offset increased demand. Indeed, according to the World Energy Conference the world's primary energy consumption is likely to increase by 50 75% between 1985 and 2020. Actual trends are clearly towards the use of more fossil fuels. Not long ago Belgium opted for a gas fuelled power plant rather than a nuclear one. Sweden seems intent to phase in gas and phase out nuclear. China, even though aiming for a 40% improvement in efficiency of energy use during the 1990s, plans to double its coal production between 1985 and 2000. India plans to treble its coal use over the same period. All this will increase CO2 emissions   not reduce them. Who could reproach China and India? The current per capita CO2 emission is 2 tons per year in China and 0.9 tons in India. This compares, for instance, with 12.3 tons in the US and 10.5 tons in the FRG. Suggestions that energy hungry developing countries like China and India should freeze their CO2 emissions at current low levels are hardly realistic. Stepped up technological and economic assistance to them to promote nuclear expansion, energy efficiency and the use of renewables could limit the increase in their use of fossil fuels, but they will most certainly and not unreasonably insist that the greatest emitters of CO2, the industrialized countries, reduce their CO2 emissions.<BR>
 Renewable sources   solar, wind, commercial biomass and geothermal power   today provide less than 0.3% of the OECD countries' energy. According to Mrs. Steeg, the head of the International Energy Agency, these sources might give a maximum of 5% of the OECD countries' energy in 2010. The World Energy Conference suggests an even lower figure: 3% for the whole world by 2020.
<P>Suggesting that we can reduce the world's CO2 emissions by conservation, energy efficiency and a greater use of renewables alone is in my view trying to take us to the greenhouse through the dreamhouse!
<P>Nuclear power, as I said, is already helping us to avoid significant volumes of CO2 emissions and a strong expansion could help us to avoid even more. We have the industrial capacity for it. An annual start up of between 40 and 60 new nuclear power plants as from 2001 would be possible. If we did, nuclear power would cover some 25% of the electricity consumption we expect by 2010, avoiding 17 20% of the CO2 emissions which would have resulted from an alternative reliance on coal. The supply of uranium is no problem for a nuclear power expansion of this dimension   even without recourse to breeder
reactors.
<P>What are the objections to nuclear power? I shall start with the issue of waste.
<P>Disposal of radioactive waste is sometimes spoken of as if it were an unsolved technical problem. This is not so. There are no insuperable scientific or technological problems in the commonly accepted multi barrier
 concepts for disposal deep underground. The problems which do exist are of a different kind, namely those of public acceptance of disposal sites. It is somewhat like the siting of airports. Most people want to fly but no one wants an airport in his neighbourhood.
<P>I turn now to the question of safety . No energy generation is without some risk and being without energy has also some negative consequences. The risks of using nuclear power are not zero but they must be compared to the risks which we run in using other methods of generating the desired energy. The number of dead from Chernobyl   31   must be compared with casualty figures from coal mines, oil platforms, gas explosions and hydrodam bursts. The size of the exclusion zone around Chernobyl should be compared with forests that are severely damaged or destroyed as a result of acid rain. The additional risk of cancer cases from Chernobyl fallout can also be compared with similar risks from other industrial activities, including energy generation. Perhaps such comparisons can also help us to somewhat demystify nuclear energy!
<P>This being said, we need also to further strengthen the safety of operating nuclear power plants so that no plants are trailing behind in safety. International co operation to achieve this is underway. I should add that the new nuclear power plants that are coming on the market in the 90s and beyond will be simpler to operate and the aim will be to give them such safety features that no evacuation plans will have to be drawn up.
 One final point. Nuclear opponents often claim that nuclear power increases the risk that more countries will acquire nuclear weapons. In reality the risk of proliferation exists whether or not we expand nuclear power, and it would not disappear even if we were to close all the world's power reactors. It deserves to be known, however, that the IAEA inspects and verifies the exclusively peaceful use of 95% of all nuclear installations outside nuclear weapon States. In the present hopeful climate for disarmament one might even dare to hope that we shall one day safeguard all nuclear installations outside nuclear weapon States.<HR>

<TITLE>CAN WE STOP THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS?</TITLE>
</BODY>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CAN WE STOP THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS?</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Hans Blix<BR>Director General<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency<BR></H4><P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The Graduate Institute of International Studies<BR>Geneva, Switzerland</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN = CENTER>14 February 1990</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>
When the title of this lecture uses the term "the spread" it refers to a spread beyond the US, the UK, the USSR, France and China, which last of the permanent members of the Security Council became a nuclear weapon State in 1964. There is no further acknowledged nuclear weapon State nor any further State that claims to have nuclear weapons. India set off what was termed a "peaceful nuclear explosion" in 1974; Israel has declared itself capable of assembling a nuclear weapon in a very short time; Pakistan has said that although it would be able to make a nuclear weapon, it has no intention of doing so. South Africa has stated that it has the capability to make weapons, but is at present contemplating adhering to the Non Proliferation Treaty. Argentina and Brazil have denied any intention of making nuclear weapons.
<P>This is not to say that a spread of nuclear weapons to further countries could not happen. The risk exists and considerable efforts are devoted to prevent that risk from becoming reality. I shall describe some of those efforts. Before I do so, however, I should in fairness point out that while "horizontal proliferation" is a risk, "vertical proliferation" is a reality.
 It is calculated that the stockpiles in the nuclear weapon States contain some 50,0O0 nuclear warheads and the technology race, including testing, continues even today. When I am not addressing this awesome issue, it is because the IAEA has no role in nuclear disarmament but is playing an important role as responsible for safeguards verification under the non proliferation regime.
<P>The nuclear weapon States, especially the superpowers, are very active to prevent further proliferation. There is perhaps something paradoxical about nuclear weapon States desperately urging non nuclear weapon States not to do what they, themselves, seem to find indispensable to continue doing, namely develop nuclear weapons.
<P>However, the unanimity which exists on this matter between the five permanent members of the Security Council does give special strength to the non proliferation stance. There is also a broad and strong body of government and world opinion behind this policy, which is based on the premise that five nuclear weapon States is already more than enough and that the world would become even more dangerous if additional countries were to acquire nuclear weapons.
<P>For the policy of non proliferation to become successful it is not enough, however, that all are agreed that the world as a whole would become more dangerous, if new nuclear weapon States appeared. Individual countries must also be convinced that for them the world would be less safe or at least not more safe if they had nuclear weapons. It is a little like family planning. It is not enough that a country is convinced that its population growth must stagnate; for such a policy to succeed individual couples must also be convinced that it is in their own interest to have few children.<BR>
It is fair to say that the efforts to prevent horizontal proliferation have been successful. While President Kennedy expressed the fear in 1962 that 20 30 States would acquire nuclear weapons, the number of acknowledged nuclear weapon States remains the same today as it was in 1964, when China joined the club. What are the reasons for this success and what are the present and future risks of proliferation?
<P>We sometimes hear it said by opponents of nuclear power that nuclear weapons and nuclear power are Siamese twins   one cannot promote nuclear power' without at the same time making it easier to make nuclear weapons. A more appropriate image would be a tree with a trunk of basic nuclear physics and two major branches, one with the technology of explosives, the other with the technology of controlled chain reactions harnessed for power generation.
<P>One cannot completely disregard the risk that a State intending to make a nuclear weapon for some time might hide its intention in a civilian nuclear programme. However, it should be remembered that going for nuclear weapons through nuclear power is a very roundabout way. All the five nuclear weapon States actually went first for nuclear weapons and only subsequently built nuclear power stations. In fact, China, a nuclear weapon State since 1964, has not yet put its first nuclear power plant into operation.
<P>There is little doubt that today any State with some industrial infrastructure and trained personnel could develop a nuclear weapon if it were determined to do so and were willing to spend the resources necessary. It is mainly a question of political will. To be sure there exists severe restrictions on the export of sensitive technology, e.g. for enrichment and reprocessing. Moreover, any country which has not pledged itself to
 non proliferation   and indeed even some whose pledges are not completely relied upon   find that there are limitations in their possibility of importing even non sensitive technology and hardware. All these restrictions may well raise difficulties for a State determined to make nuclear weapons and cause delay which may give time for political action.
<P>The political will and determination of the individual State not to acquire nuclear weapons is the first and fundamental barrier to proliferation. Hence, such conditions need to be created and maintained that no inclination arises to acquire these weapons. The will of the State is influenced by several different factors, but most important is certainly the security situation of the State. A general or regional climate of detente will reduce the perceived need for armaments, including nuclear arms. Latin America is an area of relatively little conflict between nations. This has probably convinced many Latin American States that they have nothing to lose but a good deal to gain by committing themselves to non proliferation. Brazil's, Argentina's and Cuba's unwillingness so far to commit themselves has hardly its grounds in intra Latin American relations. India's refusal to accept NPT, we know, had its roots in its conflict with China   a nuclear weapon State   and Pakistan's stance is related to India's position. Israel's position of calculated ambiguity is based on what it perceives to be its need to dispose of a strong deterrent.
<P>A number of countries feel their security is adequately protected against nuclear threats by their being members of military alliances. They have a nuclear umbrella held by someone else and have not felt the need of nuclear weapons of their own. But two members of the Western alliance, the UK and France, have continued to feel they must have an independent nuclear weapon capacity.<BR>
 Some other countries, like Sweden and Switzerland, which are not protected by umbrellas, have come to the conclusion that it might be more dangerous for them to have than not to have nuclear weapons. It is hard to know whether they have placed any faith in the declarations made by the nuclear weapon States that these would not use nuclear weapons against States which have committed themselves to be without such weapons.
<P>For a large group of developing countries, the nuclear weapon option has seemed so distant both for themselves and for neighbouring potential enemies, that to renounce these weapons has not been felt to be any sacrifice in terms of security. These States may also have been influenced by advantages which could accrue from a renunciation. This brings me to discuss the famous "Atoms for Peace" programme which was presented by the United States in 1953 and which was designed precisely to create a motivation for non proliferation.
<P>It should be recalled that until this period the United States policy in nuclear matters had been one of secrecy. It was increasingly realized, however, that once it was shown that the technology of nuclear bombs and nuclear power could be mastered, other States would make efforts to develop both. This insight prompted the idea that the US would offer freely to share nuclear material (enriched uranium), hardware, technology and know how for peaceful purposes but on condition that a pledge of exclusively peaceful use was given and the principle of on site verification was accepted. Acceptance of the offer would obviate costly research and development work. It was a carrot to forego the military option and it certainly had some effect.
<P> The Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is based upon the same concept of promising to facilitate transfers. In return it requires not only that the particular object transferred be committed to an exclusively peaceful use, but also that the recipient country's whole nuclear programme be exclusively peaceful and be verified as such by the IAEA.
<P>The NPT has 140 parties today. It can by no means be said that 137 non nuclear weapon States parties are all States that either would have no ability in the foreseeable future to make nuclear weapons or States that could not plausibly have any motivation to acquire them. Egypt is an NPT party, so are Libya, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The most important non parties are the group of States which I mentioned at the beginning. It should be noted that among the non parties South Africa has declared it is considering adhering to the treaty and that among the parties the Democratic People's Republic of Korea still has no full scope safeguards agreement.
<P>What is the real effect of a treaty of this kind? How reliable are the pledges? The world has certainly experienced States repudiating treaty obligations. When we consider the security value of the treaty, we cannot just say "pacta sunt servanda" and leave it at that. In my view the voluntary and motivated acceptance of the treaty   for that matter any treaty   by the States parties remains the most important factor for reliability. Thus, if any significant factor were to disappear which had induced a State to adhere to the treaty, then its continued acceptance of the treaty could be weakened. However. States fortunately are reluctant to disavow legal commitments which
 they have entered, even if with time they have become unhappy with some of these commitments. Renunciation of valid treaty obligations, they know, affects a State's standing and reputation. A treaty obligation thus creates a legal threshold which a State does not like to transgress, except for strong and preferably legally plausible reasons. This may be said to constitute a second barrier.
<P>The NPT contains a denunciation clause in Article X which would allow a State to leave the treaty if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of the Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. So far no party has availed itself of this clause. It may be assumed that any indication of any party intending to do so, would trigger considerable diplomatic activity among other States, perhaps including economic or other measures as well. For States which are dependent for their nuclear power industry on import of fuel, a cut off of further fuel supply could be such a measure.
<P>Thus, if there exist incentives for a State to join the NPT, there also exist incentives for States not to renounce it. However, one can imagine factors which would constitute powerful counterincentives, some of which would have the seriousness to legitimately qualify under Article X, e.g. if a neighbour of a party breaches its obligation and starts making nuclear weapons.
<P>We should also note that even though parties to the treaty some States are nevertheless looked upon by some other parties with a degree of suspicion. Adherence to the treaty raises a presumption of a determination not to acquire nuclear weapons" but the presumption may be weakened and is rebuttable.
<P> The safeguards inspection system may be said to constitute the third barrier against proliferation. Under the bilateral agreements which the United States concluded under the Atoms for Peace programme, inspection by the US of the peaceful use of exported technology, hardware and material was envisaged and implemented. When the NPT came into operation and all NPT States accepted to subject all their fissionable material to IAEA safeguards, the bilateral arrangements for inspection were suspended and the inspection function transferred to the IAEA.
<P>Today about 95% of all fissionable material and 95% of all nuclear installations outside nuclear weapon States is under IAEA safeguards. Although some safeguards inspections are performed by the Agency in India, Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil pursuant to agreements which these countries have reached with supplier States, these countries have in addition material and installations which they have created on their own and these are the 5% not inspected by the IAEA. There is no presumption that these installations and material are devoted to military purposes. I have myself been invited to visit non safeguarded enrichment plants both in Argentina and Brazil, but the Agency pronounces itself only about those installations which it inspects. It may be said as a generality that in the world at large confidence ends where safeguards end.
<P>This brings me to the nature of safeguards and the safeguards system. It consists of two major parts: first an accountancy system under which States inform the Agency of all the movements, burn ups, and other whereabouts of all fissionable material in their territory. Material comes under safeguards when it has a composition and purity suitable for fuel fabrication or enrichment
 and it remains under safeguards until it is so burnt up or otherwise treated that recovery of the fissile material is not practicable. This means in practice that yellow cake from uranium mines is not under safeguards and that safeguards can be terminated under certain conditions on wastes when they are disposed of.
<P>For States parties to the NPT, the safeguards are fixed to the fissionable material, not the installations; for non NPT countries, the safeguards have regard both to installations and material.
<P>The information provided by the States is fed into the computers of the Agency and checked. Figures for import by one country must square with figures for export of another. Figures for spent fuel must be consonant with fuel inserted and burn ups, etc.
<P>The other major part of the safeguards system is the inspection. Somewhat like the accountancy system of a bank, figures are checked for consistency, but the existence of the assets is also verified. The bank inspector verifies the existence in the vaults of gold and other assets. The safeguards inspector verifies that the material reported is located where reported and in the quantity and form reported.
<P>There are about 200 inspectors travelling around the world for inspection. In addition, we have some 300 staff in Vienna for the checking of report" working out procedures" preparing inspections" examining the results of inspections, developing new techniques for safeguards in the future, drafting reports about the results to our member governments and so forth.
 <P>The whole activity is budgeted in the Agency to about $60 million per year. In addition, especially future development of safeguards is assisted by voluntary programmes of Member States to the tune of some $14 million per year. About 30 staff in our Department of Safeguards are so called cost free experts and should be added to the cost of the system as should the harder to calculate costs of the inspected Member States for receiving inspectors.
<P>The system relies also importantly on so called containment and surveillance measures. There are, for instance, seals applied by inspectors on material containers and pathways, giving evidence that the material has not been touched and that a pathway has not been used for the removal of equipment or material. There are also cameras operating and taking pictures at irregular intervals of strategic pathways to give evidence that no fissionable material or important equipment is moved between inspections. Millions of such pictures are checked in monitoring devices in the Agency. More than 13,000 seals are checked each year in the same way.
<P>In the early days of the Agency's safeguards operation there was a good deal of reluctance among governments and industry to accept safeguards. Inspection was often seen as an unwelcome intrusion, costing operators and governments some trouble and expense. Fears also existed that safeguards could hamper nuclear development or lead to leaks of business or technological secrets
<P>Practically all these concerns have disappeared over the years. First, no one would contend any more that safeguards encroach upon sovereignty. The Agency is invited to perform them by a host State because that State finds the safeguards to be in its interest and the performance occurs in conformity with an agreement freely entered into with the State. Secondly, no one contends that nuclear development is in the least hampered by the inspection.
<P>Thirdly, even the fear about leakages of information seem to have largely, though not completely, disappeared. There are, in fact, hardly any secrets connected with ordinary nuclear power stations. The Agency also takes care that what is received as confidential information remains confidential.
Computer hacks cannot just hook on to our data bank! However, there do remain sensitive matters. Inspection must be performed on enrichment
plants and reprocessing plants under safeguards, but this must be organized in such a way that not even the inspectors learn the secrets of the
technological process.
<P>Host States and host operators now almost universally see safeguards for what they are: confidence building measures. It is reassuring for a non
nuclear weapon State to have it verified that its neighbour uses nuclear material only for peaceful purposes. The Agency and the inspectors are no
nuclear police ready to intervene and stop any diversion of fissionable material. They are observers whose only power is to report. This may seem
toothless, but a little reflection will show that any international inspection   also in disarmament   will be limited to observation and reporting. The
international community does not possess any brigades to inflict sanctions against uncooperative parties: the sanctions lie elsewhere. They lie in the
reactions of those who have economic and military power: the States.
<P>If an inspector were to discover a diversion of fissionable material or military use of an installation, he would immediately report this to the Head of the Safeguards Department and the Director General. The Board of Governors would be convoked and could take some action" including the submission of a report to the Security Council of the UN. The IAEA is the only member of the UN family that has direct access to the Security Council and that reports
annually   to the General Assembly rather than to the ECOSOC. No report of diversion has ever been made to the Security Council, for none has ever
been found, but the Agency did report directly to the Council after the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi research reactor in 1981.
<P>I have described the formal procedure in a hypothetical diversion case. It is not a very likely scenario. It has been stated that the purpose of
safeguards is to "deter from diversion by risk of early detection". This is a somewhat big brotherish definition. The many States which have accepted
safeguards and routinely receive them have not invited this operation to deter themselves from any temptation to misuse nuclear material or
installations. They have invited safeguards to create maximum confidence among their own citizens, among neighbours and in the world at large that
they are using nuclear material and installations only for peaceful purposes. Self declaration and self inspection could not create such confidence.
Only the continued presence of an outside, impartial, professional inspection mechanism can achieve this. To have maximum credibility the
inspections must be so thorough and the risk of detection so high that it would function as a deterrence against misuse of material or installations,
should a State be tempted to do so.
<P>The sensitivity of the system is set at a risk of detection of about 85 95%. To strive for 100% detection would both be very costly and impractical.
Moreover there would be a Kreat many false alarms which would irritate everybody. It is a little like security checks at airports. To attain 100%
detection would be costly and impractical. A high detection probability is deemed sufficient
 If a State were to decide that it would go for a nuclear weapon it is more likely that it would denounce the NPT and safeguards on some ground or that
it would find some pretext to stop inspectors entering. To be caught red handed must be such an embarrassing prospect that States would be unlikely
to take the risk. The chances are therefore that some signs of lack of co operation with the safeguards system would appear first. Any such signs are
taken very seriously by the Agency and, indeed, by Member States.
<P>The Agency has not under the some 30 years of the operation of the safeguards system discovered any diversion of fissionable material or misuse of installations for military purposes and I am convinced it is because none has occurred. It is not a perfect system, but it is well tried out and it is often
studied by governments to give ideas as to how inspection can be organized in connection with disarmament measures.
<P>What are the shortcomings of the safeguards system?
<UL>
<LI>(a) It can only report what it sees here and now. It is like a radar that scans the horizon. It does not read intentions.
<LI>(b) It does not roam the territory of a State in search of clandestine installations or even to check an installation deemed suspicious. While the
Tlatelolco Treaty has provisions about verification by challenge, the NPT does not. It is conceivable therefore that a State could build undeclared
nuclear installations. However, imports of uranium or construction of major facilities are not likely to go unnoticed. Moreover, safeguards are not the
only system that observes States. Satellites and intelligence are naturally also providing some governments with data.
<LI>(c) A problem is the increasing complexity of some modern nuclear installations handling growing volumes of plutonium and enriched uranium.
Efforts must be made so that safeguards keep abreast with the evolution. Governments can facilitate the task by designing the installations in a
"safeguards friendly" way! It is, in fact, in their own interest to do so.
<LI>(d) The financing of the system has until recently not been a problem, but the rigidity with which the greatest payer States hold on to zero growth
in budgets of international organizations, makes the safeguards task more problematic. To satisfactorily safeguard increasing quantities of nuclear
material in a continuously expanding number of nuclear installations, of which some are highly complex, with no growth in resources is difficult. We
risk a gradual erosion in coverage or quality.
</UL>
A special and peculiar feature of the safeguards system requires some comment. The Agency is invited by all five nuclear weapon States to perform
inspection on peaceful nuclear installations in these States.
<P>Evidently such inspection does not have the purpose of verifying non proliferation, since these States have nuclear weapons and continue to make
such weapons. These "'voluntary offers" have their roots rather in criticism voiced early that the nuclear weapon States were "rewarded" for having
nuclear weapons by being exempt from inspection. The criticism was
somewhat linked to the mistaken belief that inspection was
a heavy burden.
<P>The Agency has been routinely inspecting a few facilities in the US, UK,
 France and the USSR. With China the agreements are now in place but the actual inspection has not yet started. In the US and the UK the offer has
regard to the whole peaceful nuclear sector. In France, the USSR and China it is more limited. The Agency has been making use of the offer to
acquire experience of inspection on types of installations that might later be encountered outside nuclear weapon States. The NPT Review
Conference that met in 1985 urged the Agency to make wider use of the offer and spoke of the principle that all peaceful nuclear installations in all
States should be under safeguards. Under current budgetary restrictions no such expansion has been possible. Indeed, an offer to safeguard a
breeder reactor in the Soviet Union remains unused for budget reasons.
<P>It should perhaps be noticed that this type of inspection could be of use in some disarmament schemes. If, say, an enrichment plant or reprocessing
plant were to cease producing for military purposes it could be designated civilian and offered for safeguards. In this way an existing verification
mechanism would be readily available.
<P>I should like to conclude with some remarks on the prospects of non proliferation. In August and September this year another review conference of the
NPT is to take place and in 1995 a conference is to determine whether the treaty is to be prolonged for an additional period or additional periods or
indefinitely. A good deal of interest is already focussing upon this 1995 conference. One can certainly identify various factors which weaken the
attractiveness of the treaty to some parties. First of all, many States feel that they accepted to forego the nuclear weapon option in the expectation that
the nuclear weapon States would embark on
 substantive disarmament'. The contrary happened. There are many more nuclear weapons in the world today than in 1968. Even the INF treaty
banning intermediate range nuclear forces does not dispose of the warheads but only of the carriers.
<P>Another factor that could reduce the attractiveness of the treaty is the feeling among many developing countries that the transfer of nuclear technology
in spheres of medicine, industry, agriculture and power   the facilitation of which was promised under the treaty has been much less generous than
they feel they were entitled to.
<P>As against these factors, however, there are other more hopeful ones. If nuclear disarmament has not actually got very far yet, nevertheless we may
well hope for drastic cuts in the years to come both in nuclear and conventional armaments. Indeed, one might even wonder if the security thinkers of
the great powers are not reaching the conclusion that the military   and nuclear   way to security has become too dangerous and too expensive. Such
a conclusion, alone, would not, of course, have stopped them earlier from continuing upward in the armaments spiral. Two other momentous
developments, however, may now help to stop or slow the race. The first is the attitude of the Soviet leadership, evidenced in action, that all countries
should be allowed to seek and develop their own economic and social system without foreign interference. Armed conflicts based on or fuelled by
aspiration for ideological supremacy seem more remote. The second development is the new general acceptability of on site inspection. Only with
such inspection will States have enough confidence to lower their military guard. I should like to
 think that some 30 years experience of safeguards inspection have contributed to paving the way for the new acceptance of far reaching
disarmament inspection schemes.
<P>It is certainly too early to pronounce the demise of military force as factor in the relations of major military powers, but nuclear weapon doctrines are
looking increasingly theoretical and military sufficiency is
very different concept from "massive retaliation". Of course, residuary nuclear forces are likely to be retained as basic mutual deterrance and to deter
any maverick State that might succeed to go for nuclear weapons. It would also be naive to think that force will not remain an important factor in
regional tensions and, indeed, in internal conflicts. However, a gradual withering of the military option in great power relations could herald the
dawning of a new world order. Such an evolution would help to strengthen the non proliferation treaty. States would see less reason for arms
including nuclear arms   to maintain security.
<P>Another factor that might help to strengthen support for nonproliferation would be more rewards in the form of nuclear technology to those who accept the treaty. It cannot be doubted that some inconvenience has followed for those countries that so far have determined to stay outside the regime.<BR>
Carrots, alone, would not bring India and Pakistan, Argentina and Brazil, and even less Israel to join the NPT, but a combination of drastic nuclear
disarmament   including all nuclear weapon States   a general trend away from reliance on the military option in great power relations and some
settlement in the Middle East, plus offers of a generous transfer of nuclear technology, might bring about universal adherence to the NPT during the
next decade.
<P>Although I know that nuclear power is not the most popular subject in this city of Geneva, I would be less than honest if I did not end by saying that in my view the world is not threatened by the some 430 nuclear power stations but by the   still   some 50,000 nuclear warheads. An expanded use of
nuclear power could be   not a panacea   but a significant factor in the necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the risk of global
warming. A new and better world order would transfer enrichment plants and reprocessing plants to the civilian sector and plutonium and enriched
uranium from such plants and from dismantled nuclear weapons should, in my optimistic dream of the world, be used to generate electricity.<HR>

<P>
The subjects of this presentation are all very much in the public mind. First: the safety of nuclear power installations is now being discussed intensely in Eastern Europe and measures to strengthen safety can be expected. Second: there is a great worry that enormous CO2 emissions which result from the burning of fossil fuels contribute a major part of the so called greenhouse effect. Third: in August this year, the third review conference of the Non Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, will start in Geneva, and in 1995 a conference will decide whether the Treaty is to be prolonged for one or more fixed periods or indefinitely.
<P>There are important links between these three topics. Energy generation through nuclear power has great advantages from the environmental point of view as it does not give rise to any S02, NOx or CO2 and thus does not contribute to acid rains, dying forests or the greenhouse effect. This assumes, however, that the level of nuclear safety is high. An accident of the Chernobyl type, as we know, has severe health and environmental impacts. A wider transfer of nuclear technology to generate power without severe environmental consequences also requires that full guarantees exist against proliferation.
<P>The premise which I start from, namely that there is a need for more energy, is not universally accepted, and I must discuss the objections to it. Environmentalist constituencies the world over try to persuade us that we can meet the threat of global warming simply by using less fossil fuels    conservation  and by using more renewable sources of energy. While it is not hard to accept the tenet that the least polluting energy source is the one you don't use, one must examine the social cost attached to scarcity of energy and one must also realistically examine how much energy we can save.
<P>Energy is the lifeblood of our societies. An enormous increase in the use of oil, coal, gas and hydropower has been a major means of raising the standard of living in a few countries to unprecedented levels. There is a clear relationship between the level
 of economic development and energy consumption. The average North American uses 7200 kg of oil equivalent per year and the average Chinese uses 590 kg, and the average Indian has to make do with 280 kg of oil equivalent (of commercial energy). Even after the oil shocks, the OECD countries with one sixth of the world's population consume almost one half of the world's primary energy. Not surprisingly, the developing countries are trying to expand their energy generation as fast as they can    chiefly with fossil fuels. But industrialized countries, too, are expanding their energy use, especially their electricity use. For Austria, for instance, an increase of 25% in electricity use is forecast between 1987 and 2000.
<P>We are not without experience of what energy conservation can achieve. After the oil price shocks a more efficient use of energy allowed continued economic growth in industrialized countries without increased use of primary energy. The use of electricity increased, however. There undoubtedly still remains considerable potential for energy saving. To take but one example, future cars will certainly get more kilometers per liter of petrol than the present generation. Getting the car owners to drive fewer kilometers is a much more difficult proposition. The World Energy Conference, which met last September in Montreal, fully recognized the importance of energy conservation, but it warned at the same time that    I quote   "few subjects have been or are the object of as much wishful thinking".
<P>It may be predicted that    despite conservation efforts and barring some dramatic developments including drastic actions by governments  the global demand for more energy, particularly electricity, will increase in the future. The World Energy Conference last September published a scenario which suggests a global energy consumption 50 to 75% higher in 2020 than today  even with strong energy conservation measures.
<P>Let me turn now to the scope for an expanded use of renewable energy sources as a means of avoiding CO2 emissions. If you except hydro power, these sources now contribute about 0.1% of the global energy supply  and a major part of that is geothermal energy. As to solar power, there have been promising developments in photovoltaic cells. They are of use in satellites, isolated locations e.g., in the mountains, and in watches, calculators, etc., where cost is not so important. Solar cells are still not viable for large scale electricity generation. I might mention that to provide the same amount of electric energy as a 1000 MW(e) power station, some 90 square kilometers would need to be covered by solar cells.
<P>There exists long experience with wind generators. In California alone, there are some 15,000 wind generators now in operation. It would take at least 13,000 wind generators of 200 kW capacity each to provide the same electric energy as a 1000 MW(e) thermal power station (with 80% load factor). The surface area needed would be of the order of 100 square kilometers. Wind power can hardly be expected to become viable for large scale electricity generation.
<P>Much work is needed to reduce the costs of solar and wind generators if they are ever to become generally economically competitive. Mrs. Helga Steeg, Director General of the International Energy Agency in Paris, recently stated that "the contribution of renewable energies, besides hydro power, in most of the IEA countries [i.e. most of the Western industrialized countries] for the year 2010 can be estimated to be a
 maximum of SO2. The World Energy Conference was even more pessimistic: it suggested 3% by 2020. This does not negate the fact that these energy forms can be very important in specific regions or situations. Nor do present modest results suggest that research and development funds should be withheld for these energy sources. But they do suggest that it would be irresponsible to count on major global contributions from energy systems that have so far not turned out to be viable on a large scale. To suggest that they can replace fossil fired plants to any major extent during the next decades is as unrealistic today as it was when similar forecasts were being made ten years ago.
<P>My conclusion is that, although there may be a significant potential for saving both primary energy and electricity, especially in high consumption countries, this will not be enough to offset the increasing global energy demand which we can expect in the near and intermediate future. We will also not be able to meet this demand with renewable energy sources alone. The reality is that fossil fuels, nuclear power and    where available  hydropower are the sources we can turn to.
<P>As I mentioned, however, a further expanded use of fossil fuels raises the problem of CO2 emissions. While the SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil fuels are linked to local and regional environmental problems of acidification and Waldsterben, the greenhouse gases, including CO2, confront us with the global environmental problem of a warming atmosphere. Already in 1988, a conference in Toronto with scientists and politicians recommended a reduction by 20% in CO2 emissions by 2005. While there has since been much talk about a convention against climate change, there are so far no international commitments to reductions in CO2 emissions. The outlook is rather for increased emission.
<P>It is calculated that 50% of the greenhouse effect is caused by CO2, about 15% by CFCs and 20% by methane. The CFCs are being phased out as they are also thought to be destructive of the ozone layer. Methane reductions are hard to achieve.
<P>The additions to the atmospheric content of CO2 come mainly from our use of fossil fuels. The present emissions from these sources are some 20,000 million tons per year. An estimated additional 5,000 million tons per year come from the destruction of tropical rain forests.
<P>Since there is no economically viable way in which CO2 can be eliminated in the combustion of fossil fuels, any action to reduce CO2 emissions would have to involve limitations on the use of fossil fuels or a shift between them. The burning of oil produces less CO2 than coal per unit of heat generated. Natural gas is even more advantageous from this point of view.
<P>Afforestation would certainly be beneficial, and should be pushed with vigour. However, we must be aware that its effects would be slow and it would necessarily involve vast surface areas. Just to compensate for the present rate of deforestation in the world, it would be necessary to replant an area of the order of half of France every year.
<P>It is clear that we can hope to reduce or contain global CO2 emissions only through international action and that at least one of these actions will have to involve limiting
 the burning of fossil fuels. Such a limitation will raise formidable political problems and severely tax the solidarity of States.
<P>A switch from coal or oil to natural gas is helpful as the CO2 ernissions from the combustion of natural gas are much lower per thermal unit produced than from coal or from oil. It is likely that natural gas will be increasingly relied on for some decades to come in several countries. It does not produce any SO2, but apart from the CO2, it does produce NOx. Greater use of natural gas would meet some environmental concerns, and for some time it is likely to be available in large quantities in a number of areas. One can, of course, query whether it is rational to burn up what is also a clean and valuable industrial raw material, but that consideration may not weigh very heavily when the demand for energy becomes pressing.
<P>What about the use of nuclear power? Can it be of significance in the world's efforts to limit CO2 emissions? Some facts may be of interest: In 1988, which is the last year for which we have complete statistics, nuclear power worldwide produced 1800 TWh of electric energy. If that had instead been produced by coal fired power plants, which would have been the economically competitive alternative, it would have meant a 9% increase in the CO2 emissions resulting from the worldwide burning of fossil fuels (or 1800 Mt CO2).
<P>Some twenty five percent of the world's total CO2 emissions come from electricity generating stations. In the United Kingdom, where only 20% of the electricity comes from nuclear stations, the average CO2 emission per kWh produced was 0.78 kg. In France, where nuclear plants generate 70% of the electricity, the corresponding figure was 0.09 kg. In Sweden, with electricity generated almost exclusively by hydro or nuclear plants, the average kWh gave rise to only 0.03 kg of CO2. This gives a perspective not only on what can be achieved, but also on the potential problems in negotiating a convention to reduce CO2 emissions worldwide.
<P>The industrial capacity to build more nuclear power plants exists. An annual start up of between 40 and 60 new nuclear power plants as from 2001 would be possible. If we did this, nuclear power would cover some 25% of the electricity consumption we expect by 2010, avoiding 17 20% of the CO2 emissions which would have resulted from an alternative reliance on coal. The supply of uranium is no problem for a nuclear power expansion of this dimension  even without recourse to breeder reactors.
<P>I submit to you that the sooner we face up to the reality, the better the chances are for energy policies to meet the threat of global warming. An international convention committing the world's governments to maximum energy conservation, reforestation and an expanded use of renewable sources of energy is desirable, but is not enough. The world will not only need to keep the nuclear power capacity which exists, but also to considerably expand it. That this will actually happen is by no means a foregone conclusion, however. It requires above all that no accidents with significant radioactive releases occur. It may also require a gradual demystification of nuclear energy. It probably also requires that nuclear weapons lose some of their prominence.
<P>Nuclear power today provides some 17% of the world's electricity and 5% of its primary energy. This is just a few percent less than hydroelectric power. The importance
 of nuclear power is, however, very different in different countries. France is the world leader with 70% of its electricity coming from nuclear power, which means in practice that oil has been fully replaced by nuclear power for electricity generation in France. Through its large nuclear power capacity, France now generates more electricity than it needs itself, and exports electricity valued at more than $1 billion per year to its neighbours. Belgium gets 65% of its electricity from nuclear plants, South Korea 50%, and Sweden 45%. There are now 11 countries which get more than 30% of their electric energy from nuclear power. Of the Eastern European countries, Hungary at present has the highest fraction of nuclear generated electricity    49%.
<P>There is at present considerable doubt about the future of nuclear power, even among the big users of it. In Sweden, the phasing out of nuclear power by 2010 has been decided upon by Parliament. In Italy even the existing nuclear plants are no longer in use following a referendum. Switzerland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands have a de facto moratorium on new plants. Several countries like Austria, Denmark and Ireland have renounced nuclear power entirely, even though they need more electricity generating capacity. In the USA, no plant has been ordered since the middle of the 1970s and no new orders are expected for several years, despite the fact that there is a need for new generating capacity. In the UK, the recent decision about privatization appears to make nuclear power uneconomic through the very special conditions imposed. Against these trends, I may mention that nuclear programmes continue to grow in a few countries, notably France, Japan and Eastern Europe.
<P>The Chernobyl accident had a serious effect on public opinion everywhere, above all in the Soviet Union itself and the countries of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union closed two nuclear plants in Armenia after the earthquake there. It also stopped construction on several plants, and abandoned plans to use a number of sites for nuclear plants. Although a considerable antinuclear opinion is now visible and audible in the USSR, as in most industrialized countries, the Soviet Government still plans to expand its nuclear power plant capacity. There are nuclear power plants in operation or under construction in almost every one of the East European countries, but here, too, opposition grows with glasnost. Two older plants have recently been shut down in the GDR. Environmentalist opinion seems to be somewhat divided in East Europe between the traditional categorical green rejection of nuclear power and the opinion that the alternative use of coal is worse.
<P>The main arguments against nuclear power are well known. They relate to safety, waste and non proliferation. Let me first discuss safety. The TMI and especially the Chernobyl accident raised interest in creating some international guarantees of nuclear power safety. There have been demands for the adoption of binding international safety rules and inspection of their implementation. However, the reactions to these demands have shown that governments are not at present ready to subject their nuclear installations to binding international rules on safety or to obligatory international safety inspections. The international safety regime that is developing so far is more subtle. It offers models for national safety regulations and international missions of assistance, support and advice to plant operators and regulators.
<P>Already in the early 1970s, the IAEA served as an instrument for building an international consensus on safety standards and practices. The Agency's basic standards
 for radiation protection have been used in many countries around the world as the basis for national protection standards. As the Agency looks for scientific guidance in these matters to the International Commission for Radiological Protection, we are now carefully following the probable conclusions of the Commission to the effect that dose limits for workers in nuclear facilities should be set even stricter than they are now. We also note the recent statistical study in England which seems to couple leukemia in some children in Sellafield to radiation doses incurred by their fathers. A first reaction is that for the ten cases concerned, the doses were fairly high and at a level which would be rare in the industry today. It is also difficult to explain why a similar occurrence of leukemia has not been found among the children whose fathers incurred radiation doses from the Hiroshima bomb. This, I think, is all that I can say on the subject at the present time. The Nuclear Safety Standards Programme -- the so called NUSS programme -- produced five Codes of Practice covering the essential safety aspects of governmental organization, siting, design, operation and quality assurance. The Codes were supplemented by 56 Safety Guides recommending how these safety requirements could be implemented. We recently revised the Codes to reflect current thinking and experience gained in accident prevention and management.
<P>Member States have used the Codes extensively to elaborate national regulations. To take an important example, China, with its emerging nuclear power programme, has adopted the NUSS standards as the basis for its national regulatory requirements. Several Member States have directly adopted the Code for quality assurance.
<P>While standards and regulations are indispensable to ensure nuclear safety, equal attention must be paid to operational safety in the some 430 nuclear power plants which are now operating in the world and the 100 or so plants which will soon be put into operation. To assist its Member States in this regard, the Agency is offering several services which are being increasingly used.
<P>Firstly, Operational Safety Review Teams (OSARTs) are sent to a nuclear power plant in response to requests. The teams are composed of experts from both the Agency and Member States and their reviews are certainly not cosmetic. Over a period of several weeks they thoroughly review plant operations management and procedures. Since Chernobyl the reports of most of the some 30 OSARTs which the Agency has performed have been published by the authority which requested the OSART, in order to inform the public. Industrialized countries pay the full cost of such visits; developing countries pay all local expenses.
<P>Secondly, the Agency offers expert teams (ASSETs) to help a nuclear plant operator assess safety significant events and define the real root causes.
<P>The changes which have been taking place with such breathtaking pace in Eastern European countries have also brought with them a new openness as regards the safety of the nuclear power plants operating there. A group of safety experts in the CMEA (Comecon) countries have expressed reservations about the safety of the early 440 MW(e) PWR plants. Four such plants are operating in the Soviet Union, four in the German Democratic Republic, four in Bulgaria and two in the CSSR at Bohunice. Backfitting of safety related equipment has been recommended. This position has been supported in general terms by a report issued by safety experts from the Federal
 Republic of Germany after a review of the four PWR units of early design at Greifswald in the German Democratic Republic. An ASSET mission which the IAEA sent to Greifswald last month to examine past accidents and incidents in the plant recommended several improvements in the operational safety procedures of the plant.
<P>There is now a very rapid increase in the demand for Agency safety support services from the Eastern European countries In the Soviet Union we have undertaken safety reviews at the Ignalina, Rovno and the future Gorki plants, and we are now starting a review of the radiation protection measures taken or planned in the Ukraine and Byelorussia after the Chernobyl accident. The situation in Byelorussia has received a great deal of attention recently and I hope that the review we are undertaking will be as authoritative and enlightening as the inquiry which the Agency made about the technical causes of the accident.
<P>Czechoslovakia has requested an Operational Safety Review mission to the Dukovany plant and a pre operational safety review of Temelin. We have carried out an Operational Safety Review mission to the Paks plant in Hungary and a pre operational review in Poland. Those reviews which have been carried out have generally found good competence in the staff, but many recommendations for improvements have been made. Reviews have so far mostly had regard to operational safety. Future requests may also relate to the safety aspects of plant design.
<P>So much for international action related to safety at existing nuclear power plants. What about the future plants which are supposed to be safer and more tolerant of human errors than the ones which were subject to accidents at TMI and Chernobyl?
<P>I must preface my remarks about future reactors with the comment that today's nuclear power reactors are designed to tolerate a great deal of human error. Their safety systems have much built in redundancy. Moreover, they rely on decades of proven technology and engineering practices reflecting the high standards and strict regulations of the nuclear industry. In the TMI accident, the containment worked in spite of several operator errors. The accident at Chernobyl occurred because several safety systems had in fact been deliberately switched off. A strengthened safety system which has been introduced for that reactor type now makes it harder to do so.
<P>The industry now seems ready to present advanced versions of the currently most common reactor types, with standardized and simpler design, more "passive" safety features and often smaller sizes. Through lower total capital costs these reactors could help to improve the management of investment risks. Such features might also make them interesting for some developing countries.
<P>I do not propose to discuss the question of nuclear waste at length. Contrary to common belief, there is no lack of technical ability to construct facilities in which the waste will be safely stored for thousands of years. The difficulties are rather that public and political organs are unwilling to consent to the use of any possible sites. Dr. Herbert Kouts, chairman of the IAEA's International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group, summed up the situation when he said, I quote, "The 'unsolved' problem of radioactive waste is more political than technical and will require more guts than brains to solve,,. Interna
 tional criteria for the safe disposal of high level wastes were approved in September lastyear by the IAEA's Board of Governors.
<P>The argument sometimes heard that this generation is enjoying the benefits of nuclear power and leaving the burden of waste disposal to our children is not valid. In a good number of countries, the current users of nuclear generated electricity are actually paying for future waste disposal and decommissioning of plants by a special fee built into the cost of each kilowatthour.
<P>One reason why the non military nuclear industry has been able to isolate all its waste is the exceptionally small volume of that waste. Let me give you a comparison of the wastes of a 1000 MW(e) nuclear plant and a 1000 MW(e) coal plant: The coal fired plant will require 7000 tons of coal per day,    i.e., about five train loads. The nuclear plant will use some 80 kilograms of uranium per day. Even with the best flue gas cleaning equipment, the coal plant will annually emit some 900 tons of SO2, 4500 tons of NOx, 6.5 million tons of CO2 and some 400 tons of various heavy metals as wastes. The nuclear plant will produce 30 tons of highly radioactive waste per year.
<P>Let me turn now to the issue of non proliferation. Unlike, for instance, the dissemination of chemical technology, the transfer of nuclear power technology has been based from the beginning on schemes for international co operation with built in checks and controls against the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Atoms for Peace programme which led to the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency within the UN system was based on the philosophy that technology, material and equipment would be made available against commitments that they would only be used for peaceful purposes. The verification that these cornrnitments are upheld is now being provided through the IAEA safeguards system, the first international on site inspection system; it now costs about US $60 million per year and has some 200 inspectors regularly visiting some 60 countries. Some 95% of all fissionable material outside nuclear weapon States is under safeguards control. The fears which were common 25 years ago that many States would acquire nuclear weapons have not materialized. The risk of proliferation exists, but I think we can confidently state that the development of civilian nuclear power does not significantly contribute to it. None of the present nuclear weapon States began with nuclear power. The weapons came first. Indeed, the only industry which is subjected to international controls on its exclusively peaceful use is the nuclear power industry in non nuclear weapons States.
<P>Nevertheless, concern exists about the intentions of some countries which have not joined the NPT or allowed the Latin American Tlatelolco Treaty to take effect. The future actions of these countries can be expected to be mainly influenced by their perception of their own security situation. If we are going into a period of drastic disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, a period in which military power gradually comes to play a smaller role at least in relations between great powers, then nuclear weapons may also come to look less meaningful to countries which have not yet completely renounced the option. Continued international detente in the next few years, including some settlement in the Middle East, could lead to universal adherence to non proliferation by non nuclear weapons States. This certainly is an objective to work for.<HR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>International Women's Day</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Address by<BR>Hans Blix<BR>Director General,<BR>International Atomic Energy Agency</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Vienna International Centre</H4>
<P><H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Thursday, 8 March 1990</H4>
<P><HR>
<P>First, I would like to thank the UNIDO Forum of Women Professionals and the Group on Equal Rights for Women at the VIC for having invited me to join you in celebrating today the International Women's Day. I also would like to wish success to the Thirty fourth Session of the Commission on Status of Women' whose important work will come to a close tomorrow.
<P>In 1975, the United Nations launched the Decade for Women. At that time' the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a Resolution requesting the Director General to give "... special consideration to the appointment of qualified women to policy making and other professional posts on the staff of the Secretariat". Since then, a number of steps have been taken, resulting in an increase of 60% since 1981 in the number of professional women on the staff of the Agency. However, in spite of this considerable improvement' we are still   I am sorry to say  among the organizations with the highest proportion of men: 88% of our professional staff!
<P>The reason for this low representation of women in the IAEA is simple: We are dealing with very technical programmes in which mostly nuclear engineers or nuclear scientists are required and it seems that in these particular fields the number of trained
 and experienced women worldwide is rather limited. When circulating vacancy notices to our Member States, we draw their attention to the very low proportion of women on our professional staff. We further urge them to ensure that qualified women be given every opportunity to apply to these posts on an "equitable basis with men". In spite of this, the number of applications we receive from women is still disappointing. In 1989' only 11.4% of all applications received in respect of vacant professional posts were from women. For "technical" positions, the percentage for that year was even less, namely 4.5% of all applications.
<P>In the safeguards inspectorate, however, a field where a few years ago some supervisors were hesitant to recommend the employment of women because of the physical strain in inspection tours' and where some Governments' too, were reluctant to accept women inspectors, we have been able through a training programme to increase their number considerably. We now have 11 women inspectors who, side by side with men, are performing physically and technically difficult inspection tasks in nuclear facilities all over the world.
<P>The IAEA is still "globally" far from the 30% target for women professionals' but in some sectors, mainly "administrative", women are relatively well represented' i.e.: in Budget and Finance 52% of the professionals are women, in Personnel 33%' in Technical Assistance Implementation 35%, and in the Library 70%.
<P>The relatively small number of professional women responding to our vacancy announcements, of course, places some constraint on our efforts to increase the number of women in the Professional and higher categories. I can assure you, however, that we try to improve the situation. One step recently taken    in conformity with Common System practice    is to allow the employment of spouses under certain conditions. In this era of both spouses working professionally, this step might in come
 cases enable both spouses to work for the organization. However, to encourage women to go into technical professions, both Governments and international organizations should ensure that women be given equal access to education at all levels and in all fields. l can tell you that in the lAEA particular attention is paid to the applications of women candidates for fellowships and training courses under our Technical Co operation Programme. In fact, in 1989, 22% of the participants in our training courses were women, and 21% of all fellowships were awarded to women. It is also our intention to involve more women in Technical Co operation Projects and promotional activities.
<P>Improvements in the representation of women among the Professional staff should be at all levels. An increase in the number of women at the senior and policy making levels would be most desirable. Some  but slow   progress is made in this respect: the number of P 5 posts held by women has increased from 1 in 1981 to 6 today. I am also glad to tell you that, for the first time since the establishment of the Agency' a women was recently appointed Division Director, namely for the Division of Scientific and Technical Information, which includes a total of 177 staff members.
<P>Let me end by saying that to cope with the exciting challenges of the 90s, international organizations need the broadest possible recruitment base to get the best possible staff. Half of humanity is women. The full use of their intelligence' knowledge' wisdom and energy is needed to shape a better world and many more of them are needed in international organizations' including traditionally male dominated ones like the IAEA.<P><HR>

<B>Progress in seawater desalination</B>
<P>
With over 1.4 billion cubic kilometres of seawater available on
two-thirds of the world's surface, many water deficient
populations could have access to a vast potential for freshwater
if an economical means to desalinate seawater can be
demonstrated.  That is the working hypothesis of a feasibility
study begun by the Agency  in 1994. It has identified options for
utilizing small- and medium-sized nuclear reactors as a possible
power source to run desalination plants to produce low-cost
potable water in North Africa.  
<P>
One participant in the feasibility phase is Morocco which is
about to undertake a joint  pre-project  study of a demonstration
plant with assistance from the IAEA and  China. The plan would
utilize a 10 megawatt reactor supplied by China to produce 8,000
cubic meters a day of fresh water.  Other participants in the
study are Algeria, Egypt (which is also studying project design),
Libya, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. Over US $670,000 in financial
support for the study was provided by Argentina, Canada, Jordan,
Korea, Libya, USA  and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency
will hold an international symposium on the subject in 1997, in
collaboration with UNIDO, WHO, WMO and the EU.

<B>Roundtable starts SIT campaign in Mali</B>
<P></A>
Livestock development in much of Africa is limited by the range
of the tsetse fly, which transmits a type of sleeping sickness
called nagana (see <A
HREF="/worldatom/inforesource/bulletin/bull381/sit.html">Cattle
killer meets its match</A>, <I>INSIDE
TC</I>, March 1996). Livestock infection  rates of up to 45% in
the peri urban zone of Bamako have inspired the Government of
Mali to convene a roundtable with its development partners to
discuss co-ordinating activities for an integrated approach for
tsetse and trypanosomiasis management. The French, German and  US
aid agencies have sponsored livestock related development
projects in the area which were represented at the meeting.  
<P>
The roundtable on 27-31 May 1996 discussed the possibility of
initiating area-wide conventional fly suppression activities
(traps, screens and chemical treatments) involving local
communities to drastically reduce the tsetse population in an
area of approximately 2000 km<SUP>2</SUP>. This is a prerequisite
for a potential sterile insect technique (SIT) intervention. The
Government undertook to document through a socio-economic study
the extent of the tsetse and trypanosomiasis problem. On the
basis of these promising discussions, the Agency is moving ahead
with technical feasibility planning for boundary mapping and fly
range involving release/recapture studies with marked sterile
males.

Noting that Iraq and Kuwait, as independent sovereign States, signed at
Baghdad on 4 October 1963 "Agreed Minutes Between the State of Kuwait and the
Republic of Iraq Regarding the Restoration of Friendly Relations, Recognition
and Related Matters", thereby recognizing formally the boundary between Iraq
and Kuwait and the allocation of islands, which were registered with the United
Nations in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations and
in which Iraq recognized the independence and complete sovereignty of the State
of Kuwait within its borders as specified and accepted in the letter of the
Prime Minister of Iraq dated 21 July 1932, and as accepted by the Ruler of
Kuwait in his letter dated 10 August 1932,
<p>
Conscious of the need for demarcation of the said boundary,
<p>
Conscious also of the statements by Iraq threatening to use weapons in
violation of its obligations under the Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of
the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of
Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925, and of
its prior use of chemical weapons and affirming that grave consequences would
follow any further use by Iraq of such weapons,
<p>
Recalling that Iraq has subscribed to the Declaration adopted by all
States participating in the Conference of States Parties to the 1925 Geneva
Protocol and Other Interested States, held in Paris from 7 to 11 January 1989,

<p>
Aware of the use by Iraq of ballistic missiles in unprovoked attacks and
therefore of the need to take specific measures in regard to such missiles
located in Iraq,
<p>
Concerned by the reports in the hands of Member States that Iraq has
attempted to acquire materials for a nuclear-weapons programme contrary to its
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1
July 1968,
<p>
Recalling the objective of the establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free
zone in the region of the Middle East,
<p>
Conscious of the threat that all weapons of mass destruction pose to peace
and security in the area and of the need to work towards the establishment in
the Middle East of a zone free of such weapons,
<p>
Conscious also of the objective of achieving balanced and comprehensive
control of armaments in the region,
<p>
Conscious further of the importance of achieving the objectives noted
above using all available means, including a dialogue among the States of the
region,
<p>
Noting that resolution 686 (1991) marked the lifting of the measures
imposed by resolution 661 (1990) in so far as they applied to Kuwait,
<p>
Noting that despite the progress being made in fulfilling the obligations
of resolution 686 (1991), many Kuwaiti and third country nationals are still
not accounted for and property remains unreturned,
<p>
Recalling the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages,
opened for signature at New York on 18 December 1979, which categorizes all
acts of taking hostages as manifestations of international terrorism,
<p>
Deploring threats made by Iraq during the recent conflict to make use of
terrorism against targets outside Iraq and the taking of hostages by Iraq,
<p>
Taking note with grave concern of the reports of the Secretary-General of
20 March 1991 and 28 March 1991, and conscious of the necessity to meet
urgently the humanitarian needs in Kuwait and Iraq,

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
<CENTER>
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3004th meeting, on 15 August 1991
</CENTER>
<P>
The Security Council,
<P>
Recalling its resolution 687 (1991), and its other resolutions on this matter,
<p>
Recalling the letter of 11 April 1991 from the President of the Security
Council to the Permanent Representative of Iraq to the United Nations (S/22485)
noting that on the basis of Iraq's written agreement (S/22456) to implement
fully resolution 687 (1991) the preconditions established in paragraph 33 of
that resolution for a cease-fire had been met,
<p>
Noting with grave concern the letters dated 26 June 1991 (S/22739), 28 June
1991 (S/22743) and 4 July 1991 (S/22761) from the Secretary-General, conveying
information obtained from the Executive Chairman of the Special Commission and
the Director-General of the IAEA which establishes Iraq's failure to comply with
its obligations under resolution 687 (1991),
<p>
Recalling further the statement issued by the President of the Security
Council on 28 June 1991 (S/22746) requesting that a high-level mission
consisting of the Chairman of the Special Commission, the Director-General of
the IAEA, and the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs be dispatched
to meet with officials at the highest levels of the Government of Iraq at the
earliest opportunity to obtain written assurance that Iraq will fully and
immediately cooperate in the inspection of the locations identified by the
Special Commission and present for immediate inspection any of those items that
may have been transported from those locations,
<p>
Dismayed by the report of the high-level mission to the Secretary-General
(S/22761) on the results of its meetings with the highest levels of the Iraqi
Government,
<p>
Gravely concerned by the information provided to the Council by the Special
Commission and the IAEA on 15 July 1991 (S/22788) and 25 July 1991 (S/22837)
regarding the actions of the Government of Iraq in flagrant violation of
resolution 687 (1991),
<p>
Gravely concerned also by the evidence in the letter of 7 July 1991 from
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq to the Secretary-General and in
subsequent statements and findings that Iraq's notifications of 18 and 28 April
were incomplete and that it had concealed activities, which both constituted
material breaches of its obligations under resolution 687 (1991),
<p>
Noting also from the letters dated 26 June 1991 (S/22739), 28 June 1991
(S/22743) and 4 July 1991 (S/22761) from the Secretary-General that Iraq has not
fully complied with all of its undertakings relating to the privileges,
immunities and facilities to be accorded to the Special Commission and the IAEA
inspection teams mandated under resolution 687 (1991),
<p>
Affirming that in order for the Special Commission to carry out its mandate
under paragraph 9 (b) (i), (ii) and (iii) of resolution 687 (1991) to inspect
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missile capabilities and to
take possession of them for destruction, removal or rendering harmless, full
disclosure on the part of Iraq as required in paragraph 9 (a) of resolution 687
(1991) is essential,
<p>
Affirming that in order for the IAEA with the assistance and cooperation of
the Special Commission, to determine what nuclear-weapons-usable material or any
subsystems or components or any research, development, support or manufacturing
facilities related to them need, in accordance with paragraph 13 of resolution
687 (1991), to be destroyed, removed or rendered harmless, Iraq is required to
make a declaration of all its nuclear programmes including any which it claims
are for purposes not related to nuclear-weapons-usable material,
<p>
Affirming that the aforementioned failures of Iraq to act in strict
conformity with its obligations under resolution 687 (1991) constitutes a
material breach of its acceptance of the relevant provisions or resolution 687
(1991) which established a cease-fire and provided the conditions essential to
the restoration of peace and security in the region,
<p>
Affirming further that Iraq's failure to comply with its safeguards
agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, concluded pursuant to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968, as
established by the resolution of the Board of Governors of the IAEA of 18 July
1991 (GOV/2531), constitutes a breach of its international obligations,
<p>
Determined to ensure full compliance with resolution 687 (1991) and in
particular its section C,
<p>
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter,
<P>
Condemns Iraq's serious violation of a number of its obligations under
section C of resolution 687 (1991) and of its undertakings to cooperate with the
Special Commission and the IAEA, which constitutes a material breach of the
relevant provisions of resolution 687 which established a cease-fire and
provided the conditions essential to the restoration of peace and security in
the region,
<P>
Further condemns non-compliance by the Government of Iraq with its
obligations under its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy
Agency, as established by the resolution of the Board of Governors of 18 July,
which constitutes a violation of its commitments as a party to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968,
<P>
Demands that Iraq
<P>
(i) provide full, final and complete disclosure, as required by
resolution 687 (1991), of all aspects of its programmes to
develop weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
with a range greater than 150 kilometres, and of all
holdings of such weapons, their components and production
facilities and locations, as well as all other nuclear
programmes, including any which it claims are for purposes
not related to nuclear-weapons-usable material, without
further delay,
<P>
(ii) allow the Special Commission, the IAEA and their Inspection
Teams immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to
any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means

transportation, medical or logistical support requested by
the Special Commission, the IAEA and their Inspection Teams,
<P>
(ix) respond fully, completely and promptly to any questions or
requests from the Special Commission, the IAEA and their
Inspection Teams,

<h2>Atoms for Peace</h2>
<hr>
<center><i>
Address by Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States
of America, to the 470th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General
Assembly<br>
Tuesday, 8 December 1953, 2:45 p.m.<br>
General Assembly President: Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (India)
</center></i>
<hr>        
<P>
Madam President and Members of the General Assembly;
<p>
when Secretary General Hammarskjold's invitation to address the General Assembly reached me in
Bermuda, I was just beginning a series of conferences with the Prime Ministers
and Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and France. Our subject was some
of the problems that beset our world. During the remainder of the Bermuda
Conference, I had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honour. That
honour is mine today as I stand here, privileged to address the General Assembly
of the United Nations.
<p>
At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you,
I have a sense of exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly. Never before in
history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single
organization. Your deliberations and decisions during these sombre years have
already realized part of those hopes.
<p>
But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead.
And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, I would use the office
which, for the time being, I hold, to assure you that the Government of the United
States will remain steadfast in its support of this body. This we shall do in
the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom, of the courage
and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting  peace for all nations, and
happiness and well-being for all men.      
<p>
Clearly, it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to
present to you a unilateral American report on Bermuda. Nevertheless, I assure
you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same
great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched
in your Charter. Neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity to
recite, however hopefully, pious platitudes. I therefore decided that this
occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds
and hearts of my legislative and executive associates, and on mine, for a great
many months: thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American
people.
<p>
I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger
exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope
exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all. Finally,  if
there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure
the tensions of today's world, what more appropriate audience could there be than
the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
<p>
I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new, one
which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have
preferred never to use. That new language is the language of atomic warfare.
<p>
The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of
the world should have some comprehension, at least in comparative terms, of the
extent of this development, of the utmost significance to every one of us. Clearly,
if the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace, they
must be armed with the significant facts of today's existence.
<p>
My recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United
States terms, for these are the only incontrovertible facts that I know, I need
hardly point out to this Assembly, however, that this subject is global, not
merely national in character.
<p>
On 16 July 1945, the United States set off the world's biggest atomic
explosion. Since that date in 1945, the United States of America has conducted
forty-two test explosions. Atomic bombs are more than twenty-five times as
powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned, while hydrogen weapons
are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT equivalent.
<p>
Today, the United States stockpile of atomic weapons, which, of course,
increases daily, exceeds by many times the total equivalent of the total of all
bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of
war in all the years of the Second World War. A single air group whether afloat
or land based, can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo
exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all the Second World War.
<p>
In size and variety, the development of atomic weapons has been no less
remarkable. The development has been such that atomic  weapons have virtually
achieved conventional status within our armed services. In the United States, the
Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps are all capable of putting this
weapon to military use.
<p>
But the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic might are not
ours alone.
<p>
In the first place, the secret is possessed by our friends and allies,
the United Kingdom and Canada, whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution
to our original discoveries and the designs of atomic bombs.
<p>
The secret is also known by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has
informed us that, over recent years, it has devoted extensive resources to atomic
weapons. During this period the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic
devices, including at least one involving thermo-nuclear reactions.
<p>
If at one time the United States possessed what might have been called
a monopoly of atomic power, that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago. Therefore, 
although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a
great quantitative advantage, the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts
of even greater significance. First, the knowledge now possessed by several
nations will eventually be shared by others,  possibly all others.
<p>
Second, even  a vast superiority in numbers of weapons, and a consequent capability  of
devastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself, against the fearful material
damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression.
<p>
The free world, at least dimly aware of these facts, has naturally embarked on a large programme   
of warning and defence systems. That programme  will be accelerated and extended.  But let no      
one think that the expenditure of  vast sums for weapons and systems of defence can guarantee        
absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation. The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb      
does not  permit of any such easy solution. Even against the most powerful defence, an
aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a
surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen
targets to cause hideous damage.
<p>
Should such an atomic attack be launched against the United States, our
reactions would be swift and resolute. But for me to say that the defence
capabilities of the United States are such that they could inflict terrible losses
upon an aggressor, for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the United
States are so great that such an aggressor's land would be laid waste, all this,
while fact, is not the true expression of the purpose and the hopes of the United
States.
<p>
To pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that
two atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a
trembling world. To stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of
civilization destroyed, the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind
handed down to us from generation to generation, and the condemnation of mankind to
begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagery towards decency, and
right, and justice. Surely no sane member of the human race could discover
victory in such desolation. Could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history
with such human degradation and destruction? Occasional pages of history do
record the faces of the "great destroyers", but the whole book of history reveals
mankind's never-ending quest for peace and mankind's God-given capacity to build.
<p>
It is with the book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the
United States will ever wish to be identified. My country wants to be constructive, not destructive.   
It wants agreements, not wars, among nations. It  wants itself to live in freedom and in the        
confidence that the peoples of every  other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life. 
<p>
So my country's purpose is to help us to move out of the dark chamber of horrors into
the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, the souls
of men everywhere, can move forward towards peace and happiness and well-being.
<p>
In this quest, I know that we must not lack patience. I know that
in a world divided, such as ours today, salvation cannot be attained by one
dramatic act. I know that many steps will have to be taken over many months
before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate
of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world. But I know, above all
else, that we must start to take these steps - now.
<p>
The United States and its allies, the United Kingdom and France, have
over the past months tried to take some of these steps. Let no one say that we
shun the conference table. On the record has long stood the request of the
United States, the United Kingdom and France to negotiate with the Soviet Union
the problems of a divided Germany. On that record has long stood the request of
the same three nations to negotiate an Austrian peace treaty. On the same record
still stands the request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea.
<p>
Most recently we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect
an expression of willingness to hold a four-Power meeting. Along with our allies,
the United Kingdom and France, we were pleased to see that this note did not
contain the unacceptable pre-conditions previously put forward. As you already
know from our joint Bermuda communique, the United States, the United Kingdom and
France have agreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union.
<p>
The Government of the United States approaches this conference with
hopeful sincerity. We will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose
of emerging from that conference with tangible results towards peace, the only true
way of lessening international tension.
<p>
We never have, and never will, propose or suggest that the Soviet Union
surrender what rightly belongs to it. We will never say that the peoples of
the USSR are an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly
and fruitful relationship.
<p>
On the contrary, we hope that this coming conference may initiate a
relationship with the Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a freer
mingling of the peoples of the East and of the West - the one sure, human way of
developing the understanding required for confident and peaceful relations.
<p>
Instead of the discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany,
occupied Austria and the countries of Eastern Europe, we seek a harmonious family
of free European nations, with none a threat to the other, and least of all a
threat to the peoples of the USSR. Beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of
Asis, we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural
resources and to elevate their lot.
<p>
These are not idle words or shallow visions. Behind them lies a story
of nations lately come to independence, not as a result of war, but through free
grant or peaceful negotiation. There is a record already written of assistance
gladly given by nations of the West to needy peoples and to those suffering the
temporary effects of famine, drought and natural disaster. These are deeds of
peace. They speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent.
<p>
But I do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals
or the restatement of past deeds. The gravity of the time is such that every new
avenue of peace, no matter how dimly discernible, should be explored.
<p>
There is at least one new avenue of peace which has not been well
explored - an avenue now laid out by the General Assembly of the United Nations.
<p>
In its resolution of 28 November 1953 (resolution 715 (VIII)) this General Assembly
suggested: "that the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing
a sub-committee consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved,
which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report...on such a solution
to the General Assembly and to the Security Council not later than 1 September 1954.
<p>
The United States, heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of
the United Nations, is instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries
as may be "principally involved", to seek "an acceptable solution" to the atomic
armaments race which overshadows not only the peace, but the very life, of the
world.
<p>
We shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception.
The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination
of atomic materials for military purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon
out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will
know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.
<p>
The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military
build-up can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into
a great boon, for the benefit of all mankind. The United States knows that peaceful power from      
atomic energy is no dream of the future. The capability, already
proved, is here today. Who can doubt that, if the entire body of the world's
scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with which
to test and develop their ideas, this capability would rapidly be transformed into
universal, efficient and economic usage?
<p>
To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from
the minds the people and the governments of the East and West, there are certain
steps that can be taken now.
<p>
I therefore make the following proposal.
<p>
The governments principally involved, to the extent permitted by
elementary prudence, should begin now and continue to make joint contributions from
their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international
atomic energy agency. We would expect that such an agency would be set up under
the aegis of the United Nations. The ratios of contributions, the procedures and
other details would properly be within the scope of the "private conversations" I
referred to earlier.
<p>
The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good
faith. Any partner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find
the United States a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate.
<p>
Undoubtedly, initial and early contributions to this plan would be
small in quantity. However, the proposal has the great virtue that it can be
undertaken without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt
to set up a completely acceptable system of world-wide inspection and control.
<p>
The atomic energy agency could be made responsible for the impounding,
storage and protection of the contributed fissionable and other materials. The
ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such
a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure.
<p>
The more important responsibility of this atomic energy agency would
be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve
the peaceful pursuits of mankind. Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic
energy to the needs of agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities. A
special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved
areas of the world.
<p>
Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating some of their strength
to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind.
<p>
The United States would be more than willing - it would be proud to
take up with others "principally involved" the development of plans whereby such
peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedited.
<p>
Of those "principally involved" the Soviet Union must, of course, be one.
<p>
I would be prepared to submit to the Congress of the United States,
and with every expectation of approval, any such plan that would, first, encourage
world-wide investigation into the most effective peacetime uses of fissionable
material, and with the certainty that the investigators had all the material needed
for the conducting of all experiments that were appropriate; second, begin to
diminish the potential destructive power of the world's atomic stockpiles; third,
allow all peoples of all nations to see that, in this enlightened age, the great
Powers of the earth, both of the East and of the West, are interested in human
aspirations first rather than in building up the armaments of war; fourth, open
up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiative at least a new approach to
the many difficult problems that must be solved in both private and public 
conversations if the world is to shake off the inertia imposed by fear and is to make
positive progress towards peace.
<p>
Against the dark background of the atomic bomb, the United States does
not wish merely to present strength, but also the desire and the hope for peace.
The coming months will be fraught with fateful decisions. In this
Assembly, in the capitals and military headquarters of the world, in the hearts of
men everywhere, be they governed or governors, may they be the decisions which will
lead this world out of fear and into peace.
<p>
To the making of these fateful decisions, the United States pledges before you, and 
therefore before the world, its determination to help solve the fearful atomic 
dilemma - to devote its entire heart and mind to finding the way by
which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, 
but consecrated to his life.
<p>
I again thank representatives for the great honour they have done me in inviting me to appear
before them and in listening to me so graciously.
<P>

<B><LI>Background Information</B>
<P>
Irradiation of food has the same objectives as other food
processing methods - the reduction of losses due to spoilage
and deterioration and control of the microbes and other
organisms that cause foodborne diseases.  Food irradiation
employs ionizing radiation from gamma ray sources, such as
cobalt-60, and from machines, such as x-ray generators and
electron accelerators.  Based on decades of research and
unprecedented number of studies, the technology is
increasingly accepted as safe and effective in controlling
insects and other pests responsible for post-harvest losses;
in meeting quarantine requirements; in reducing levels of
foodborne pathogens and parasites; and in prolonging the
shelf-life of fresh produce and other foods.  Food irradiation
can contribute significantly to food preservation and safety
and the facilitation of trade, but legislation permitting its
use is essential for the commercialization of the process. 
Furthermore, as it is the case with other food preservation
method such as thermal processing, many applications of food
preservation through irradiation require that the irradiation
process be integrated with other processes, particularly
refrigeration, to attain its full potential.
<P>
The safety and effectiveness of food irradiation have been
established through the positive recommendations of the Joint
FAO/IAEA/WHO Expert Committee on the Wholesomeness of
Irradiated Foods in 1980 and the subsequent adoption of the
Codex General Standard for Irradiated Foods and its associated
Code of Practice by the Codex Alimentarius in 1983.

<P>
Following the adoption of the Codex General Standard for
Irradiated Foods, thirty eight countries have approved
irradiation for the treatment of one or more food items,
including countries in the Africa and Near East Regions.  In
1984, an International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation
(ICGFI) was established to evaluate global developments,
provide a focal point of advice and furnish information on
food irradiation.  Currently, ICGFI has 43 member countries and
meets periodically under the aegis of FAO, IAEA and WHO.  A
number of policy guidelines and recommendations with regard to
control and trade aspects of food irradiation, food hygiene,
quarantine treatment and public information have been
developed and documents and materials issued by ICGFI.  In
1988, food irradiation was reviewed and endorsed by the
International Conference on the Acceptance, Control and Trade
in Irradiated Food, jointly convened by FAO, IAEA WHO and
ITC-UNCTAD/GATT in Geneva.
<P>
Positive regulations on food irradiation in 38 countries and
increasing commercial application in some 30 countries,
indicate growing interest and confidence in this technology. 
The Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade,
adopted during the GATT Uruguay Round, could facilitate wider
trade in food (including irradiated food) in the near future. 
Thus, significant international trade in irradiated food
products could be expected.  Similarly, actions taken or being
taken by countries in Africa and the Near East are likely to
increase trade (domestic, intra-regional and international) in
irradiated food products.
<P>
Considering that many applications of food irradiation such as
reduction of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and
inactivation of parasites in meats, poultry, fish and
seafoods, and insect disinfestation of fresh fruits and
vegetables that remain perishable after irradiation, it is
important to ensure that the benefits attained through the
food irradiation process are not lost post-irradiation. 
Consequently, it is often necessary to integrate food
irradiation, as a process, into the overall system of food
handling and preservation which includes packaging, storage,
transportation and, most especially, refrigeration.  Thus,
successful implementation of food irradiation must be
accompanied by the development of appropriate, complementary
infrastructure.
<P>
Given the unique potential of food irradiation technology in
overcoming such food safety problems as parasites and
pathogens, as well as its potential technological and
commercial advantages in controlling insect pests especially
as a replacement of methylbromide fumigation which is being
phased out globally, and prolonging shelf-life of fresh
produce and other foods, it would seem desirable for countries
in the Africa and Near East Regions to introduce appropriate
regulations in preparation for an increase in the application
of food irradiation and in trade in irradiated food products. 
Furthermore, it would be desirable to take steps to ensure
that the introduction of such regulatory control of food
irradiation be done in a consistent manner leading to uniform
regulations which reflect internationally acceptable control
measures.
<P>
This seminar represented a combined effort of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Joint FAO/IAEA
Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture,
International Institute for Refrigeration (IIR), International
Trade Centre (ITC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and
FAO Near East Regional Office in introducing food irradiation
technology to reduce postharvest fool losses and foodborne
diseases, to consider a harmonized regulations in this field,
and to facilitate trade in certain food commodities within and
from the African continent and the Near East Region.
<P>
<B><LI>Objectives</B>
<P>
The objectives of the seminar were:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  to discuss technical issues related to implementation
of irradiation to control food losses and foodborne diseases;
<P>
<DD>(b)  to review the role of food irradiation as a
substitute to fumigation of fresh and dried foods in trade;
<P>
<DD>(c)  to discuss the integration of food irradiation
processing into the food production and handling system, and
the need to develop support or complementary infrastructure to
enable commercial application of food irradiation; and
<P>
<DD>(d)  to review the current situation concerning enactment
and enforcement of regulations on food irradiation in Africa
and the Near East, and technical issues facing national
regulatory control authorities (including those involved in
food regulation, control and safety, and plant protection and
quarantine) in introducing and implementing regulations based
on the principles of the Codex Standard on Irradiated Foods
and the recommendations of ICGFI.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
The establishment of a nuclear research reactor and
multi-disciplinary research facilities around it can be regarded
as a precursor to the introduction and development of nuclear
technology in the country.  Such a research reactor centre is
expecte to make important contribution to research,
technology, education, training and other national interests. 
This perception was the main reason for the establishment of a
large number of reactors during the 1960s and 1970s.  Many of
these continue to operate even today although some have been
shutdown and decommissioned.  Accoring to the IAEA Research
Reactor Database, there are 288 research reactors that are
currently operational in 57 countries.  This includes 88
reactors in 39 developing countries.
<P>
A research reactor centre is generally a major component of
science and technology infrastructure and, in the case of
developing countries, it is a place for high level research,
training and education and facilities which are usually not
available elsewhere in the country.  It serve to generate and
disseminate knowledge and skills which cover widely diverse
scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, life sciences,
materials and advanced technologies.  They also play an
important role by meeting national demands in th fields of
medicine, agriculture and industry.  The resulting social
benefits go far beyond what may be seen mere cost analyses.
<P>
Since most of the reactors were established several years ago,
their continued operation critically depends on their ability
to meet current scientific demands.  To undertake new
technical programmes, efficient operation and effective
utilisation of these reactors is, therefore, of prime
importance.
<P>
The seminar represented one of the various activities of the
Agency aimed at enhancing the operation and utilisation of
research reactors.
<P>
<B><LI>Purpose of the Seminar</B>
<P>
In view of the continuing role or research reactors in
achieving national goals, the problems concerning their
under-utilisation must be duly addressed.  Efforts should be
made to enhance utilisation by resolving various problems.  To
this end, the seminar provided a forum for the research
reactor operation personnel and users to exchange information
and discuss current perspectives; highlighted the role of
research reactors in promoting basic and applied research and
in providing various services; and presented views and
discussed future initiatives concerning improved utilisation,
more effective use of human and financial resources, and co-
operative efforts.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
Low level radioactive wastes (LLW) exist in most Member States.
They arise from nuclear fuel cycle activities and also as a
result of the use of radionuclides in medicine, research and
industry. In some countries LLW disposal facilities have been in
operation for many years and so a considerable base of experience
in operation exists. A few repositories have reached the end of
their operational lives and have been closed and so a limited
amount of experience now exists of the closure and post-closure
phase. On the other hand, in some countries efforts are still
being made to site and license the first repositories of this
type. The IAEA considers that it could be beneficial for experts
in countries with operating or closed LLW repositories to share
their experiences by means of an international Symposium on the
subject. The Symposium will also be of interest to experts from
countries planning to build LLW disposal facilities. It will
provide an opportunity for them to share their experiences and
gain valuable information on the subject.
<P>
The objective of the Symposium was to review and summarize
experiences in planning and operating LLW disposal facilities.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
Pesticides are an integral component of agricultural systems
throughout the world. It is generally accepted that this will
continue for the foreseeable future in many circumstances if the
production of food of acceptable quality is to increase. However,
pesticide use has costs as well as benefits. As far as the
environment is concerned, information must be provided before a
product is registered to provide assurance that it can be used
without unacceptable hazard to non-target organisms. In addition,
post-registration surveillance and monitoring studies are
necessary to check that the fate and environmental effects of
pesticides under field conditions are consistent with
predictions. Much of the data is generated with the use of
radioisotopes and other nuclear or related methods. 
<P>
For a variety of reasons, developing countries often have to rely
to a large extent on data generated elsewhere in order to assess
the acceptability of a compound, particularly if it is
off-patent. This symposium examined the circumstances under
which extrapolation from one environment to another is valid on
the basis of data generated under comparable conditions. It 
also considered ways in which relatively simple methods can be used
to verify the field applicability of data obtained in
sophisticated experimental conditions. It is hoped to develop
guidance on these complex issues that will help to reduce
unnecessary duplication and maximise the use made of available
data.
<P>         
<B><LI>List of Topics:</B>
<P>         
The framework of the programme was be based on consideration of
the fate and effects of pesticides in the various environmental
compartments (soil, water and air) and in terrestrial
(agricultural and non-agricultural) and marine ecosystems.
<P>
It  included reports of relevant research, developments in
methodology and the use of information for regulatory purposes.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
The applicability of nuclear techniques to the primary detection
and, more widely, the follow up of cancer after treatment has
been a high interest area of the Nuclear Medicine Section of the
Agency. Since arranging the first seminar on this topic, in
Vienna, in 1989, three co-ordinated research programmes have been
organized on the topics of radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) for
colon cancer, alpha feto protein  (AFP) measurement by
radioimmunoassay in liver cancer, and the determination of the
biological sensitivity of breast cancer by measuring steroid
receptors, EGFR, and pS<SUB>2</SUB> antigen. A CRP on tumour
markers as relevant to prostate cancer is being organized for
1996. A series of training courses, two at regional and one at
interregional level, have served to transfer the necessary
technology to developing countries in addition to which numerous
individual TC projects are operative in the field of RIS and
tumour marker assays.
<P>         
RIS has been found to be a non-invasive diagnostic technique
which also appears to have been advantageous over alternative
imaging modalities in several cases. The increasing availability
of monoclonal antibodies specific to tumour associated antigens
combined with developments that have enabled these to be labeled
with <SUP>99</SUP>Tcm as an alternative to <SUP>131</SUP>I or
<SUP>111</SUP>In have increased their applicability in nuclear
medicine departments in developing countries. The value of
determining serum concentrations of tumour associated antigens
(tumour markers) by radioimmunoassay for primary diagnosis,
screening programmes, and the follow up of cancer patients is
also well recognised and  numerous RIA laboratories in developing
countries have been successfully utilising these  methods for
many years. 
<P>         
<B><LI>List of topics</B>
<P>         
The purpose of the seminar was to upgrade knowledge on basic and
applied aspects of radioimmunoscintigraphy and tumour markers
assays,as used for the detection and follow up of cancer, as a
diagnostic tool which could directly influence patient management
decisions. Invited review papers by international
experts focused on recent advances and possibilities in developing
countries in the fields of radioimmunoscintigraphy and tumour
marker assays. Bone marrow scintigraphy and RIS as applied to non
malignant disorders  also received some attention.
<P>
Papers and presentations covered methodological and
clinical aspects on the following main topics.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>        
- RIS in cancers of the colon, liver, ovary, head and neck,
brain, stomach, etc.
<DD>- Bone marrow imaging
<DD>- RIS in non malignant disorders
<DD>- Tumour markers assays

<li><b>Introduction</b> </li>

<p>Recognizing the prominent role that energy plays in the world and the
expectation that controlled fusion will provide an effectively inexhaustible
energy source, the International Atomic Energy Agency encourages the exchange
between nations of scientific and technical information on fusion research.
The results from large experimental devices now in operation and under
construction, the advances in the understanding of plasma physics, and
the engineering design consideration of fusion experimental devices may
lead to the demonstration of &quot;scientific breakeven&quot; soon. </p>

<p>Previous conferences in this series were held in Salzburg (1961), Culham
(1965), Novosibirsk (1968), Madison (1971), Tokyo (1974), Berchtesgaden
(1976), Innsbruck (1978), Brussels (1980), Baltimore (1982), London (1984),
Kyoto (1986), Nice (1988), Washington (1990), Wurzburg (1992) and Seville
(1994). </p>

<li><b>List of topics</b> </li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>Tokamak Experiments </li>

<li>Inertial Confinement Fusion </li>

<li>Non-Tokamak Confinement Systems (Helical Systems, Open Confinement
Systems, Reversed Field Pinches, etc.) </li>

<li>Magnetic Confinement Theory and Modeling </li>

<li>Plasma Heating and Current Drive </li>

<li>ITER Engineering Design Activities </li>

<li>Fusion Technology and Reactor Concepts </li>

<li>Economic, Safety and Environmental Aspects of Fusion </li>
</ol>

<p>This time the conference has been shortened from six days to five and
this requires adjustment of the format. In order to reduce overlap that
has occurred in the past, papers whose main aim is to review research programmes
or to overview results presented elsewhere in the conference are not desirable.
Because of the progression of the field towards a more technological phase,
papers on fusion technology are encouraged. </p>

<p>Papers dealing with diagnostics, fundamental processes, etc. will be
considered if clearly relevant to fusion problems. </p>

<p>A scientific programme committee with a representative international
membership will be responsible for the selection of papers, the arrangements
of conference sessions and the overall scientific content of the conference.
</p>

<p>In the event that an excessive number of papers describing significant
new research is submitted, some of the accepted papers may be selected
by the programme committee for presentation in summarized form by rapporteurs.
</p>

<p>Poster sessions will be included in this conference. Papers selected
for poster presentation will be published in the proceedings. </p>

<B><LI>Purpose</B>
<P>     
The purpose of the symposium was to exchange experience and
lessons learned in safety reviews and experience feedback systems
for existing NPPs. These are means for identifying safety
improvements; for the verification of plant safety, including
decisions on the acceptability of the safety level and continued
plant operation; and for licensing. It was intended through this
symposium to make available to all those involved in maintaining
the safety of NPPs (i.e., to plant owners/operators, regulators,
designers, technical support organizations and manufacturers)
information on effective methods, practices and criteria for
safety reviews and experience feedback systems.
<P>
<B><LI>Background</B>
<P>         
Several types of safety review are used to ensure the safety of
existing nuclear power plans. <I>Routine reviews</I> of NPP
operation
(including ongoing reviews of significant events, hardware and
procedural modifications, operating experience, plant management
and personnel competence) and <I>special reviews</I> following
accidents
are the primary means for safety verification and ongoing safety
improvements. <I>Periodic safety reviews</I> (PSRs) have been
initiated
in recent years to deal with cumulative effects of NPP ageing,
modifications and operating experience; with changes in safety
standards; and with advances in technology and in scientific
knowledge and analytical techniques. (IAEA issued in 1994 a
Safety Guide on PSRs.)
<P>         
PSRs, which are undertaken every 10 years, make use of results of
routine and special safety reviews and of other relevant studies,
including a plant-specific PSA, if available. These reviews are
complementary and together provide the means for ensuring safety 
throughout plant service life. In addition, <I>safety reviews of
NPPs built to earlier standards</I> have been performed to
determine
which design and operational modifications are needed to improve
the safety of these plants. The symposium will be a forum for the
exchange of experience with all of the above safety reviews and
with the related issue of the basis for judging the
<I>acceptability
of continued plant operation.</I>
<P>
<I>Operational experience feedback</I> (OEF) is a means by which
experience and lessons learned are exchanged on a range of
activities, from NPP design, through operation, to
decommissioning. It can be used to indicate whether the design
safety intent of plants is realized in operation and as a
pro-active technique to assist in reducing risks. The     
effectiveness of OEF depends on identifying the most useful data
to be collected; on appropriate balance in coverage between
events which have led to incidents or accidents, and those which
are safety related deviations/findings (detected for example
through testing, maintenance and safety reviews); on
comprehensiveness of data analysis; and on disseminating
information that meets the needs of users.
<P>         
The means for the management of data is crucial to the success of
safety reviews and  experience feedback systems. The
multidimensional nature of the data (textual, numerical and
graphical) in safety reviews and feedback systems should be
accommodated by the use of object and relational <I>database
management systems.</I>
<P>
<B><LI>List of topics</B>

symposium, papers should address one or more of the following

<P>
In recent years, isotope techniques have largely contributed to
the progress
of marine environmental studies. Research in these fields is
directed
towards a better understanding of fundamental oceanographic
processes and
phenomena, the protection and management of the marine
environment including
adequate use of marine resources, and the reconstruction of past,
and the
prediction of future global change. The tracers used include

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
The Symposium will be organized by the Animal Production and Health Section of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. The main thrust in supporting disease control by the Agency has been the development and utilization of kits for the measurement of antibodies and antigens based on ELISA (a technique which was accepted as being analogous to RIA). The symposium will cover the areas of serology, molecular biological approaches, epidemiology and socio/economics. All are relevant to the consideration of disease control. These topics will be reviewed by invited speakers and their impact on developing countries and feasibility of transfer assessed. The proceedings will be essential reading to scientists and administrators involved in using and choosing appropriate technologies to control disease in developing countries.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
The fundamental motivation for the growing international concern about the environment is that expanding economic and technological activities of mankind are contributing to rapid and potentially stressful changes in the global ecosystem, in ways we are only now beginning to understand. These changes may have harmful, far-reaching consequences in the near future via direct effects on the biosphere - including human beings - and, indirectly, via the alteration of life-supporting conditions on the earth. Anticipated global warming as a result of the rapidly increasing concentration in air of some trace constituents such as carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, ozone, halocarbons, nitrogen and sulphur oxides, may serve as a prominent example of such consequences.
<P>
The current changes in the global ecosystem are also effecting the hydrological cycle. Pollution and degradation of water resources belong already to the major environmental problems of global significance. While the demand for water is increasing, its availability is being reduced as a result of the cumulative impact of industry, agriculture and the growing human population. Pollution, salinization and over-exploitation of water resources are the most common symptoms of growing anthropogenic pressure on the hydrological cycle. Degradation of water resources is not restricted to industrialized countries; it is of growing concern also throughout the developing world.
<P>
Environmental isotopes, whose distribution in natural compounds is governed by environmental conditions, are one of the most powerful tools to investigate past and current environmental changes. In particular, they have proved to be very useful proxy indicators of climate-related parameters such as surface air temperature, relative humidity of the atmosphere and amount of precipitation. Radioisotopes released to the atmosphere during nuclear bomb tests offered a unique opportunity to investigate dynamics of transport and mixing processes in the atmosphere as well as to carry out a global tracer experiment on the hydrological and carbon cycles.
<P>
The forthcoming symposium will cover a broad spectrum of applications of isotope techniques in studies of past and current environmental changes in the hydrosphere and the atmosphere. Consequently, the participation of scientists representing different branches of geosciences and live sciences (climatologists, meteorologists, hydrologists, geochemists, geologists, biologists, paleontologists, etc.), in addition to modelers and isotope specialists, is desired in order to discuss and exchange on the problems with a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach.
<P>

Contributions are invited on the topics listed below and should be devoted to further development and refinement of isotope methods, including models for evaluation of isotopic data. New applications of isotope methods for tracing natural and man-induced changes within the atmosphere-hydrosphere system are most welcome. It is hoped that the Symposium will stimulate more efficient wide-spread use of isotope techniques in the Global Change research.
<P>
The programme of the Symposium will comprise invited keynote lectures, contributed oral presentations, poster sessions and a round table discussion.
<P>
<B><LI>Papers are solicited on the following topics</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- <I>	Isotopes in atmospheric studies</I>: isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture and precipitation; water vapour transport in the atmosphere; isotopes as calibration tool for regional and global models of atmospheric circulation; isotope characteristics of
atmospheric greenhouse gases; reconstruction of past atmospheric levels of 
greenhouse gases; isotope constraints on sources and sinks of greenhouse gases; anthropogenic impact on atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases.
<P>
<DD>- <I>	Interaction between atmosphere and hydrosphere under anthropogenic stress:</I> air-sea interactions; contaminant transport through surface water systems; recent changes in
large aquatic systems (Caspian Sea, lake Bajkal, Great Salt Lake, internal seas);
man-induced perturbations of the soil-plant-atmosphere system on local and regional
scale; impact of large-scale deforestation on regional climate and hydrology;
rainfall-recharge relationship under different climatic regimes.
<P>
<DD>- <I>	Pollution and degradation of water resources:</I> transport of contaminants in the unsaturated zone; identification of sources and behaviour of contaminants in
groundwater; man-induced salinization of groundwater resources; impact of 
urbanization on hydrological cycle; interaction of waste disposal sites with regional groundwater systems; impact of mining industry on regional hydrological systems.
<P>
<DD>- <I>Isotope indicators of past climatic and environmental changes:</I> response of 
hydrological systems to climate change; polar ice sheets and high mountain glaciers as archives of climatic and environmental changes; palaeowaters as archives of palaeoclimate; 
lacustrine deposits as archives of climatic and environmental changes; other indicators of 
climatic and environmental changes (terrestrial and aquatic organic matter, freshwater
carbonates, speleothems, phosphates, etc.)
<P>
<DD>- <I>	Advances in isotope analytical techniques:</I> recent developments in isotope dating techniques; C-14, Th/U and other chronologies; new isotope tools for reconstructions 
of past climatic and environmental changes.

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
Worldwide availability of potable water substantially exceeds the amount of water consumed. However, water resources are not evenly distributed. About three quarters of the world's population lack an adequate supply of safe potable water and some Member States are confronting acute water shortages. There has been a significant increase in the installation of seawater desalination facilities over the past decades, and there are many regions and countries which are expected to expand their desalination capacity.
<P>
The various incentives which in the past have led to the deployment of nuclear energy for electric power generation are now also applicable to the choice of nuclear energy as the source for seawater desalination plants. The reasons include: economic competitiveness in areas which lack inexpensive fossil fuel resources: energy supply diversification, conservation of limited fossil fuel resources: and promotion of technological development and environmental protection through the elimination of emissions causing acid rain and climate changes originating from the burning of fossil fuels.
<P>
As early as the 1960s the IAEA surveyed the feasibility of using nuclear energy for seawater desalination and held an international symposium in 1968. Since that time, no forum has been made available for discussions and information exchange on the subject. In 1989, renewed interest in utilizing nuclear energy for seawater desalination, indicated by several Member States, led to a resolution at the IAEA's General Conference, requesting the Agency to proceed with studies to assess the technical and economic potential of nuclear reactors for seawater desalination in the light of experience gained in recent years. This interest is confirmed each year, when the General Conference requests the Agency to include activities on nuclear desalination in its programme.
<P>
The IAEA has performed several feasibility studies regarding the use of nuclear energy for seawater desalination, with the participation and support of several Member States. In addition to the IAEA's studies, several bilateral and national activities on nuclear desalination are also in progress.
<P>
Considering the ongoing programmes, as well as the growing interest in nuclear desalination worldwide, the IAEA recognizes a need to provide, with the co-operation of other international organizations, a forum for the review of the state-of-the-art technological experience, design and development of nuclear desalination systems, and of prospects for nuclear desalination.
<P>
The Symposium will be beneficial to technical, financial and regulatory decision makers and governmental people associated with this subject.

<B><LI>Purpose</B>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium is:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- 	To prepare for decision-makers (including nuclear-weapon States in relation
to excess weapons material) and the public, a scientific assessment of the
different fuel cycle and reactor strategies with particular reference to the
production, use and disposal of plutonium;
<P>
<DD>- To examine the policy options and explore the scope for international
common understanding on these options;
<P>
<DD>- 	To enhance the transparency of the management and disposition of
plutonium;
<P>
<DD>- 	To examine the scope for future international collaboration in matters relating
to the production, storage, use and disposal of plutonium.
</DL>
<P>
<B><LI>Background</B>
<P>
The nuclear community faces new realities which were not foreseen two decades ago. Nuclear power generation has grown at a far slower rate than expected. Second, there has been limited interest in fast reactors and delay in their commercialization where they are being developed. Third, the adoption of a closed nuclear fuel cycle, where chosen, is only partially achieved through the burning of mixed oxide fuels. These new realities have resulted in the accumulation of plutonium in civilian programmes. In addition, as a result of the end of the cold war, there may soon be a large amount of plutonium from dismantled warheads.
<P>
The production, storage and use of plutonium are the subject of international concerns but there is no common international understanding on what policies should be adopted. The 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons called for "greater transparency on matters relating to the management of Pu (and HEU) for civil purposes, including stock levels and their relationship to national nuclear fuel cycles". Also, the Conference urged "continued international examination of policy options concerning the management and use of stocks of Pu. This consideration could include, inter alia, arrangement for the deposit with IAEA, as envisaged in Article XII.A of its Statute, of Pu (and HEU) as an additional precaution against diversion of materials to nuclear weapons or other explosive devices as well as the possibility of regional fuel cycle centres".
<P>
It is, therefore, timely and important to provide an international forum to examine the policy options and explore the international common understanding, based on sound scientific assessment.
<P>
<B><LI>List of topics</B>
<P>
In the context of the above purpose the following six topics will be covered at the Symposium. These topics will be discussed at six sessions and Key Issue Papers prepared by Working Groups are to be presented (see 4). For each of the topics, subtopics are also listed.

<B><LI>Introduction and Background</B>
<P>
Radiation processing uses high energy ionizing radiation, mainly gammas from Co-60 and high energy electrons (0.2-10 MeV) from electron accelerators. The radiation power needed for industrial processes is typically, between ten and several hundreds of kW. While this is low in comparison with thermochemical processes, the product yield of radiation processes are very high. The scientific basis of radiation technology is the reactive chemical species produced by radiation resulting in changes of chemical, physical and biological properties. This technology has been in use by industry in many countries for more than 30 years in a wide range of applications.
<P>
The beneficial environmental impact and opportunities to apply radiation technology for conservation of the environment has been recognized from the beginning and has been the subject of extensive research.
<P>
Within the programmes of the IAEA implemented through the Department of Research and Isotopes and the Department of Technical Co-operation, the Agency has been active in this field for many years contributing to new developments, training, promotion and transfer of technology. In March 1992 the Agency held an International Symposium in Karlsruhe, Germany on "Applications of Isotopes and Radiation in Conservation of the Environment". About 90 participants representing 30 Member States attended the Symposium. The reports presented were published in the Agency's Proceedings Series (STI/PUB/904; 1992). Radiation technology was one of the several subjects at the Symposium (other subjects included isotope applications for monitoring of environmental pollution, radiotracer studies and nuclear analytical techniques).
<P>
Several new developments in radiation processing technology have taken place since the last Symposium. New power radiation sources have become available; successful demonstrations of cleaning of flue gases were carried out in some countries culminating in an industrial scale plant. Liquid and solid waste treatments using ionizing radiation are also the subject of active research in many institutions; and environmental applications of radiation chemistry are becoming better understood.
<P>
These new developments justify convening a Symposium dealing solely with applications of radiation technology for conservation of the environment.
<P>
The main purpose of this Symposium is to bring together scientists, technologists, industrialists, regulatory authorities, etc. with a view to exchanging information and reviewing the status of current developments and applications and to discuss potential future developments. A further objective is to consider potential needs of developing countries in terms of applied research in radiation processing and mechanisms for promotion and transfer of such technology.
<P>

<B><LI>Introduction</B>
<P>
An IAEA Symposium on International Safeguards will be held in Vienna, Austria from 13 - 17 October, 1997. This symposium will be organized in cooperation with the European Safeguards Research and Development Association (ESARDA) and the Institute of Nuclear Material Management (INMM).
<P>
This symposium will be the eighth in a series, the last of which was the Symposium on International Nuclear Safeguards 1994: Vision for the Future, held from the 14-18 March 1994. The symposia are sponsored by the IAEA to foster a broad exchange of information on concepts and technologies related to international safeguards.
<P>
The IAEA safeguards system, considered to be the cornerstone for assurance of peaceful application of nuclear energy, has evolved through the introduction of new developments and improvements in both its effectiveness and efficiency for the verification of nuclear material and other items under safeguards. Recently demands have been made by the international community that the IAEA should provide credible assurances not only regarding declared nuclear activities, but also regarding the absence of undeclared or covert nuclear activities. The Agency intends to take full account of state-of-the-art technological developments relevant to the field of safeguards in order to accomplish this expanded role in a manner that is effective, efficient and as non-intrusive as possible for all concerned.

<B><LI>Objectives of the Symposium</B>
<P>
The purpose of the Symposium is to exchange experience and lessons learned in fire safety assessment and backfitting for nuclear power plants in operation, especially those built to earlier standards. The Symposium will focus on various fire safety reviews and audits as a means of identifying deficiencies as well as on the process implementing appropriate safety improvements, whereby effective methods, practices and criteria applied in the fire safety assessment and upgrading will be addressed. The Symposium is intended to provide assistance to all those involved in maintaining the fire safety of NPPs (i.e. plant owners/operators, regulators, designers, technical support organizations and manufacturers).
<P>
<B><LI>Background</B>
<P>
Lessons learned from experience in nuclear power plant operation indicate that fires in NPPs pose a real threat to nuclear safety and that their significance extends far beyond the scope of a conventional fire hazard.
<P>
Considerable progress in design and regulatory requirements for fire safety, in fire protection technology and in related analytical techniques has been made in the past two decades. Substantial efforts have been undertaken worldwide to implement these advances in the interest of improving fire safety both at new nuclear power plants and at those in operation.
<P>
Particular attention is being given to those nuclear power plants that were designed and constructed to earlier fire protection standards. The unique requirements on fire safety of NPPs were not clearly recognized before the Browns Ferry incident in 1975. Although the general principles of fire protection were commonly acknowledged, such rules as the physical separation of redundant safe shutdown equipment or the application of fire retardant cable insulation were not strictly followed in the process of design and construction. There are plants in which the fire safety has not been sufficiently taken into consideration in the design and operation of the plants. A systematic examination of the fire safety of these plants is needed in order to identify the existing deficiencies and to implement appropriate corrective measures.
<P>
To assist in these efforts, the IAEA has initiated a project devoted to fire safety. The project, which commenced in 1993, concentrated mainly on the development of guidelines for examining, item by item, the adequacy of overall fire safety arrangements for a plant. During the period 1993-94 the project's tasks focused on the development of a Safety Guide on "Fire Safety during Operation of Nuclear Power Plants". This Safety Guide formulates specific requirements addressed at the plant management and regulatory organizations with regard to the fire safety of nuclear power plants in operation and recommends means to effectively implement such requirements. In the course of preparing this Guide, several Safety Practice documents developed to assist in its implementation. They address the inspection of various elements of fire protection programmes at NPPs including hardware, organization and management and fire hazard analyses. Two Safety Practice documents on the preparation of fire safety analyses (deterministic and probabilistic) are under development.
<P>
It has been recognized that the expertise of a systematic independent assessment of fire safety of a NPP may not always be available to a number of Member States with operating NPPs. In order to assist in enhancing fire safety, the IAEA has already started to offer a number of services to Member States such as fire safety review missions of varying scope.
<P>
This topical Symposium is intended to provide further assistance in enhancing fire safety of the operating nuclear power plants designed and constructed to earlier standards. The Symposium will be a forum for the exchange of practical experience in the systematic assessment of fire safety at NPPs and in the backfitting process.
<P>
<B><LI>Topics of the Symposium</B>
<P>
It is intended that the Symposium should cover all elements of the upgrading process, namely: the identification of fire safety related deficiencies, the search for the most appropriate corrective measures, and the implementation of selected engineering or organizational solutions.
<P>
Various types of reviews of fire safety and audits of plant fire protection programmes will be addressed as an effective means of identifying fire safety deficiencies. Routine reviews, periodic reviews and post-incident reviews are to be mentioned in this context. Fire safety is one of the important areas covered by special safety reviews of NPPs built to earlier standards. A systematic fire hazard analysis and recently, also risk based fire safety assessment studies provide relevant input for these reviews. Currently, work is being carried out within the IAEA project on Fire Safety to provide assistance in the preparation of such studies. Their role in the identification of fire safety deficiencies will be one of the topics of the Symposium.
<P>
The systematic assessment of fire related incidents is another source of information on the fire safety of the plant. Lessons learned from fire may lead to the identification of plant deficiencies that are difficult to discover by routine or periodic fire safety inspections. Fire incident reporting and assessment, exchange of information and related databases are the important topics covered by the Symposium. These topics are also addressed in the current activities of the IAEA project on Fire Safety.
<P>
The basis for the acceptability of fire safety upgrading measures is an important element in the selection of the most appropriate corrective measures and their justification. The regulatory approach to fire safety backfitting will therefore be addressed at the Symposium. The role of the performance based regulatory approach is considered as one of the Symposium topics.
<P>

<SMALL><B>Bucharest, Romania
<BR>
9 - 20 June 1997</B></SMALL>

</CENTER>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Deadline for nominations:</B> 1 March 1997 (advance nominations by fax are welcomed)
<P>
<LI><B>Organizers:</B>International Atomic Energy Agency in co-operation with the 	Government of Romania through the National Agency for Atomic
		Energy of the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Institute
		for Physics and Nuclear Engineering.
<P>
<LI><B>Language:</B>	The language of instruction will be English and Russian (Simultaneous
		interpretation will be provided.)
<P>
<LI><B>Participation:</B>	The training course is open to 25 participants from IAEA Member
		States in the Europe region. Preference will be given to candidates
		from countries which are recipients of IAEA technical co-operation.
<P>
<LI><B>Target countries:</B>	The training course will focus on the needs of developing countries
		having research reactors already shutdown or facing retirement and
		considering decommissioning in the near future. This will also include
		small nuclear facilities typically associated with research reactors such
		as radiochemical laboratories, waste treatment and decontamination and
		storage facilities. Invited countries should ideally propose two
		candidates, one from the operators', the other from the regulators' side.
<P>
<LI><B>Purpose of the course:</B>	This training course is designed to provide information and to impart
		lessons learned from past experiences in decommissioning to
		developing Member States. In this manner, elements learned at this
		training course will assist decision making, planning and implementation
		associated with the decommissioning of research reactors and research
		facilities. This is especially true of those facilities undergoing
		decommissioning because of their ageing condition or because they are
		facing shutdown in the near term. Moreover, it is the main objective of
		this training course to demonstrate the need for early and complete
		project planning to achieve safe and cost-effective decommissioning of
		nuclear installations.

	<P>
<LI><B>Participants' qualifications:</B>	The course is designed for managers or engineers responsible for planning and implementing decommissioning programmes of research 	reactors. The course should be also useful for those involved in the
		nuclear regulatory framework, when reviewing decommissioning plans,
		inspecting decommissioning activities and confirming satisfactory
		completion of decommissioning. Participants must be fluent in English
		or Russian, and should have a university degree in science or
		engineering and ideally a minimum of three years relevant experience in
		the field of decommissioning, waste management and/or radiation
		protection techniques.
<P>
<LI><B>Nature of the course:	</B>The course covers <I>inter alia</I> decommissioning planning, including the
		selection of a strategy and the development of a decommissioning plan,
		decontamination and dismantling technologies, waste management
		aspects, and decommissioning cost estimating and financing. Besides
		the technological aspects, the course includes regulatory, safety and
		radiation protection issues of decommissioning, as well as an overview
		of national programmes in decommissioning and recommended
		international practices. Although spent fuel management is an
		important pre-requisite to the safe and timely implementation of the
		overall decommissioning process, it will not be explicitly discussed in
		the course. The course will include technical lectures by experts
		followed by discussion periods to allow an exchange of information,
		discuss and seek solutions to practical national problems. Lecturers will
		come from Member States with well developed decommissioning
		programmes as well as from the IAEA. In addition to course lectures,
		technical visits and relevant video films are also planned. A short
		survey of the national decommissioning experience is expected to be
		presented by the participants for discussion. A syllabus of the course is
		attached.
<P>
<LI><B>Application procedure:</B>	Nominations may be submitted on the standard IAEA application form
		for training courses. Completed forms should be endorsed by and
		returned through the official channels established (the Ministry of
		Foreign Affairs, the National Atomic Energy Authority, or the Office of
		the United Nations Development Programme). They must be received
		by the International Atomic Energy Agency, P.O. Box 100, A-1400
		Vienna, Austria, not later than <B>1 March 1997</B>. Nominations received

Developments in Radioimmunoassay and
Related Procedures<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium held in co-operation with WHO, Vienna,
26-30 August 1991. The symposium focused on recent methodological
developments which would enable laboratories in developing
countries to upgrade their level of radioimmunoassay practice
with the aim of bridging the gap to the industrialized world.
Attention was also given to the production of primary reagents
including monoclonal antibodies and the establishment of external
quality assessment schemes, also of particular concern to
developing countries. This is also the case for newly emerging
techniques, including non-nuclear analytical methods, as
alternatives to radioimmunoassay. The clinical papers were on
public health issues of grave socioeconomic concern such as
neonatal hypothyroidism and cancer. Discussions on the future of
radioimmunoassay provided guidelines as to the most suitable
directions in which progress in radioimmunoassay could be made.

October to 4 November 1988. Phase I of
the Asian RPFI programme demonstrated the technoeconomic
feasibility of irradiation for processing of food
items of economic importance to the region, e.g. mangoes, fishery
products, onions and spices. Effective
transfer of food irradiation technology to the industry in the
region was implemented in Phase II, resulting
in successful market testings of several irradiated food items,
e.g. potatoes, onions, garlic, dried fish, spices,
apples, oranges, Chinese sausages and Thai fermented sausages.
Under Phase II, which was carried out from
1985 to 1988, the following objectives were covered: (1)
disinfestation and decontamination of stored
products; (2) improvement in the hygiene of processed seafood;
(3) insect disinfestation of fruits for
quarantine purposes; and (4) sprout inhibition of root crops.

the conclusions and recommendations.
The papers deal with radiation disinfestation of cereals, beans,
pulses, oilseeds, copra, dates and tobacco
leaves. The research findings show that the advantages of this
method are that there are no undesirable
residues in foods, no resistance developed by the insects and no
significant changes in the physicochemical
properties or nutritive value of the treated products. Another
important aspect under consideration was the
development of suitable packaging materials for controlling
reinfestation of irradiated products.

Proceedings of the final research co-ordination meeting organized
by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of
Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, 27-31 August 1990. The
Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) was initiated in 1985 with
the purpose of determining the
radiation doses required to provide quarantine security from
insects and other pests infesting food and
agricultural commodities in trade, assessing the tolerance of
host commodities to the radiation dose(s)
required to provide quarantine security and distributing
information on the possible use of irradiation as a
quarantine treatment of food and agricultural commodities to
interested parties. The results of the work
carried out under this CRP by laboratories in several countries
have demonstrated that irradiation is a viable
alternative to ethylene dibromide fumigation of food. These
proceedings include the final reports of work
carried out by the scientists who co-operated in this CRP, as
well as review papers presented at the Second
Task Force Meeting on Irradiation as a Quarantine Treatment of

insecticides, as fewer insecticides are available for effective
control and as environmental concerns limit the
use of some insecticides. The genetic control of insect pests
offers solutions to some of these problems.
Biotechnology offers enormous potential for insect control, and
rapid progress over the next decade can be
anticipated.

<B>Radiation Induced F<sub>1</sub> Sterility in Lepidoptera for

<I>Panel Proceedings Series</I>

<P>
Proceedings of the final research co-ordination meeting organized
by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of
Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, Phoenix, Arizona,
9-13 September 1991. Genetic control of
lepidopterous pests includes the environmentally benign use of
the sterile insect technique as well as the use
of inherited sterility, which is especially pronounced in the
first filial (F<sub>1</sub>) generation following the exposure
of the parents to substerilizing doses of ionizing radiation.  In
the case of inherited sterility, the F<sub>1</sub>
generation is reared in the field, thereby reducing costs. Some
lepidopterous species can be mass reared in
factories, stockpiled in diapause, irradiated and activated for
release in synchrony with the wild population.
This method has been highly successful since 1968 in protecting
0.5 million hectares of cotton in the San
Joaquin Valley of California from the pink bollworm. This report
presents information mainly on the inital
phases in the development of the use of inherited sterility to
manage populations of the corn earworm,
codling moth, Asian corn borer, European corn borer, diamondback
moth, cotton leafworm, fall army worm,
tropical army worm, gypsy moth, pink bollworm and wild mulberry
silkworm.

<P>
Proceedings of an Advisory Group meeting, Vienna, 17-21 November
1986. The need for plant produced industrial raw materials, as
well as the fact that more and more people depend upon fewer and
fewer plant species for their food, led scientists to consider
the possibility of domesticating additional plant species, i.e.
changing hitherto not cultivated plant species into crop plants.
As spontaneous single gene mutations contributed substantially to
domestication, experimental mutagenesis appears to be a promising
tool to accelerate the process of domestication in new crop
plants. The purpose of the meeting was to consider the
possibilities and limitations of induced mutation technology for
the purpose of domestication, to discuss the methodology,
identify target species and define the character changes
required.

Mutation breeding is a valuable supplement to the techniques
available for plant breeders in developing improved varieties.
However, it has its limitations. It is generally recognized that
more efforts are needed to develop selection methods that enable
the breeder to make advances in complex and difficult
characteristics related to productivity, adaptation and
tolerance. Interdisciplinary co-operation is mandatory for such
developments.

Proceedings of a symposium organized by the IAEA and FAO, Vienna,

plant breeding purposes of somaclonal variation, i.e. the
occurrence of mutations during in vitro culture with or without
the application of ionizing radiation or other mutagens. Another
issue was finding ways and means of maintaining the genetic
integrity of plants under in vitro conditions, such integrity
being of vital importance if in vitro techniques are to be used
to propagate virus-free clones of economically important plants,
or to preserve germplasm in gene banks. In vitro culture
techniques considerably accelerate the plant breeding cycle. This
factor and the advantage of using haploids derived from another
culture were also discussed at the symposium.

evaluate progress in the use of stable isotopes to examine
various aspects of soil fertility and plant nutrition and some
environmental problems, the potential and limitations of existing
methods, and possibilities for further development. The meeting
focused on the site level rather than the landscape level and,
more specifically, on soil-plant relations, although landscape
environmental aspects were also examined. The underlying theme
was an assessment of current and possible future approaches to
two problems of concern: how to increase or sustain productivity
with minimum inputs, and how to limit environmental damage due to
inappropriate land management and to industry.

<I>Panel Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>
Proceedings of a co-ordinated research programme meeting, Vienna,
28 August to 2 September 1978. Isotopic tracer techniques provide
a most important tool for studying biota interactions in soil and
aquatic ecosystems and for assessing the significance to the
residue. Concepts and new approaches to studies on eutrophication
and ecotoxicology are dealt with. Labelled substrate techniques
provide a very useful tool for studying the effects of residues
on biological processes vital to soils and fisheries.

Proceedings of a final research co-ordination meeting organized
by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and
Agriculture, Rockhampton, Australia, 20-24 February 1989. This
publication reports the results of the second five year
co-ordinated research programme to determine the constraints on
buffalo production in terms of nutrition, reproduction and
disease. Studies on nutrition focused on the comparative aspects
of digestion of tropical forages and crop by-products, and on the
effects of supplementation or treatment of fibrous feeds. In
reproduction, emphasis was placed on the evaluation of methods
for overcoming prolonged postpartum anoestrus and for improving
overall productivity. The studies on diseases dealt with
trypanosomiasis and rotavirus infection. Field oriented
interdisciplinary research was stressed and many of the trials
were carried out under smallholder conditions.

<P>
Proceedings of the final research co-ordination meeting organized
by the IAEA and the Direzione Generale per la Cooperazione
Italiana allo Sviluppo, Rabat, Morocco, 23-27 March 1987. The
production of meat, milk, wool and other products from grazing
animals has a long and important tradition in countries around
the Mediterranean and North Africa. Although there are many
millions of both large and small ruminants in these countries,
the output of livestock products is increasingly falling short of
the demand created by human population expansion. To reverse, or
at least slow down, this trend requires that better use be made
of existing animal and feed resources -- in effect to optimize
individual productivity. The strategies to be adopted to optimize
productivity need to be developed through both basic and applied
research on breeding, feeding and other management practices.
Nuclear techniques, employed in conjunction with standard
methods, play an important role in developing a proper
understanding of animal/environment interactions; they can also
be used to examine how such interactions can be manipulated to
minimize the impact of constraints and thereby to improve
productivity.

nutrition and reproduction of ruminant and other herbivorous
animals, as well as in new approaches to disease diagnosis and
control. Consideration was given to isotope and related
techniques currently employed in research, but more importantly
to the application of research findings in improving the
productivity of livestock reared in tropical and subtropical
developing countries, e.g. of ruminant animals whose diets mainly
consist of poor quality roughages. Also addressed were advances
in the development of highly sensitive radioimmunoassay methods
for measuring the concentrations of reproductive and other
hormones. In addition, emphasis was given to developments in the
use of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, not only for diagnosis
of diseases of major relevance to developing countries, but also
for their applicability in monitoring the effectiveness of large
scale vaccination programmes and conducting epidemiological
surveys.

Isotopes and Radiation in Parasitology IV<BR>
<I>Panel Proceedings Series</B></I>
<P>
This book is the result of an Advisory Group meeting organized by
the IAEA at the University of Cambridge Veterinary School, United
Kingdom,10-14 September 1979. To increase the availability of
animal products, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas,
more effort must be made to control parasites and, at the same
time, the scale and nature of how host and parasite alike adapt
to the environment must be defined. This requires a better
understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunology of
parasitic infections under the conditions of various climatic
regions and in different host genotypes. In this context, nuclear
techniques, employed in conjunction with other standard
techniques, are important research tools. The contents include
papers on the pathogenesis and immunology of animal
trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis and gastrointestinal nematode
infections; trypanotolerance and the genetics of resistance to
ticks and endoparasites of cattle; tissue and blood protein
turnover in parasitized animals; the influence of the environment
on the epidemiology of helminth infections; and immunization
against parasites.

<P>
Reproduction must be regarded as one of the major limiting
factors in animal production, and many of the modern methods for
improving reproduction rely heavily on the ability to measure
hormone levels in blood and milk. This has produced a worldwide
demand for laboratory facilities to carry out hormone assays and
the need for specialist training to allow these assays to be
undertaken. The need to measure nanogram and picogram quantities
and the use of radionuclides require considerable skill and
care, and this manual has been prepared to aid training and to
provide the sort of information that rarely appears in scientific
papers. Included are sections on the biology of reproduction and
a general introduction to radioimmunoassay.

Proceedings of a final research co-ordination meeting, Manila,
Philippines, 30 January-3 February 1984. The unique role of the
buffalo in Asian agriculture is centuries old, but it is only
within the past decade or so that national and international
organizations have become seriously interested in promoting the
research long recognized as being required to define and improve
output from the buffalo at the farm level. This publication
reports the results of a five year programme of research which
adopted a multidisciplinary approach to the study and solution of
problems relating to an animal of tremendous economic and social
value.

Neutron Monitoring for
Radiological Protection
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 252</I>
</B>
<P>
The assessment of the dose equivalent to organs of the body
resulting from the exposure to neutrons is one of the important
problems of radiation protection. The practical measurement of
neutrons presents special difficulties, giving rise to problems
in the development of techniques of neutron monitoring, the
design of monitoring instruments and the assessment of organ
dose equivalents resulting from exposure to neutrons alone or to
mixed radiation fields. The main sources of neutrons are sealed
radionuclide sources, nuclear reactors and particle accelerators.
Neutrons are encountered in the enrichment of fissile materials
and in the processing of spent fuels. Neutron sources are also
widely used in medicine and industry. Neutron monitoring is
therefore a subject of increasing general interest.

Neutron Scattering in the 'Nineties
<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of an international conference organized in
cooperation with the J&uuml;lich Nuclear Research Centre,
J&uuml;lich,
Germany, 14-18 January 1985. The study of condensed matter
physics through neutron scattering techniques is one of the most
active and productive areas of material science research.
The proceedings emphasize new technological developments,
both in powerful new neutron sources -- steady-state as well     

             
as pulsed -- and in new instrumentation and techniques,          

        
indicating that neutron scattering is posed for a new intense    

             
period of growth in terms of the use of the technique in basic   

             
research as well as its application to applied sciences and      

                  
industry. Various research utilization aspects are covered       

             
in a number of review papers, which not only deal with           

        
condensed matter physics but also include biology and            
macromolecules, polymer studies, microemulsions and material     

        
science, all of which papers indicate considerable prospects for 

             
industrial applications.

isotopes became available it was immediately recognized that they
offered an almost ideal solution to tracer selection. Extensive
experience has been gathered all over the world in the

<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium, Vienna, 5-8 June 1990. Over the last
decades, many nuclear techniques have been developed and used on
an industrial scale for the exploration and exploitation of
energy and mineral resources, resulting in very great technical
and economic benefits. The major nuclear techniques which are
currently employed on a large scale include nucleonics control
and on-stream analysis, nuclear well logging and tracer
investigations. The advantages of nuclear techniques include
rapidity, relative simplicity and, in some cases, the possibility
of use in hostile environments where no other methods can be
used. Furthermore, nuclear measurements and nucleonics control
can be made by non-contact processes. The purpose of the
symposium was to review the latest concepts and developments and
to foster an exchange of information leading to technology
transfer from developed to developing countries.

Research reactors are interdisciplinary tools that can be used in
a variety of fields. They also play an important role in the
support of national and international nuclear programmes. Purpose
research reactors with high fluxes, such as materials testing and
neutron beam reactors, have a wide application. Their efficient
utilization requires technology groups specialized in the design
and fabrication of irradiation devices, as well as dosimetry and
hot cell groups to permit insertion and extraction of radioactive
material and post-irradiation examinations.

medicine and biology, radioisotope production and neutron
activation techniques. The present CINDA file contains more than
230 000 entries. It also includes index lines for experimental
and evaluated numerical data files available from data centres.
The entries are sorted by element, isotope and data category. The
list of data categories comprises microscopic cross-sections,
angular distributions and energy spectra from all neutron-induced
reactions of the energy range from 0 to 50 MeV and above, as well
as resonance parameters, resonance integrals, level density
parameters, yields of fission neutrons and fission fragments,
gamma ray spectra, and also a few related nuclear reactions such
as spontaneous fission, photo-fission and production of
photo-neutrons. CINDA-A, the archival issue in 5 volumes,

It provides most of the sub-surface information needed by the    
exploration geologist, including in-situ analysis, lithological  
identification, stratigraphic correlation, and information on    
density and moisture. Logging is equally important in mine    
development and grade control, in mining operations and in    
production. The present text takes into account the requirements 
of both developing countries, which might be at an incipient    
stage of uranium exploration, and industrialized countries, where
more advanced exploration and resource evaluation techniques are 
commonly in use.

This publication is the result of recognition of the great     
potential for discovery of additional uranium resources in Africa

and South America and the long common geological history of the  

two continents. The document provides a summary of the regional
geology and tectonics as a basis for correlation of the
geodynamic settings of the uranium occurrences. Studies and new  

  satellite imagery interpretation of West-Central Africa are the

    basis for much of the new information included. The document 

   reviews the occurrences of uranium and the implications for   

 exploration. This compilation of geological information provides

    an excellent summary of current knowledge on the geology of
the      two continents that should provide new insights into the

Proceedings of a symposium, Vienna, 5-8 June 1990. Over the last 

    few decades, many nuclear techniques have been developed and 

    used on an industrial scale for the exploration and
exploitation       of energy and mineral resources, resulting in
great technical and       economic benefits. The major nuclear
techniques which are       currently employed on a large scale
include nucleonics control       and on-stream analysis, nuclear
well logging and tracer       investigations. The advantages of
nuclear techniques include       rapidity, relative simplicity of
use and, in some cases, the       possibility of use in hostile
environments where no other methods       can be used.
Furthermore, nuclear measurements and nucleonics       control
can be made by non-contact processes. The purpose of the      
symposium was to review the latest concepts and developments and 

    to foster an exchange of information leading to technology

<B>Vein-type and Similar Uranium Deposits in Rocks Younger than
Proterozoic<BR>
<I>Panel Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>

Proceedings of a Technical Committee meeting, Lisbon, Portugal,
24-28 September 1979. Vein-type and similar uranium
deposits made the main contribution to world production of
uranium in the early days of the development of the nuclear power
era up to the time when the production of uranium coming from
sandstone deposits and Proterozoic quartz-pebble conglomerates
played a dominant role. However, ores from vein-type deposits
have always maintained a significant contribution.

World Map of Uranium Deposits
</B>
<P>
This is the first ever geological map of the world's uranium
deposits at a scale of 1:30 000 000.  It provides information on
potential economic uranium deposits containing more than 500
metric tonnes of uranium with an average grade greater than 0.03%
uranium. The geological settings and locations of 590 uranium
deposits meeting the minimum criteria are shown.  Shape, colour
and size of symbols on the map indicate the deposit type,
operational status and size.  The names of the reported uranium
deposits are listed in the legend.  It is the most comprehensive
compilation of relevant information ever published and includes
previously unavailable information on uranium deposits in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as in China.  The
maps are available rolled or folded.

This is the tenth and latest volume in the present series. It is 
mainly concerned with the concentration of the environmental 
isotopes (tritium, deuterium and oxygen-18) in monthly samples of

precipitation taken by a global network of 169 stations in the 
period 1988-1991. Selected meteorological data, such as the 
amount of precipitation, mean water vapour pressure and surface 
air temperature, are also presented. Data before 1988 which were 
unavailable at the time of the earlier issues have also been 
included in the latter part of this volume as late reports. The 
great majority of the data comes from the IAEA/WMO
Isotopes-in-Precipitation Network, which was set up by the  IAEA
in co-operation with WMO and seven national laboratories.  The
collection of the precipitation samples is carried out by the 
meteorological services in 45 countries and territories. Analyses

of the network samples are made in co-operating laboratories, a 
full list of which is given at the end of this publication.

This report is the result of a consultants' meeting, Vienna, 1-4
December 1980, a follow-up to an Advisory Group meeting held in
Vienna in November 1979 for the purpose of reviewing the
application of isotope techniques in mining and waste disposal
hydrology, with special emphasis on the problems connected with
low-flow, low-permeability regimes. The report describes the
present state of development and the applications of various
isotope techniques used in studying groundwater origin and flow,
with emphasis on low-permeability rock systems. The application
of isotope techniques in waste isolation technology can be
especially valuable when used in connection with other
hydrological and geochemical methods.

Environmental Changes in the Hydrosphere and the Atmosphere<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium, Vienna, 19-23 April 1993. Natural
isotopes are among the most powerful tools for investigating past
and current environmental changes. In particular, stable isotopes
have proved to be very useful proxy indicators of climate related
parameters such as surface air temperature, relative humidity of
the atmosphere and amount of precipitation, whereas radioactive
isotopes are widely used as a dating tool. The release of
radionuclides during nuclear bomb tests permitted studies of the
dynamics of transport and mixing processes in the atmosphere. It
also allowed a global tracer experiment on the hydrological and
carbon cycles, which substantially contributed to better
understanding of these two vital compartments of the global
ecosystem. A wide spectrum of themes was discussed at the
symposium, covering both the 'present' and the 'past' of the
global atmosphere/hydrosphere system. Case studies as well as
methodological aspects of various isotope techniques applied in
both areas of research were presented.

Proceedings of an Advisory Group meeting, Vienna, 17-21 November
1986. Although fractured rocks cover approximately one    third
of the earth's surface, knowledge of groundwater flow    dynamics
still needs to be substantively improved. The main    objective
of the meeting was to discuss the theory of fluid flow    in
fractured media and the role of nuclear techniques in the flow   
dynamics of fractured and fissured rock media. Critical reviews  

of the environmental isotope and nuclear techniques being used in

  the study of the hydrology of fractured and fissured rocks were

  presented and general recommendations were made.

<I>Panel Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>
Proceedings of a consultants' meeting, Vienna, 29 May to 2 June  

 1989. Application of isotopes of noble gases as tracers in    
environmental studies ranges from studies of transport and mixing

   processes in the atmosphere and the ocean, determination of
the     age, origin and mode of flow of groundwater bodies and   

investigations of rock-water interactions and palaeoclimatic    
research to their spectacular role, although not yet fully    
proven, as early indicators of earthquakes and volcanic    
eruptions. The purpose of the meeting was twofold: to review the 

  current status of techniques using isotopes of noble gases in
the     general field of environmental studies, with emphasis
placed on     investigations of the atmosphere and the
hydrosphere, and to     provide guidelines for further
developments and research needed     in the field.

The idea of using tracers (chemical, dyes, etc.) in the
investigation of complex physical phenomena has always attracted
the attention of scientists and engineers. When radioactive
isotopes became available it was immediately recognized that they
offered an almost ideal solution to tracer selection. Extensive
experience has been gathered all over the world in the
application of radioactive tracers in industry. This guide is
devoted to reviewing the present status of the tracer method as
such and to its applications to those branches of industry which
have derived large benefits from the use of this technology.

<P>
Proceedings of a symposium, Vienna, 5-8 June 1990. Over the last
decades, many nuclear techniques have been developed and used on
an industrial scale for the exploration and exploitation of
energy and mineral resources, resulting in very great technical
and economic benefits. The major nuclear techniques which are
currently employed on a large scale include nucleonics control
and on-stream analysis, nuclear well logging and tracer
investigations. The advantages of nuclear techniques include
rapidity, relative simplicity and, in some cases, the possibility
of use in hostile environments where no other methods can be
used. Furthermore, nuclear measurements and nucleonics control
can be made by non-contact processes. The purpose of the
symposium was to review the latest concepts and developments and
to foster an exchange of information leading to technology
transfer from developed to developing countries.

<BR>
<I>Safety Series No. 95</I>
</B>
<P>
Over the past decade there have been significant developments in
the techniques and methods of monitoring radon and radon
daughters,
thoron and thoron daughters, and radioactive dusts encountered in
the mining and milling of radioactive ores. The development of
new
techniques and methods of measurement has received increased
attention owing to the fact that the efficient control of radon
and
its daughters in the mining atmosphere, particularly in
underground
mines, is a difficult task. Epidemiological studies have clearly
demonstrated that the incidence of lung cancers among underground
uranium miners, and also among underground non-uranium miners who
were exposed to radon and radon daughters in their occupations,
is
higher than that among the general public. This publication is a
revision of IAEA Safety Series No. 43, originally issued in 1976.
The revised version has been limited in coverage to radiation
monitoring and medical surveillance.

This guide has been developed through a series of technical
meetings and represents an international consensus on useful
operating principles. These principles incorporate features which
will be effective in maintaining fuel subcritical, removing
residual heat, providing radiation protection and containing
radioactive materials for the lifetime of the facility. It is
intended for use by the nuclear power industry, its supporting
organizations and related regulatory bodies in identifying and
managing all relevant issues on the operational aspects for the
safe interim storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plants. It
complements Safety Series No. 116, Design of Spent Fuel Storage
Facilities, and Safety Series No. 118, Safety Assessment for
Spent Fuel Storage Facilities.

Storage of Water Reactor Spent Fuel in Water Pools: Survey of
World Experience
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 218</I>
</B>
<P>
In 1979, the IAEA and OECD/NEA jointly issued a questionnaire
dealing with all aspects of water pool storage. This report
summarizes the information received from storage pool operators.
Forecasts predict that by the year 2000 more than tonnes of heavy
metal from spent LWR fuel will have been accumulated. Although
very positive experience with wet storage has been gained over
the past 40 years, making wet storage a proven technology, it
appears desirable to summarize all available data for the benefit
of designers, storage pool operators, licensing agencies and the
general public. Such data will be essential for assessing the
viability of extended water pool storage of spent nuclear fuel.
<P>
<I>Contents:</I>  Summary of conclusions; Introduction; Spent
fuel pool history; Extent of spent fuel storage experience;
Current practice in spent fuel pool design and operation; Spent
fuel pool chemistries; Radiochemistry; Spent fuel pool
components; Spent fuel history and behaviour; Special operations;
Measures to control radiation doses and waste volumes; Spent fuel
pool practices and innovations; Interim dry storage of spent
fuel.

Balancing Automation and Human Action in Nuclear Power Plants
<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium jointly organized with OECD/NEA,
Munich, 9-13 July 1990. The purpose was to review developments
and to discuss directions for future efforts. One important
aspect of nuclear safety in recent years has been the very high
rate of development and subsequent introduction of computer
technology. The data acquired by computer systems have to be
presented to the operator in a structured form with priorization
capabilities. Further developments of operator support systems
may considerably influence the interface between human control
and automation. To deal with fast transients, automation and real
time simulation have to be used. For other abnormal and accident
situations, human flexibility may be preferred. Full use must be
made of all plant resources, with system state and success path
monitoring being of special interest in accident situations. The
symposium discussed all aspects of balancing problems, operating,
maintenance and testing, including all levels from information
processing to full automation.

<I>Safety Series No. 75-INSAG-7</I>
</B>
<P>
The purpose of this report is to update findings of the
International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group's Summary Report on
the
Post-Accident Review Meeting on the Chernobyl Accident (INSAG-1),
published in September 1986, in the light of further information
that has been revealed since that meeting. INSAG stands by the
general conclusions of INSAG-1 about the accident's causes and
their implications for the safety of the Chernobyl type light
water cooled graphite moderated RBMK reactors. However, the new
information, which derives from studies made in the then USSR on
the physical origins of the accident, has led INSAG to shift the
emphasis of its conclusions from the actions of the operating
staff to faulty design of the reactor's control rods and safety
systems. Deficiencies in the regulation and management of safety
matters throughout the Soviet nuclear power industry have also
been revealed and are discussed. Two detailed Soviet reports on
the causes and circumstances of the Chernobyl accident,
translated into English by the IAEA, and a statement of measures
that have been taken to enhance the safety of RBMK reactors are
included.

This report was prepared in response to the recommendation of
the
IAEA General Conference in 1992 that the Director General
develop
a process to provide a common basis on which the acceptable
level
of safety of all operating nuclear power plants built to
earlier
standards can be judged. This followed a recommendation made
at
the IAEA Conference on 'The Safety of Nuclear Power:  Strategy
for the Future' held in September 1991.  The report also
provides
a basis for allocating responsibilities for, and deciding on
the
best approach to, making a safety assessment, and for
selecting
criteria to adopt in deciding on what corrective action to
take.

This report is part of the IAEA's programme on underground
disposal
of radioactive wastes. The repositories under consideration are
mined cavities in deep continental rocks for the emplacement of
wastes in solid and packaged form. The report further deals with
the effects of heat from high level wastes on the performance of
deep geological repository components. This generation of heat,
which occurs in the near field of the repository system, affects
the mobilization of radionuclides and their subsequent migration
to
the far field. The report mainly deals with high level wastes and
spent fuel, but considers other types of wastes as well, wherever
appropriate.

<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 232</I></A>
</B>
<P>
This report deals with an original method of disposal of
radioactive wastes which was developed and has been in use in the
United States of America for almost two decades. In this method,
radioactive waste effluents in the form of a slurry containing
hydraulic binders (grouts) are injected by means of fracturing
into
a deep underground formation considered to be isolated from the
surface. The composition of the grout is carefully chosen so that
the slurry solidifies in situ, ensuring fixation of the waste and
rendering this type of disposal final in character. Such liquid
wastes can be disposed of directly without going through the
stages
of intensive reconcentration and evaporation or solidification,
packaging, transport or extensive site monitoring. A cost/benefit
analysis shows that in some cases the method of disposal by
hydraulic fracturing would, for this very reason, be at least ten
times more economical than competing techniques.

Long Lived Radioactive Wastes 
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 304</I></A>
</B>
<P>
A unique and scientifically most difficult aspect of predictive
safety analysis of repositories for long lived wastes is the
extrapolation of short term field and laboratory data to the long
periods of time required by regulatory agencies for performance
assessment. Natural analogues may be the only way of obtaining
data
on the cumulative effect of the migration of radionuclides over
the
time-scales of interest. This report briefly summarizes the state
of the art in this field for technical specialists and may also
serve as an introduction to the subject for managers.

This report was to provide basic guidance on protection of humans
and the environment from the hazards associated with deep
geological disposal of high level radioactive wastes. It reflects
the need for internationally harmonized criteria. It sets out a
basic safety philosophy for use in planning such disposals, the
main objective being the isolation of the radioactive wastes from
the human environment for considerable periods of time. The
safety
principles contained in this book are generally consistent with
the
recent recommendations of the International Commission on

Sealing of Underground Repositories for Radioactive Wastes
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 319</I>
</B>
<P>
For high level and alpha bearing radioactive wastes, the disposal
concept most generally agreed upon is the emplacement of the
conditioned waste in deep underground repositories in stable
geological formations. The report reflects the general consensus
that long lived radioactive wastes can be isolated safely from
the
human environment in such repositories located in deep geological
formations. One of the most important tasks in the development of
underground disposal systems is the plugging of boreholes and the
sealing of shafts excavated for either exploratory or operational
purposes. Several countries have outlined proposals and
identified
geological formations for detailed examination as potential host
media for waste repositories.

A wide variety of radiation dosimeters and survey instruments are
used to monitor exposure to neutrons. To establish an adequate
neutron monitoring programme and to evaluate dosimetry results
properly, it is important to know both the energy distribution of
the neutrons encountered and the energy dependent response of the
measuring devices. It is also important for calibration to use
neutron fields whose spectra are appropriate for the particular
application. This compendium includes a collection of neutron
spectra encountered in various occupational environments and the
spectra of calibration neutron sources. It also gives the
response
functions of various neutron dosimeters and survey instruments.
Finally, it includes the calculated energy responses for each of
the detectors and spectra given.

The principles of radiation protection recommended by the
International Commission on Radiological Protection for the
normal
operation of a radiation source constitute a dose limitation
system
that has three components: namely, the justification of a
practice,
the optimization of radiation protection and the limitation of
individual doses. This report describes how the application of
these principles may be extended to unexpected or accidental
situations by changing from the dose based system of radiation
protection to a unified approach within a probabilistic
framework.

These Standards are based on the latest assessments of the biological effects of
irradiation made by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic
Radiation, and on the recommendations of the International Commission on
Radiological Protection and the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group. The
Standards represent an international consensus on qualitative and quantitative
requirements for protection and safety for: planned practices such as nuclear power
generation and the use of radiation and radioactive materials in medicine and industry;
intervention in existing situations such as chronic exposure to natural sources of
radiation or exposure following an accident; control of radiation sources, including
notification and authorization, and criteria for exemption. Consensus guidance is also
given on: occupational radiaton protection; protection of patients in radiography,
fluoroscopy, computer tomography, mammography and nuclear medicine; protection of
members of the public from exposure to radioactive materials released to the
environment; prevention of incidents giving rise to potential exposures; and
intervention in a radiological emergency.

Neutron Monitoring for Radiological Protection
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 252</I>
</B>
<P>
The assessment of the dose equivalent to organs of the body
resulting from the exposure to neutrons is one of the important
problems of radiation protection. The practical measurement of
neutrons presents special difficulties, giving rise to problems
in
the development of techniques of neutron monitoring, the design
of
monitoring instruments and the assessment of organ dose
equivalents
resulting from exposure to neutrons alone or to mixed radiation
fields. The main sources of neutrons are sealed radionuclide
sources, nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. Neutrons are
encountered in the enrichment of fissile materials and in the
processing of spent fuels. Neutron sources are also widely used
in
medicine and industry. Neutron monitoring is therefore a subject
of
increasing general interest.

is
concerned with the subject of limiting releases of radioactive
effluents during normal, controlled operations of nuclear
installations. It does not deal with releases during accidents
where it is only possible to limit exposures by intervention. In
practice, a choice must be made between releasing radioactive
materials directly from an installation, storing them, treating
and
disposing of them by some means, or a combination of these
methods.

Assessment of Radiological Consequences and Evaluation of
Protective Measures:</A>
<BR>
Reports by an International Advisory Committee
</B>
<P>
The International Chernobyl Project was launched in 1990 at the
request of the Government of the USSR to assess the environmental
and health situation in the areas of the Soviet Union
contaminated
by the Chernobyl accident and to evaluate the measures taken by
the
authorities to safeguard the health of the population still
living
in these areas. Some 200 scientists from 25 countries and 7
international and regional organizations participated in this
Project. An International Advisory Committee was set up to
oversee
the Project and approve its conclusions and recommendations.
Almost
50 missions to the USSR were carried out in order to obtain the
best available information and to make an independent assessment
of
the situation.
<P>
The results of the International Chernobyl Project are presented
in
two main documents: The full Technical Report, which contains, in
addition to the conclusions and recommendations of the Project,
all
the relevant methodologies and the data upon which they are
based,
and the Overview, which summarizes the methodology presented in
the
Technical Report and also presents the conclusions and
recommendations. While the Technical Report is intended for the
scientific community, the Overview is intended for decision
makers,
concerned groups and the informed public. Three maps showing the
distribution of surface ground contamination by plutonium,
strontium and caesium released by the Chernobyl accident and
deposited in the Byelorussian SSR, the Russian SFSR and the
Ukraine
are attached to the Overview. A third document, containing the
proceedings of an International  Conference which took place in
Vienna in May 1991, presents  the Project results to the
scientific
community and to the media.  The Proceedings should be read in
conjunction with either the  Overview or the Technical Report.

The widespread use of radiation sources in medicine, agriculture,
industry, research and teaching, in spite of all the precautions
taken, may cause accidents which result in injury or death of
persons and damage to property. All practical steps to prevent
such
accidents must be taken and emergency actions be planned in
advance
in order to limit injuries and damage. Emergency plans should be
sufficiently broad to cover unforeseen or very improbable
accidents
as well as those that are considered more likely. Such plans
should
be established by the users of radioactive materials as well as
by
local emergency agencies and national competent authorities.

<A NAME=41>The Radiological Accident in San Salvador</A>
</B>
<P>
On 5 February 1989, a radiological accident occurred at an
industrial irradiation facility near San Salvador, El Salvador.
Medical products are sterilized at the facility by irradiation by
means of an intensely radioactive cobalt-60 source in a movable
source rack. This source rack became stuck in the irradiation
position. The operator bypassed the irradiator's degraded safety
systems and entered the radiation room with two other workers to
free the source rack manually. The three men were exposed to high
radiation doses and developed the acute radiation syndrome. They
received initial hospital treatment in San Salvador and
subsequent,
more specialized treatment in Mexico City. The legs and feet of
two
men were so seriously injured that amputation was required. The
worker who had been most exposed died six and a half months after
the accident from lung damage due to irradiation complicated by
injury sustained during treatment. The report describes the
accident and the response to it and presents lessons derived for
operators and suppliers of irradiators, national authorities,

<A NAME=31>The Radiological Accident in Soreq</A>
</B>
<P>
On 21 June 1990 a fatal radiological accident occurred at an
industrial irradiation facility at Soreq, Israel. An operator
entered the irradiation room by circumventing safety systems and
was acutely exposed with an estimated whole body dose of 10-20
Gy.
The accident, like earlier accidents at similar irradiators, was
the consequence of the contravention of operating procedures. An
IAEA review team investigated the causes of the accident. This
report presents its findings and recommendations and describes
the
clinical management of the patient, particularly of the
haematological phase. The medical treatment included the use of
emerging therapies with haematopoietic growth factor drugs which
may rescue the overexposed patient, albeit in this case only
temporarily. The report is intended for regulatory authorities
responsible for the regulation and inspection of irradiators,
operating organizations and physicians who may need to treat
overexposed patients.
<P>
<I>Contents:</I> 1. Introduction; 2. The irradiation facility; 3.
Regulatory control; 4. The accident; 5. Actions and lessons; 6.
Overview of the medical aspects; 7. Medical management of the

to be learned.

<P>
In revising the definition of high level radioactive waste
unsuitable for dumping at sea, calculations of water
concentrations
in and near a dump site have been made and used to estimate doses
to 'typical' marine species living at or near the sea floor at a
depth of 4000 m. These calculations show that there are
radionuclides that can give rise to significant doses to these
typical species and that future revisions of the Definition and
Recommendations under the Convention on the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter will have to
consider impacts on the marine ecosystem in setting limits for
dumping.

<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>

<P>
Proceedings of a symposium organized in co-operation with UNEP
and WHO, J&uuml;lich, Germany, 9-13 April 1984. The role of
energy in the economy and in society, the risks and impacts of
energy production, cost effective measures to reduce risks and
national energy strategies in response to global constraints were
discussed. Decisions on energy systems have to be based on an
assessment of many different aspects regarding their risks and
benefits. Many case studies were presented and it was shown that
it is of the utmost importance to list all the assumptions made
and to discuss the uncertainties and limitations of the analysis.
Comparison of risks of energy systems lead to a definite rank
ordering per unit of energy produced, but risks are only one
aspect in defining an appropriate energy mix. In order to allow
for efficient risk management it is important to apply cost
effectiveness techniques to various options for reducing risks.

Sediment K<sub>d</sub>s and Concentration Factors for
Radionuclides in the Marine Environment
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 247</I>
</B>
<P>
In 1983 new models to calculate dumping rate limits of
radionuclides into the deep sea were adapted. These models
required parameters involving sediment/water interactions. One
such parameter, the sediment/water distribution coefficient
(referred to as K<sub>d</sub> in the deep-ocean environment and
coastal sediment concentration factor in coastal environments),
had only been  measured for a few nuclides.  A new approach for
calculation of these coefficients has been developed, using
stable element  geochemical data. In addition, concentration
factor data for marine biological material have been reviewed and
updated, and emphasis has been placed on field derived data. 
Additional data on coefficients for elements not occurring
naturally are also provided.

This report reviews the environmental models currently available
for the assessment of the radiological impact of those
radionuclides that are of recognized significance on a regional
and global scale, i.e. tritium, carbon-14, krypton-85 and
iodine-129. The models are used in illustrative calculations to
demonstrate the relative importance of pathways to man, the
relative contributions to dose on regional and global scales, and
the temporal distribution of dose following environmental
release. The report also contains an estimate of the magnitude of
the future exposure of the world's population from releases of
radionuclides that become globally dispersed on the basis of an
assumed future world power programme.

Proceedings of a symposium jointly organized with ANS, ENS and
OECD/NEA, Vienna, 3-7 June 1991. During recent years the
development of PSA has been directed towards its use as a
practical tool for the enhancement of operational safety. Only
plant specific analysis can provide a basis for meaningful risk
management. The importance of human interventions in the recovery
from degraded states of operation, the importance of inclusion of
external events in PSA, the determination of potentials for
common cause failures and the importance of treating and
communicating the uncertainties have already been well
established within the PSA community. Also risks during low power
level and shutdown states have become more recognized.
