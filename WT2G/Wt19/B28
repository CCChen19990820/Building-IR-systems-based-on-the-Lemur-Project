<H2><CENTER>SUMMARY OF THE 1995 PROGRAM AND ITS IMPACT<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H2>
The George Washington Fellows met nearly every weekday with Dr. West to
discuss readings ranging from the Bible and Martin Luther to the American
Founders and C. S. Lewis. Key themes explored through the readings include
the special role of religion in fostering civic morality, the importance
of religious liberty, the need to find common ground with other citizens
when entering public life, and the necessity of humility and charity in
politics (&quot;speaking the truth in love&quot;) to counter the temptations
of power. A special emphasis of the readings was the positive impact of
faith on American public life during the past two centuries, including the
efforts by nineteenth century evangelicals to defend the human rights of
the Cherokee Indians and African Americans. This year the seminar added
a special set of readings from Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, and others, showing
the debilitating effects of materialism on Western culture. As in the 1994
program, postbaccalaureate, graduate-level credit was available for the
seminar through Seattle Pacific University, and two students took the course
for credit.<BR>

The JOYCE FOUNDATION has awarded $179,455 to the AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE, which will use the 
money to &quot;work with a group of midwestern Catholic dioceses to organize a year-long grassroots education and action campaign 
centered around money and politics.&quot;  The project, &quot;Dollars and Democracy: The Search for the Common Good,&quot; will bring citizens in 
various cities together to examine &quot;how private money shapes public decision-making.&quot;
<HR>
<P>
<P>The Joyce Foundation's September newsletter notes that &quot;Today religious groups have a strong political presence, and a 
majority of Americans think that's the way it should be.&quot;  The article notes that a May 1996 poll by the PEW RESEARCH CENTER 
FOR PEOPLE AND THE PRESS revealed that 54 percent said churches should speak out on public issues  which is almost 
exactly the reverse of a 1968 poll where 53 percent said churches should avoid politics.
<hr>
<P>
<P>The California Attorney General's office is investigating whether the CALIFORNIA WELLNESS FOUNDATION violated its 
charter by funding an opinion poll on the California Civil Rights Initiative (Prop. 209).  The Foundation, which is supposed to promote 
health, spent $102,000 on a survey to access the potential health care impact of banning preferences and set-asides.  If the state 
finds that a violation occurred, board members could be personally responsible for repaying the Foundation.

<P>A recent HERITAGE FOUNDATION study, entitled &quot;From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt,&quot; documents labor unions' 
ties to various far-left interest groups like the DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA (of which AFL-CIO President John 
Sweeney is a member), EMILY'S LIST, and PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY.  The report, authored by Kenneth Weinstein and 
August Stofferahn, notes that the AFL-CIO has attacked groups like the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family, and the American 
Family Association as &quot;religious extremists [who] pose a significant threat to those candidates who would best represent 
America's working families.&quot;
<HR>
<P>
<P>No sooner had the Virginia Military Institute announced its decision to admit women next year, then the 
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN denounced VMI's plan to make female cadets meet the same physical training standards as men. 
 &quot;VMI is obviously lamenting the downfall of the phallocracy,&quot; cried NOW Vice President Karen Johnson.  So much for equality.
<HR>
<P>
<P>The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City has sold all of its stock in the WALT DISNEY CORPORATION, citing the movie &quot;Priest&quot; 
and an exhibit at Disney World as its main objections.  A spokesman for the archdiocese said that Disney's actions have 
become &quot;morally reprehensible as well as antithetical to the values they formerly professed.&quot;  The film &quot;Priest&quot; was condemned by 
many, including the CATHOLIC LEAGUE FOR RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL RIGHTS, for its extremely negative portrayal of Catholic 
clergy. [<I>Catholic News Service</I>]

<P>
<P>Contributions to the federal government's workplace giving program, the COMBINED FEDERAL CAMPAIGN, have been falling. 
 Donations have fallen from over $204 million in 1991 to $189 million last year, with just over 40 percent of employees participating. 
 Focus group surveys attribute the lack of support to federal downsizing and government shut-downs.

to six &quot;social justice organizations.&quot;  The recipients are the NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, the CENTER 
FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, the CENTER FOR DEMOCRATIC RENEWAL AND EDUCATION, the LEADERSHIP 
CONFERENCE EDUCATION FUND, the NATIONAL CONFERENCE, and the SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER.

<P>The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the interest collected on client trust accounts (IOLTAs) is client property, 
raising the possibility that such funds may not be pooled together and distributed to activist groups, as is currently the practice in 
most states.  IOLTAs are a key source of funds for litigious interest groups.  According to the WASHINGTON LEGAL 
FOUNDATION, they constitute an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation.<HR>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
For Immediate Release<br>
July 31, 1995<br>
<p>
<center>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

<H2><CENTER>WRITING PROJECT<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H2>
During the first year of the George Washington Fellows Program (1994), Fellows
researched, wrote, and revised their papers while in Seattle. Last year
the writing component of the program was modified and Fellows were required
to submit drafts of their essays prior to the commencement of the program.
This change was enacted to allow more time for revising and strengthening
the essays during the Fellows' tenure in Seattle, and it resulted in a better
final product. Early in the program, Dr. West met with each Fellow to discuss
his or her draft essay. The Fellows then revised their essays, and the revised
papers were read and critiqued by all participants in open sessions. A final
revision was then prepared. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Topics explored by essays produced during this year's program include religion
and education, natural law and civil disobedience, school prayer, the effect
of government social programs on moral character, the ethics of biotechnology
research, the relationship between natural science and Christianity, the
use of religious language in politics, and the status of religious liberty
in Greece. The essay written by 1995 Fellow Mark DeForrest has been selected
for publication as a <I>Discovery Institute Inquiry</I> paper later in 1996.<BR>

</H2>
<HR>The George Washington Fellows Program seeks to fill the vacuum of spiritual
and moral leadership in American society. Directed at long-term leadership
development among college-age men and women, this national program identifies
potential leaders among college students pursuing careers in government,
journalism, and law and then educates them in an intensive month-long seminar
about how their faith should impact their public life. The program also
extends its impact beyond the Fellows by sponsoring public conferences,
such as last year's two-night presentation on &quot;The Death of Materialism.&quot;

<title> $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT </title>

<h2> AND THE WINNERS OF THE $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT ARE

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

In order to further extend the impact of the George Washington Fellows program,
Discovery Institute sponsored two public conferences in conjunction with
last year's seminar. The Fellows attended these conferences and interacted
with the guest speakers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first public event was a two-night conference on &quot;The Death of
Materialism&quot; held at Seattle Pacific University on July 19 and 20.
Co-sponsored with the Shuv Institute and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
the conference examined the debilitating consequences of materialism on
western society and on new developments in physics, biology, and cognitive
science that are undermining the basis of materialism. Speakers included
Stephen Meyer of Discovery Institute and Whitworth College, George Gilder
of Discovery Institute, Paul Vitz of New York University, and John Campbell
of the University of Washington (now at the University of Memphis). More
than 100 people attended the event, and portions of the conference were
played on cable television throughout Washington state. This spring the
national journal <I>Intercollegiate Review</I> will publish a symposium
based on the papers given at the conference with an introduction by Discovery
Senior Fellow John West. <I>Intercollegiate Review</I> is distributed quarterly
to more than 55,000 faculty and students at colleges and universities across
America. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the &quot;Death of Materialism&quot; conference, a public
luncheon seminar was held on July 28 that examined the implications of the
landmark equal access decision in Rosenberger vs. the Rector and Visitors
of the University of Virginia. The seminar featured law professor and Discovery
Institute Senior Fellow Edward Larson, Perkins Coie attorney Randy Beck,
and national ACLU board member Judith Bendich. The presentations by Larson
and Beck have been adapted for publication as a <I>Discovery Institute Inquiry</I>
paper.<BR>

seminars on selected topics with Discovery Senior Fellows and other guest
speakers: 
<UL>
  <LI>Former Attorney General Edwin Meese held a private question-and-answer
session with Fellows about faith and public life. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Discovery Senior Fellow and author George Gilder held a private question-and-answer
session with Fellows on issues relating to faith, ethics, and economics.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. Stephen Meyer of Whitworth College discussed
academic freedom for people of faith and shared how new scientific developments
are refuting the ideology of scientific naturalism. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. Edward Larson of the University of Georgia
and Discovery Institute gave a behind-the-scenes account of the passage
of the landmark Equal Access Act. He also gave a presentation on the ethical
implications of the human genome project and developments in genetics. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Adam Pruzan of Discovery Institute delivered a presentation about
modern Judaism and politics in America.

<li> There were earlier federal statutes
that addressed research and development and state cooperation,
but the 1970 statute was the first to establish federal controls.

<P>
<li> New car emissions of hydrocarbons
have fallen 97 percent since 1970, and California standards call
for the equivalent of a 99 percent reduction.  Between 1982 and
1991, ozone forming emissions decreased 13 percent and CO levels
declined, even with an increase in the number of vehicles and
miles driven.  (See U.S. Department of Energy, <U>Alternatives
to Traditional Transportation Fuels: An Overview</U>, Washington,
D.C., August 1994, p. 33.)
<P>
<li> The deepest criticism of the massive
efforts to deal with the ozone problem, to be discussed in this
report, relates to the 1988 data that forms the premise of the
problem.  The critics point out that 1988 was an outlier year
for drought and temperature, which contribute to higher ozone
readings.  Examination of a longer time series, before and after
1988, reduces significantly the ozone readings for the designated
ozone cities and regions.  (On this see, K.H. Jones and Jonathan
Adler, <U>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act:  Clearing away the
Regulatory Smog</U>, Policy Analysis, No. 233, Washington, D.C.:
 Cato Institute, July 11, 1995, and Kenneth Chilton and Christopher
Boemer, <U>Smog in America:  The High Cost of Hysteria</U>, Policy

. See Peter Passell, &quot;Illinois
Is Looking To Market Forces to Help Reduce Its Smog,&quot;  <U>The</U>
<U>New York Times</U>, March 30, 1995. p. C1. Passell points out
that Chicago is establishing a market for VOCs.  Major corporate
polluters-Caterpillar, Abbott Labs, Amoco, Corn Products-are participating
in the planning phase.  The program involves six counties and
hundreds of polluters.  The 300 that emit more than 10 tons annually
will be obligated to participate. By 2007, total allowable emissions
will be reduced 60%. The program will also facilitate the purchase
and destruction of older, higher emission, cars.  Also, see Benjamin
A. Holden. &quot;Dirt in Hollywood?  Californians Have Pollution-Rights
Market Ready for It,&quot; <U>The Wall Street Journal</U>, April
12, 1995, p. B3. Holden describes the Regional Clean Air Incentive
Market or RECLAIM and reports that the Pacific Stock Exchange
has created an electronic trading system for Southern California
pollution credits called the SMOG exchange.  Some 24 companies
listed credits.  <BR>

<P>
<li> In making this point, Kenneth Chilton
and Christopher Boemer, op. cit., draw on National Research Council,
<U>Rethinking the Ozone Problem in Urban and Regional Air Pollution</U>,
Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.: 1991.
 Quoting from the Council report, Chilton and Boemer state: &quot;On
days conducive to ozone formation, 'this VOC background should
be able to generate ozone concentrations that exceed the NAAQS
concentration of 0.12 ppm,' says the NRC.  Computer-generated
 simulations have shown that reactions between prevailing levels
of NOx and VOCs alone can generate ozone concentrations above
0.08 ppm in the Ohio River Valley and the entire Northeast corridor.&quot;
(Chilton and Boemer, ibid., p. 18.)<BR>

<P>
<li> Also, see Patrick Bedard, &quot;Still
Smoggy After All These Years,&quot; <U>Car and Driver</U>, April
1995, pp. 105-110.  Beard explains the situation this way: &quot;Control
of ozone is especially tricky because each city has its own air
chemistry, to which is added unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides
of nitrogen (NOx) from cars.  Because the ratio is critical, locations
with excess HC-in Atlanta, for example, vegetation is a major
source of HC-are particularly sensitive to additional NOx and
insensitive to more HC.  The reverse is true in areas where coal-burning
power plants produce NOx.  Cars, however, are not tailored to
locations, except for statewide regulations specific to California.
 With cars, the regulators' plan is simply to eliminate as much
HC and NOx as possible and hope for the best.&quot; (Patrick Bedard,
ibid., p. 107.)  <BR>

<P>
<li> K. H. Jones and Jonathan Adler, <U>Time
to Reopen the Clean Air Act:  Clearing away the Regulatory Smog</U>,
Policy Analysis, No. 233, Washington, D.C.:  Cato Institute, July
11, 1995, p. 7.<BR>

<P>
<li> Similar findings are reported for
the northeastern states where 1988 data shows 39 nonattainment
areas, with 23 marginal, 6 moderate, 6 serious and 3 severe. 
Based on 1992-94 data, the total is 13, with 6 marginal and no
serious or severe. (Jones and Adler, op. cit, p. 7.)
<P>
<li> See U.S. Department of Energy, Energy
Information Agency, <U>Alternatives to Traditional Transportation
Fuels: An Overview</U>, Washington, D.C., August, 1994, pp. 99-100
and U.S. Department of Energy, <U>First Interim Report of the
Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force</U>, Washington, D.C., August
1993, appendix K.
<P>
<li> In addition to setting higher 1996
model year standards, the statute instructs EPA to review the
new standards and if necessary for achieving clean air goals to
cut allowable emissions by 50 percent beginning in 2004.  (See
U.S. EPA, &quot;Motor Vehicles and the 1990 Clean Air Act,&quot;
EPA 400-F-92-013, Washington, U.S. EPA, August 1994.)
<P>
<li> A comparison of these standards with
the 1970 standards indicates how far gasoline-fueled vehicles
have come in reducing emissions.  The 1970 standard called for
a maximum of 3.9 gpm for hydrocarbons, 33.3 gpm for carbon monoxide,
and no control of nitrogen oxides.  (See Robert H. Hahn, &quot;Choosing
Among Fuels and Technologies for Cleaning Up the Air,&quot; AEI
Discussion Paper, Washington, D.C.:  American Enterprise Institute,
December 1993, Table 1.)<BR>

<P>
<li> The California standards are far
more complex than indicated here.  The standards involve three
auto tiers-transitional low emission vehicles (TLEVs), which are
to meet the standard stated in the text, low emission vehicles
(LEVs), which are to meet a stricter standard, and ultra low emission
vehicles (ULEVs) that are to achieve a standard that is close
to zero.  Speaking in terms of a composite emission standard called
non-methane organic gases, a precursor for smog, the California
Air Resources Board estimates that <U>lifetime</U> emissions of
the three vehicle types will be 55 pounds, 33 pounds, and 18 pounds
respectively.  The Society of Automotive Engineers estimates that
improved gasoline engine vehicles could reduce emissions to the
level of the LEV vehicles.  (For discussion, see Robert W. Hahn,
&quot;Choosing Among Fuels and Technologies for Cleaning Up the
Air,&quot; AEI Discussion Paper, Washington, D.C.: American Enterprise
Institute, December 1993, pp. 2-4.)

. The nine cities are Los Angeles, Houston,
New York, Baltimore, Chicago, San Diego, Philadelphia, Milwaukee,
and Ventura. (See U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information
Agency, <U>Alternatives to Traditional Transportation Fuels: 
An Overview</U>, Washington, D.C., June 1994, p. 35.)
<P>
<li> When the oxygen content is increased,
hydrocarbon and CO emissions can be reduced by 7.0 and 9.3 percent
respectively. (See Gilbert Sperling, &quot;Alternative Fuel Vehicles,&quot;
<U>Energy Law &amp; Transactions</U>, Release 5, Oakland, CA:
Matthew Bender &amp; Co., 1993, p. 74-9.) 
<P>
<li> According to DOE estimates, the total
reformulated fuel requirements for these urban markets and others
that may choose to require the same fuel will quickly reach 60
percent of all gasoline sold in the U.S. (U.S. Department of Energy,
Energy Information Agency, <U>Alternatives to Traditional Transportation
Fuels:  An Overview</U>, Washington, D.C., June 1994, pp. 23-24.)
<BR>

<P>
<li> Section 244 of the CAA, which specifies
the fleet program, requires clean-fuel vehicles to be used in
serious, severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas.  Examples
might be taxi, school bus, and delivery vans that refuel at a
common location.  The CAA envisions a goal of 250,000 clean-fuel
vehicles.  (See Henry A. Waxman, Gregory S. Weststone, and Philip
S. Barnett, &quot;Cars, Fuels, and Clean Air:  A Review of Title
II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,&quot; <U>Environmental
Law</U>, Vol. 21, 1991, pp. 1947-2019, at 2001.)
<P>
<li> For discussion, see Gilbert Sperling,
&quot;Alternative Fuel Vehicles,&quot; <U>Energy Law and Transactions</U>,
Release 5, Oakland, CA: Matthew Bender &amp; Co., 1993, pp. 74-37
to 74-39.
<P>
<li> The CAA contains sanctions for nonattainment
regions classified as severe that fail to meet ozone reduction
deadlines. All along, new stationary emission sources must obtain
offsets from existing sources, and the emission offset ratio rises
with a lack of progress.  If progress continues to fall short,
then even those ozone nonattainment areas not classified as severe
may be designated severe unless the state organizes an emission
trading system.  Put simply, the statute is market-forcing at
certain margins.  (See Penny Mintz, &quot;Transportation Alternatives
within the Clean Air Act:  A History of Congressional Failure
to Effectuate and Recommendations for the Future,&quot; <U>New
York University Environmental Law Journal</U>, Vol. 3, 1994, pp.
1-18, at 14.)
<P>
<li> The states include Connecticut, Delaware,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and the consolidated
metropolitan statistical area of Washington, D.C., which includes
part of Virginia.  The CAA allows for creation of other such regions,
when EPA deems necessary. (For discussion, see Daniel B. Trinkle,
&quot;Cars, Congress, and Clean Air for the Northeast:  A Separation
of Powers Analysis of the Ozone Transport Commission,&quot; <U>Environmental
Affairs</U>, Vol. 23, 1995, pp. 169-199.)<BR>

the Environmental Needs of the Northeast:  A Look at the Future
of Alternative Fuels,&quot; <U>California Western Law Review</U>,

<P>
<li> Virginia joined the auto industry
suit. On this, see Daniel B. Trinkle, &quot;Cars, Congress, and
Clean Air for the Northeast:  A Separation of Powers Analysis
of the Ozone Transport Commission,&quot; <U>Environmental Affairs</U>,
Vol. 23, 1995, p. 179.<BR>

<P>
<li> The new cleaner vehicles, which would
reduce ozone-related emissions by 50 percent, relative to the
standard set for the national fleet, would be introduced in the
Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states beginning in 1996.  These
NLEVs will be introduced nationally in 2001. NLEV tailpipe emissions
are to be limited to 0.2 g/mile for nitrogen oxide and 0.075 g/mile
for hydrocarbons, the two pollutants that produce ozone.  Those
caps would be 50 percent and 70 percent below current limits,
respectively. (See &quot;Cloudy Prospects for NGVs May Soon Find
Clear Air,&quot; <U>Natural Gas Week</U>, Jan. 8, 1996, pp. 6-7.)
<BR>

<P>
<li> In addition to EPACT, the Alternative
Motor Fuels Act of 1988 encouraged the development, production
and use of AFVs.  Funding of $18.5 million was provided for 1990-93.
 (See U.S. General Accounting Agency, &quot;Alternative Fuels:
 Increasing Federal Procurement of Alternative-Fueled Vehicles,&quot;
GAO/RCED-91-169, May 1991.  Also, the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Act of 1991, which focuses primarily on transportation planning
and related federal programs, addresses AFVs.)
<P>
<li> The 1990 Kuwait invasion, still fresh
in the memories of most Americans, led to a daily curtailment
of seven percent. The Iranian revolution of 1978-79 and the Arab
Embargo of 1973-1974 had smaller daily impacts on the flow of
oil but lasted far longer than the Kuwait disruptions.  To put
the disruptions in perspective, the daily reductions during the
1978 revolution was equal to roughly 5.5 percent of world daily
consumption.(<U>Statement of Jay Hakes, Administrator</U>, Energy

<P>
<li> We note that President Carter issued
Executive Order 12261 in 1981 requiring federal agencies to use
gasohol where it was feasible to do so. The experience under the
order was similar to that under EPACT.  There were supply problems,
unanticipated expenses, and competing regulations.  (On this see,
U.S. General Accounting Office, &quot;Gasohol:  Federal Agencies'
Use of Gasohol,&quot; GAO/T-RCED-92-73, June 24, 1992.)
<P>
<li> The U.S. General Accounting Office
provided a 1994 report on progress and problems associated with
the federal fleet purchases.  At the end of 1993, some 7,800 AFVs,
about two percent of the total, were in the federal fleet.  Problems
encountered involved higher than anticipated vehicle costs problems
encountered involved higher than anticipated vehicle costs, insufficient
refueling facilities, and mismatch of vehicles with infrastructure.
 For example, 118 methanol vehicles were sent to Atlanta, which
had no methanol refueling capability.  In addition, the GAO was
unable to obtain any meaningful estimate of the effects of the
AFVs on air quality goals.  (See U.S. General Accounting Office,

<li> There is yet another complicating
factor to consider.  NOx emissions from mobile and stationary
sources become nitrogen pollution in rivers, lakes and streams,
which leads to eutrophication and fish kills. This in turn leads
to a water shed management problem, which is again local or regional
in character.  (On this, see Todd Shields, &quot;Scientist Tracks

Law</U>, Vol. 21, 1991, pp. 1549-1647.  Reitze notes that common
law protection that might still be effective for controlling pollution
from easily identified sources has been eroded by statutes that
blunted the evolution of federal common law applied by federal
courts.  For a more optimistic view, see Elizabeth Brubaker, <U>Property

<li> There were a few isolated problems
with natural gas tanks or cylinders as they are called, but these
seem to have been rectified. CNG tanks are fairly rugged.  Several
tests show no fuel being released in a 50 mph rear-end collision
or in drop tests.  Automatic shutoff valves react if a line ruptures
preventing full dispersion of the tank's contents.  A pressure
relief valve allows gas to escape in the event of an external
fire, reducing the chance of an explosion.

<li> We note that some flexibility currently
exists in the interpretation of emissions for new sources in nonattainment
areas when those sources, by law, are involved in trading transactions
with existing sources.  Reitze pointed out in 1991 that 22 states
use regulator-determined emission allowances as the baseline;
8 states use the lower of allowable or actual emissions from sources;
8 states use &quot;variable baselines for different kinds of emission
trades; four states use actual emissions&quot; and 8 states had
no information available on the topic. (Arnold W. Reitze, Jr.,

The result is a death watch as species decline and geneticvariability diminishes. ... (S)pecies should be placed on the threatenedlist early enough to allow time to manage them before they become endangered.By focusing conservation on threatened species, the severe regulatory constraintsof the Endangered Species Act can be largely removed. Only when a speciesis approaching the point where management options become limited are regulatorycontrols necessary for species conservation.&quot;</B> </DL>It's actually from a working draft of the Endangered Species ManagementAct, sponsored by Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho), subcommittee chairmanof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But the sentimentis totally in the spirit of Noah's Choice, by Discovery Senior Fellow MarkL.

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<H2><CENTER>LIFE AFTER TELEVISION, UPDATED</CENTER>
</H2>

<I>GEORGE GILDER<BR>

</H3>
In 1994, four years after I wrote the first edition of Life After Television,
the cornucopian afterlife is indeed at hand. With microchips and fiber optics
eroding the logic of centralized institutions, networks of personal computers
are indeed overthrowing IBM and CBS, NTT and EEC. But as the great pyramids
of the broadcast and industrial eras--the familiar masters of the American
immigration--break apart, new fear and anxieties arise about the future.
If the center cannot hold, what rough beast, shuffling its slow thighs,
slouches toward Hollywood to be born again in gigabytes--and gigadollars--on
the information superhighway?<BR>
<H3><HR>Will life after television mean the dissolution of the American
hearth into a pornucopia of 900-number videos, full-color cold calls from
sultry sisters at Lehman Brothers and real-crime performances in multimedia
by superstar serial killers? Or will the new technologies uplift the culture
and empower the people, as Life After Television predicted?<BR>
<HR></H3>
<BR>
A Hughes Aircraft Corp. rocket's red glare in French Guiana, bombs bursting
in air on 500 channels, give proof through the night that something is going
on out there: 150 choices of DirecTv broadcast satellite images; up to one
billion hertz of cable TV bandwidth; star-spangled malls of infomercials;
CD radio with fidelity beyond the ken of the human ear; high-resolution
wrestlemania; 3,000 films on- demand; interactive personals and impulse
pay-per-view playmates; Yellow Pages blooming into home- shopping bonanzas;
and videogames galore on compact discs and cartridges. All zooming through
the air, blasting through cable and pulsing through fiber at the speed of
light. All to be captured, decrypted, decompressed, rendered and rolled
out from the new set-top boxes, game players and supertheaters in millions
of colors and living rooms.<BR>
<BR>
In such a phantasmagoria, what could be missing? The same thing that is
missing in much of the media coverage of the information superhighway: the
personal computer. What is driving the &quot;telefuture&quot; is not any
convergence of films and TVs, consumer electronics and publishing, computers
and games. What is driving the change is the onrush of computer technology
invading and conquering all these domains. The computer industry is converging
with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged
with the horse, the TV with the nickelodeon, the word processing program
with the typewriter, the computer-aided design program with the drafting
board and digital desktop publishing with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.<BR>
<BR>
The computer industry feeds on the explosive advance of semiconductor and
networking electronics: 1) the law of the microcosm, which shows that microchip
cost-effectiveness rises by the square of the number of transistors crammed
on a single chip, and 2) the law of the telecosm, which shows that computer
cost- effectiveness rises by the square of the number of computers connected
to networks. According to the famous projection of Intel Corp. chairman
Gordon Moore, the number of transistors on a single chip will double every
18 months. According to the record of the last five years, the number of
computers attached to networks is rising too fast to measure. Only by comprehending
the full force of the computer juggernaut can one anticipate the future
of the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Focusing on the technologies alone, however, is not enough, because the
new technologies are often retrofit into failing industries and concepts.
To grasp the telefuture, it is still necessary to see the domonetics of
the technologies--their social and cultural effects and contexts.<BR>
<BR>
The microcosm and telecosm have generated a rich business and domestic culture--a
supporting social fabric of PCs and network users--that not only nurtures,
sustains, applies and expands the technologies but also is enriched and
empowered by them. In positive feedback loops, the customers of the PC culture
are also its creators and protagonists. If you keep your eyes on this culture,
you can anticipate the sources and vectors of growth. If you focus on the
hype of old industries--television and telephony, Hollywood and electronic
games, consumer appliances and other diversionary devices--you will miss
the real action. 
<H3>The Logic Of Technology</H3>
Behind all the changes are the supply-side rhythms of creative destruction.
Radical innovations sweep nearly unnoticed through the economy from obscure
niches such as Woz's garage, Bill Gates' Basic, Bob Metcalfe's ether, Bolt
Beranek &amp;Newman's Internet, Carver Mead's laboratories and Bob Noyce's
workbench. On the heels of these seminal tides come much expensive hype
and hullabaloo from the established industry, which is trying to absorb,
deflect or co-opt the threat. This rhythm of real enterprise and reactive
public relations explains why the telefuture prophesied in Life After Television
rushed in faster than expected, and why the key developments are often downplayed
or misinterpreted today. The publicity is easier to see than the broad tides
of change that have swept through society since 1989.<BR>
<BR>
Take John Malone and Tele-Communications Inc., for example. They are important
not for the new dealmaking spectacles but for decades of enterprise that
have created a new broadband network unique in the world. With links to
63 percent of America's homes--coaxial lines with a capacity some 416,000
times the capacity of telephone twisted-pair wires and easily upgradeable
to two-way communications--the cable industry commands a key resource for
the telefuture.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, as Malone consummated his network, he and TCI were still
discussed by the press chiefly in the idiom of organized crime. Mostly financed
by junk bonds, Cable TV was derived at telecommunications meetings as a
conspiracy of political action committees--&quot;PACs with coax&quot;--foisting
junk services on the American people. Malone and his colleagues appeared
in the pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times chiefly in
exposes of corporate chicanery.<BR>
<BR>
By 1993, though, the &quot;cable czar&quot; had reemerged as Dr. Malone,
the reigning genius of America's broadband future. TCI loomed as the spearhead
of a cable industry that had become a unique American resource, putting
the US as much as a decade ahead of Japan and Europe on the information
superhighway.<BR>
<BR>
Even Malone could not keep up with the pell-mell pace of change. In the
early summer of 1992, on a panel at a NewsCorp Conference, he told me, &quot;There
is no short-term need to accelerate the deployment of fiber optics&quot;
in the cable system. The winners would follow a strategy of &quot;step-by-step,
incremental change,&quot; he told the crowd of news executives and Twentieth
Century Fox movie and broadcasting magnates.<BR>
<BR>
But the logic of the technology soon engulfed him. Less than a year later,
on April 12, 1993, Malone publicly committed his company to a $2 billion
investment in fiber--to connect a non-incremental 90 percent of his customers
over the following four years. On October 13, 1993, he sold out, probably
at the top, to Raymond Smith's Bell Atlantic Corp., once a sleepy-time regional
Bell, now an entrepreneurial dervish on the digital highway. &quot;There's
no time to waste in deploying this infrastructure,&quot; Malone then explained.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the great information companies financed by Michael Milken's junk
bonds were still seen as sleazy corpocracies teetering on towers of debt.
By 1993 TCI, McCaw Cellular, MCI, Turner, NewsCorp, Viacom and Time Warner--collective
beneficiaries of $10 billion of Milken funds--had emerged as the titans
of the new information economy and ruled the business pages of the press
or months on end. Scorned in 1989 as part of a Milken scam or &quot;Ponzi
scheme&quot; by Benjamin Stein in Barrons, James B. Stewart in the Wall
Street Journal, Connie Bruck in the New Yorker and other acclaimed reporters
and analysts, TCI and McCaw together attained in 1993 a total market value
of around $50 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the most weighty wisdom on the future of media was the &quot;Negroponte
switch&quot;--the theory launched by Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media
Lab that what currently goes by air--chiefly broadcast video--would soon
switch to wires (fiber optic and coax), while what currently goes by wires--chiefly
voice telephony--would massively move to the air.<BR>
<BR>
In Life After Television I urgently touted the Negroponte switch. I still
believe it brilliantly captures the key vectors of change. Shortly afterward,
though, I began to have my doubts that the victory of fiber as a delivery
system would be quite so total as I had imagined. After all, the spectrum
of electromagnetic vibrations is essentially infinite, and several companies,
led by Motorola, were offering wireless local area network (LAN) equipment
operating at Ethernet or Token Ring data rates in the 18-gigahertz band--a
frequency previously used chiefly in outer space. Moreover, BIIC, Photonics
and other firms were offering LANs in the infrared bands of the spectrum--up
in the terahertz and beyond--previously used in the air only by low-data-rate
TV remotes (although infrared pulses were the medium of fiber optics).<BR>
<BR>
By 1994 the vision of scarce spectrum behind the Negroponte switch was in
a rout. Qualcomm Corp. of San Diego introduced a cellular technology that
allowed use of the entire spectrum in every cell (rather than permitting
frequency reuse only once every seven cells as in current cellular technology).
By creating smaller cells in larger numbers, it would be possible to multiply
spectrum almost without limit while drastically lowering handset power usage.
Spectrum once too scarce to waste on video was becoming as cheap and abundant
in the air as in wires, where fiber optics had already opened an era of
potential bandwidth abundance. Andrew Grove, CEO of Intel, memorably declared:
&quot;You think computer prices are plummeting. Wait till you see what happens
to bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Still, there remained limits to the use of higher frequencies for communication.
Higher frequencies, it was believed, created prohibitive problems of interference
and power. Rain, for example, would drown out microwave communications.
Pigeons would fry on the antennas. Then Cellular Vision of New York Inc.
overthrew this conventional wisdom. It announced in the fall of 1992 that
it was broadcasting 49 channels of studio-quality video in the 28-gigahertz
band of the electromagnetic spectrum to 500 homes in the Borough of Queens.
The total cost was some $300 per home. Months later, Gigahertz Equipment
of Phoenix was seeking similar licenses in the West.<BR>
<BR>
Although many observers scoffed at these microwave ventures, on August 4,
1993, Bell Atlantic signed up to market the system through the City of New
York and in neighboring suburbs to the north. US West signed up with Gigahertz
to supply service in its own region.<BR>
<BR>
Shaking most of the certainties of 1980s conventional wisdom, such insurgencies
all stemmed from the still deeper forces of the microcosm and telecosm--described
in Life After Television--that are still gaining momentum in 1994 and will
continue to cascade through the technoscapes of the coming decade. 
<H3>The Avalanche Of Bits</H3>
But with Milken banished from financial markets and Malone in harvest mode,
who will ride the next avalanche of bits on the information superhighway--and
who will be buried under it? Widely regarded as likely winners are Edward
McCracken of Silicon Graphics Inc., the aspiring king of the set-top box
and the video server, and Jim Clark, SGI founder and chairman until February
28 (when he will leave to start his own interactive TV software company).
In the form of 3D graphics hardware and software, SGI's technology is central
to the triumph of computers over television and games. Yet the company's
present strategy is to retrofit these digital engines into the television
set-top boxes and Nintendo game machines of the pre-computer culture. Clark
hopes to provide the content.<BR>
<BR>
SGI offers compelling reasons for this strategy: production volumes and
foundries for the Mips 4000 microprocessor family comparable to those of
the Intel X86 standard; a siphon amid the possible floods of software revenues
to be earned by Nintendo using the SGI architecture; and sales of SGI superservers
to the television programming industry. But in harvesting these benefits
over the next five years, SGI and Clark risk dissipating their energies
by serving the industries of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Is Mickey Schulhof of Sony Corp. going to countervail these trends? He is
trying to converge and digitize all the technologies of the past into a
pi$ata of new consumer appliances, musical hits, videogames and movies,
making blockbuster turkeys such as &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and selling
everything but the feathers and the popcorn. Schulhof grandly plans to rule
both ends of the information superhighway, with Hollywood video and musical
content and a panoply of appliances to play them, from high-definition TV
sets to minidiscs, CDs and videotapes, game players and walkmasters. But
Sony may merely be supplying digital cosmetics to two dying industrial establishments:
Hollywood and consumer electronics. Making an array of incompatible and
incommunicable devices, Sony is defying both the law of the microcosm, which
compels the distribution of intelligence, and the law of the telecosm, which
asserts the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
Lest the information superhighway clog up with wrecked hopes and misbegotten
plans, let us look for the false assumptions behind some of the disappointments
of today.<BR>
<BR>
GTE's Cerritos, Calif., project--the first full test of interactive services,
launched in the mid-1980s-- rolled out its cornucopia of on-demand video,
instant banking, shopping, games and other services to an indifferent marketplace.
Although the results are still shrouded in secrecy, news reports suggested
that people just didn't want to take the trouble. US West and TCI are said
to have made similar discoveries in Denver. If the world lusts for interactivity,
why does it spurn the leading interactive market tests?<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;killer app&quot; for these new broadband systems is supposed to
be pay-per-view television. But, says Frank Biondi, president of Viacom,
&quot;there has been no serious take-up for pay-per-view in 20 years. We
are way behind revenue projections on motion picture pay-per-view.&quot;
When Time Warner raised its pay- per-view movie bandwidth from five to 60
channels in the Borough of Queens, monthly revenue is reported to have risen
by only some $4 per home. &quot;If people really hated going down the block
to pick up a movie, video stores would have a thriving delivery business
today,&quot; commented Michael Noll of the University of Southern California
in the software newsletter Release 1.0.<BR>
<BR>
3DO's new super-Cd-ROM multiplayer and graphics processor may someday find
a market outside Wall Street. But judging from the fall of the company's
stock price, from a high of 48-1/4 when the machine was launched into stores
last October to 26 in mid-January, sales have been disappointing. 3DO indicated
that some 50,000 units had been shipped to retailers, compared with earlier
company projections of &quot;fewer than 100,000&quot; and euphoric expectations
of many more. Similarly, after investment of untold hundreds of millions
of dollars, the Philips CD-I players still lag in the marketplace. If the
world is rushing to multimedia, why is it so slow to embrace the leading
new multimedia players? 
<H3>&quot;Like Feeding Vitamins To A Horse&quot;</H3>
Games show magnate Jon Goodson of Mark Goodson Productions declares that
people don't want to interact with game shows. &quot;It changes the game--for
the worse.&quot; A 1993 Dataquest study reported that people really don't
want to interact with sports events. TV Answer, now Eon, and Interactive
Networks both failed to break through with plans to supply interactivity
to current-day televisions over special radio frequencies allocated for
the purpose by the FCC. Hollywood has determined that audiences have no
interest in shaping the outcomes of films; they want to be surprised. If
people don't want to interact with video, how can the world move beyond
television?<BR>
<BR>
The new standard for digital HDTV, though far ahead of the old analog systems,
will not be officially unveiled until 1995, according to Richard Wiley,
chairman of the FCC's Advisory Committee on Advanced Television. The broadcast
companies that are supposed to adopt it are mostly uninterested. &quot;We
see no way any of us will make money out of this thing,&quot; says John
Swanson, vice-president, engineering, at Cox Broadcasting.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb companies have been
disappointments--Raynet and BroadBand Technologies have had difficulty selling
their equipment. A superb passive optical technology has so far failed to
save BroadBand's stock price. It tumbled from a high of 52 early in 1993,
amid the uproar over the information superhighway, to a low in the mid-20s
by the end of January 1994 as revenue projections were lowered by analysts.
Raychem has pumped more than $100 million into Raynet without yet generating
a profit. Meanwhile, the telephone companies have been dallying with a new
system called Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line, which will let them
send full-motion video down a conventional phone line at six megabits per
second (near to the practical rate of an Ethernet computer network). Although
Eli Noam of the Columbia University Telecommunications Center says ADSL
is &quot;like feeding vitamins to a horse rather than buying a truck,&quot;
the phone companies feel that if they have to compete with TV, it is cheaper
to supercharge the old copper nag for the last few hundred yards.<BR>
<BR>
On the content side the picture is equally cloudy. At multimedia conventions,
television executives declare that there is no way they can make money with
the kind of stuff currently available on CD-ROMs and other such platforms.
During intermissions they mutter off the record that the only way to jump-start
this market is through virtual sex. In the late 1980s the entire Japanese
electronics industry was riding high with the harvest of profits from decades
of investment in consumer electronics. Deciding that &quot;content is king,&quot;
Sony and Matsushita each bought major Hollywood studios. As these companies
moved on toward HDTV, Western pundits prophesied that Japan would dominate
all advanced electronic industries, from semiconductors to supercomputers.
Instead, however, the Japanese electronics industry entered a period of
prolonged decline, suffering heavy financial setbacks and even losing its
lead in semiconductors to American firms. 
<H3>Strategists Focused On Wrong Industry</H3>
From Cerritos to Denver and on to Orlando, Omaha and Castro Valley, from
3DO to CD-I and beyond, from BroadBand to Raynet, from Sony to NEC, the
current and impending disappointments spring from one key mistake. With
some notable exceptions, the leading strategists are focusing on the wrong
industry. You can't get beyond television by collaborating with TV companies
in their long slide to obsolescence. You can't create a new information
infrastructure by propping up the old telephone networks with the right
to provide tv-type services.<BR>
<BR>
The new 3DO and Philips CD-I game machines, for example, both link to interlaced
TV screens that display every other line and then fill in the gaps on a
second sweep. Interlaced screens mean cumbersome text and limited graphics.
Interlaced screens doom multimedia to a fringe videotext fuzz. Yet these
new game players shun the personal computer and its installed base of 33
million home units in order to build up a new installed base from scratch,
connecting to visually inadequate televisions.<BR>
<BR>
Interactivity, almost by definition, is a computer function, not a television
function. Making the boob tube into an interactive hive of theater, museum,
classroom, banking system, shopping center, post office and communicator
is contrary to the nature of the box.<BR>
<BR>
Millions of Americans, however, are eager to turn their personal computers
to these pursuits. Therefore, it is natural that nearly all the relevant
activity is in the computer industry rather than in the television industry.
The PC world provides an environment totally alien to the downside dirges
of consumer electronics.<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker has said, an entrepreneur should always heed the upside
surprises. Upside surprises distract business leaders from a deadening focus
on problems and target them on their opportunities. In the information economy,
the best opportunities stem from the exponential rise in the power of computers
and computer networks, microcosm and telecosm. In the computer industry,
all the surprises tend to come on the upside.<BR>
<BR>
For example, early in 1993 the two leading experts in the field, Bill Gates
of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel, both boldly predicted total PC sales
between 35 and 40 million, up from a stupendous 32 million in 1992. In an
outcome first predicted in February by semiconductor analyst Daniel Klesken
of Robertson Stephens, the actual number came in at nearly 50 million, between
25 and 40 percent above the forecasts--during what was widely reported as
a down year for computer companies.<BR>
<BR>
This drastic surprise engendered waves of similar upside surprises through
the industry. Despite a chaos of competing architectures and aspiring standards
that meant any particular CD-ROM would most likely not be playable on your
machine, the sales of multimedia-ready computers rose from a few thousand
high-end devices in 1989 to some three-and-a-half million in 1993, bringing
in some $5 billion in revenues. Despite general disappointment in the quality
of the titles, the sales of CD-ROMs soared from a few hundred thousand in
1989 to nearly five million in 1993. As a harbinger of the future, sales
of encyclopedias in CD-ROM format surpassed those of book copies in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
More important is the explosive rise in networks. Since 1989 the share of
US computers attached to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more
than 60 percent. Some 15 million are now attached to the network of networks--the
Internet--up from a few score thousand in 1989. For several years the Internet
grew at a pace of 15 percent per month.<BR>
<BR>
The fatal flaw of Silicon Graphics, 3DO, AT&amp;T, Raynet, Eon and QVC is
that they are trying to solve the problems of the telephone, TV, videogame
and consumer appliance companies. The problems of these separate industries
are unsolvable in the face of the integrating sweep of the computer networking
industry juggernaut. Television problem solving just distracts computer
firms from their huge and hugely demanding opportunity to usurp phones,
televisions and videogame players entirely with multimedia PCs and networks.
The huge telecom and consumer firms must be enlisted in their true role:
supplying networks, peripherals and programs for the computer industry.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood may still be full of glamour, but the surest sell sign for a technology
company is still a star- struck CEO. It is not altogether reassuring to
hear Terrence Garnett, Oracle's vice-president, multimedia, discussing his
boss' place in the industry. After schmoozing at a party with Hollywood
stars, Garnett confided to a reporter: &quot;I would have a hard time picturing
Lewis Platt [president of Hewlett Packard] sitting at that party. I mean,
you look at Larry Ellison and you could see him in that environment. I couldn't
see Jim Manzi [president of Lotus Development] or Philippe Kahn [president
of Borland] there. They don't look good in Armani.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most Hollywood-savvy executive of Silicon Valley is Jerry Sanders of
Advanced Micro Services. Star-struck at age 20 and bent on becoming a star,
he discovered shortly afterward that actors are mostly fungible functions
and their glamour mostly meretricious. Rather than trying to get rich in
Hollywood, he decided to enjoy Hollywood on his own terms after he got rich
in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
The irony is that technology companies actually hurt the movie business
more than they help it. The central message of Life After Television for
the film industry is that the new technologies are targeted directly at
Hollywood. Today some 70 percent of the costs of a film go to distribution
and advertising. In every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key
impact of the computer networking revolution is to collapse the costs of
distribution and remove the middlemen. The movie business is now mostly
middlemen. In an information industry such as the movie business, distribution
costs will predictably plummet if the movie business embraces networking.
<H3>TVs And Telephones: Change Or Crash</H3>
Anyone with access to the information superhighway will be able to distribute
a film at a tiny fraction of current costs. Moreover, webs of glass and
light will free the producer from the burden of creating a product that
can attract miscellaneous audiences to theaters. Instead, producers will
be able to reach equally large but more specialized audiences dispersed
around the globe. Rather than making lowest- common-denominator appeals
to the masses, film makers will be able to appeal to the special interests,
ambitions and curiosities of individuals anywhere, anytime.<BR>
<BR>
Limiting these opportunities at present are both the bottleneck of telephone
nets and the runaway costs of film making. Personal computers will not only
pulverize the costs of distribution, they will also drastically diminish
the costs of actual film production. Today leading directors can still imagine
that they alone command the capital to deploy the new digital production
and editing tools. But any capability now costing a few hundred thousand
dollars is sure to cost less than $20,000 in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Just as digital desktop publishing equipment unleashed thousands of new
text-publishing companies, so the new digital desktop video-publishing systems
will unleash thousands of new filmmakers. The video business will increasingly
resemble not the current film business, in which output is 100 or so movies
a year, but the book business, in which some 55,000 new hardcover titles
are published annually in the US alone. After all, scores of thousands of
screenplays are already written every year. In the next decade thousands
of screenwriters will be able to make and distribute their own films.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood, meanwhile, will move toward providing enhanced experiences through
virtual reality and other expensive technologies. The current harbinger
is Circus Circus' Luxor resort in Las Vegas, a gigantic pyramid that is
briefly the world's largest hotel. Luxor is not just another Vegas casino:
It serves chiefly as a dormitory for six ride-film theaters on the first
floor. Luxor cost some $375 million to build. The largest expense was the
$40 million invested in the ride-films at the heart of the project. The
individual who made these films was Douglas Trumbull, formerly Hollywood's
leading supplier of special effects and now an enemy of the Hollywood establishment.
He is pioneering the new technologies of theatrical presentation--a field
abandoned by Hollywood in the 1950s when antitrust laws were interpreted
as barring film companies from owning theaters. Trumbull's first ride-film
hit, the incandescent Back to the Future, The Ride, saved the Universal
Theme Park in Orlando and set a new technical standard for the medium.<BR>
<BR>
Life After Television did not merely predict a technical revolution; it
predicted a cultural upheaval. Moving authority from elites and establishments
to creators and customers, the new technologies drastically change the cultural
balance of power. Shifting the optimal target of commercial art from vulgar
taste and sensations to special interests, curiosities, hobbies, ambitions
and artistic aspirations, digital multimedia machines will transform the
marketplace and elevate the culture. Only by addressing the new opportunities
will companies prosper and prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Computer networks are the pivotal technology of the new era. They are the
chief engine of the division of labor--the force of creativity and specialization
that Adam Smith identified as the key driver of economic growth. And they
are the reigning spearhead of the creative destruction that Joseph Schumpeter
saw as the key to all economic progress. The domonetics of computer networks
are active and dynamic rather than passive and diversionary. Unlike games
and movies, computer networks endow people with new powers of self-improvement
and wealth creation. They free individuals from the shackles of corporate
bureaucracy and geography and allow them to collaborate and exchange ideas
with the best colleagues anywhere in the world. Computer networks give every
hacker the creative potential of a factory tycoon of the industrial era
and the communications power of a TV magnate of the broadcasting era.<BR>
<BR>
The accelerating spread of computer networks in the early 1990s explains
the high sense of opportunity and possibility in an economy otherwise in
the doldrums. To prevail all industries will have to adapt to network powers
and constraints. This means telephone and TV companies will have to change
or crash. It also means that to fulfill the promise of the Information Age,
computer companies will have to adapt to the laws of the microcosm and telecosm.
They will have to stop dallying with game machines and set-top boxes, stop
their infatuation with Hollywood and embrace the empowering promise of their
own machines.<BR>
<BR>
Leading any list of companies that grasp this reality are Apple and Intel.
Both have made large strides in the past year toward the overthrow of the
establishments of consumer electronics, telephony and television.<BR>
<BR>
Although Apple suffered sharp setbacks in 1993, the &quot;teleputer&quot;
strategy launched by John Sculley in recent years began to bear fruit that
same year in such pioneering products as the Quicktime multimedia operating
system, the Macintosh TV and the Mac Quadra 840AV.<BR>
<BR>
First came the Mac TV, which boldly subsumed a full cable-ready television
set in a Macintosh computer, together with a stereo CD-ROM drive, all in
one chassis. Connectable to a VCR, camcorder, laserdisc or videogame player,
the Mac TV cost around $2,000 and signals a new epoch.<BR>
<BR>
Moving still closer to the teleputer ideal of the multimedia production
center is the Mac Quadra 840AV. Standing for audio-visual, the AV fulfills
the ultimate promise of the teleputer as a device that can not only display
digital video but also store, edit and transmit it. With input port for
all TV standards--including the European PAL and the American NTSC and studio
modes S-video and composite video--the Quadra AV can convert analog images
to a digital bit stream to be stored, edited and then transmitted. The AV
can also function as a phone and stereo and contains an advanced digital
signal processor that imparts powers of speech recognition and synthesis.
Rivaled as a multimedia machine only by the most costly and powerful Silicon
Graphics Indy workstation, the Quadra AV is unique in its pattern-matching
and voice-recognition features.<BR>
<BR>
In early December 1993 in Tokyo, Apple introduced the latest version of
Quicktime running Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG standard) video at
30 frames per second on a Mac Quadra. Fujitsu Ltd.'s announcement that it
was licensing the technology for its own line of video computers signified
a growing awareness that Quicktime was becoming a worldwide multimedia standard
even before the Kaleida multimedia system and the so-called Power PC emerged
from an Apple-IBM partnership.<BR>
<BR>
Fulfilling Sculley's promise of usurping both phone and television set,
these new computers and their software represent the first generation of
the multimedia era. Already an upside surprise, the Quadra 840AV moved quickly
to the forefront among Apple best-sellers, showing that Apple can still
do best in the marketplace through genuine innovations. These technologies
do not ape the price points and form factors of consumer electronics; they
do not hunker down or twist themselves into pretzels to fit in a set- top
box. These products extend the PC imperium into new territory.<BR>
<BR>
However, in a world with Intel chieftain Andy Grove aboard, Apple cannot
rest on its teleputer laurels. Intel is still more fiercely focused on the
prize. As Grove says: &quot;The PC is it. That sums up Intel's business
plan and rallying cry.&quot; Scorning the obsession with set-top boxes elsewhere
in the industry, he explains: &quot;The PC is already in 30 percent of the
nation's homes. How long will it be before these new set-top boxes are in
30 percent of homes? And what will PCs be doing by then? The PC is not any
one thing. It is a continuing phenomenon, and every couple years its definition
changes. The Intel goal is to make sure that the living organism of the
PC evolves in the right direction to continue as the dominant interactive
appliance in both home and business. The PC is not a fixed product but a
continuum. By contrast, the set-top box is a stationary machine. The set-top
box won't have the volume, the installed base, the software or the adaptability
of the PC. By the time they get all the necessary functions into the set-top
box at the right price point, the PC will be controlling the TV as a mere
peripheral.&quot; Grove's warning is exactly on target. 
<H3>Bandwidth Frees Computers' True Power</H3>
Bruce Ryon, Dataquest's chief multimedia analyst, observes: &quot;If you
talk to the cable set-top box guys, they are all saying that they are not
going to get to the price points they need until three to five years out.&quot;
After three to five more years of Moore's Law, the PC will be a multimedia
machine with some eight times the power and storage capacity at the same
price that brought nearly 50 million unit sales in 1993 and, according to
Robertson Stephens' Klesken, promises to bring some 55 million unit sales
in 1994. At this pace, within four or five years, PC penetration into homes
will pass 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all these PCs will be connected to networks--most of them with
10 megabits per second or more of bandwidth--and most will run internal
buses (linking processors to memory and display) at rates of close to a
billion bits per second, ample for full-motion video.<BR>
<BR>
These new PCs being prepared at Intel and Apple will merge with the new
tools of the information superhighway. Technologies of fiber optics and
wireless communications, glass and air, they are advancing as fast as the
microchip technologies of sand. Together they will consummate the computer
revolution and wreak a new revolution in telecom.<BR>
<BR>
Until endowed with broadband connections, the computer is a cripple that
devotes huge portions of its processing power merely to compressing, decompressing,
coding and decoding its data for the telephone system bottleneck. It is
because of this bottleneck that the true power of the PC remains obscure
to many observers. It is because of this bottleneck that the TV and consumer
electronics industries can imagine themselves a significant rivals to the
PC. But once provided with broadband communications, the PC will come fully
into its exponential harvest from microcosm to telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
As Grove points out: &quot;Infinite processing power will get you only so
far with limited bandwidth. But the coming era of nearly free bandwidth
will liberate the computer to fulfill its powers. Just as the 1980s saw
the demolition of the vertical structure of the computer industry, so the
1990s will see the demolition of the vertical structure of the communications
industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To accelerate the day, at the December 1993 Western Cable TV Show, Intel
announced that it is developing a new computer on-ramp for the information
superhighway. In league with General Instrument and Hybrid Technology, Intel
demonstrated a modem to connect computers to cable TV coax at Ethernet speeds
of 10 megabits per second. One of several firms preparing to release computer
powers onto cable networks, Intel has the manufacturing clout and marketing
power to make cable PC a widespread reality.<BR>
<BR>
To prepare for this new era of broadband teleputing, Intel is introducing
a new bus standard, PCI, that runs at video speeds--around a gigabit per
second. With Apple's recent endorsement, PCI seems likely to become the
prevailing system for personal computer internal communications. At the
same time, Intel announced a full desktop teleconferencing system. Doggedly
pursuing the dual goal of integrating both voice and video with the computer,
Intel is far more ready to exploit the new era than firms panting after
Paramount and Nintendo.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, neither the Intel nor the Apple machines bring nirvana. As
multimedia guru Eric Hoffert of Apple points out, the consummated teleputer
requires 10 key advances. They include an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
interface, fast real-time compression/decompression chips, a full 64-bit
microprocessor, a real-time operating system that can schedule events for
specific times, internal buses that run the gigabits-per-second of raw high-definition
video flows, networked multimedia standard software to sustain new applications,
and improved human interfaces for multimedia communication and access to
media databases. Furthermore, the teleputer will demand huge storage devices
for the many gigabytes of data in ambitious multimedia projects. Finally,
it will entail new ways of encrypting and metering information so that the
creators can be paid for each access rather than requiring customers to
&quot;buy the reservoir,&quot; as Wave Systems chief Peter Sprague puts
it, &quot;every time you want a drink of water.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although these capabilities are available today, their cost remains in the
scores of thousands of dollars. Without these features, even the AV and
the Indy suffer nagging limits in storing, processing, editing and transmitting
the full-motion, full-screen, high-resolution digital video of our dreams.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if this were the television industry, such a machine would remain
a dream for decades to come. But in the entrepreneurial crucible of the
PC industry, all these dreams can come true at the remorseless pace of Moore's
Law. Within the next five years, cheap desktop machines could not only show
digital movies of full quality and resolution, but also create, edit and
transmit them.<BR>
<BR>
With this development at hand, all through Wall Street a warning is whispered:
&quot;The train is leaving the station.&quot; Content is scarce. If you
don't get it now, you will be left behind with the nerds in polyester.<BR>
<BR>
So why didn't Andy Grove join the race with Viacom's Sumner Redstone, QVC's
Barry Diller and all the rest for the grand prize of Paramount? Couldn't
someone at Intel find him an Armani suit? Paramount is worth $10 billion.
Intel is worth around $25 billion. It could easily swallow up the movie
giant and combine the Intel computer and communications tools with Paramount's
creative treasures.<BR>
<BR>
Even more significant, though, if the train is leaving the station, where
is America's sometimes richest man, the world's leading digital software
tycoon? Most of the prerequisites for the multimedia teleputer are software
projects now under way at Microsoft. Why didn't Bill Gates join the Hollywood
rush? He is famously pursuing content, digitizing famous works of art. Like
Grove, Gates commands a company worth close to $25 billion. Gates could
scoop up Paramount into his content venture, Continuum Productions, and
become as famous and fashionable as he is rich.<BR>
<BR>
But Gates is the epitome of PC domonetics. Gates doesn't even own a TV set.
Without mentioning movies or games, he can spiel off dozens of detailed
ideas for applications for the digital highway in the time it takes John
Malone to list his market tests and caveats. Gates invested nearly 10 years
of fatigue and futility, money and energy in the CD-ROM market as an alternative
to TV. Today's triumph of the CD-ROM is a supreme vindication of Gates'
PC strategy. Why should he abandon it now?<BR>
<BR>
Train leaving the station? Gates told Forbes ASAP, &quot;That's a joke.&quot;
Gates has always acted on the assumption that Microsoft--or, more generally,
the PC--is the train and he is driving it. In 1985 he declared: &quot;Television
is passive entertainment. We're betting that people want to interact, choose
different paths and get feedback from the machine about what they have really
learned.&quot; Almost a decade later, in the January 10, 1994, New Yorker,
he was still making the same point. Calling interactive TV &quot;a really
bad name for the in-home device connected to the information highway,&quot;
he stated: &quot;The bottom line is that two-way communication is a very
different beast than one-way communication... A phone that has an unbelievable
directory [and] lets you talk or send messages to lots of people, and works
with text and pictures is a better analogy than TV... Because TV had very
few channels, the value of TV time was very high so only things of very
broad interest could be aired on those few channels. The information highway
will be the opposite of this--more like the Library of Congress but with
an easy way to find things.&quot; Exactly the message of Life After Television.<BR>
<BR>
Gates did not hustle after Hollywood. Barry Diller and Michael Ovitz had
to seek him out in Seattle. Bill Gates has fiercely focused Microsoft on
the PC culture. In the NT operating system, he is pushing a system with
multimedia interfaces, which thrusts Microsoft into the middle of the fray
in computer multiprocessing and computer networking. That is the heart of
the new era. 
<H3>PC's Superior Demographics</H3>
The reason Gates and Grove are not interested in Paramount is no mystery.
They don't need it. They already command a much larger, faster-growing,
more creative and more promising vehicle for their capital. Selling nearly
50 million units in 1993, at an average price some four times higher than
that of a TV, the PC is not only a bigger market than television and movies
put together, it is also a better market in every way. In 1992 the US computer
industry commanded total sales of $161 billion, compared with $104 billion
in total revenues for TV and films. The revenues from computer hardware
sales were more than six times the revenues from TV sales, and home computer
sales were growing 10 times as fast. More important, the demographics of
the PC industry are far superior. Television buyers are median American
couch potatoes who pay some $400 for their machines. PC buyers mostly come
from the upper income quintiles, usually have higher education and pay an
average of some $1,500 for their machines and then put out another $1,500
or so for software and peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
Most crucial of all is the difference in the use of the two devices. While
TV watchers use their machines to lull themselves and their children into
a stupor, PC users exploit their machines to become yet richer and smarter
and more productive--and still better able to exploit future computer advances.
The PC customer is also the creator of new applications and add-on devices.
The TV is a consumption product. The PC is a supply-side investment in the
coming restoration of the home to a central role in the productive dynamics
of capitalism, and the transformation of capitalism into a healing force
in the present crisis of home and family, culture and community.<BR>
<BR>
How can this be when the computer is so often condemned as a divisive and
polarizing force in American life, the tool of an elite of nerds, a weapon
of dehumanizing bureaucracy? These charges were partly valid for the mainframe
computers of old. But as the PC gains communications powers and evolves
into a teleputer, its social, cultural and political impacts change completely.
As it ushers in a life beyond TV, it becomes a powerful force for democracy,
individuality, community and high culture.<BR>
<BR>
The leading-edge computers always go first to the elites who can use them
best and help develop them for others. All new technologies are first purchased
by elites and mastered by them before they reach a larger public. The PC
plays a role in contemporary culture resembling the role of the Model T
automobile in 20th-century industrial culture.<BR>
<BR>
Owners of the Model T could not simply jump in and drive the machine. They
had to learn how to maintain and repair it. Many of them learned how to
take it apart and put it back together. They became an industrial elite
with the mechanical skills that won two world wars and propelled the US
to the forefront of the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the linked PCs of today and the teleputer networks of tomorrow
seem formidable--difficult to get in and drive. At times they appear to
be the tools of a new elite. But teleputers feed on the most rapid learning
curves in the world economy, and in proportion to their powers are the cheapest
technologies in history. Just as the TV, once an exotic tool of elites,
became even more ubiquitous in America than the telephone or the automobile,
the teleputer will end the decade not as a luxury but as an indispensable
appliance.<BR>
<BR>
It is companies that shun the PC of today in order to cater to the TV, consumer
electronics and telephone industries that will end up in luxury backwaters.
They will resemble the companies that catered to the mainframe trade early
in this decade, or those that catered to the horse business early in this
century. They may find exotic or intriguing niches. Yet just as the real
action was not at Churchill Downs or the Peapack Hunt Club but in Detroit,
the real action today--the source of wealth and power--is not at Nintendo
or Sega, Hollywood or QVC. It is in the scores of thousands of computer
and software companies that make up the industrial fabric of the Information
Age--the exhilarating new life after television.<BR>

</I>Carl Jung Meets Newt Gingrich</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <A HREF="gorsky.html">Frank Gregosrky</A></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="warn-stripe-1.gif" WIDTH="774" HEIGHT="8" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>No one who ever worked with Newt Gingrich has a complete picture of him.
In fact, the only man to portray him fully died over 30 years ago -- and
the two never met. This essay comes as close as anything will to bringing
them together.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Back in April 1983, Newt told his D.C. staff: &quot;There are consistencies
of pattern but not consistencies of process. You can't predict from day
to day what I'll do, but you can predict from day to day what, in a general
way, I'll be doing.&quot; In those days, he struggled to be heard and heeded.
He assumed his staff could maximize his reach, if only they understood his
method. He thought his GOP colleagues could seize the House, if only they
would implement his latest 25 projects. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Newt explained himself blue, while they -- most staff, many allies --
ran themselves ragged. Eventually, many of us just ran. Even when we could
finally &quot;do what he wanted,&quot; he suddenly no longer wanted it.
Becoming GOP Whip finally put some order into Newt's daily operations, and
the Speakership may complete the process. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet my guess is that his hyper-creative entrepreneurial nature will regularly
override the new post's structure and scheduling. If so, Newt's associates
still require a yardstick, a divining rod, to truly &quot;understand&quot;
him. I have one, and I'll tell you where to obtain it. But first, savor
its best parts, in bold, followed by a comment or two on each.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>[His] morality is governed neither by thinking nor by feeling; he has
his own characteristic morality, which consists in a loyalty to his vision
and voluntary submission to its authority. </B>Much like Bill Gates creating
Microsoft or Andy Grove guiding Intel, Newt Gingrich obeys his vision. Unlike
them, he is used to flying solo. As he told a senior staff group in September
1982: &quot;I only have coherently explainable positions when I'm forced
to stop and develop them.&quot; Otherwise he keeps piling intuition atop
intuition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The stronger his intuition, the more his ego becomes fused with all the
possibilities he envisions. He brings his vision to life, he presents it
convincingly and with dramatic fire -- he embodies it, so to speak. But
this is not play-acting, it is a kind of fate. </B>Yes, Newt has &quot;known&quot;
since teendom how he was fated to shape and lead a transformed Republican
Party. Ego may help power such a person's overarching goal, but it is never
the determining motivation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>He seizes on new subjects with great intensity, sometimes with extraordinary
enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without any compunction
and apparently without remembering them, as soon as their range is known
and no further developments can be divined.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B>Anyone in Washington ever put in charge of a &quot;Newt project&quot;
will nod at this passage's correctness. As Newt said in 1983: &quot;I don't
do by planning, I plan by doing.&quot; It's a workable formula for a creative
individual surrounded by acolytes, but tends to cause chaos in a growing
structure run by colleagues who need to trust the central figure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that he has always
just reached a final turning point, and that from now on he can think and
feel nothing else</B>. Anyone who has just heard the latest of several Gingrich
presentations will concur. Newt acts and talks as if it's a total departure,
when usually it's a 5-10% modification. Though amusing to insiders, this
relentless enthusiasm keeps his talks immune to the cynicism lurking in
every Washington job. More importantly, it facilitates national recruiting.
(Cynics sometimes get to wage war, but only charisma can raise an army.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The intuitive is never to be found in the world of accepted reality values,
but he has a keen nose for anything new and in the making. Because he is
always seeking out new possibilities, stable conditions suffocate him.</B>
And this is why Gingrich, even as Speaker, will be a revolutionary. He could
not manager the status quo, making deals for the sake of comity, even if
he wanted to. This forecast has little to do with conservative ideology,
and everything to do with the type of leader and movement-personality he
is fated to be.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And what type is that? An Extroverted Intuitor. My hidden source tells the
complete story -- on pages 222-25 of The Portable Jung, a 1986 Viking paperback
edited by the late Joseph Campbell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the visionary psychologist Carl Jung never met the brilliant
partisan Newt Gingrich. Yet every single line in the pages I cite appears
to apply. (They come from his 1923 work Psychological Types, which 20 years
later was used to design the first of the Myers-Briggs evaluations.) With
such a tool, why rely on insider gossip and ideological tracts? Carl Jung
long ago wrote Newt's basic script. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Since his intuition is concerned with externals and with ferreting out
their possibilities, he readily turns to professions in which he can exploit
these capacities to the full. Many business tycoons, entrepreneurs, speculators,
stockbrokers, politicians etc. belong to this type.<BR>
<BR>
</B>For a striking case study, explained by a guru Gingrich also likes,
consult Peter Drucker's 1983 essay on Thomas Watson Sr., whose vision drove
IBM beyond time clocks and keypunch machines: &quot;Watson saw and understood
the computer 15 years before the term was even coined. He knew right away
that it had to be radically different from a high-speed calculator. And
he did not rest until his engineers had built&quot; the SSEC in 1947, which
was the first machine &quot;to combine electronic computation with stored
programs, with its own computer language, and with the capacity to handle
its instructions as data.&quot; (See chapter 33 in The Frontiers Of Management.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Technologies then came in response to Watson's leaps of information-age
insight. Similarly, <BR>
the Republican-run House now taking shape will fill in gaps envisioned by
Gingrich's intuitions of 20 years ago. Politics needs its entrepreneurs,
too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Final Jung sampler: <B>Such a type is uncommonly important both economically
and culturally. If his intentions are good, i.e. if his attitude is not
too egocentric, he can render exceptional service as the initiator or promoter
of new enterprises. He is the natural champion of all minorities with a
future.<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
Doesn't that final line clinch my case? House Republicans finally have a
future, Newt's intentions are good, and he has enough independently elected
peers to head off dangerous lurches -- all of which makes the prognosis
excellent: American governance is embarking upon a five or 10-year stretch
that, at least on domestic reform, will make Reagan's best years seem like
a sloppy rehearsal. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before I left his payroll, Newt advised the staff to read up on
Churchill. In one of the Manchester books, I found this description of him
at age 4l: &quot;He is a wonderful creature, with a curious dash of schoolboy
simplicity and what someone said of genius -- 'a zigzag streak of lightning
in the brain.'&quot; So said Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, sounding like
Bob Michel appraising his own successor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this city, reading Winston Churchill is more common than studying Carl
Jung texts. But, if you seek to confirm a the new Speaker's &quot;consistencies
of pattern if not of process,&quot; Jung's piece, written 20 years before
Newt was born, offers the only direct path. It will help us &quot;predict
from day to day what, in a general way, he'll be doing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I needed Doctor Jung's description a dozen years ago, but didn't know where
to look. Now you do. After you read it, you might say a prayer for the current
generation of Gingrich aides. Why? It goes back to the point Drucker made
about Watson: &quot;Because visionaries cannot explain to the rest of us
what they see, they have to depend on command.&quot; <BR>

<title>Cyberspace and the American Dream -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>



<h1><center>Cyberspace and the American Dream</center></h1>
<p>

The driving force behind the Big Change now happening in America is the
information revolution. PFF has led the way through its Cyberspace and the
American Dream project in exploring the consequences and the direct policy
implications of this revolution.<p>

The Foundation not only dedicated two major conferences to this topic, but it has
published "<A HREF="/pff/position.html">A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age</A>." This Magna Carta became the
centerpiece of a wide-ranging debate in The Internet and throughout the media
about whether the information revolution was better defined by the metaphor of
"an information superhighway" or the much freer metaphor of "Cyberspace."<p>

But the Foundation's efforts in Cyberspace are by no means limited to vision.
Policy change is taking place in Washington, in state legislatures, indeed, in
governments around the world, as policymakers attempt to understand the
consequences of the move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on
regulatory policy. PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications policy
debate in Washington and around the country, focusing its efforts on the next
generation of telecommunications deregulation. <p>

For example, the Foundation will be offering in May 1995 a complete plan to
abolish the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</A>. In addition, PFF is offering in
conjunction with <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A> an eight-week seminar on
Telecommunications for Capitol Hill staffers. The goal is to educate
"non-experts" about the Information Revolution and the impact action in <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A>
will have in enhancing or hindering its arrival.<p> 

Earlier in the year, PFF, in conjunction with <a href="/townhall/clubs_groups/cse/cse.html">Citizens for a Sound Economy</a>, <a href="/heritage">The
Heritage Foundation</a>, <a href="gopher://gopher.seattle.wa.us:70/11ftp%3AGopher%3A%20%20Seattle%20USA%20Yellow%20Pages%3AInternational%20Affairs%3ADiscovery%20Institute%3A">The Discovery Institute</a> and the <a href="gopher://nuinfo.nwu.edu:70/00/graduate/dissertation/Hudson%20Institute">Hudson Institute</a>, hosted a
congressional seminar on "Updating the Communications Act: The Free Market
Approach." Held in the Capitol Building on January 31, 1995, In excess of seventy
Members of <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> as well key staff and media, including <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street
Journal</a> and <a href="http://ibd.ensemble.com/">Investor's Business Daily</a>, attended the seminar.<p>

<title>Surfing the Sheraton. The Internet Society Summit in San Diego. 
 -- PFF</title>

<H1>Surfing the Sheraton.<br> 
The Internet Society Summit in San Diego.</H1>

<P>By Mike Vlahos, Senior Fellow, The Progress & Freedom Foundation 

<P><A HREF="http://www.nosc.mil/planet_earth/sandiego.html">San Diego</A> is not
just another pretty place promising azure sky by day, and
cobalt
by night. It is first, the Navy's town: the city itself looks small, like it is
doing homage to the gray shapes of steel that look bigger as they pass the
channel between the city and Coronado, burling by with the immense stateliness
that comes from moving without the appearance of velocity. 

<P>Steel. Manufacturing. Industrial Age imagery in charge. This is the antithesis
of
ether: sun glinting off missile box launchers and guns, like it must have off the
battleship gray hulls of Task Force 58 50 years ago, steam up and on to Okinawa.

<P>But the internet is all contrast: jewel-like graphics shimmering digitally off
the faces of a new elite, seeking darkness in place of light: their odyssey not
there in South Pacific heat, but here, in the cool confections of cyberspace.

<P>Flying in yesterday, that was the contrast I expected, a sharp thematic cut
between old and new, past and future.

<P>I found something different. And ordinary. 


<P>The Crowd.

<P>Fewer pony tails than I expected, and so many of them gray! No, this was a
true
multi-cultural gathering, a Diet of WWW conclave with equal measures of 

<P><A NAME="typea"> suit and tie, pony tail optional</A> [Type A]  <A NAME="typeb">chinos, white socks</A> [Type B]
 <A NAME="typebplus">jeans, ersatz lacoste, boat shoes</A> [Type B+] 
<A NAME="typebplusplus">whiteshirtpotbellyspillingoverthefadedjeans</A> [Type B++],  <A NAME="typec">the babybluesweater and
mustache look</A> [Type C]  <A NAME="typecplus">the big beard, balding, v-neck</A> [Type C+]  <A NAME="typed">relaxed
Japanese cyber-egged-on oxymoron</A> [Type D]  <A NAME="typee">Pinstripe suit and Aussie mid-back
hair, coifed</A> [Type E]  <A NAME="typef">Euro-neat short hair, suit optional</A> [Type F] 

<P>[And by the way, all the women were wearing suits] 

<P>There was exactly one journalist [<http://sfgate.com/new/schron/index.cgi">San Francisco Chronicle</A>] hooked up to and
using
a computer. Only three others were using them, in an audience of about 100, and
one of them is Cerf himself [after his speech]; oh, and an <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">HP</A> palmtop too.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS TAKING HAND-NOTES. 


<P>The Kick-Off.

<P><A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Vint Cerf</A> --
like bad novels liked to say -- was resplendent in thin-pin
Statedept. togs, truly lungfish-sartorial in a world of dockers. 

<P>It's 8:00 AM, and it is slowly hitting me: the incredible ordinariness of the
setting. Here is the future, measured and packaged in a neural-numbing hotel box
... burned-out holly-print carpeting, ersatz Louis Quinze partitions, sweet
cheese Danish, silver plate pitchers of half-and-half bathed in condensation,
matching holly-leaf dome chandeliers set into cheap acoustic tiles: all the charm
of interior anachronism elevated to a kind of ultimate fin de siecle American
mixed metaphor ... 

<P>It could have been a gala New Avenues in Hemorrhoid delivery, or the big
convention of the Postal Deliverers' Reform Foundation, or the annual meeting
of the Association of Hickory-Smoked Wood Putty Manufacturers. But it wasn't.

<P>It was the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org">Internet Society</A> Summit [oh, how
the mighty (word) has fallen!],
and
here was a darkened room with a screen set up in one corner; you know, the kind
we stared at during death march slide shows in first grade. And yes, he's showing
slides. Well, at least they're from a computer LCD on an overhead projector, and
not good old petroleum slides. 

<P>And the droning is traditional too: I have vivid memories of showing up at
that
place when they first inaugurated .... Well, to be fair, it is the first
session, and, like a good Victorian play, the maid does have to get onstage and
give the essential exposition. 

<P>But it's deja vu all over again. Same as Atlanta [but better, brighter
colors]:
WWW started in 89, led to Mosaic ... blah blah left <A
HREF="http://www.sgi.com">Silicon Graphics</A> and founded
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</A>, luring away blah blah blah ... 

<P>Now I get it: <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf's</A> reliving the good ole days, the glory days, when men were
men and heroes walked the earth. He doesn't see what he's doing either: 

<P><A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A> is denying change in the Internet's culture, its way of life, while at
the
same time trumpeting its coming dominion. He mixes nostalgia and sentimental
memory [as did all the older speakers, a hand-picked, band of brothers, all at
Agincourt] with the paean of explosive growth. 

<P>Begin a litanic recitation of glorious stats [so with every speaker: the
same].
It was like an after-dinner testimonial [from modest beginnings ... , from a log
cabin ... , with only three dollars in his pocket ...] 

<P>A pocketful of miracles reduced to magical decimals: 

<P> 4,851,000 on the net
 94 countries wired [what's a country?]  growing at 9-12% a month
 200,000,000 plugged-in by end of decade  50,000 networks
 research: 27%
 commercial: 53% and growing [so what else is new?]  education: 5%
 govt.: 10%
 military: 7%
 and this, in 93
[available on <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org">internet society web page</A>] 

<P>The whole world will be plugged in for the millennium! 


<P>He went on:

<P> Growth in world faster than in US [duhhh ...]  Fr. and UK fastest in Eur.
 Aus. Jap. Taiwan biggest surge in E Asia  And gee, high positive correlation
between internet growth and high 
GNP [duhhh ... maybe we need a govt. study] 

<P>Then he offers the potentially useful thought that over time, more internet
means
more income -- but then he let's it drop! [He doesn't want to push the internet
as key to a global economic revolution. Too much change? Change the internet out
of recognition, maybe? Got a whiff of grapeshot there, Vint.]

<P>He enjoys this metaphor far more: <A
HREF="http://peacock.tnjc.edu.tw/ROC_info.html">Taiwan</A> -- they make 88% of
all PC
motherboards. Golly, if they kept some of them, instead of exporting them, maybe
their income would go up! [I thought their income was going up, through the
roof, precisely because they were exporting the damn things!] 

<P>Acerbic on <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A>; Mea culpa, I can't help it. <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A> was in the weeds of the web:
his worries are all about how to keep it open, how to keep it civil, how to keep
the good uses going, and limit the encroachment of the bad [like govt.
restrictions on free speech, which he sees as too hard for old order govts. to do
anyway. (But see my talk with <A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/singtel.html">Singapore Telecom</A>, and get a nice cold spritz!)]

<P>And then, someone raised the spectre of The Nefarious One: What about
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>
monopolization? <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A>: won't happen, because other services can spring up if
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> overcharges [Overcharges!!!!!!!! Give me a Pharonic Break!]

<P>And then, someone gushes that the net will bring us true democracy -- Not so,
says <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A>. He says, what happens when you have 100,000 E-mail messages flooding
in at once: No one could deal with that; we must engage our brains to deal with
scaling problem.

<P>See what I mean? To <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A> -- and the whole succeedent summit tenor of thought
--
all issues involve making the net work better as it is now, as The Internet.

<P>Example: The net must stay ill-defined to escape regulation [<A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A> wants to
keep
the feel of the old net ethos]. 

<P>Then a Euro-wimp whines: The US controls all the net technology; therefore,
the
US can control everyone else who uses the net [Is it still 1968?] 

<P><A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf's</A> retort to this starts off better: supplier companies have a global
perspective, they want to sell (half of their business outside of US, they are
motivated to keep their business base in world). But then on to Big Al: 
The Nat. Information Infrastructure must match global needs; unless we make it
uniform, it is useless--that is direction I see on policy side [Gee whiz, Ma! So
there is an NII after all!].


<P>Morning Panel -- Administrative Infrastructure. 

<P>There are four speakers. The first speaker is a <a href="#typecplus">Type C+</A> -- sweater-wire-rims
plus
full beard and pony, all gray, of course -- Aquinas discoursing on internet names
[domain names], protocols, IP address allocation [credibility, fairness,
routing--we're going to run out! so now it's a control thing] 

<P>Wow!

<P>And he's using petroleum slides! Other parameters: port numbers, protocol
numbers
-- assigned by the internet numbers authority 

<P>[It's called a summit, but some still ask questions like What's the Internet?]

<P>Next speaker's a <a href="#typebplusplus">Type B++</a> in masquerade -- he's got on a blue blazer, and
apologizes, lamely. He's a Registration Services Man, and excited about his work
-- Boy, it's lighting the ether on fire! There is an E-mail explosion going on --
how to handle it? [my SCO system is broken, how do I fix it?] 

<P>And on and on it goes: how to handle domain demand at hundreds a day? ..edu,
.net
not growing, .comm, also .org [from small base] are the big burners.

<P>Perhaps it's in the lineage, the bloodlines, the genes; but this jargon makes
Pentagonese argot taste sweet on an English tongue: 

<P>CIDR ization of INADDR.ARPA
Rollout of SWIP

<P>Our resources are stressed!

<P>Next speaker's <a href="#typebplusplus">Type B++</a>, whiteshirtpotbellyspillingoverthefadedjeans, with two

<P>This guy's also stuck on petro-slides, but he goes one better: they're

[making him ante-ante-diluvian] He's covering Asia, so it's all Pac-argot: 

<P>a peer of <A HREF="http://www.internic.net">InterNIC</A>, RIPE-NCC
ISPs are APNICs most important customers org. IANA, regional Irs
Whois database, WAIS database, DNS database, etc. 

<P>[at least etc. makes sense, I like that database] 

<P>Next guy from Neth., screaming Madras cotton shirt and shooort hair <a href="#typef">[Type F]</a>
and
the only guy there with a bona fide backpack [up on the podium!]. At least his
petroleum jargon gives better names -- <A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/">RIPE</A> (forum of providers), <A HREF="http://www.terena.nl/">TERENA</A> (the
assoc. of research networks), and <A HREF="http://www.ebone.net/">EBONE</A> [not a clue!], all hinting at more
elite-oriented interest in the internet in among the euro-wimps. This guy speaks
better English than Henry Kissinger; it's the words themselves that convey no
meaning -- outside the charmed nomenclatura that are the Internetski.

<P>Then he says it all: you need qualified engineers; you need nerds. Nuff
said.

<P>ALL HAVE 2-D LINE/CURVE CHARTS AS CENTERPIECE FOR THEIR GRAPHICS [only <A HREF="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/a200/creators.html">Cerf</A>

<P>Providers in euro-land from beginning to end 1995: 32 to 250! [see, more of

[later, I find out all numbers at the conference bogus, unsubstantiated] [I also
find out, from a Swiss AG, that German telecom I-net hook up and use rates three

<P>Last guy a lawyer, all-darkman guido suit and open shirt, heavy jowls, Big
Brother mustache [untyped in this sub-culture]. Big Shoulder City's top firm, but
he's trying to look caj here. You know, the half-poly knit with the little
MacDonalds heraldry on the left tit. 

<P>He is representing the international trademark assoc.; and finally, things get
interesting. He addresses the big worries of the gathering of techno-geeks:

<P>Are domain names trademarks or not?

<P>Domain names represent registered trademarks, he says, and do tell the story
of
the Newsday reporter who took McDonald's as his domain name, with Ronald as his
personal moniker. He graciously gave it up for a donation by BigMac to his fav
charity, but the BigMo is on. 

<P>There's a guy out there with the domain name, Coke, and he's holding CC ransom
for big$. The US patent office regards domain names as being capable of being
trademarks. The issue: is it used as TM, in trade [unlike a phone number]?
[there's another guy I know about who's going around gathering domain names for
every city in Mass.]

<P>Yes, it's Wild West time on the WWW. And it gets worse. 

<P>There's a co. called knowledgenet reg. Well it seems that another company
registered same as its domain name. Now there's a lawsuit, complaint, as well as
infringement and restraint of trade ... and even RICO! What do the doyens of the
internet do? Publish requests for domain names, turn over to govt.? Right. That
one really took off. Boos and hisses. 

<P>But what is interesting here is the emotional subtext beneath the surface
talk.
These guys are scared; their beloved net is being defiled by trade, yet commerce
is making it the world of tomorrow! To reach the stars, they lose control. They
lose the Internet itself. 


<P>Luncheon Buzz

<P>Now for the real talk; like, a journalist from <A HREF="http://www.ziff.com">Ziff</A> [<A HREF="http://www.ziff.com:8002/~pcweek/">PC Week</A>] talking about
her
frequency. What she meant was that she was now competing, not with other
zines, but with the likes of the Wall Street Journal web page, and Ziff wanted
more and more from her, because they have to post everyday on their web page [the
real virtual sweatshop, ladies & gentlemen, begins here]. 

<P>Also, what about all those millions of providers? All morning speakers gushed
like founts about providers like shooting-star Roman Candles. The Chaos of the
Internet forever!

<P>But then, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> is inundated with requests for its new portal: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/services/msnet/msnintro.html">Microsoft
Network</A>. Embedded; this is the word. It is embedded in its operating system, and
especially in the application bundle that everyone uses, Microsoft Office. Like
its purchase of Intuit, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> stands to dominate, not because, as suggested
wrongly earlier, Gates will overcharge, but because he will make it easy and
cheap to connect, to get all the services you want, and to do it all from within
Word [<A HREF="http://www.qdeck.com/">Quarterdeck</A>, in fact, has just come out with a patch for <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/deskapps/word/wordhome.html">Word 6.0</A> that lets
you send and receive, cruise the net, 
all from within <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/deskapps/word/wordhome.html">Word</A>].

<P>What is about to happen, in other words, is that the thousands of providers
just
plain collapse in the next few years. The few big coalitions, the ones that can
come up with the capital to build the interface, offer the services, and make it
easy within the desktop environment, and make it more and more like an appliance,
will be the ones who catch the market surge of the hoi polloi. It's Railroad
Baron Byte City building. And the old internet is dead.

<P><A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/singtel.html">Singapore Telecom</A> guy insists that govt. doesn't care, isn't listening in; 
but that Lee Quan et al freaked out when they were told that there were 3000
unlicensed bulletin boards on the island! And now, get this, the govt. has
created the first national web site, the <A HREF="http://www.sg">Singapore Home Page</A>. And [are we
surprised?] everybody in Singapore posts there. And guess who's listening? 
[Kishore Mahbubani, Sing's perm foreign secretary , told me We don't want

<P>Afternoon Panel: The Internet in commerce 

<P>Another member of the Old Guard. And gleaning gets hard. Real hard. 

<P>One pale anecdote after another [when I was creating ARPAbucks in 1978 ...]

<P>As for the rest, blah, blah, blah:

<P>[But it's still that same old, lovable net] 

<P>Why is there nothing about the real future, where the internet is going, not

<H3>A Series of Eyes</H3>
<BR>
How do we see? In the 19th century the anatomy of the eye was known in great
detail, and its sophisticated features astounded everyone who was familiar
with them. Scientists of the time correctly observed that if a person were
so unfortunate as to be missing one of the eye's many integrated features,
such as the lens, or iris, or ocular muscles, the inevitable result would
be a severe loss of vision or outright blindness. So it was concludedthat
the eye could only function if it were nearly intact<BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin knew about the eye too. In the Origin of Species, Darwin
dealt with many objections to his theory of evolution by natural selection.
He discussed the problem of the eye in a section of the book appropriately
entitled &quot;Organs of extreme perfection and complication.&quot; Somehow,
for evolution to be believable, Darwin had to convince the public that complex
organs could be formed gradually, in a step-by-step process. 
<H3><HR><IMG SRC="greenfinger.gif" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="LEFT" 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><A HREF="dissent.html">The Dissent of Man</A><I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> review of Discovery Fellow Michael Behe's book <I>Darwin's
Black Box</I><BR>
<HR></H3>
<BR>
He succeeded brilliantly. Cleverly, Darwin didn't try to discover a real
pathway that evolution might have used to make the eye. Instead, he pointed
to modern animals with different kinds of eyes, ranging from the simple
to the complex, and suggested that the evolution of the human eye might
have involved similar organs as intermediates.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a paraphrase of Darwin's argument. Although humans have complex
camera-type eyes, many animals get by with less. Some tiny creatures have
just a simple group of pigmented cells, or not much more than a light sensitive
spot. That simple arrangement can hardly be said to confer vision,but it
can sense light and dark, and so it meets the creature's needs. The light-sensing
organ of some starfishes is somewhat more sophisticated. Their eye is located
in a depressed region. This allows the animal to sense which direction the
light is coming from, since the curvature of the depression blocks off light
from some directions. If the curvature becomes more pronounced, the directional
sense of the eye improves. But more curvature lessens the amount of light
that enters the eye, decreasing its sensitivity.The sensitivity can be increased
by placement of gelatinous material in the cavity to act as a lens. Some
modern animals have eyes with such crude lenses. Gradual improvements in
the lens could then provide an image of increasing sharpness, as the requirements
of the animal's environment dictated.<BR>
<BR>
Using reasoning like this, Darwin convinced many of his readers that an
evolutionary pathway leads from the simplest light sensitive spot to the
sophisticated camera-eye of man. But the question remains, how did vision
begin? Darwin persuaded much of the world that a modern eye evolved gradually
from a simpler structure, but he did not even try to explain where his starting
point for the simple light sensitive spot came from. On the contrary, Darwin
dismissed the question of the eye's ultimate origin:<BR>
<BR>
How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than
how life itself originated. He had an excellent reason for declining the
question: it was completely beyond nineteenth century science. How the eye
works; that is, what happenswhen a photon of light first hits the retina
simply could not be answered at that time. As a matter of fact, no question
about the underlying mechanisms of life could be answered. How did animal
muscles cause movement? How did photosynthesis work? How was energy extracted
from food? How did the body fight infection? No one knew. <BR>
<BR>
To Darwin vision was a black box, but today, after the hard,cumulative work
of many biochemists, we are approaching answers to the question of sight.
Here is a brief overview of the biochemistry of vision.When light first
strikes the retina, a photon interacts with a molecule called 11-cis-retinal,
which rearranges within picoseconds to trans-retinal. The change in the
shape of retinal forces a change in the shape of the protein,rhodopsin,
to which the retinal is tightly bound. The protein's metamorphosis alters
its behavior, making it stick to another protein called transducin.Before
bumping into activated rhodopsin, transducin had tightly bound a small molecule
called GDP. But when transducin interacts with activated rhodopsin,the GDP
falls off and a molecule called GTP binds to transducin. (GTP is closely
related to, but critically different from, GDP.)<BR>
<BR>
GTP-transducin-activated rhodopsin now binds to a protein called phosphodiesterase,
located in the inner membrane of the cell. When attached to activated rhodopsin
and its entourage, the phosphodiesterase acquires the ability to chemically
cut a molecule called cGMP (a chemical relative of both GDP and GTP). Initially
there are a lot of cGMP molecules in the cell, but the phosphodiesterase
lowers its concentration, like a pulled plug lowers thewater level in a
bathtub.<BR>
<BR>
Another membrane protein that binds cGMP is called an ion channel. It acts
as a gateway that regulates the number of sodium ions in the cell. Normally
the ion channel allows sodium ions to flow into the cell, while a separate
protein actively pumps them out again. The dual action of the ion channel
and pump keeps the level of sodium ions in the cell within a narrow range.
When the amount of cGMP is reduced because of cleavage by the phosphodiesterase,
the ion channel closes, causing the cellular concentration of positively
charged sodium ions to be reduced. This causes an imbalance of charge across
the cell membrane which, finally, causes a current to be transmitted down
the optic nerve to the brain. The result, when interpretedby the brain,
is vision.<BR>
<BR>
My explanation is just a sketchy overview of the biochemistry of vision.
Ultimately, though, this is what it means to &quot;explain&quot; vision.
This is the level of explanation for which biological science must aim.
In order to truly understand a function, one must understand in detail every
relevant step in the process. The relevant steps in biological processes
occur ultimately at the molecular level, so a satisfactory explanation of
a biological phenomenon such as vision, or digestion, or immunity must include
its molecular explanation.<BR>
<BR>
Now that the black box of vision has been opened it is no longer enough
for an &quot;evolutionary explanation&quot; of that power to consider only
the anatomical structures of whole eyes, as Darwin did in the nineteenth
century,and as popularizers of evolution continue to do today. Each of the
anatomical steps and structures that Darwin thought were so simple actually
involves staggeringly complicated biochemical processes that cannot be papered
over with rhetoric. Darwin's simple steps are now revealed to be huge leaps
between carefully tailored machines. Thus biochemistry offers a Lilliputian
challenge to Darwin. Now the black box of the cell has been opened and a
Lilliputian world of staggering complexity stands revealed. It must be explained.Irreducible
Complexity<BR>
<BR>
How can we decide if Darwin's theory can account for the complexity of molecular
life? It turns out that Darwin himself set the standard. He acknowledged
that:<BR>
<BR>
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not
possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications,
my theory would absolutely break down.But what type of biological system
could not be formed by &quot;numerous,successive, slight modifications&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Well, for starters, a system that is irreducibly complex. Irreducible complexity
is just a fancy phrase I use to mean a single system which is composed of
several interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts
causes the system to cease functioning. <BR>
<BR>
Let's consider an everyday example of irreducible complexity: the humble
mousetrap. The mousetraps that my family uses consist of a number of parts.
There are: 1) a flat wooden platform to act as a base; 2) a metal hammer,
which does the actual job of crushing the little mouse; 3) a springwith
extended ends to press against the platform and the hammer when the trap
is charged; 4) a sensitive catch which releases when slight pressure is
applied, and 5) a metal bar which connects to the catch and holds the hammer
back when the trap is charged. Now you can't catch a few mice with just
a platform, add a spring and catch a few more mice, add a holding bar and
catch a few more. All the pieces of the mousetrap have to be in place before
you catch any mice. Therefore the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.<BR>
<BR>
An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by numerous, successive,
slight modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an
irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.
An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would
be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection
can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system
cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit,
in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstration that a system is irreducibly complex is not a proof that there
is absolutely no gradual route to its production. Although an irreducibly
complex system can't be produced directly, one can't definitively rule out
the possibility of an indirect, circuitous route. However, as the complexity
of an interacting system increases, the likelihood of such an indirect route
drops precipitously. And as the number of unexplained,irreducibly complex
biological systems increases, our confidence that Darwin's criterion of
failure has been met skyrockets toward the maximum that science allows.The
cilium<BR>
<BR>
Now, are any biochemical systems irreducibly complex? Yes, it turns out
that many are. A good example is the cilium. Cilia are hairlike structures
on the surfaces of many animal and lower plant cells that can move fluid
over the cell's surface or &quot;row&quot; single cells through a fluid.
Inhumans, for example, cells lining the respiratory tract each have about
200 cilia that beat in synchrony to sweep mucus towards the throat forelimination.
What is the structure of a cilium? A cilium consists of a bundle of fibers
called an axoneme. An axoneme contains a ring of 9 double&quot;microtubules&quot;
surrounding two central single microtubules. Each outer doublet consists
of a ring of 13 filaments (subfiber A) fused to an assembly of 10 filaments
(subfiber B). The filaments of the microtubules are composedof two proteins
called alpha and beta tubulin. The 11 microtubules forming an axoneme are
held together by three types of connectors: subfibers A are joined to the
central microtubules by radial spokes; adjacent outer doublets are joined
by linkers of a highly elastic protein called nexin; and the central microtubules
are joined by a connecting bridge. Finally, every subfiber A bears two arms,
an inner arm and an outer arm, both containing a protein called dynein.<BR>
<BR>
But how does a cilium work? Experiments have shown that ciliary motion results
from the chemically-powered &quot;walking&quot; of the dynein arms on one
microtubule up a second microtubule so that the two microtubules slide past
each other. The protein cross-links between microtubules in a cilium prevent
neighboring microtubules from sliding past each other by more than a short
distance. These cross-links, therefore, convert the dynein-induced sliding
motion to a bending motion of the entire axoneme.<BR>
<BR>
Now, let us consider what this implies. What components are neededfor a
cilium to work? Ciliary motion certainly requires microtubules;otherwise,
there would be no strands to slide. Additionally we require a motor, or
else the microtubules of the cilium would lie stiff and motionless.Furthermore,
we require linkers to tug on neighboring strands, converting the sliding
motion into a bending motion, and preventing the structure from falling
apart. All of these parts are required to perform one function:ciliary motion.
Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are
present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules,
connectors, and motors. Therefore, we can concludethat the cilium is irreducibly
complex;an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian
evolution.Blood Clotting <BR>
<BR>
Now let's talk about a different biochemical system of blood clotting.Amusingly,
the way in which the blood clotting system works is reminiscent of a Rube
Goldberg machine.<BR>
<BR>
The name of Rube Goldberg; the great cartoonist who entertainedAmerica with
his silly machines,lives on in our culture, but the man himself has pretty
much faded from view. Here's a typical example of his humor. In this cartoon
Goldberg imagined a system where water from a drain-pipe fills a flask,
causing a cork with attached needle to rise and puncture a paper cup containing
beer, which sprinkles on a bird. The intoxicated bird falls onto a spring,
bounces up to a platform, and pulls a string thinking it's a worm.The string
triggers a cannon which frightens a dog. The dog flips over, and his rapid
breathing raises and lowers a scratcher over a mosquito bite,causing no
embarrassment while talking to a lady. <BR>
<BR>
When you think about it for a moment you realize that the RubeGoldberg machine
is irreducibly complex. It is a single system which is composed of several
interacting parts, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes
the system to break down. If the dog is missing the machine doesn't work;
if the needle hasn't been put on the cork, the whole system is useless.
<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that we all have Rube Goldberg in our blood. Here's a picture
of a cell trapped in a clot. The meshwork is formed from a protein called
fibrin. But what controls blood clotting? Why does blood clot when you cut
yourself, but not at other times when a clot would cause a stroke or heart
attack? Here's a diagram of what's called the blood clotting cascade.Let's
go through just some of the reactions of clotting.<BR>
<BR>
When an animal is cut a protein called Hageman factor sticks to the surface
of cells near the wound. Bound Hageman factor is then cleaved by a protein
called HMK to yield activated Hageman factor. Immediately the activated
Hageman factor converts another protein, called prekallikrein, to its active
form, kallikrein. Kallikrein helps HMK speed up the conversion of more Hageman
factor to its active form. Activated Hageman factor and HMK then together
transform another protein, called PTA, to its active form. Activated PTA
in turn, together with the activated form of another protein (discussed
below) called convertin, switch a protein called Christmas factor to its
active form. Activated Christmas factor, together with antihemophilic factor
(which is itself activated by thrombin in a manner similar to that of proaccelerin)
changes Stuart factor to its active form. Stuart factor,working with accelerin,
converts prothrombin to thrombin. Finally thrombin cuts fibrinogen to give
fibrin, which aggregates with other fibrin molecules to form the meshwork
clot you saw in the last picture.<BR>
<BR>
Blood clotting requires extreme precision. When a pressurized bloodcirculation
system is punctured, a clot must form quickly or the animal will bleed to
death. On the other hand, if blood congeals at the wrong time or place,
then the clot may block circulation as it does in heart attacks andstrokes.
Furthermore, a clot has to stop bleeding all along the length of the cut,
sealing it completely. Yet blood clotting must be confined to the cut or
the entire blood system of the animal might solidify, killing it.Consequently,
clotting requires this enormously complex system so that the clot forms
only when and only where it is required. Blood clotting is the ultimate
Rube Goldberg machine. 
<H3>The Professional Literature</H3>
<BR>
Other examples of irreducible complexity abound in the cell,including aspects
of protein transport, the bacterial flagellum, electron transport, telomeres,
photosynthesis, transcription regulation, and much more. Examples of irreducible
complexity can be found on virtually every page of a biochemistry textbook.
But if these things cannot be explained by Darwinian evolution, how has
the scientific community regarded these phenomena of the past forty years?
A good place to look for an answer to that question is in the Journal of
Molecular Evolution. JME is a journal that was begun specifically to deal
with the topic of how evolution occurs on the molecular level. It has high
scientific standards, and is edited by prominent figures in the field. In
a recent issue of JME there were published eleven articles; of these, all
eleven were concerned simply with the comparison of protein or DNA sequences.
A sequence comparison is an amino acid-by-amino acid comparison of two different
proteins, or a nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison of two different pieces
of DNA, noting the positions at which they are identical or similar, and
the places where they are not. Although useful for determining possible
lines of descent, which is an interesting questionin its own right, comparing
sequences cannot show how a complex biochemical system achieved its function;
the question that most concerns us here. By way of analogy, the instruction
manuals for two different models of computer putout by the same company
might have many identical words, sentences, and even paragraphs, suggesting
a common ancestry (perhaps the same author wrote both manuals), but comparing
the sequences of letters in the instruction manuals will never tell us if
a computer can be produced step by step starting from a typewriter.<BR>
<BR>
None of the papers discussed detailed models for intermediates in the development
of complex biomolecular structures. In the past ten years JME has published
over a thousand papers. Of these, about one hundred discussed the chemical
synthesis of molecules thought to be necessary for the origin of life, about
50 proposed mathematical models to improve sequence analysis, and about
800 were analyses of sequences. There were ZERO papers discussing detailed
models for intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular structures.
This is not a peculiarity of JME. No papers are to be found that discuss
detailed models for intermediates in the development of complex biomolecular
structures in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Nature,
Science, the Journal of Molecular Biology or, to my knowledge, any science
journal whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Publish or perish&quot; is a proverb that academicians take seriously.
If you do not publish your work for the rest of the community to evaluate,
then you have no business in academia and, if you don't already have tenure,
you will be banished. But the saying can be applied to theories as well.
If a theory claims to be able to explain some phenomenon but does not generate
even an attempt at an explanation, then it should be banished. Despite comparing
sequences, molecular evolution has never addressed the question of how complex
structures came to be. In effect, the theory of Darwinian molecular evolution
has not published, and so it should perish. 
<H3>Detection of Design</H3>
<BR>
What's going on? Imagine a room in which a body lies crushed, flat as a
pancake. A dozen detectives crawl around, examining the floor with magnifying
glasses for any clue to the identity of the perpetrator. In the middle of
the room next to the body stands a large, gray elephant. The detectives
carefully avoid bumping into the pachyderm's legs as they crawl,and never
even glance at it. Over time the detectives get frustrated with their lack
of progress but resolutely press on, looking even more closely at the floor.
You see, textbooks say detectives must &quot;get their man,&quot; so they
never consider elephants.<BR>
<BR>
There is an elephant in the roomful of scientists who are trying to explain
the development of life. The elephant is labeled &quot;intelligent design.&quot;
To a person who does not feel obliged to restrict his search to unintelligent
causes, the straightforward conclusion is that many biochemical systems
were designed. They were designed not by the laws of nature, not by chance
and necessity. Rather, they were planned. The designer knew what the systems
would look like when they were completed; the designer took steps to bring
the systems about. Life on earth at its most fundamental level, in its most
critical components, is the product of intelligent activity.<BR>
<BR>
The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself,
not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. Inferring that biochemical systems
were designed by an intelligent agent is a humdrum process that requires
no new principles of logic or science. It comes simply from the hard work
that biochemistry has done over the past forty years, combined with consideration
of the way in which we reach conclusions of design every day. <BR>
<BR>
What is &quot;design&quot;? Design is simply the purposeful arrangement
of parts. The scientific question is how we detect design. This can be done
invarious ways, but design can most easily be inferred for mechanical objects.
While walking through a junkyard you might observe separated bolts and screwsand
bits of plastic and glass, most scattered, some piled on top of each other,
some wedged together. Suppose you saw a pile that seemed particularly compact,
and when you picked up a bar sticking out of the pile, the whole pile came
along with it. When you pushed on the bar it slid smoothly to one side of
the pile and pulled an attached chain along with it. The chain inturn yanked
a gear which turned three other gears which turned a red-and-white striped
rod, spinning it like a barber pole. You quickly conclude that the pile
was not a chance accumulation of junk, but was designed, was put together
in that order by an intelligent agent, because you see that the components
of the system interact with great specificity to do something.<BR>
<BR>
It is not only artificial mechanical systems for which design caneasily
be concluded. Systems made entirely from natural components can also evince
design. For example, suppose you are walking with a friend in the woods.
All of a sudden your friend is pulled high in the air and left dangling
by his foot from a vine attached to a tree branch. After cutting himdown
you reconstruct the trap. You see that the vine was wrapped around the tree
branch, and the end pulled tightly down to the ground. It was securely anchored
to the ground by a forked branch. The branch was attached to another vine,
hidden by leaves so that, when the trigger-vine was disturbed, it would
pull down the forked stick, releasing the spring-vine. The end of the vine
formed a loop with a slipknot to grab an appendage and snap it up into the
air. Even though the trap was made completely of natural materials you would
quickly conclude that it was the product of intelligent design. 
<H3>A Complicated World</H3>
<BR>
A word of caution; intelligent design theory has to be seen in context:
it does not try to explain everything. We live in a complex worldwhere lots
of different things can happen. When deciding how various rocks came to
be shaped the way they are a geologist might consider a whole range of factors:
rain, wind, the movement of glaciers, the activity of moss and lichens,
volcanic action, nuclear explosions, asteroid impact, or the hand of a sculptor.
The shape of one rock might have been determined primarily by one mechanism,
the shape of another rock by another mechanism. The possibility of a meteor's
impact does not mean that volcanos can be ignored; the existence of sculptors
does not mean that many rocks are not shaped by weather.Similarly, evolutionary
biologists have recognized that a number of factors might have affected
the development of life: common descent, natural selection, migration, population
size, founder effects (effects that may be due to the limited number of
organisms that begin a new species), genetic drift (spread of neutral, nonselective
mutations), gene flow (theincorporation of genes into a population from
a separate population), linkage (occurrence of two genes on the same chromosome),
meiotic drive (the preferential selection during sex cell production of
one of the two copies of a gene inherited from an organism's parents), transposition
(the transfer of a gene between widely separated species by non-sexual means),
and much more.The fact that some biochemical systems were designed by an
intelligent agent does not mean that any of the other factors are not operative,
common, or important. 
<H3>Curiouser and Curiouser</H3>
<BR>
So as this talk concludes we are left with what many people feel tobe a
strange conclusion: that life was designed by an intelligent agent. In a
way, though, all of the progress of science over the last several hundred
years has been a steady march toward the strange. People up until the middle
ages lived in a natural world. The stable earth was at the center of things;
the sun, moon, and stars circled endlessly to give light by day and night;
the same plants and animals had been known since antiquity. Surprises were
few.<BR>
<BR>
Then it was proposed, absurdly, that the earth itself moved, spinning while
it circled the sun. No one could feel the earth spinning; no one could see
it. But spin it did. From our modern vantage it's hard to realize what an
assault on the senses was perpetrated by Copernicus and Galileo; they said
in effect that people could no longer rely on even the evidence of their
eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Things got steadily worse over the years. With the discovery of fossils
it became apparent that the familiar animals of field and forest had not
always been on earth; the world had once been inhabited by huge, alien creatures
who were now gone. Sometime later Darwin shook the world by arguing that
the familiar biota was derived from the bizarre, vanished life over lengths
of time incomprehensible to human minds. Einstein told us that space is
curved and time is relative. Modern physics says that solid objects are
mostly space, that sub atomic particles have no definite position, that
the universe had a beginning.<BR>
<BR>
Now it's the turn of the fundamental science of life, modern biochemistry,
to disturb. The simplicity that was once expected to be the foundation of
life has proven to be a phantom. Instead, systems of horrendous,irreducible
complexity inhabit the cell. The resulting realization that lifewas designed
by an intelligence is a shock to us in the twentieth century who have gotten
used to thinking of life as the result of simple natural laws.But other
centuries have had their shocks and there is no reason to suppose that we
should escape them. Humanity has endured as the center of the heavens moved
from the earth to beyond the sun, as the history of life expanded to encompass
long-dead reptiles, as the eternal universe proved mortal. We will endure
the opening of Darwin's black box.

<H3><I>A review of Darwin's Black Box, by Michael Behe<BR>
by Paul R. Gross</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="10" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
Decades after the infamous Scopes Trial, the debate over Darwinism is<BR>
heating up again, even among Darwinists. For them, however, the debate is<BR>
merely over details of the standard model. The truly brazen challenges to<BR>
Darwinian thought come from creationists--mostly religious believers who
read<BR>
Genesis literally and believe all species to have been created one-by-one
and<BR>
for a purpose. But creationism, too, has internal rivals.<BR>
<BR>
The fanciest version of creationism does not contest the brute facts<BR>
of geology and organic evolution' it concedes the immense age of the planet<BR>
and allows that evolution happens, at least within species. But it rejects
the<BR>
mechanisms--one of which is Darwin's natural selection--by which scientists<BR>
generally say evolutionary change occurs. This form of creationism--called<BR>
Intelligent Design Theory--argues that mere &quot;chance&quot; couldn't
make anything so<BR>
obviously &quot;designed&quot; as the human eye, let alone life. If life
is designed,<BR>
there must be a designer, no?<BR>
<BR>
The argument isn't new. Design is a common theme in medieval proofs of<BR>
the existence of God. William Paley's Divine Watchmaker--the Creator--was<BR>
believed throughout the 19th century (even by some Darwinists) to be required<BR>
by the complexity of life. But for scientists concerned with the study of<BR>
evolution, &quot;<A HREF="bydesign.html">intelligent design</A>&quot; ceased
to be taken seriously about 100 years<BR>
ago.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="behe.html">Michael J. Behe</A>, associate professor of biochemistry
at Lehigh<BR>
University, thinks he has rehabilitated the argument. In &quot;Darwin's
Black Box&quot;<BR>
(Free Press, 307 pages, $25), he claims to refute not simply old-fashioned<BR>
Darwinism but the 20th-century synthesis of paleontology, anatomy, embryology<BR>
and molecular genetics--what might be called Neo-Darwinism. According to<BR>
Neo-Darwinism, the diversity of life results from the survival of hereditary<BR>
variations that arise by chance at the level of genes--that is, at the level<BR>
of chemistry.<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Behe tries hard to avoid the theistic platitudes of &quot;creation<BR>
science.&quot; he insists that &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have a<BR>
candidate for the role of designer.&quot; He will not force God on his<BR>
readers--just a designer. So &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; includes a popular
tour of<BR>
some molecular processes at the cellular level of life. That much is<BR>
unexceptionable and well-written.<BR>
<BR>
But there is a key argument: The &quot;black box&quot; of the cell has now
been<BR>
opened by science (true enough). It is not simple (also true). The complexity<BR>
of whole organisms SEEMS modest compared with the complexity of their cellular<BR>
chemistry. So, he asks, could that complexity have happened step-by-step,<BR>
gradually, as Darwin proposed? No way, he answers; not unless the molecular<BR>
designs were already built in! The chemistry of life is just too complex
to<BR>
have come about &quot;by chance.&quot; In his own words: &quot;As the number
of required<BR>
parts increases, the difficulty of gradual putting the system together<BR>
skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets. Darwin looks<BR>
more and more forlorn.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But no more now than before is this convincing. Natural selection does<BR>
not operate &quot;by chance&quot; in any ordinary sense. Changes in the
genes do arise<BR>
randomly: This has been documented as well as anything in science. But there<BR>
is nothing chancy about what happens next, which is the survival and increase<BR>
of what WORKS. Nor is it true that as the number of required parts increases<BR>
&quot;the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets.&quot;
In fact,<BR>
complex systems--think of modern cities--CAN and DO assemble gradually rather<BR>
than all at once. Darwinism does not require complexity to arise willy-nilly<BR>
from simple parts. It requires only an adequate pool of variations in existing<BR>
parts, a changing environment and time for particular variations to increase<BR>
or die out in the population.<BR>
<BR>
Of late, the most notorious example of this process is the newly<BR>
drug-resistant bacteria and viruses that take over in an antibiotic-rich<BR>
environment. These are life-forms with novel chemistries, &quot;selected&quot;
from<BR>
continuous random changes in the genes: These genes make altered proteins,<BR>
which cause changes in chemistry and eventually a new form of life. With<BR>
viruses, this happens with alarming speed. Old kinds go extinct and new
kinds<BR>
take over within days. In higher, multicellular species, although the time<BR>
frame may be longer, the sources of molecular variations are the same or
even<BR>
more abundant and environmental pressures are just as severe if not more
so.<BR>
In sum: The evidence for old chemistry modifying to serve new purposes in<BR>
systems of increasing complexity is overwhelming.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, Mr. Behe patronizes or ignores the successes of<BR>
molecular evolution and pounces on a few puzzles as though each spelled
the<BR>
death of Darwinism. He does not attend seriously to the developmental<BR>
consequences of small genetic changes, which create whole new body-plans.
Thus<BR>
&quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; is not the refutation of Darwinism that creationists
long<BR>
for. Science cannot yet explain, among other things, the origin of life
on<BR>
this planet a few billion years ago. But whatever happened then, there is
no<BR>
trace--at least in the findings of science so far--of an intelligent designer<BR>
intervening thereafter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><h2>APPENDIX 2 </h2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF PUHCA<BR>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
The main provisions of PUHCA are summarized
below. A &quot;holding company&quot; is a company that owns ten
percent or more of the voting stock of a &quot;public utility
company.&quot; <a href="foot.html"><sup>65</sup></a> 
A &quot;public utility company&quot; is an electric
or gas utility company.  An electric or gas utility is any company
which owns or operates facilities to generate, transmit (in the
case of electricity) or distribute (in either case) these goods
for sale.  Numerous activities undertaken by public utilities
are regulated under PUHCA.  These can be divided into several
main areas:<BR>
 
<P>
<u>1) Registration </u>.
 As discussed above, all utility holding companies must either
register under the Act or seek an exemption.  Section 2 of the
Act requires that any firm acquiring more than 10 percent of the
equity of a utility must register as a holding company.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>2) Exemption </u>.
 The Act creates two main categories of public utility holding
companies: &quot;registered&quot; holding companies and &quot;exempt&quot;
holding companies.  Registered holding companies (RHC's) are subject
to all provisions of the Act, while exempt holding companies (EHC's)
are exempt from critical provisions of the Act.  There are currently
fourteen registered holding companies in the U.S.<BR>
 
<P>
There are several ways a holding company can
gain an exemption from the Act.  There are technically five statutory
exemptions.  The two main ones are, first, if a holding company's
operations are predominantly within a single state (i.e., &quot;intrastate&quot;
- Section 3 (a)(1)) and second, if the parent company is &quot;predominantly
a utility&quot; (Section 3 (a)(2)) meaning that the parent is
itself predominantly an operating utility, and operations of the
holding company system are limited to the state in which the parent
is organized, and contiguous states.<a href="foot.html"><sup>66</sup></a>  
The three remaining exemptions
are if the holding company is &quot;only incidentally a holding
company,&quot; a &quot;temporary holding company,&quot; or a &quot;foreign
holding company.&quot; <BR>
 
<P>
<U>3) Issuance and Acquisition of Securities </U>
(Sections 6 and 7).  The Act also regulates the securities and
assets that a registered holding company or its subsidiaries can
hold.  These sections make it unlawful to issue or sell a security
without prior SEC approval.  Specifically, the Act requires that
a security be &quot;reasonably adapted&quot; to the earning power
and security structure of the issuing company and to the capital
structure of the company, among other requirements. <BR>
 
<P>
<U>4) Acquisition of Utility Interests </U>
(Sections 8, 9 and 10).  These sections affect the acquisition
of securities, utility assets, and interests in other businesses.
 Section 8 prohibits a registered holding company from owning
an electric utility and a gas utility without the approval of
the state commission.  Section 9 places restrictions on the type
of assets that can be acquired.  It prohibits registered holding
companies from acquiring any securities, utility assets or any
other interest in any business (unless approved by the SEC) under
the standards of Section 10. Additionally, this section prohibits
any person (including both registered and exempt holding companies)
from acquiring any security of any public utility company, if
that purchase makes the person an affiliate (unless approved by
the SEC).  In the so-called &quot;two-bite rule, Section 9(a)(2)
requires that if a company owns five percent of a utility, transaction
that would result in ownership of more than 5 percent of the equity
of another utility requires prior SEC approval.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>5) Simplification of Holding Company Systems </U>
(Section 11).  An important goal of the Act was to integrate and
simplify the holding company system.  Section 11(b)(1) of the
Act requires that each registered holding company be limited to
a single &quot;integrated public-utility system,&quot; (although
the SEC has the authority to relax this constraint).  This essentially
limits the RHC to a particular geographic region and thus fosters
local control.  Non-utility businesses can be acquired only if
they are &quot;reasonably incidental, or economically necessary
or appropriate&quot; to the operations of the integrated utility
system, as defined in the Act.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>6) Coordination with State Regulatory Authorities </U>.
 An additional goal of the Act was to facilitate regulation of
public utilities on the state level.  For example, Section 6(b)
authorizes the SEC to exempt the issuance of certain securities
by subsidiary companies if approved by a state commission.  Likewise,
Section 9(b) exempts some asset acquisitions from provisions of
Section 10 if approved by a state commission.  Moreover, the SEC
may not authorize the issuance of securities or the acquisition
of assets unless the applicant has complied with state laws.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>7) Intercompany Transactions </U>
(Section 12).  This section was intended to limit transactions
between various affiliates within the holding company system.
 For example, section 12 (a) states that RHC's may not borrow
or receive any extension of credit or indemnity from any system
utility company.  Additionally, the SEC was given rule-making
authority over a large number of other affiliate transactions,
such as use of loans, payments of dividends, and disposal of assets.
<BR>
 
<P>
<U>8) Service Company Regulation </U>
(Section 13).  This section of the Act regulates contracts between
operating companies and service companies.  For example, Section
13 (b) states that service, sales, and construction contracts
between system companies in the same holding company system must
be performed &quot;economically and efficiently for the benefit
of such associate companies at cost, fairly, and equitably allocated
among such companies.&quot; <BR>
 
<P>
<U>9) Reports and Accounts </U>
(Sections 14 and 15).  These sections require RHCs to file routine
reports and keep record in accordance with the SEC's requirements.
<BR>
 
<P>
 <U>10) Exemptions since PURPA</U>.  There
are two main ways that these restrictions under PUHCA have been
alleviated since its passage.  First, under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, &quot;qualifying facilities&quot;
under that Act were exempted from PUHCA.  Second, The Gas Related
Activities Act of 1990<a href="foot.html"><sup>67</sup></a>
 allows gas utility holding companies to
seek exemption from PUHCA for certain activities including gas
transportation, storage and acquisitions related to gas supply.
Third, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended PUHCA in order to
create an exemption for exempt wholesale generators, which are
essentially facilities devoted exclusively to the generation of
electricity exclusively for sale on the wholesale level.  This
act also created an exemption for foreign utility companies, which
allows an RHC to own a foreign utility.  However, numerous aspects
of these transactions are still regulated by the SEC.

<P>
<CENTER><B>SUMMARY OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
IN SELECTED STATES<BR>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>California </B></CENTER>
<P>
Public Utility Commission's (PUC) December
20, 1995 Restructuring Decision:  Orders retail wheeling and poolco
market structure starting Jan 1998.  All customers would be eligible
by 1999, or by 2003 if there are technical problems.  Bilaterals
will be allowed, but at the beginning, all IOU's will be required
to buy and sell all their power through the Power Exchange, which
would gradually become a voluntary spot market.  Transmission
system operated by an independent system operator (ISO) according
to information from bilaterals and Power Exchange.  Both ISO and
Power Exchange should be FERC-regulated, independent of transmitters
and generators.  100 percent of stranded costs allowed to be recovered
through a non-bypassable (i.e. paid by all customers) competition
transition charge (CTC), but at a lower rate of return.  SCE and
PG&amp;E required to file plans to voluntarily divest themselves
of at least 50 percent of their fossil generation to a non-affiliated
entity because of market power concerns. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Massachusetts </B></CENTER>
<P>
On May 1, 1996 the Department of Public Utilities
(DPU) issued draft restructuring rules.  The rules envision implementation
of retail wheeling beginning 1998, a Power Exchange as a market
for short-term power sales, an ISO, separation of generation,
transmission and distribution into distinct corporate entities
and stranded costs recovery over ten years through a non-bypassable
access charge. 
<P>
Following DPU's request of August 1995, the
Division of Energy Resources and five (5) utilities have filed
their own restructuring plans, all of them presuming retail wheeling
and most of them proposing the separation or divestiture of generation
assets as the right way to mitigate market power and calculate
stranded costs. 
<P>
A number of bills on retail wheeling for manufactures
and municipal aggregation of loads are pending but not expected
to pass before DPU's final general rules, which are scheduled
for September 1996.  The company-specific orders are to be issued
February and March 1997.   
<P>
DPU imposed the first retail stranded costs
tariff on MIT who built a PURPA 20MW cogeneration facility and
hence departed from Cambridge Electric Light Co.  The tariff provides
for recovery of 75 percent of associated stranded costs. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>New Hampshire </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Public Utility Commission issued final
guidelines for a two-year retail wheeling pilot program (starting
May 1996) and applicable to about 50MW.  Participation is open
to any supplier who in turn must obtain NEPOOL membership or contract
with a NEPOOL member.  Utilities, except for individually negotiated
plans, will be allowed to recover 50 percent of stranded costs.
 
<P>
Both House and Senate passed a bill requiring
the PUC to order retail wheeling by June 1998 for all customer
classes.  The bill is expected to be signed by the Governor. 
It leaves the decision over the degree of unbundling to the PUC.
 It also instructs the PUC to assure recovery of nonmitigatable
stranded costs through a time-limited charge to all customers.
 
<P>
On June 6, 1995, the PUC ruled in the Freedom
Energy case that the utility franchise granted to Public Service
of New Hampshire was not exclusive on a permanent basis. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Rhode Island </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Electric Industry Restructuring Collaborative,
established by the PUC and comprised of broad spectrum of stakeholders,
issued an interim progress report, reaching consensus on most
issues, but not on a stranded cost recovery mechanism.  
<P>
A retail wheeling bill was introduced in the
House with New England Electric System's support and is expected
to pass.  The bill calls for gradual implementation of retail
wheeling starting in 1998, functional unbundling into separate
affiliates, and stranded costs recovery by 2009.  
<P>
Subsidiaries of Eastern Utilities Associates
filed a restructuring plan calling for retail wheeling for all
customers starting 1998.  It also contained a recovery of nuclear
stranded cost that would extend until all current obligations
are satisfied.<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>New York </B></CENTER>
<P>
In December 1995, an administrative law judge
(ALJ) issued a decision in the Public Service Commission's competitive
opportunities case recommending that PSC initiate wholesale competition
through a pool with an ISO and then add retail wheeling as soon
as possible.  Following the decision, the PSC approved a restructuring
plan which calls for creating a wholesale pool in 1997 and implementing
retail wheeling in 1998. While the PSC's plan envisions a system
operator consisting of member utilities and a &quot;green surcharge&quot;
to fund renewable programs, it does not deal with stranded costs
recovery.  
<P>
The PSC is also in the process of reviewing
company-specific restructuring proposals filed by Niagara Mohawk
and Long Island Lighting and ordered remaining five of state's
utilities to file their plans. The New York Power Authority has
proposed becoming an ISO and take over other utilities' transmission.
<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Illinois </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Commerce Commission approved a retail wheeling
pilot programs for Central Illinois Light and Illinois Power.
 Both programs are designed primarily for large loads.  Commonwealth
Edison proposed a long-range restructuring framework, consisting
of a five-year rate-freeze for its customers and experimental
five-year retail access starting 1998.  There are several legislative
proposals pending, including those of the Coalition for Consumer
Choice and Central Illinois Public Service.  All proposals presume
some sort of retail wheeling.

<CENTER><h2>I.  INTRODUCTION </h2></CENTER>

<P>
In sector after sector of the American economy
- from airlines to telecommunications - competition already has
replaced, or is replacing, regulation as the primary market structure.
 This competition revolution is now sweeping into the energy industry.
 Forty-six states are considering introducing competition into
their energy markets, and some Members of Congress are calling
for the complete deregulation of the energy industry. 
<P>
America is home to one-third of all the installed
electric energy capacity in the world, with investor-owned utility
assets in excess of $500 billion and total revenues of the electric
energy industry of $200 billion annually.   Allowing competition
in this industry would provide consumers with billions of dollars
annually in economic benefits and spur the introduction of better
generating technologies. 
<P>
Yet efforts to introduce competition into the
energy industry are hindered by a regulatory hold over from the
Depression.  The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is
a major barrier to state reform efforts.  In addition, its primary
purpose - to protect consumers and investors - is better served
by other existing mechanisms. Today, the Act is denying consumers
the benefits of more energy choices at better rates. 
<P>
This paper demonstrates that PUHCA should be
repealed as an important step in bringing the benefits of the
competition revolution to all consumers of energy in America.
 After a brief explanation of the origins and provisions of PUHCA,
the paper explains in section III how the Act is standing in the
way of state competition initiatives. 
<P>
Section IV explores how PUHCA hinders the most
efficient production of energy. Next, the paper explains that
the Act interferes with efficient energy regulation.  Section
VI explains that sixty years after the Depression, PUHCA is redundant.
 Not only has the industry itself transformed, but other federal
government bodies and market mechanisms are better able to protect
consumers and investors. 
<P>
At the end of the paper are appendices defining
terms and abbreviations, outlining the main provisions of PUHCA,
and explaining the reform efforts underway in the leading states. 
<P>
Repealing PUHCA would be a major step forward
in deregulating the energy industry.  It is time to remove this
outdated and redundant regulatory barrier to competition. It is
time to allow the states to experiment with the best methods for
providing consumers with the benefits of energy competition.<BR>

<TITLE>The Public Utility Holding Company Act -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>II.  THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT </h2></CENTER>
<P>
PUHCA was enacted during the Great Depression
in order to address problems in an energy industry that had &quot;concentrate[d]
control of vast utility empires in a few hands, which led to deception
of investors, excessive rates for consumers, and obstruction of
state utility regulation.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>  In order to address these purported
problems, the Act required the integration and simplification
of utility holding company systems into single &quot;integrated
public-utility systems.&quot; 
<P>
A holding company is any company which owns
the stock of another company.  PUHCA defines a utility holding
company as &quot;any company which directly or indirectly owns,
controls, or holds with the power to vote, 10 per centum or more
of the outstanding voting securities of a public utility.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
 For the purposes of the Act, an &quot;electric utility company&quot;
means any company which owns or operates facilities used for the
generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy for
sale, other than sale to tenants or employees of the company operating
such facilities for their own use and not for resale. <sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> A &quot;gas
utility company&quot; is generally a company that owns or operates
facilities used to distribute gas at retail.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> 
<P>
The holding company structure has always played
an important role in the utility industry.  In 1932, three holding
companies accounted for about half of the investor-owned electric
utility market.  In 1935, about 80 percent of the electric and
gas utility industry was controlled by holding companies.
<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>  With
PUHCA's enactment, more than 200 registered utility companies
- a large share of the utility industry - became subject to its
rules.<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> 
 In 1938, the 214 utility holding companies registered
under PUHCA controlled 922 utilities and 1,054 non-utility subsidiaries,
and often controlled other utilities through minority shareholdings.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>
 
<P>
By 1952, the process of reducing the complexity
of utility cross-ownership and reducing the number holding companies
was largely complete.  And today, only 14 active holding companies
(11 electric and 3 gas) remain registered under the Act.
<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>  The
11 registered electric utility holding companies account for about
20 percent of investor-owned utility retail electricity sales.
  Many of the largest electric utilities and most of the gas industry
are not even regulated under the Act. 
<P>
Yet the holding company structure is clearly
valuable to utilities as they continue to organize this way despite
the substantial regulations imposed by PUHCA.  In fact, a number
of pending mergers in the energy industry would create new registered
holding companies. 
<P>
A utility holding company subject to PUHCA
is required to &quot;register&quot; unless it can qualify for
exemption under any of five statutory exemptions.
<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>  The two main
exemptions are for utility operations that are predominately in
a single state and holding companies that are predominately operating
utilities.  Collectively, these exemptions encourage utilities
to operate in single states and to maintain relatively simple
organizational structures. 
<P>
Under PUHCA,  registered holding companies
require SEC approval to issue or sell securities, acquire utility
or nonutility assets, sell utility assets or enter into service
arrangements with sister companies.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  
 PUHCA also imposes rules
on various intercompany transactions, record-keeping and accounts,
and contracts between operating and service companies.  There
are also both routine and transaction-specific reports which utilities
must file with the SEC. 
<P>
Perhaps the most important aspect of PUHCA
regulation is the &quot;integration requirement.&quot;
<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup>  PUHCA
places a virtual ban on the acquisition of geographically distant
utility assets through the holding company form.  The effect of
this restriction is to keep both registered and unregistered utility
holding companies largely confined to one geographic area.
<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>   The
Energy Policy Act of 1992<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup> 
weakened this restriction, by permitting
investments by registered and exempt holding companies in foreign
utility companies and exempt wholesale generators (EWG's), &quot;wherever
located.&quot;  PUHCA continues to affect the acquisition of other
systems, however, and while the integration requirement does not
apply to EWG's, other provisions of PUHCA do.  For example, when
acquiring an EWG, a registered holding company is limited as to
the amount it can invest. 
<P>
The integration requirement is subject to interpretation
by the SEC, which appears to have loosened its interpretation
of the requirement over time.  For example, the SEC recently approved
a merger where the utilities in question were part of the same
power pool rather than actually contiguous.
<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>  The SEC could, however,
change course at any time.  
<P>
Finally, PUHCA regulates the degree to which
a registered holding company can acquire non-utility assets. 
Thus, the Act restricts diversification by registered holding
companies into non-utility businesses as well as into other utility
businesses.

As competition sweeps into America's
energy industry, the crucial public policy issue is, especially
at the federal level, how to restructure the rules of the game
so as to make the most of the current opportunity.  The Progress

<CENTER><h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
During the past 20 years, competition has largely
replaced monopoly as the typical market structure in cargo and
passenger airline service, bus and truck transportation, securities
and financial services markets and many postal services. With
enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the market for
telecommunications seems likely to follow a similar path. 
<P>
In many of these markets, competition has been
facilitated by technological advances that have reduced both the
importance of economies of scale and the cost of information,
creating opportunities for decentralization in areas where monopolies
and bureaucratic decision making once prevailed.  Taken together,
these developments constitute a major competition revolution. 
<P>
Competitive pressures in electricity markets,
already significant because of recent developments freeing up
transmission networks, are now increasing, in part due to the
introduction of more efficient (and environmentally friendly)
generation technologies.  Moreover, a large number of states are
studying or proposing restructuring plans for their electricity
markets, designed to bring the benefits of competition to their
consumers. 
<P>
 One major obstacle has stood in the path of
the competition revolution:  Government regulation.  Regulatory
structures put in place during the Progressive Era ostensibly
to <I>protect </I>consumers are now, ironically, <I>depriving
</I>consumers of the benefits only competition can bring. 
<P>
 Nowhere is this more true today than in the
markets for electric power and natural gas.   A 1935 law, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act<a href="foot.html"><sup>1</sup></a> (PUHCA), is depriving consumers
of hundreds of millions of dollars annually in economic benefits,
slowing the introduction of new technologies and even blocking
the efforts of states to deregulate their own markets. 
<P>
 As this paper demonstrates, repealing PUHCA,
as legislation now before Congress would do, would generate substantial
benefits and impose virtually no costs. The competition revolution
is moving to the market for electricity; government needs to open
the gates and let it in. 
<P>
PUHCA is a depression-era regulatory program
that has outlived its usefulness.  PUHCA's major effect today
is to impede state efforts to bring the benefits of electricity
competition to consumers.  Among the reasons to repeal PUHCA are: 
<UL>
<LI>At the present time, 46 states are at various
stages of implementing competitive restructuring plans of their
electric energy markets.  Six states - California, Illinois, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island - already have adopted
or are close to adopting restructuring plans that will allow retail
competition in some form.  In many of these cases, the restrictions
imposed by PUHCA will restrict entry and frustrate efforts to
create a competitive electricity market. 
<LI>PUHCA places geographic restrictions on
mergers and limitations on diversification into non-utility lines
of business.  These create artificial barriers to competition
and the efficient allocation of resources.  While these costs
have been reduced by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which
allows utilities to make better use of their telecommunications-related
assets, too many restrictions still remain. 
<LI>Similarly, PUHCA restricts the &quot;market
for corporate control&quot; by limiting takeovers of electric
and gas utilities.  This reduces the pressure for efficient utilization
of utilities' assets and the resultant savings that would be passed
on to customers. 
<LI>Increased wholesale competition in the
electricity industry and overall competition in gas markets diminish
the need for PUHCA-style regulation.  Competition is not yet sufficient,
however, to make rate regulation unnecessary. 
<LI>In order to trace costs to specific goods
and services and to avoid cross subsidization, many regulated
industries frequently establish separate subsidiaries or affiliates
for certain purposes.   In the energy industry, the holding company
structure is conducive to sound rate regulation.   Current PUHCA
requirements discourage firms from adopting a holding company
structure, and make the regulatory process more difficult for
both regulators and regulatees. 
<LI>Finally, PUHCA is redundant, because the
pervasiveness of other regulatory programs provides ample consumer
protection.  These programs include rate regulation at the state
and federal levels covering consumer prices; antitrust regulation
covering mergers and acquisitions; and, financial disclosure regulation
covering investors. 
</UL>

<P>
PUHCA has out lived whatever usefulness it
may once have had.  Consumers and investors today receive ample
protections through other regulatory and market mechanisms, yet
they are denied the benefits of competition in the energy industry.
<p>
  Repealing PUHCA is an important first step in bringing America's
energy markets into the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century. <be>

<TITLE> Puhca Versus the States -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>III.  PUHCA VS. THE STATES </h2></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-six states currently are studying options
for restructuring their electric energy markets.  In six states
- California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York
and Rhode Island - the state public utility commissions or legislatures
have adopted, or are close to adopting, specific restructuring
plans.<a href="/foot.html"><sup>16</sup></a> 
<P>
Each of these states is proposing to allow
retail customers to buy power directly from generators or other
alternative suppliers.  In such transactions, the traditional
franchise utility would merely transmit and distribute power.
 The benefits to consumers of such market arrangements are obvious:
 consumers will not be captive customers of a franchise utility,
relying on regulators to assure that their utility does not charge
excessive prices. Instead, consumers will be able to shop for
power the same way they shop for long distance telephone carriers.
 Furthermore, competition between generators ultimately will lead
to lower prices. 
<P>
PUHCA interferes with state-level restructuring
efforts in two ways.  First, it makes it difficult for states
to implement asset divestiture and unbundling proposals.  Second,
it will diminish the entry into retail markets of other power
suppliers that is necessary for restructuring proposals to produce
maximum benefits for consumers. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Unbundling (Charts 1 and 2) </B></CENTER>
<P>
An important aspect of a number of state proposals
is divestiture of generation assets, or the unbundling of utility
assets into a generating company (Genco), transmission company
(Transco) and distribution company (Disco).  In California, for
example, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
have been ordered to divest themselves of at least 50 percent
of their fossil generation capacity. <a href="/foot.html"><sup>17</sup></a>
 The purpose of these proposals
is to reduce the potential for market power and cross-subsidization
on the part of a vertically integrated utility, and to facilitate
regulation of monopoly transmission and distribution services.
 Proposals differ as to whether the divested Gencos, Transcos
and Discos could remain affiliated within a holding company structure. 
<P>
In some cases, PUHCA makes adoption of corporate
unbundling almost impossible. Unbundling an existing non-holding
utility company into legally distinct Genco, Transco and Disco
would create a new registered or exempt holding company.  The
large non-holding company utilities that operate in more than
one state would be the primary candidates for becoming registered
holding companies if one of the states in which they operate was
to issue a corporate unbundling order.  As Chart 1 shows, 
</ul><IMG SRC="img00001.gif">
<BR>
<ul> 
<P>
this would impose significant costs and procedural
delays on existing utilities.  Some of the most significant costs
include possible spin-offs of non-integrated or non-retainable
non-utility assets. 
<P>
Due to these potential costs, affected utilities
are likely to raise legal challenges, thus frustrating or at least
delaying restructuring efforts.  Even if events never reached
this stage, utilities could point to this troublesome aspect of
PUHCA in regulatory proceedings.  This might have a &quot;chilling&quot;
effect on state commissions, which may respond by avoiding corporate
unbundling proposals, even though, in the absence of PUHCA, such
proposals would be a beneficial part of a competitive restructuring
package.<BR>
 
<P>
If PUHCA did not exist, corporate unbundling
would be much more straightforward, as the contrast between Charts
1 and 2 demonstrates.<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00002.gif"><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B> Barriers to Retail Entry (Charts
3-6) </B></CENTER>
<P>
A key condition for successful state restructuring
plans is free entry into the energy market.  Restrictions either
on building new, more efficient generation plants or on entrants
buying existing generation capacity have an unambiguous impact:
 diminished competition in a deregulated environment. 
<P>
PUHCA is a significant barrier to entry in
a retail wheeling environment, and it will decrease participation
by some of America's most efficient firms in state competitive
restructuring efforts.  The Act restricts the ability of registered
holding companies, exempt holding companies, non-holding companies,
and non-utility companies to enter newly restructured markets.
  
<P>
The geographic integration requirement of PUHCA
prevents registered holding companies and their affiliates from
buying or building generation capacity to compete in a geographically
separate retail market.  An acquisition that fails to satisfy
the SEC integration requirement compliance test cannot be completed,
as is shown in Chart 3.  For example, the New England Electric
System cannot own a generation plant in California that directly
competes in the California retail market, even though there is
no economic reason why it should not be allowed to do so.  
<P>
Also, as Chart 3 shows, even when an acquisition
is consistent with PUHCA's geographic integration requirements,
the registered holding company still needs approval from the SEC
on the acquisition and its financing. The SEC approval process
is costly, uncertain and time consuming.  Even if approval is
eventually forthcoming, the delay may be a dealbreaker, and the
asset may not be obtained by the most efficient operator.
 
<P>
Exempt holding companies also may face SEC
jurisdiction if they attempt to enter a newly restructured retail
market, especially if such an entry would threaten their exemption
status.  The prospect of becoming a registered holding company
may well deter an exempt holding company from pursuing transactions
in out-of-state restructured markets.  Even if willing to carry
this burden, the SEC approval or procedural delay may be a dealbreaker,
as is illustrated in Chart 4.<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00003.gif">
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00004.gif">
<P>
Retail transactions across state boundaries
that do not involve the acquisition of generation might also create
problems for exempt companies.  For example, California's consumers
might benefit from buying power directly from Arizona Public Service,
which is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West, an exempt holding company
because its operations are limited to a single state.  If Arizona
Public Service bought a distribution company in California and
sold a significant amount in that market, its operations would
no longer be limited to a single state and it might lose its exemption.
 As a result, Arizona Public Service might choose not to compete
in the California retail market.
 
<P>
Finally, the exempt status of exempt wholesale
generators (EWGs) may diminish their importance as potential competitors.
 EWGs represent an easy source of entry into the retail generation
markets.  By selling at retail, however, an EWG's operations would
no longer be limited to wholesale level, and it would lose its
exemption from PUHCA.  The costs of losing the exemption are likely
to keep the EWGs off the retail market.
 
<P>
PUHCA will also make it more difficult for
utility companies that are not already holding companies to enter
new retail markets.  Such companies may, for financing and other
reasons, prefer to create a new corporate entity when acquiring
a generation plant used to make retail sales.  As Chart 5 shows,
entering a retail market in this manner creates a maze of PUHCA-related
procedures and requirements that may eventually result in ordered
divestitures of substantial assets from the entering entity. 
This possibility, and the administrative costs and other restrictions
of PUHCA, are likely to cause such companies to avoid these transactions.
 In particular, any transaction that entails becoming subject
to PUHCA is very likely to deter companies that are not already
holding companies.
 
<P>
Any corporate entity that owns retail generation
becomes an &quot;electric utility company&quot; under PUHCA. 
A parent of such an entity (unless able to qualify for an exemption)
must register and thereby become subject to all the requirements
of PUHCA, including the geographic integration and ownership of
non-utility assets requirements.  Non-holding companies that are
not already in the electricity business may bypass PUHCA when
acquiring a retail generation plant by not using a holding company
structure.  In that case, however, the company would, as shown
in Chart 6, become an &quot;electric utility company&quot; under
PUHCA.  Future activities, whether in the power industry or elsewhere,
that would entail creating a holding company would make such a
company subject to full PUHCA requirements, unless an exemption
could be found.  Such a threat is likely to deter non-power companies
from entering the retail generation business.
 
<P>
Thus far, state restructuring proposals typically
have not mandated the use of wholesale power pools, which provide
another possible framework for competition.  The exceptions are
California, where initially all utility power must be traded through
a pool,  
<P>
  
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00005.gif"><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="img00006.gif">
<P>
and New York, where the pool structure is required
to be in place before retail wheeling is implemented in 1998.
 Although a pool structure eliminates some of the problems discussed
above, because generators selling into the pool are considered
wholesale and therefore exempt, some PUHCA-induced restrictions
remain.  In particular, the ability of registered holding companies
to participate by owning EWG's outside their integrated service
territories would still be limited by SEC investment rules for
such companies (see Chart  7).<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00007.gif">
<P>
Without PUHCA, as Chart 8 shows, the process
of acquiring utility assets will be greatly simplified and much
more attractive to a large number of potential entrants.  Paradoxically,
even though PUHCA directly regulates registered holding companies,
the high costs of becoming a registered holding company prevents
retail entry by those companies that actually do <I>not</I> fall
under its jurisdiction.  (Compare Charts 5 and 6 with Chart 3).

 
<P>
Although PUHCA is viewed as serving consumers'
interests by limiting market power through merger control, in
fact the Act <I>increases</I> market power by raising barriers
to entry into newly restructured retail markets.  The repeal of
PUHCA is thus necessary to provide electricity consumers the greatest
benefits of electricity competition.<BR>

<CENTER><h2>IV. PUHCA VS. EFFICIENCY</h2><BR>
 </CENTER>
<P>
Quite apart from the direct impact PUHCA will
have on state competitive restructuring programs, the Act imposes
substantial social costs on electricity and gas customers, stockholders
and the public at large by erecting barriers to efficiency and
by imposing significant administrative, financing and transactions
costs.<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Barriers to Efficiency<BR>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
As discussed in the last two sections, PUHCA
restricts the movement of registered holding companies into markets
that are not geographically connected or capable of such interconnection.
 The SEC has recognized that these requirements are restrictive,
and while it appears that the SEC is relaxing its interpretation
of this section somewhat, such mergers are nevertheless subject
to regulatory scrutiny by the SEC as well as by FERC.
<a href="/foot.html"><sup>18</sup></a>
 
<P>
The potential benefits lost because of these
restrictions are numerous.  While it is unlikely that major benefits
would accrue at the plant level because the minimum efficient
scale of an electric generating plant is now relatively small,
<a href="foot.html"><sup>19</sup></a>
substantial benefits from non-contiguous utility integration include:
a more efficient mix of generating facilities through better coordination;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>20</sup></a>
savings due to a more efficient scale of overhead activities;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>21</sup></a>
and, savings due to more efficient matching of load diversity.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>22</sup></a>
 The present value of the total savings from lifting restrictions
on non-contiguous utility mergers is estimated at approximately
$2 billion<a href="foot.html"><sup>23</sup></a>
 - and this does not include the &quot;cost&quot; of
the integration requirement imposed on consumers of states where
competitive restructuring is underway. 
<P>
In addition, PUHCA directly and indirectly
restricts registered holding companies from engaging in non-utility
activities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>24</sup></a>  
The &quot;ten-percent rule&quot; directly restricts
a registered holding company to no more than 10-percent ownership
of a subsidiary venture before that venture is subject to the
requirements of PUHCA.  Furthermore, the &quot;functional-relationship
test&quot; combined with the &quot;50-percent rule&quot; essentially
requires that the business a registered holding company does in
a &quot;functionally related&quot; area <I>outside</I> the firm
cannot exceed what the company does <I>inside</I>.
<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Although the
SEC has begun recently to make exceptions to the 50-percent rule,
these rules still constitute significant direct restrictions on
non-utility activities. 
<P>
Indirectly, the Act creates a &quot;chilling
effect&quot; on non-utility activities by requiring SEC oversight
of these businesses.<a href="foot.html"><sup>26</sup></a>
  The fact that firms must publicly disclose
the details of these businesses, and incur compliance costs, imposes
a burden that affects exempt holding companies and non-utilities
as well as registered holding companies.  
<a href="foot.html"><sup>27</sup></a> 
<P>
Utilities have a comparative advantage in many
non-utility activities but are prevented from engaging in them
due to PUCHA.<a href="foot.html"><sup>28</sup></a>  
The costs associated with limits on diversification
were somewhat mitigated by enactment of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, which permits registered holding companies to enter
the telecommunications business.<a href="foot.html"><sup>29</sup></a>
  This legislation will produce
large benefits because the electric utility industry already has
laid 10,000 miles of fiber optic cable for its own data transmission
and other purposes.  This cable capacity has gone under utilized
because of PUHCA and now may be made available for other purposes. 
<P>
Many industry observers anticipate that electric
utilities will find significant efficiencies in having homes wired
for improved energy-use metering and applications such as &quot;real
time pricing&quot; of electricity.  In the event this takes place,
utilities will obviously be in a good position to utilize the
same wires to offer telecommunications services at very competitive
prices.  This is now permissible, but other potential benefits
of diversification are not currently feasible.  For example, while
the 1996 Act permits electric utilities to diversify into telecommunications,
the reverse is not true.  Telecommunications companies cannot
diversify into the retail electricity business without being subject
to the requirements of PUHCA.  And, the Act continues to restrict
entrance by electric utilities into non-telecommunications  businesses. 
<P>
Given that there are important complementarities
between a number of industries and electric utilities, it is likely
that many firms would find it profitable to enter utility markets,
thus bringing additional capital and expertise.  In general, PUHCA
limits the possibility of innovative and efficient industrial
companies acquiring electric utilities and applying the lessons
learned in competitive industries to their regulated firms.  These
economies are lost, in addition to limiting participation in the
market for &quot;corporate control.&quot;<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Barriers to the Market for Corporate
Control </B></CENTER>
<P>
The market for corporate control - whereby
firms are able to create value by acquiring poorly managed firms
and improving their performance - exerts a powerful disciplining
effect on costs.<a href="foot.html"><sup>30</sup></a>  
There is substantial statistical support for
the proposition that takeovers create important social benefits.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>31</sup></a>
 An active market in corporate control can be especially important
in traditional rate-regulated public-utility markets, where the
incentives to control costs are relatively weak, because costs
are easily passed through to ratepayers.<a href="foot.html"><sup>32</sup></a>
  To the extent that PUHCA
impedes the operation of the market for corporate control, it
results in less efficient utilization of utility assets and higher
costs and prices for consumers. 
<P>
For example, of the nine hostile utility takeover
attempts that occurred between 1960 and 1986 (all of which failed),
six failed &quot;primarily because of federal regulatory procedure
based on the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.&quot;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>33</sup></a>
 In the five years from 1986 to 1990, there were 13 takeover attempts
but only one was successful.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>34</sup></a> 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Restrictions on Financing, Affiliate
Transactions and Administrative Costs </B></CENTER>
<P>
As discussed previously, the regulatory costs
imposed by PUHCA to a non-utility of acquiring a utility are prohibitive.
 Such a company, under the Act, could be required to become a
registered holding company.  Registered holding companies need
SEC approval to issue or sell securities, acquire utility or nonutility
assets, sell utility assets or enter into service arrangements
with sister companies.  This clearly makes it nearly impossible
for a non-utility to consider acquiring utility assets. 
<P>
There are substantial costs routinely associated
with PUHCA's regulation of utility financing.  Since companies
must obtain SEC approval for numerous activities, they are often
significantly delayed in responding to market opportunities. 
The benefits of optimal financial arrangements are slow in coming,
and therefore may be foregone.  As discussed below, state utility
commissions also regulate these decisions, and this local regulation
is likely to be better able to assess local needs. 
<P>
Moreover, each registered holding company must
file annually a number of routine reports with the SEC to meet
the requirements of PUHCA.  The cost of filing these required
forms has been estimated at $6 million annually (or more than
$50 million on a present value basis). <a href="foot.html"><sup>35</sup></a>
 Utilities also must file
applications with the SEC to obtain approval for various transactions.
 In addition to these routine filings, companies in a registered
holding company system must generally seek SEC approval any time
they undertake non-routine activities which fall under the purview
of PUHCA.  These costs have been estimated at more than $10 million
annually (or more than $100 million on a present value basis).
<a href="foot.html"><sup>36</sup></a>
 Thus, total annual administrative costs are estimated at $16
million annually, or approximately $150 million on a present value
basis. These are costs that consumers eventually pay through higher
rates for gas and electricity. <br>

<TITLE> V. Puhca versus Efficient Regulation -- PFF</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>V.  PUHCA VS. EFFICIENT REGULATION </h2></CENTER>
<P>
Increases in competition diminish the need
for regulation in general and magnify the importance of PUHCA's
anticompetitive features.  Nevertheless, competition is not yet
sufficient to eliminate the need for maximum rate regulation.
 Paradoxically, PUHCA has effects that are inconsistent with an
efficient regulatory system.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>Increased Competition in Electricity
and Gas </B></CENTER>
<P>
Although competition at the retail level for
electricity has just started to emerge, there has, in recent years,
been a significant increase in wholesale electricity competition.
 In the gas industry, competition has increased at both the wholesale
and retail levels. 
<P>
Wholesale power markets have become increasingly
competitive in recent years, primarily as a result of a series
of legislative and regulatory developments.  Today, large regional
grid networks allow competing suppliers access to wholesale customers
of many sizes and types. 
<P>
The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
of 1978 (PURPA),<a href="foot.html"><sup>37</sup></a>
 created a new class of generators, called qualifying
facilities (QFs) consisting of co-generators and small power producers.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>38</sup></a>
 As a result, non-utility generation increased rapidly in the
1980's, and by 1992 accounted for 10 percent of total U.S. generation.
 
<P>
Wholesale competition also has been facilitated
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, <a href="foot.html"><sup>39</sup></a>
which permits any person, including
a registered holding company, to acquire an exempt wholesale generator
wherever located, or a foreign utility company (&quot;FUCO&quot;)
without seeking prior approval from the SEC.<a href="foot.html"><sup>40</sup></a> 
The EWGs constitute
an important source of non-utility generation. 
<P>
Today, additional units of generating capacity
are just as likely to be provided by non-utility generators (NUGs,
which include both QFs and EWGs) as by utilities.  During 1990-91,
NUGs added more net capacity than did utilities and forecasts
suggest that the importance of NUG's will increase in the future.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>41</sup></a> 
<P>
The 1992 Energy Policy Act also authorized
FERC to require companies to provide transmission services if
in the public interest.  Pursuant to this provision, the Commission
in April 1996 issued an order that requires all transmission-owning
public  utilities to open their transmission lines to eligible
wholesale customers on a non-discriminatory basis.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>42</sup></a>  Providing
access to the transmission network will increase competitiveness
at the wholesale level and make the state regulators' job easier
and their regulation more effective. 
<P>
The gas market has, in the deregulated environment
of recent years, become much more competitive. In 1978, Congress
passed the Natural Gas Policy Act as part of the National Energy
Plan.  In January 1985, in accordance with Phase 1 of this plan,
wellhead prices for about half the nation's gas supplies were
decontrolled.<a href="foot.html"><sup>43</sup></a>  
Wellhead price controls were eliminated for all
gas supplies by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. 
<P>
In October 1985, FERC, in Order 436, allowed
pipelines to become open-access transporters of gas bought directly
from producers by all classes of customers.  In November of 1993,
FERC issued Order 636, which basically converted pipelines to
common carrier status and made natural gas procurement, contract
and price negotiations the responsibility of the local distribution
companies. 
<P>
The deregulation of wellhead prices, combined
with greater access to pipeline transportation services, and the
inclusion of many more participants in the natural gas market,
has resulted in a much more competitive market than existed a
decade ago.  The gas industry seems well along in the deregulatory
process and PUHCA simply acts as a drag on the process. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Regulatory Efficiency </B></CENTER>
<P>
The developments described above mean that
electric utility firms are now faced with wholesale competition
from numerous non-utility generators and other utilities.  Even
in the absence of retail competition, this change in market structure
reduces the need for PUHCA regulation. The price information from
an active wholesale market is a major aid to state regulators
and hence they are able to more easily judge the &quot;reasonableness&quot;
of a local utility's rate requests.  Information generated from
a competitive wholesale market is a high-powered substitute for
the purported informational benefits of PUHCA regulation. 
<P>
PUHCA was intended &quot;to provide a mechanism
to create conditions under which effective federal and state regulation
will be possible.&quot;<a href="foot.html"><sup>44</sup></a> 
 It is, therefore, ironic that the Act
discourages the holding company structure, which is conducive
to efficient regulation. The major purpose of public utility rate
regulation is to insure that rates are reasonable relative to
costs.  The avoidance of unauthorized cross-subsidies is particularly
important for multi-product utilities. 
<P>
Firms with discrete product lines can organize
either through the divisional structure (examples are PacifiCorp
and UtiliCorp) or as holding companies in which the divisions
are separate corporate entities.  The holding company structure
facilitates regulation because it makes it more straightforward
for both the regulator and the regulatee to allocate costs.  Costs
are more easily traceable to the individual products and cross-subsidies
are easier to discern.  It is for this reason that firms in regulated
industries frequently are <I>required</I> to provide certain product
lines through separate subsidiaries or affiliates (for an example,
see section 272 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires
Bell operating companies to provide certain services through separate
affiliates). 
<P>
The requirements of PUHCA make organizing as
a holding company costly, whatever its other advantages.  If PUHCA
were repealed, it is likely that more firms would organize as
holding companies, thereby improving the regulatory process.

<TITLE> PUHCA is Redundant -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><B>VI.  PUHCA IS REDUNDANT </B></CENTER>
<P>
As the SEC has recognized, the regulation of
utilities has become vastly more sophisticated at both the federal
and state levels in the years since PUHCA was enacted. The pervasiveness
of other regulatory programs makes the PUHCA requirements duplicative
and unnecessary. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>State Regulation </B></CENTER>
<P>
One of the intentions of PUHCA was to facilitate
the regulation of electric utilities on the state level through
simplification and data availability.  Absent any of the PUHCA
provisions, state regulators have expanded their authority over
both electric and gas utilities and now have all the authority
needed to protect consumers from unreasonable rates. 
<a href="foot.html"><sup>45</sup></a> Most states
also regulate securities issuances, acquisition and diversification
activities and prescribe uniform systems of accounts for regulatory
purposes.<a href="foot.html"><sup>46</sup></a> 
<P>
All state commissions have the authority to
regulate retail rates of investor-owned utilities and to demand
justification before adopting any rate changes.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>47</sup></a> In this connection,
states have the authority to access out-of-state information that
affects an in-state utility.<a href="foot.html"><sup>48</sup></a> 
 The great majority of state commissions
also have the authority to investigate rates, approve mergers,
and investigate contracts and agreements between utilities and
their affiliated non-utilities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>49</sup></a>
  Many commissions have authority
to regulate utility entry into non-utility activities.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>50</sup></a>  Most states
lacked the authority to review these activities when PUHCA was
passed in 1935.<a href="foot.html"><sup>51</sup></a>  
<P>
Importantly, any activity which affects rates
(as all important activities invariably do) is under the control
of state regulators.<a href="foot.html"><sup>52</sup></a> 
 Thus, even if a state commission is not
directly granted the authority to review a particular utility
transaction, it is able to review it and take remedial action
<I>de facto</I> through powers of rate review.  Similarly, even
if a commission did not have express approval power over mergers
or consolidations - although most of them do<a href="foot.html"><sup>53</sup></a>
 - the commission
could nevertheless control these transactions by reviewing their
effects on rates and potentially disallowing cost recovery in
the next rate hearing.  Finally, in the limited number of cases
where a commission does not have full access to all of a utility
affiliate's books and records, the commission can simply refuse
to grant a rate increase if its requests for data are not met.
<sup><a href="foot.html">54</a></sup>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Federal Regulation </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
is responsible for regulating rates for the interstate wholesale
electricity and natural gas markets.<a href="foot.html"><sup>55</sup></a>
  As part of its regulatory
functions, FERC collects detailed financial information and has
established uniform systems of accounts to which regulated utilities
must adhere.<a href="foot.html"><sup>56</sup></a>  
<P>
FERC also has the authority to review, in advance,
electric utility mergers and securities issuances, and has oversight
over numerous utility transactions, including mergers, property
dispositions, the acquisition and issuance of securities, and
affiliate transactions.<a href="foot.html"><sup>57</sup></a>
  Finally, FERC has authority to scrutinize
the books and records of a utility, and of a person who controls
such a utility. <a href="foot.html"><sup>58</sup></a>
<P>
With respect to the issue of access to books
and records, utilities generally have the burden of proof in rate
proceedings.  Therefore, as a practical matter, even when a state
commission does not have independent access to the books and records
of a utility affiliate, the utility will be required to provide
such records to the extent that they relate to the recovery of
costs.<a href="foot.html"><sup>59</sup></a> 
Similarly, the issue of the reasonableness of affiliate
transactions can be addressed by  FERC and the states through
their normal ratemaking authorities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>60</sup></a> 
<P>
At the time PUHCA was enacted, public utilities
were exempt from the federal antitrust laws.<a href="foot.html"><sup>61</sup></a>
  Now, not only do
FERC and the SEC examine the same aspects of proposed mergers,
but the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice does as
well, in order to deter mergers that are detrimental to consumers'
interests.  Thus there would still be redundancy in utility merger
oversight even if PUHCA were repealed. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Financial Disclosure </B></CENTER>
<P>
As noted, a major goal of PUHCA was to standardize
accounts and increase financial disclosure.  Today, registered
holding companies are subject to the same securities laws which
are applicable to all publicly held companies.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>62</sup></a>
  Repeal of PUHCA
would not affect these laws in any way. 
<P>
Moreover, the market itself &quot;demands a
level of disclosure unheard of in the days when PUHCA was passed
into law&quot; for any company that wants to attract outside capital.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>63</sup></a>
 Any company wishing to obtain financing through organized securities
markets must meet stringent standards of disclosure and uniformity,
independent of the requirements of securities laws.  Because of
the tremendous benefits of the securities markets, there is an
extraordinary incentive to meet the necessary standards.  The
growth of intermediaries between firms and individual investors,
such as mutual and pension funds, ensures that firms are subject
to a high level of financial scrutiny.  Expert rating agencies,
such as Duff and Phelps, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's, provide
an elevated level of scrutiny. 
<P>
The institutions of the accounting profession
also have responded to the demands for better information.  For
example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has become
increasingly important in establishing uniform accounting standards
which must be used by all accountants who are members of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  All financial
statements certified by a member of the AICPA must follow rules
established by FASB.  The stricter accounting standards envisioned
by the framers of PUHCA for the utility industry have thus been
incorporated by the accounting profession and are now widely enforced
by it.  Any utility wishing to enjoy the benefits of having audited
financial statements must meet these standards.

<CENTER><h2>VII.  CONCLUSION </h2></CENTER>
<P>
PUHCA was enacted under vastly different circumstances
than exist today.  In the last 60 years, the electric and gas
utility industries have undergone substantial changes.  Whatever
the merits of PUHCA in 1935, the case for repealing it now is
strong. 
<P>
As the states try to move toward a more competitive
environment, PUHCA stands in their way.  If unchanged, PUHCA will
be an even more significant impediment to the competitive restructuring
of the electric utility industry in the future.  For the gas industry,
which has to a large extent already been restructured, the PUHCA
restrictions may be even more burdensome. 
<P>
Given the existing regulatory protections,
the increasingly competitive electricity and gas environment,
and the desire on the part of many states to move away from the
old vertically integrated monopoly structures, the case for repealing
PUHCA seems compelling. The SEC has been recommending PUHCA repeal,
albeit in slightly different forms, for more than a decade. 
<a href="foot.html"><sup>64</sup></a> It
seems time for the Congress to act.

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">I. INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><br><p>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Urban air pollution, whether from chimneys,
smokestacks or, later on, from automobiles, is documented as far
back as commentary on urban problems can be found.  First addressed
by common law and later by city and state regulation, the pollution
challenge became the object of federal control in 1970 with passage
of the Clean Air Act.<sup><a href="end.html">1</a></sup> 
Over the years, America achieved significant
progress in reducing emissions, but never enough to meet nationwide
standards.  For instance, in heavily populated regions, pollution
from individual sources was reduced while the number of sources
simultaneously increased.  Indeed, vehicle travel has doubled
since 1970.<sup><a href="end.html">2</a></sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Air pollution is a regional phenomenon.  Its
solution requires a decentralized approach that allows flexibility
to address local conditions.  The 1990 amendments to the Clean
Air Act (CAA) recognized that the problem of air pollution cannot
be solved with a national, one-size-fits-all approach - a fundamental
change from the way the nation had previously attempted to achieve
clean air goals.  While the CAA set tighter national standards
for reducing air pollution, it also established even tighter strictures
for more troubled regions.  These regional standards are so tight
that some question their scientific justification.<sup><a href="end.html">3</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA identified 22 U.S. cities, California
and the12 states that form the nation's northeastern quadrant
as regions facing exceptional air pollution problems that require
individualized solutions.   The Act mandated that these regions
achieve significant reductions in the formation of ozone and certain
specified pollutants that come from automobiles, other mobile
sources and industry.  Federal regulators have ordered cities
and states facing the more difficult pollution problems to set
up prescribed systems for inspecting and maintaining automobile
emission controls.  However, pollution from stationary sources
and conventional vehicles can be reduced only so much before the
rising incremental costs make it practically impossible to achieve
significant gains in overall reductions of air pollution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> Thus in the face of ever-tightening constraints,
communities, states and regions have searched for new ways to
reduce air pollution - in fact, the CAA calls for the development
and deployment of new technologies.  A few established credit
trading programs that allow polluters who cut below mandated levels
to sell credits to others who face higher costs.<sup><a href="end.html">
4</a></sup>  Some pushed
for the use of cleaner-burning fuels.  Others experimented with
ways to induce greater use of mass-transit systems and clean-fuel
vehicles, and some pushed to remove older and dirtier cars from
the highway by allowing industrial polluters to gain credits when
they purchase and destroy the old junkers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> Added to these programs is a major effort
to develop and introduce alternative fuel (nonpetroleum-based)
vehicles (AFVs).  AFVs have two major benefits:  they are cleaner
and reduce U.S. dependence on petroleum imports.  AFV use is being
encouraged through legislative mandates, presidential executive
orders, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) standards that set the mile-per-gallon fuel
efficiency rate to be achieved by new car fleets .</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Introduction of Alternative
Fuel Vehicles</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> When the CAA was passed, AFVs were far more
than a gleam in some inventor's eye.<sup><a href="end.html">5</a></sup>  Propane-burning vehicles,
which accounted for 10 percent of the vehicles in Holland in 1992,
had been used in the United States for decades.  Methanol- and
ethanol-based fuels, used widely in Brazil, were available for
conventional vehicles throughout most U.S. markets.<sup><a href="end.html">6</a></sup>  Compressed
natural gas (CNG) vehicles dominated a small part of the Italian
market and were a clear contender for expanded use in America.
 And electric vehicles, long seen in airports and on golf courses
in miniature form, were being developed and demonstrated for commuters
in U.S. cities.  Along with alternative fuels, reformulated gasoline
was in the works, and the auto companies were heavily involved
in improving the emission performance of their gasoline engines.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The drafters of the CAA hoped that if somehow
clean automobiles and trucks suddenly emerged on the streets of
nonattainment cities (those not meeting clean air standards),
then part of the emission control battle might be won.   However,
placing a bet on the market prospects for AFVs in 1990 was gambling
on successful development and market acceptance of new technologies.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 1994 summary
of the problem somehow makes all this seem easy:</FONT>
<P><blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Clean-fueled vehicles are here today and widespread
use in the near future is feasible.  To enable the transition,
technologies must be refined so vehicles can achieve optimum performance
and emissions characteristics.  Consumers must accept the new
vehicles and fuels, and government and industry must cooperate

</blockquote><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> Yet in reality, the challenges facing the
new technologies are enormous.  One need only think of the nation's
deeply embedded driving and fuel-use habits to understand the
magnitude of change required for AFVs to succeed:  consumers purchasing
light vehicles can choose from thousands of models; buyers of
heavy-duty trucks and buses may select from hundreds; and, government
and industry are limited in their options.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> At any moment in time and in all markets,
new technologies stand before the market's threshold awaiting
their chance.  Entry to the market depends on luck, access to
capital markets, changing relative prices, protection of intellectual
property rights, and the regulatory framework that may in some
cases be protecting existing technologies. Technology-based standards,
commonly found in the environmental arena, can blunt the spur
to introduce new pollution control devices that may stand at the
market's threshold. The role of government in influencing markets
and thus the acceptance of new technology is immense.  For example,
banking statutes and regulations that mandate risk-based capital
requirements can affect credit markets, sometimes introducing
a bias that favors known players and technologies.  In addition,
the patent and common law governing trade secrets can either delay
or hasten the introduction of new production techniques. Antitrust
enforcement limits the exchange of information among competitors
and chills mergers among firms with new and old technologies.
 Various tax and subsidy schemes alter consumer prices and thereby
influence the flow of new technologies.  Finally, government's
role as buyer of goods can either favor or discourage new technologies.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Even if these hurdles are surmounted for at
least part of the AFV market, another difficulty enters the picture.
 Unlike other new products that, for instance, improve communications
or health care, environmental technologies produce a product that
seldom commands a price.  Units of cleaner air are not bought
and sold in conventional markets, and thus it is difficult to
determine the worth of new environmental technologies.  It may
even seem that command-and-control regulation is the only way
to induce air quality improvements.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Can market incentives be called on to help? What is the role played by government in all this?  Are federal
subsidies and taxes the answer?  Do states and cities provide
the appropriate arena of action?  What can we say about national
policy and the prospects for cleaner AFVs?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This paper addresses these questions and more.
 While recognizing that there are serious questions associated
with the statutes now in place, we nonetheless accept their bright
lines and consider the means that might be chosen to accomplish
the laws' goals.<sup><a href="end.html">8</a></sup>
  Our report first explains the air pollution
problem facing major cities and regions, the statutes attempting
to address the problem, and the related national energy security
problem.  Next the paper explains the institutional framework
that affects the market for all vehicles and especially those
using alternative fuels.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Section III examines the problem confronted
when there is no market for cleaner air and provides details on
federal and state legislation and tax policies that relate to
the problem.  The next section focuses exclusively on AFVs and
examines in some detail six contenders for market entry:  compressed
natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, ethanol, methanol
and electric-powered vehicles.  Along the way, key institutional
issues are discussed, and the newly emerging decentralized approach
to the clean air problem is emphasized.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Section V identifies niche markets that are
currently emerging for AFVs.  These include heavy-duty trucks
and other large engine vehicles that do not confront the infrastructure
problem faced by the light vehicle market.  Drawing on the theme
of decentralization, the concluding section provides a policy
proposal for alternative fuel vehicles and other technologies
that might improve air quality.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our proposal calls for the creation of Environmental
Innovation Areas (EIAs) - air quality management regions that
can be freely adopted by any metropolitan area, region or state.
 Bound by national air quality standards that must be maintained,
the EIAs would be given flexibility in devising local approaches
for improving air quality.  Each unique EIA may customize its
use of taxes, subsidies, emission credit markets and other devices
to achieve its clean air targets.  Our plan would also repeal
regulations that limit entry of new technologies.  In addition,
it would require that federal agencies use taxpayer funds to assist
the purchase of mandated AFVs while not favoring or discriminating
against any specific alternative fuel.  The goal of our recommendations
is to encourage experiments in new technology by using the creativity
of the marketplace.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Pressure for the development and introduction
of AFVs is driven by two goals.  One relates to efforts to reduce
the importation of oil especially from the Persian Gulf, discussed
more fully below.  The more binding goal relates to mobile-source
emissions, which is another way of saying emissions from autos,
trucks and buses.  Simply stated, many U.S. cities have not met
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), first put
forward in the 1970 Clean Air Act and subsequently revised and
raised.<sup><a href="end.html">9</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The problem fundamentally relates to ozone,
which falls into two categories.<sup><a href="end.html">10</a></sup>
 The first is found in the upper
atmosphere; this is good ozone that protects the population from
intense sun rays that cause skin cancer.  There is also a lower
atmospheric or terrestrial ozone, which is produced by a complex
reaction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), like hydrocarbons, in the presence of sunlight.  It is
this lower atmospheric ozone that yields smog, which in turn causes
respiratory and other health problems as well as damage to agricultural
crops.<sup><a href="end.html">11</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ozone is produced each day, rising with the
amount of sunlight and falling to low levels at night.  There
is little if any sustained accumulation from one day to the next,
although ozone can travel as far as 100 miles from its source.
Heat and light being necessary for ozone reaction, the levels
produced follow seasonal patterns; the worst periods occurring
in the spring and summer. The amount of ozone produced results
from the production of the ozone-related emissions, atmospheric
conditions and natural background levels of VOCs.  Population
density, ozone concentration and ozone movement determine the
extent to which ozone production is a health problem. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The ozone creation problem is inherently local,
with wide differences across cities. Chilton and Boemer point
out: </FONT>
<P><blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ozone's real-world chemistry is even more dynamic
than this, however - VOC-NOx ratios can change throughout a single
day.  Ratios also vary by metropolitan area and can differ within
portions of an individual city.  Further, the relative amounts
of VOCs and NOx in the air are linked to the location and size
of their sources and the movement of air masses.  VOCs originate
most from vehicle emissions, chemical and petroleum refining companies,
industrial solvents and natural vegetation.<sup><a href="end.html">12</a></sup>  </FONT>
</blockquote><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Continuing with their discussion, Chilton and
Boemer indicate that trees and other vegetation are significant
sources of background VOCs, and, of course, urban vegetation varies
significantly across metropolitan areas.  Indeed, the National
Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Science estimates
that background levels of ozone are of &quot;comparable magnitude&quot;
to man-made VOC emissions and that complete elimination of man-made
sources could leave enough VOC sources to produce smog.
<sup><a href="end.html">13</a></sup>  Finally,
the NRC indicates that solutions to local ozone problems must
be custom-tailored to solve local problems.<sup><a href="end.html">14</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The variation in ozone levels and conditions
across cities can be seen in other ways.  Since passage of the
CAA, ozone levels have changed dramatically in a number of cities.
 Jones and Adler indicate that it &quot;is difficult to identify
a significant air pollution problem outside California.&quot;
<sup><a href="end.html">15</a></sup>
 From 1992 to 1994, the reduction in ozone above allowable levels
for the rest of the nation fell by 57 percent.  For California,
the reduction was 27 percent.  From 1988 to 1990, the years reflected
in the CAA mandate, the nonattainment regions totaled 85, with
40 marginal.  Using 1992-94 data, the total was 18 with 12 marginal.
<sup><a href="end.html">16</a></sup>
 Even so, the 1988-90 data continue to define the problem, and
the various control regions, even those that are cleaner, must
follow the CAA prescription.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The 1990 Clean Air Amendments (CAA) defined
the nonattainment problem based on 1988-1990 emissions data. 
By that measure, some 96 urban areas were designated to be in
ozone nonattainment categories that ranged from moderate to serious,
severe and extreme.<sup><a href="end.html">17</a></sup>  
Excluding the moderate category leaves 22
cities (shown in Figure 1) with the most difficult statute-based
ozone standards to meet.  In addition, some 13 metropolitan areas
(including some of the 22 above) exceeded NAAQS for carbon monoxide,
again using 1988-1990 data.<BR>

<hr>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To address the nonattainment and other vehicle
emissions problems, the CAA set tighter emission standards for
the national auto fleet, to be fully achieved by the 1996 model
year.<sup><a href="end.html">18</a></sup> 
The standard for exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons was
cut from the previous standard of 0.41 grams per mile (gpm) to
0.25 gpm and the standard for nitrogen oxides, from 1.0 gpm to
0.4 gpm.  Emission limits for carbon monoxide remained at 3.4
gpm.<sup><a href="end.html">19</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Breaking with the national scheme, the statute
set stricter hydrocarbon emission standards for a California pilot
program (0.125 gpm) - in effect establishing two standards to
be met by auto producers.<sup><a href="end.html">20</a></sup>
  Along with defining specific metropolitan
and California attainment challenges, the statute took one more
step toward decentralized control by establishing a northeastern
state ozone control region required to reach beyond the national
baseline standards.  In addition, the 1990 law ordered auto firms
to provide cleaner, if not zero, emission automobiles, and mandated
the sale of reformulated, cleaner-burning gasoline.  The CAA also
addressed truck and other vehicle emissions and required EPA to
focus on emissions from boats, farm equipment, lawn mowers, and
construction machinery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">While forcing attention on alternative fuels,
but not requiring their use, the 1990 CAA ordered cleaner-burning
gasoline to be marketed in cities that failed to meet NAAQS for

carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone.<sup><a href="end.html">21</a></sup>
   Starting in 1992, 39 nonattainment
areas were required, during part of the year, to use oxygenated
fuels, that blend oxygenated compounds with gasoline.  The intent
here was to reduce hydrocarbon and CO emissions which are a weaker
but still significant smog precursors.<sup><a href="end.html">22</a></sup>
  Reformulated (cleaner-burning)
gasoline, a distinct gasoline product not to be confused with
oxygenated gasoline, adds yet one more dimension to the clean
air arsenal. Mandated for the country's nine worst ozone areas
starting in 1995, a two-phase program calls for a 15 percent reduction
in volatile organic compounds beginning in 1995, and a 25 percent
reduction beginning in 2000.<sup><a href="end.html">23</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Under the CAA, ozone nonattainment areas are
to develop state implementation plans (SIPs) to achieve 15 percent
ozone reductions in areas classified as moderate, serious, severe
and extreme ozone  nonattainment areas.  The statute requires
a Clean Fuel Fleet program for operators of 10 or more centrally
refueled vehicles in these areas.<sup><a href="end.html">24</a></sup>
  However, the law does not mandate
the use of any particular fuel but simply requires that California
emission standards be met.<sup><a href="end.html">25</a></sup>
  Beginning in 1996, the nonattainment
areas are required to show an additional three percent reduction
each year until the attainment goal is achieved.  Failure to accomplish
these goals can lead to losses of federal transportation funds
and stiff emissions offset requirements from existing polluters
when new stationary sources seek approval.<sup><a href="end.html">26</a></sup>
  </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Ozone Transport Region</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Air pollution is not a national problem in
the sense that a well-specified set of pollutants is uniformly
affecting every citizen across all 50 states.  Air pollution is
a decidedly local and regional problem.  Recognizing this, the
CAA sets national baseline standards that must be achieved throughout
the nation, but then sets different standards for California,
22 urban areas, and 12 northeastern states.  Reaching from northern
Virginia, including the District of Columbia, and extending to
Maine, these 12 states form the Ozone Transport Region.
<sup><a href="end.html">27</a></sup>  Cooperation
across part of this region developed in 1967, when nine of the
12 states formed the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management, which continues to operate.<sup>
<a href="end.html">28</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA effectively establishes for the 12-state
region an environmental cartel managed by the Ozone Transport
Commission.  The Commission consists of state governors, the EPA
Administrator, EPA regional administrators, and state air pollution
control officers.  Like all cartels, gaining agreement among diverse
groups is not always easy.  The Commission is charged with the
difficult task of determining a <I>uniform</I> strategy for dealing
with ozone pollution in the 12-state region.  By statute, the
Commission may select to meet its goals by adopting California
standards and California vehicles or by adopting some other clean
fuel strategy - but the Commission may not settle on a technology
that requires the auto industry to produce a third vehicle type
for the U.S. market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In 1994, the Commission attempted to require
the use of California low emission vehicles (LEVs) as a major
component of its ozone reduction scheme.  The LEVs would have
been electric vehicles.  However, no agreement could be reached
across the 12 states, and the U.S. auto industry filed suit in
those states that had already adopted the LEV rule, arguing that
an LEV for the northeast would be a third car.
<sup><a href="end.html">29</a>
</sup>  In brief, the
argument turned on the notion that because of differences in climate,
requiring colder starts and requirements for energy-using heaters,
a northeastern LEV would be different from a California LEV.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The industry is seeking to persuade the Commission
to adopt a cleaner-fuel approach and has committed itself to provide
a National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEVs) that would satisfy the
ozone reduction requirements of the Northeast Ozone Transport
Region.<sup><a href="end.html">30</a></sup>
  This salvo by the auto industry advanced the prospects
for some AFVs in the large northeastern market, but practically
eliminated the prospects for electric cars in that region.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Energy Policy Act of 1992</FONT></B></CENTER><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Energy security, a motivating factor behind
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), is a second force pushing
for alternative fuel vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">31</a></sup>
  EPACT, passed in the wake of the
1990-91 Gulf War, is a prime example of crisis-borne legislation.
 Since 1951, petroleum supply lines from the Gulf have been disrupted
13 times, with the largest supply shortfall occurring during the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August-October 1990.
<sup><a href="end.html">32</a>
</sup>  In each case,
the U.S. economy was seriously affected.  After declaring an energy
crisis at hand the Congress responded by passing legislation that
sought to buffer the economy from future oil shocks.  The Gulf
region now provides about 50 percent of U.S.-consumed crude oil,
a share that is predicted to rise to 60 percent over the next
10 years.<sup><a href="end.html">33</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As described by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), EPACT &quot;was enacted to stimulate the research, development,
and accelerated introduction of technologies that can potentially
shift the focus of national energy demand away from imported oil
and toward renewable or domestically produced energy sources.&quot;
<sup><a href="end.html">34</a></sup>
 EPACT requires DOE to promote alternative fuels that reduce consumption
of gasoline and diesel fuel and to determine the feasibility of
meeting EPACT requirements of replacing 10 percent of all petroleum-based
motor fuels by the year 2000 and 30 percent by 2010.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, EPACT was not born an orphan.  Its
legislative parents were the Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988
and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  These were then strengthened
by executive orders issued in 1991 by President Bush and in 1993
by President Clinton.<sup><a href="end.html">35</a></sup>  Both executive orders accelerated the purchase
of alternative fuel vehicles for the federal government's vehicle
fleet.  President Clinton's order called for 1993, 1994 and 1995
purchases of 7,500, 11,250 and 15,000 AFVs, respectively.
<sup><a href="end.html">36</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The definition of alternative fuels turns on
the effort to reduce reliance on imported petroleum products.
 These include methanol, ethanol, mixtures containing 85 percent
or more by volume of alcohols with gasoline, natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal-derived fuels, electricity and anything
else that is clearly not petroleum.  Reformulated gasoline and
innovative fuels such as mixtures of water and petroleum-based
naptha, that may be cleaner than the fuels just mentioned, do
not receive EPACT's blessing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT's goals for replacing gasoline are ambitious
but currently unattainable.<sup><a href="end.html">37</a>
</sup>  In 1993, the total number of vehicles
that were part of a public or private fleet, was approximately
13.5 million - less than 10 percent of the 190 million vehicles
on the road. Among the 13.5 million fleet vehicles, only 550,000
were in the federal fleet, where EPACT has the greatest leverage.
 Thus to accomplish EPACT's goal, the private fleet must be affected
more significantly.  In 1994, DOE estimated that all of EPACT's
efforts would lead to a reduction of 400,000 barrels of gasoline
per day consumed in the year 2010, about five percent of the total
but nowhere near the 30 percent targeted by EPACT.  Speaking to
the fundamental energy security goal and neglecting the definition
of alternative fuels, the U.S. General Accounting Office indicates
that eight percent of the total gasoline consumed can be reduced
through the use of nonpetroleum-based oxygenates in gasoline.
<sup><a href="end.html">38</a></sup>
 In addition, the 4.3 cents fuel tax added by the 1993 Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act raised the already high hurdles to be
jumped by producers of AFVs and fuels, since the uniform increase
across fuels yields a disproportionate increase in the price of
some alternative fuels.  For example, a 4.3 cents per gallon increase
for CNG, which sells at approximately 90 cents a gasoline equivalent
gallon, is a distinctly larger increase in price than 4.3 cents
on gasoline that sells for $1.15 gallon. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">CAFE Standards: A Companion to EPACT</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT's energy security goal is shared by the
1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which established corporate
average fuel economy standards (CAFE) for the U.S. passenger car
fleet beginning in 1978.<sup><a href="end.html">39</a>
</sup>  By statute, firms providing vehicles
to the U.S. fleet must meet an average CAFE for their new car
fleets that accounts for the mix of models produced and sold in
a given year.  A firm that fails to achieve the standard is fined
$50 per mile per gallon per car produced.  Firms may earn credits
in years when they exceed the standard that can be applied to
penalty years.  The CAFE standard has been raised over the years
and is now set at 27.5 mpg for model years 1985 and beyond.  CAFE's
goal relates directly to reducing the importation of crude oil
and petroleum products. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">CAFE's history is controversial.  Auto producers
struggled to meet the rising standard.  For instance, at times
the declining relative price of gasoline made larger and heavier
cars more attractive to consumers; yet to meet CAFE standards,
the auto producers made smaller cars not wanted by dealers or
consumers.  CAFE also had the effect of encouraging foreign producers,
which typically provided smaller, more fuel efficient cars, to
increase the average size of the cars they sold in the United
States.  Thus while domestic producers reduced the sizes of their
standard vehicles, foreign producers scaled up, resulting in an
average vehicle sold in America that was smaller, lighter, and
therefore less crashworthy.  At the margin, fuel economy is substituted
for passenger safety.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The fatality effect of CAFE was estimated by
Crandall and Graham for the 1989 fleet.<sup><a href="end.html">40</a></sup>
  Their analysis shows
that CAFE is associated with 2,200 to 3,900 excess occupant fatalities
per year.  Crandall and Graham also estimated the number of excess
serious injuries triggered by the lighter cars derived from CAFE,
finding 11,000 to 19,500 additional serious injuries in 1989.
 If a value of $1 million is assigned to each life lost and $20,000
is assigned to each serious injury (the values used by Crandall
and Graham), CAFE's adverse safety cost carries a price tag of
approximately $1.9 to $3.4 billion over the life of a given model-year
car.  Put simply, the avoidance of imported oil carries a high
price.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Since EPACT and CAFE share the same goal, it
seems logical to consider the relative merits of substituting
AFVs for CAFE.  In fact, auto producers receive a credit against
their CAFE obligation for each AFV they produce and sell.  Instead
of raising CAFE to higher levels and generating more excess fatalities
and injuries, CAFE could be eliminated.  Efforts made by auto
producers to achieve the current CAFE or even higher future standards
could be diverted to the design and production of AFVs, which
have a safety record that is superior to that of the national
fleet.<sup><a href="end.html">41</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Infrastructure Problem</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Those charged with promoting AFVs recognized
immediately that any significant move to fuels other than gasoline
requires a new fuel distribution system.  DOE's program, like
that in the CAA, first focuses on fleet operators where centralized
refueling and maintenance is cheaper.  The program combines education,
voluntary commitments from alternative fuel suppliers to build
distribution facilities, and requirements for alternative fuel
providers and other federal and state fleet operators to expand
the number of AFVs.  The Department of Energy's March 27, 1996,
announcement of purchase requirements to be met by alternative
fuel providers spells out the fleet requirements.
<sup><a href="end.html">42</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Referring to EPACT, the rules mandate purchase
of AFVs by state and local governments, fuel providers, and related
petroleum and chemical companies.  Some 10 percent of newly purchased
light duty vehicles for the affected fleets must be AFVs for model
year 1997.  The share rises in subsequent years, reaching 75 percent
for model year 2001 and thereafter.  To encourage accelerated
progress toward the ultimate goal, the rules include a system
of tradable credits that arise when a purchaser goes beyond the
minimum number required in a given model year.  These credits
can be applied in subsequent years to fill out a purchase shortfall,
or they can be sold to another fleet owner who fails to meet requirements.
  The DOE AFV initiatives also include a Clean Cities program
that promotes greater use of clean-fuel buses, a push for tax
incentives, state grants, and strategic efforts to locate the
placement of mandated federal AFVs.<sup><a href="end.html">43</a></sup> 
 Close to 50 cities have joined
the Clean Cities effort.  DOE's overall goal is to expand the
nation's AFV fleet from 421,000 vehicles in 1995 to almost 2.5
million by 2010.  Funding for the DOE effort has expanded from
$7 million in FY 1993 to $30 million in FY 1995, but funding for
future budgets is in serious doubt.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among alternative fuels, compressed natural
gas (CNG) and electricity are the most ubiquitous.  These two
energy sources are supplied to nearly every home, business and
industry throughout the country.  The electricity available at
a home or business is ready to be used for charging an automobile
battery.  However, the natural gas delivered to a home or business
is at a much lower pressure than required for fueling a vehicle.
An investment of $500,000 or more in a compressor and related
equipment is required before a filling station can become a full-service
natural gas dispenser.  A home compressor unit requires an investment
of $5,000.  Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) - commonly known as propane
- is also widely available, with many refueling facilities located
near commercial users.  However, LPG does not compare with the
wide potential distribution of CNG, since natural gas is piped
to homes, industries and commercial establishments throughout
the United States.  Ethanol, which is typically produced from
corn, can be produced practically anywhere in America, blended
with gasoline and distributed across large regions.  Finally,
methanol, which is generally produced from natural gas, can be
made widely available.  According to DOE, there were 4,587 AFV
refueling stations in the nation's metropolitan areas in 1995,
a substantial increase from 1,398 in 1992.
<sup><a href="end.html">44</a>
</sup>  Of these, CNG had
1,078 stations, with locations in all states except Alaska, Maine,
and Mississippi.  In 1996, Maine is the last remaining state without
a CNG station.  Liquefied petroleum gas was available in 3,385
locations, with refueling stations lacking only in the District
of Columbia.  Blends of methanol and ethanol had 88 and 36 stations
respectively, but could be supplied from practically any filling
station.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a country with more than 200,000 filling
stations, 4,587 alternative fuel stations looks rather pale, but
every state now has at least some refueling capability; some major
cities have a score.<sup><a href="end.html">45</a>
</sup>  In November 1995, <I>USA Today</I> reported
that four additional compressed natural gas stations were opening
each week.<sup><a href="end.html">46</a>
</sup>  As might be expected, concentration by state is associated
with the relative abundance of the fuel type.  California shows
a relatively large number of compressed natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas stations, as does Texas and other gas-producing
states.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When assessing availability, it is important
to focus on the fleets being targeted.  In the early stages of
entry, AFVs must be concentrated in locations with refueling capability.
 In some cases, these will be for fleets of trucks and light vehicles
that operate exclusively in particular metropolitan areas or regions.
 In other cases, the fleets may be a city bus system or vehicles
that support a major airport operation.  As fleets grow, and as
demand increases, refueling will grow simultaneously.  However,
in the early stages of market development the chicken and the
egg puzzle will always plague the supporting industry.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Just how large is the U.S. alternative fuel
fleet and what are its future prospects?  At the time of a DOE
1996 survey, there were some 421,000 AFVs in the U.S. fleet.
<sup><a href="end.html">47</a></sup> 
The 279,000 vehicles fueled by LPG account for the lion's share
of the total. With 84,000 vehicles, CNG stands in second place,
and vehicles using ethanol and methanol rank third and fourth,
with approximately 32,000 and 22,000 vehicles respectively.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">According to DOE, the gains experienced by
each vehicle type since 1992 show LPG vehicles have experienced
only small growth.<sup><a href="end.html">48</a></sup>
  Both methanol- and CNG-powered vehicles show
substantial growth, with CNG showing the more dramatic year-over-year
increases since 1993. However, there are expectations for the
1996 sale of ethanol-fueled vehicles to rise significantly, largely
due to General Motors' offering a bi-fueled pickup truck.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The composition of the AFV fleet is dominated
by the private sector, which owns some 342,000 of the total.
<sup><a href="end.html">49</a></sup> 
Most of the AFVs in the private fleet, some 265,000 vehicles,
are LPG-fueled vehicles.  CNG, with 38,000 vehicles, stands in
second place.  In 1996, state and local governments operated 42,000
AFVs.  CNG, fueling some 22,000 of these, was the dominant fuel
type in that fleet.  Of the total, heavy duty vehicles such as
buses accounted for the major share. Even with purchases of AFVs
for the federal fleet stimulated by presidential executive orders,
the numbers in the federal fleet are still rather small. According
to DOE's 1996 survey, there are 36,571 AFVs in the federal fleet,
with CNG vehicles accounting for 23,744 of that number.  Nonetheless,
growth has been impressive; there were just 3,360 AFVs in the
federal fleet in 1992.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">According to DOE, the propane-fueled fleet
component is the oldest and is the least likely to expand markedly.
 The agency predicts CNG to be the growth component of the AFV
fleet, partly due to price and low emissions.  This is in spite
of the lack of refueling infrastructure and the challenges presented
by the requirement for larger on-board fuel tanks.
<sup><a href="end.html">50</a>
</sup>  The methanol/gasoline
blend AFVs are primarily in California, and many are urban buses.
 Government purchases of additional blended-fuel vehicles should
increase the number by 10,000 units in 1996.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">State Regulatory Hurdles</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Thus far, the entry of AFV technology has occurred
despite old-style public utility regulation that affects the pricing
and distribution of natural gas.  The identical problem would
face electricity providers if electric cars became a significant
competing technology.  The central issue relates to the regulation
of prices charged by local distribution companies, which are set
by state public utility commissions.  Traditionally viewed as
a monopolist, the natural gas distributor usually had an exclusive
area franchise in which it operated.  There was no direct competition
from other providers in the sale of the product to typical residential
and commercial customers, although large users could contract
with gas marketers and have their gas shipped from distant points.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Public utility commissions engage in rate-of-return
regulation when setting prices.  Using a standard, but complicated,
approach, the regulatory body identifies an appropriate rate base,
determines what is to be included, and approves a pricing scheme
that yields some predicted rate of return to the gas distributor.
 Gas distributors and regulators engage in periodic struggles
when prices are to be altered.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The AFV market is different in significant
ways from the market for residential, commercial and industrial
gas.  Unlike the market for home-heating and industrial fuels,
CNG will compete head-to-head with gasoline and all other fuels
at the pump.  Of course, natural gas competes with electricity
in its monopoly market, but that competition ends when a customer
settles on a particular boiler or furnace technology. Competition
at the filling station is continuous, particularly for bi-fueled
vehicles, and the market turnover of automobiles occurs more frequently
than the turnover of home furnaces and industrial machinery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The central problem here relates to incentives
for natural gas providers to assume a new market risk.  With traditional
rate regulation, there is no risk premium paid for the development
of a new market.  A conceptual solution to the problem lies in
separating the assets that serve the AFV market and allowing gas
providers complete freedom in setting price.  Alternately, gas
providers can be allowed to establish separate firms dedicated
to the AFV market.  These firms would buy natural gas from pipelines
or producers, paying the market price.  Then, they would sell
the gas to the AFV market at prices determined by market competition.
 Old-fashioned economic regulation applied traditionally to natural
gas providers will not work in the AFV market.  For the new technology
to enter, regulatory reform will be necessary.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are distinct regional differences in
the ozone problem and differences in how people in various regions
are addressing the problem.  There are significant differences
in the availability of AFV fuels across regions as well as the
likely concentration of AFVs that could ultimately form viable
markets.<sup><a href="end.html">51</a></sup>  Given the differences in the air quality gap to be closed
and the regional options for closing it, logic suggests that the
instruments of control should be decentralized.  The success of
CAA and EPACT relies on actions to be taken by cities, states
and regions.  With NAAQS as a baseline, California standards higher
than the baseline, and with promises of cleaner fuel autos, logic
further suggests that city, state and regional control groups
should be given complete flexibility in determining incentive-based
rules for inducing technological change.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Yet this leaves a number of questions unanswered,
which will be addressed in following sections:  How can regions
that seek cleaner air make their desires known in the market place?
 After all, markets for air quality are few and far between. 
Should communities and regions consider modifying fuel taxes to
make cleaner-burning fuels more attractive?  Should subsidies
be provided to investors who build clean fuel filling stations?
 Or should consumers be given incentives to purchase cleaner cars
and fuels?  How would these incentives be calculated?  And where
might the zone of control be located?</FONT>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">III.  ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION
OF CLEANER AIR</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Air quality is a classic case of economic externalities
and the tragedy of the commons:  no one owns it, so no one wants
to pay to keep it clean.  Finding reliable incentives that encourage
people to treat air quality with owner-like concern is the crux
of the environmental challenge.  Air quality is a valuable asset,
but its price is zero.  People who want more clean air logically
feel more should be provided, without paying for it.  Those who
use air quality in manufacturing or in transportation tend to
think in terms of rules and regulation instead of having to confront
a monthly bill that accounts for their environmental use.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Were it not for transaction costs, solving
the problem would be simple.<sup><a href="end.html">52</a></sup>
  Property rights to defined elements
of the atmosphere could be placed in the hands of owners, be they
environmental organizations or private entrepreneurs.  These owners
would predictably recognize the value of alternative uses and
manage their asset to maximize its value.  Lovers of cleaner air
and people who wish to produce goods and services would compete
for use of the valuable rights.  In theory, the market process
would yield an effective and efficient outcome.  Taking another
theoretical approach, and assuming information and transaction
cost are negligible, wise politicians seeking to serve the public
interest could calculate taxes and fees to be imposed on individuals
who use the scarce atmosphere.<sup><a href="end.html">53</a></sup>
  Following this prescription, campers
who build fires and drivers of automobiles would receive bills
that reflect the cost they impose when consuming the environment.
 But, alas, the costs of such approaches are high.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Were it not for transaction costs, we could
rely on common law rules that endow environmental rights to all
property owners and offer protection when those rights are violated
against the owners' will.<sup><a href="end.html">54</a></sup>
  But while common law works well for
pollutants with a known, and readily controllable, source, the
rule of law faces severe challenges when the problem has to do
with millions of small emission sources that collectively produce
unwanted smog.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Assuming transaction costs are negligible,
we can imagine a community that sets a continually monitored baseline
for air quality.  The community could reward activities that improve
baseline conditions and penalize actions that tend to undermine
it.  The community could provide a scheme of subsidies and taxes
that affect the decisions of ordinary people, whether they be
environmentalists or not.  As explained more fully below, both
of these fiscal instruments are widely used in the United States.
 In recent years, countries across Europe have begun to base fuel
taxes on fuel emission characteristics.  For example, Germany,
Italy, Sweden and Great Britain have reduced fuel taxes for natural
gas vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">55</a></sup>
  Ireland, Belgium and Italy have no excise taxes
on natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and the Netherlands revised
its tax structure to eliminate penalties previously placed on
gaseous fuels.  The application of lower relative taxes on LPG
makes that fuel more attractive, from a price standpoint, than
gasoline or diesel in Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the
Czech Republic.<sup><a href="end.html">56</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another approach to reducing emissions would
be for a community to organize a market for emission rights, where
those who find ways to reduce emissions below the baseline could
sell the rights to others who face higher control costs.  All
along, air quality would improve, and a primitive but important
set of property rights would emerge.  Emission permit markets
currently exist nationally for sulfur dioxide emission allowances.
 Markets for emission reduction credits are established in regions
throughout California, across several northeastern states, and
in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Air Management Association.
<sup><a href="end.html">57</a></sup>   The
City of Chicago has a burgeoning market underway, and the State
of Texas has approved a state emissions reductions credit market.
<sup><a href="end.html">58</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The U.S.'s struggle to improve air quality
has reached a point where the gains from employing economic incentives,
like a permit market or emission fees and subsidies, are large
enough to cover some meaningful transaction costs.  A plethora
of special taxes, subsidies and other incentive programs are in
place in many states, and the federal government has modulated
fuel taxes to favor or penalize certain fuels.  The rich variety
of state, local and regional programs illustrates the range of
experiments that can take place when we recognize that air pollution
problems are almost always local and regional in nature.  In effect,
states and cities compete for population and economic activities,
both of which are highly mobile.  Those areas that impose burdensome
rules will be punished when people and prospective industrialists
vote with their feet; regions that find lower cost ways to achieve
air quality goals will be rewarded.  The competition among regions
thus leads to many different mixes in taxes, subsidies and permit
markets as each area seeks the most effective and efficient way
to produce clean air.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal Incentive Programs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Actions taken by the federal government to
improve air quality and affect the expansion of the AFV fleet
are just as pervasive as those found at the state and local level.
 There are taxes, subsidies, permit markets and a heavy dose of
mandates.  When considered together, the federal and state programs
seem to reveal a crude effort to encourage the use of cleaner
fuels and cleaner-fuel vehicles.  But unlike local and state governments,
the federal programs offer only a uniform approach that does not
always fit with the various air quality goals sought by communities
facing distinctly different challenges.  In fact, current federal
fuel taxes are not truly based on emissions goals.  Some fuel
types are penalized heavily, relative to others, and programs
based primarily on the goal of providing cleaner air are not particularly
effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The political and economic importance of clean
air and energy security has spawned a wide variety of federal
initiatives designed to promote the purchase and use of AFVs.
 Tax credits and deductions are offered for the purchase of AFVs
and certain fuels.  Federal tax law also provides subsidies in
the form of differential excise taxes for those who purchase alternative
fuels.  Income tax deductions are provided under the EPACT for
the incremental costs of engine modification, fuel storage and
delivery systems, and emission control systems (retrofit).  Deductions
are also allowed for refueling facility expenditures.  The following
limits are placed on these deductions:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Up to $2,000 for vehicles that weigh less
than 10,000 pounds;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$10,000 for vehicles that weigh between
10,000 and 26,000 pounds;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$50,000 for trucks and vans over 26,000
pounds and for buses with seating capacity for 20 or more adults;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$100,000 for AFV refueling facilities;
and,</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">For flexible-fuel vehicles, only the incremental
costs of qualified items can be deducted.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT also provides for a 10 percent tax credit
for purchases of electric vehicles, up to a maximum of $4,000
- a credit scheduled to fall by 25 percent in 2002, by one-half
in 2003 and by 75 percent in 2004.<sup><a href="end.html">59</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, also receive
favorable treatment from the federal government.  For example,
the tax code provides income tax credits of 60 cents per gallon
for alcohol content in fuel when used as either a mixture (at
least 10 percent alcohol) or as a straight fuel.  Ethanol producers
are provided a tax credit of 10 cents for each gallon of fuel,
up to 15 million gallons per year, that is sold to buyers who
use it in fuel mixtures or to retail purchasers.  These credits
do not apply to alcohol produced from petroleum, natural gas or
coal (i.e., methanol).  Under current law, these credits are to
expire on January 1, 2001.  The federal tax code also provides
a tax credit of $3.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent for domestic
production of oil, gas and synthetic fuels derived from nonconventional
sources.<sup><a href="end.html">60</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Federal highway motor fuel taxes differ for
all major conventional and alternative fuels.  The current rate
on gasoline is 18.4 cents per gallon.  The rate for diesel fuel
is 24.4 cents per gallon.  All but 6.9 cents of these taxes is
allocated to the highway trust fund, with the balance earmarked
for deficit reduction and cleanup of underground storage tanks.
Liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol (from
natural gas) and 10 percent ethanol fuels are taxed, respectively,
at 18.3 cents, 18.4 cents, 11.4 cents and 13 cents respectively,
which is almost in reverse order of their clean emission characteristics.
However, CNG, which is one of the cleanest burning fuels, is taxed
at the equivalent of 5.6 cents per gallon of gasoline.  Table
1 provides a more complete list of federal motor fuel taxes in
both gallon and gasoline equivalent terms.</FONT>

</TABLE>
<P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">By making some major assumptions, we can estimate
the consequences of the net tax or subsidy, relative to gasoline,
the federal government provides for the purchase of AFVs and for
the use of alternative fuels.  Assume that the income tax credit
for the purchase of alcohol fuels amounts to six cents per gallon
for 10 percent ethanol blends. Applying this assumption, the first
column of Table 2 shows the approximate effective federal motor
fuel excise rates for the BTU equivalent of gasoline for alternative
fuels after subtracting the alcohol tax credit.  Assuming further
that each vehicle is operated for 120,000 miles (i.e., 10 years
at 12,000 miles per year) and that each vehicle gets 28 miles
per gallon for the BTU equivalent of one gallon of gasoline, the
second column of the table shows the net excise taxes paid by
the vehicle operator.<sup><a href="end.html">61</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As noted earlier, purchasers of alternative
fuel passenger cars are allowed a tax deduction of $2,000.  If
we assume that automobile buyers are in a 28 percent federal marginal
tax bracket, this deduction reduces the buyer's taxes by $560.
 Electric vehicle buyers are allowed a $4,000 tax credit.  This,
of course, reduces an electric car buyer's taxes by $4,000, regardless
of marginal tax rates.  Using the noted assumptions, the last
column of the table shows the relative advantage given by the
combination of fuel taxes, income tax deductions and credits relative
to gasoline-fueled vehicles.  As indicated, the net value of the
tax reductions is largest for electric vehicles.  Ethanol is some
distance away in second place.  And CNG comes in third.  The value
of the tax reductions for the other fuels is probably too small
to make much difference in consumer behavior.</FONT>

have not emerged as a competing technology,  and  ethanol  production

<FONT FACE="Arial">price for electric vehicles exceeding $30,000
and with battery replacement costs running close to half that
amount, the lack of market penetration for electric vehicles is
surely understandable.  As to ethanol, the high demand for corn
has driven up its price, making alcohol production a less attractive
proposition.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to tax incentives for purchasers
of AFVs and alternative fuels, several federal agencies manage
a wide variety of programs that provide grants and subsidies to
states, localities and consumers for the development and implementation
of alternative fuel programs.  For example, EPACT authorizes $10
million per year for financial assistance to state and local AFV
programs. EPACT also allows manufacturers of AFVs to receive credits
that can be applied to the CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for conventional
motor vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Through its Urban Consortium Energy Task Force,
the DOE provides funds for energy technology and management programs
in cities and counties.  DOE uses oil overcharge money derived
from prices charged by oil companies during the 1970s' oil embargoes
to fund state energy efficiency programs.  Along with Ford, General
Motors, Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute, the
Department of Transportation (DOT) funds the U.S. Advanced Battery
Consortium, which conducts extensive research on electric vehicles
(EVs).  Under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the DOT provides funds for state transportation
programs and projects that improve air quality.  ISTEA authorizes
the use of federal funds for the conversion and purchase of centrally-fueled
AFVs and for on-site fueling facilities for publicly-owned fleets.
The National Air and Space Administration and DOT also provide
support for AFV research from their research budgets.

Laws and Incentives</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Interest in AFVs appears to be universal among
states.  As of November 1994, all fifty states and the District
of Columbia had enacted statutes, written regulations or issued
executive orders that in some way facilitate the use of alternative
fuels in motor vehicles.  These measures range from very minor
and relatively passive measures to complicated and detailed mandates,
tax credits, tax deductions, grants and other measures supporting
the acquisition of AFVs and stimulation of AFV technologies.
<sup><a href="end.html">63</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">California illustrates the range of these actions.
 The state has a comprehensive set of subsidies and mandates contained
in at least 15 statutes related to the use of vehicles that produce
lower emissions than conventional gasoline powered vehicles. 
One such statute requires the state to purchase 25 percent AFVs
as it replaces the state fleet.  Another statute allows a 55 percent
tax credit, up to $1,000 per passenger vehicle and up to $3,500
for heavier vehicles, for those who purchase low emission vehicles
or retrofit conventional vehicles.  California also sets an excise
tax on fuels with 85 percent ethanol or methanol that is one-half
the rate charged on gasoline.  For operators of flexible-fuel
vehicles in the air quality district, the Sacramento Metropolitan
Air Quality Management District annually offers $500 of &quot;free&quot;
85 percent methanol fuels.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the other extreme, Indiana provides no state
funds or mandates for AFVs, but the state government offers assistance
to private firms and localities in attracting federal grants for
AFV activities.  Like Indiana, Kentucky has no incentives or mandates,
but has several small demonstration projects and has received
DOE funding for four retail CNG refueling stations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As noted in Table 1, federal motor fuel excise
taxes favor some alternative fuels over gasoline and diesel fuel.
 State taxes paint an entirely different picture.  Table 3 shows
state tax rates for gasoline, diesel and four alternative fuels.
 A number of states listed in the table provide special fuel tax
treatment for AFVs with decals purchased from the state.  The
annual decal fees range from $30 for light vehicles to $4,060
for heavy-duty trucks and buses depending on the weight and annual
mileage of the covered vehicle.  For example, Louisiana requires
a $150/year decal, which exempts operators of propane and natural
gas vehicles from fuel taxes.  Alabama requires an AFV decal for
a fee that ranges from $75 to $175 depending on vehicle weight.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">With some rather modest exceptions, state taxes
per gallon of fuel differ very little across the six fuels listed
in the table. Since federal taxes favor alternative fuels over
gasoline and diesel, and since most states tax fuels are approximately
the same by volume, the sum of state and federal excise taxes
would appear to provide implicit subsidies for alternative fuels.
Table 4 gives these sums.  However, fuel energy content, not volume,
is the more relevant unit of measurement. Table 5 shows the sum
of state and federal excise taxes based on the BTU equivalent
of one gallon of gasoline. Viewed in BTU terms, CNG receives a
relatively favorable treatment. Ethanol is treated favorably,
but the tax savings on ethanol consumption is considerably lower
than for CNG.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">*These calculations exclude decal and
fee states. Source: Computed from Tables 1 and 2 above.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">On the other hand, current state tax laws substantially
penalize the use of methanol.  Only six states (Alaska, Arkansas,
Colorado, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Vermont) tax methanol at a
lower rate than gasoline and diesel fuel.  All other states and
the District of Columbia tax methanol at a higher rate.  In most
states there is also an excise tax penalty for using propane.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The combined effect of state and federal fuel
taxes, considered in the light of emission characteristics, form
an interesting picture.  CNG and LPG are cleaner burning than
ethanol- and methanol-blends of gasoline.  The tax structure favors
CNG and ethanol and penalizes methanol and LPG.  However, the
effects of combined taxes are not as unfavorable on air quality
grounds as the federal tax system considered in isolation suggests.
 The federal tax system appears to reflect a massive political
struggle among the various fuel providers.  Apparently, ethanol
achieved a major victory; LPG did not do so well.  This outcome
tells us that the political process may not be well suited to
establish emission-based fuel taxes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">State taxes suggest the reverse of federal
programs.  Certainly the data reveals the influence of special
interests.  For instance, states that are specialized in the production
of corn favor ethanol; those that produce natural gas favor gas-based
fuels.  But overall, the state schemes come much closer to setting
taxes based on emissions than does the federal scheme.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The outcome suggests that competition matters.
 States compete for population, economic development and environmental
protection.  The national government does not face the same competition.
 The record suggests strongly that states should focus on emission-based
fuel taxes that provide incentives for all fuel producers to achieve
higher environmental standards.  The national government should
address primarily the highway user-fee component of the fuel tax,
while perhaps paying some attention to emission-based taxes that
address national environmental concerns.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Conventional wisdom and anecdotal evidence
tell us that the first automobiles on the dusty roads of America
encountered many naysayers.  Early drivers were greeted by catcalls
and &quot;Get a horse!&quot;  Availability of fuel was a problem,
and no one could imagine how the new technology might affect the
environment.  Indeed, few people cared.  Today, what can we say
about AFVs, their emission characteristics and costs?  Which of
the AFVs is in the best position to enter the market?
<sup><a href="end.html">64</a></sup>   </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Compressed Natural Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is estimated that in 1990 there were 500,000
CNG powered vehicles worldwide.  In the United States today, some
84,000 CNG vehicles ply the roads, 49 percent of which are pickups
(most of them bi-fuel vehicles).<sup><a href="end.html">65</a></sup>
  Ford offers its Crown Victoria,
Econoline van and F150/250 pickups for the CNG market.  Chrysler
sells its CNG Voyagers, Caravans, Dakota and Ram pickups, while
General Motors is reentering the market with sedans.  Meanwhile
Chrysler, Ford, Cummins, Mack Truck, Caterpillar, and Detroit
Diesel are developing natural gas engines for vehicle use. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Natural gas is a fossil fuel extracted either
from natural gas wells or from wells that produce both crude oil
and natural gas.  Because of its very low energy density, natural
gas needs to be used as compressed gas (CNG) or liquefied and
stored cryogenically (LNG).  Either method requires heavier, more
expensive storage systems than those found in conventional vehicles.
CNG vehicles can be bi-fuel (natural gas and either diesel or
gasoline) or dedicated to natural gas, which optimizes performance.
 When properly tuned, a single-fuel natural gas vehicle has superior
power and efficiency to a gasoline engine.  An engine dedicated
to natural gas can have a higher compression ratio, increasing
thermal efficiency 10-20 percent, which compensates for the heavier
tanks required for containing the compressed fuel.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are two refueling options for CNG vehicles:
 (1) Fast-fill at a compressor-equipped refueling station or (2)
at home or work, which takes several hours for a typical light
vehicle.  The fast-fill method requires a greater infrastructure
investment, as much as $500,000 for an average volume station.
<sup><a href="end.html">66</a></sup>
 As for home refueling, much of the infrastructure is in place,
because most homes are connected to a natural gas utility system.
 With a small compressor unit, which costs approximately $5,000,
CNG vehicles could be filled at home using overnight filling.
Compared to gasoline, dedicated CNG engines have longer engine
lives and lower maintenance costs due to the cleaner burn of CNG.
<sup><a href="end.html">67</a></sup>
 As to safety and health concerns, natural gas is less subject
to self-ignition than gasoline, and the release of natural gas,
which is nontoxic, does not cause a serious health hazard.
<sup><a href="end.html">68</a></sup>  The
per-mile injury rate for CNG vehicles is 37 percent lower than
for gasoline fleet vehicles and 34 percent lower than all gasoline
vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">69</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">CNG is being used in fleets across the country.
 A central refueling point makes fleet usage attractive.  For
example, the Peachtree City, Georgia, police force recently converted
its twelve patrol cars to CNG.  Schools in Tulsa, Oklahoma (120
buses), and Aurora, Colorado (53 buses), are using CNG buses.
 The cities of Milton, Florida (25 police cars, sedans and garbage
trucks), and West Vancouver, British Columbia (40 police, utility,
and administrative vehicles), are successfully  using CNG vehicles.
<sup><a href="end.html">70</a></sup>
 The American Gas Association estimates that more than 25 U.S.
school districts have converted five or more buses to CNG use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Not surprisingly, natural gas companies are
at the forefront in using natural gas vehicles.  An American Gas
Association survey in 1991 revealed that 8,827 natural gas vehicles
are part of the fleets of 82 U.S. utility companies.
<sup><a href="end.html">71</a></sup>  In order
to reduce air pollution, water clouding and fuel bills, Disneyland
converted much of their transportation system (60 boats and rafts,
one submarine, four Main Street vehicles, and 16 service vehicles)
to CNG. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">United Parcel Service implemented a CNG program
for its delivery vehicles in New York City, the District of Columbia,
Dallas, Los Angeles, Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  The firm reports
a maintenance cost drop of $1.00 per vehicle per day, a 30 percent
reduction in fuel costs and reductions in pollution (18 percent
less CO, 86 percent less nonmethane hydrocarbons, and 22 percent
less NOx).<sup><a href="end.html">72</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The U.S. Postal Service (USPS), which now has
thousands of CNG vehicles, tested seven types of alternative fuels
in their vehicles and found that CNG was the only fuel tested
that is economical, safe and viable.<sup><a href="end.html">73</a></sup>
  They incurred costs of converting
to CNG of $1,500-$2,500 per vehicle and increased vehicle weight
by 200 pounds.  USPS concluded that electric vehicles had high
maintenance, costs and limited range.  Propane (LPG) vehicles
tested were deemed unsafe and did not reduce reliance on imported
oil.  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanks required too much space.
 Methanol suffered from low fuel economy and corrosive effects
on engines.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Research on fuels for AFVs focuses primarily
on light vehicles and is generally incomplete.  Comparisons of
studies are difficult to make, since the tests reported are often
for different vehicles using different test techniques.  For these
reasons, we report a series of findings, which turn out to be
rather wide-ranging.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">On the basis of these studies, CNG turns out
to be a rather clean fuel.  Evaporative emissions from CNG are
zero since refueling and storage requires a sealed system.  Because
of more complete combustion, carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane
hydrocarbon emissions are substantially lower than for conventional
gasoline.  NOx emissions may be higher, but in dedicated engines
special combustion chambers can reduce NOx emissions.  When substituting
natural gas for diesel, particulates cease to be a problem, but
NOx surfaces again.  In one comprehensive review, the author reports
a consensus that natural gas has a 20 percent advantage over gasoline
when it comes to greenhouse emissions (GHG), and is neutral in
GHG relative to diesel.<sup><a href="end.html">74</a></sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Department of Energy has not yet completed
its final assessment of emissions for CNG vehicles.  However,
one DOE report concludes that using CNG lowers CO emissions by
six to 99 percent, a range too wide to be very instructive.  NOx
emissions range from 40 percent higher to 85 percent lower, and
hydrocarbon (HC) emmisions range from 697 percent higher to 44
percent lower for passenger cars.  However, much of the increased
HC is methane, which does not contribute to ozone.  In short,
the overall effect of CNG use would be ozone reducing.
<sup><a href="end.html">75</a></sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance study of CNG, CO emissions were 50 to 90 percent
lower than for gasoline vehicles, HC emissions were 50 to 80 percent
lower, and particulates were nearly eliminated.  NOx emissions,
which are subject to temperature and the presence of oxygen, were
shown to be as much as 80 percent higher.<sup><a href="end.html">76</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A 1990 EPA report estimates that CNG vehicles
will reduce volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), an ozone precursor,
by 36 to 47 percent in bi-fuel vehicles and 80 to 90 percent in
engines dedicated to natural gas.<sup><a href="end.html">77</a></sup>
  It is important to note the
EPA's findings, given the agency's lead role in regulating mobile
source emissions.  An American Petroleum Institute report agrees
that dedicated engines reduce VOCs 80 to 93 percent, but estimates
the bi-fuel systems will generate 75 to 86 percent less VOCs.
<sup><a href="end.html">78</a></sup>
 A study by the Gas Research Institute<sup><a href="end.html">79</a></sup>
 estimates 83 percent less
reactive organic gases, another measure of ozone precursors, and
another exhaustive report estimates that CNG use has 60 percent
lower ozone-forming potential than do gasoline vehicles.
<sup><a href="end.html">80</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A 1995 report prepared for the Natural Gas
Coalition compared emissions for nine different light vehicles
and provided some data for heavy-duty trucks and locomotives.
 Net smog-forming emissions for CNG vehicles, which accounts for
volume as well as reactivity of emissions gases, were 87 percent
less than those from gasoline engine vehicles.  Emissions of NOx
from heavy-duty vehicle engines were at levels that could not
be achieved by diesel engines.<sup><a href="end.html">81</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As with emission estimates, the estimated cost
of moving to CNG vehicles varies widely from study to study. 
A 1994 survey of AFV studies reports the overall costs of CNG
range from 74 percent to 170 percent of the cost of a gasoline-fueled
light vehicle.<sup><a href="end.html">82</a></sup>
  The DOE estimates that light vehicle conversion
costs range from $2,700 to $5,000.<sup><a href="end.html">83</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a more comprehensive study, the American
Petroleum Institute examined the incremental costs, including
private and social costs, of the adoption of CNG for three cases.
<sup><a href="end.html">84</a></sup>
 The first is a private CNG vehicle program with a public refueling
program.  The second is for centrally fueled fleets in nine cities.
 The third case involves the use of new CNG transit buses in metropolitan
areas having a population greater than one million people.  The
costs of emissions reductions were calculated at avoided costs
(the cost effectiveness of achieving the same reductions through
other means).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In all three cases, the net private benefit
of CNG vehicles is negative, and in all three cases, the net social
benefit may be positive (which accounts for air quality improvements
as well as private costs and benefits).<sup><a href="end.html">85</a></sup>
  For example, CNG use
in Los Angeles light vehicles would have a private cost ranging
from $0.01 to $0.36 per gallon equivalent, but would yield overall
social benefits as large as $0.55 or overall costs of $0.01 per
gallon.  For transit buses, the net private costs range from $0.04
to $0.50 per gallon equivalent, but the social benefit ranged
from a high of $0.35 per gallon to a loss of $.027 per gallon.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied Natural Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas
stored in liquid form at refrigerated temperature levels; it therefore
shares many of the features of CNG.  The liquid form offers an
advantage over the compressed form.  The fuel is stored at low
pressures (10 to 25 psi), which yields rapid refueling capability
and the use of smaller storage tanks.  However, with the added
bulk of insulation, LNG tanks are about twice as large as gasoline
tanks for an equivalent amount of energy.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A major disadvantage of LNG is that the refrigeration
can consume 25 percent of the energy of the natural gas being
liquefied.  This adds roughly $0.20 per gallon equivalent to the
cost of the natural gas.  There is also a potential frostbite
problem associated with the handling of LNG, but all other technological
assessments are essentially the same between LNG and CNG.  Emissions
characteristics, of course, are the same as CNG use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">LNG is in use in a substantial number of heavy-duty
truck and bus demonstration fleets, but few light-duty AFVs are
currently operating on LNG.  There is a potential use of LNG as
a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles,<sup><a href="end.html">86</a></sup>
 particularly if the federal taxes
on LNG and CNG are equalized.<sup><a href="end.html">87</a></sup>
  Since LNG is a liquid fuel, it
is taxed at about a 12 cents per gallon higher rate than CNG.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Even with the tax disadvantages, LNG has penetrated
some major markets. The Houston (Texas) Metro has announced its
commitment to convert 300 of its buses to LNG use, and Roadway
Express, operator of 3,500 long-haul moving trucks and 5,800 local
moving vans, is considering using LNG fuel in its trucks.
<sup><a href="end.html">88</a></sup>  However,
the federal tax penalty on LNG, as compared to other alternative
fuels, makes the conversion far less attractive.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied Petroleum Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) can be formed
from a mixture of gases including propane, butane and ethane.
 In the United States, LPG is primarily composed of propane, and
the terms LPG and propane are often used interchangeably.
<sup><a href="end.html">89</a></sup>  LPG
has been used as a commercial fuel for more than 60 years.  Currently,
more than 300,000 vehicles in the United States and four million
vehicles worldwide operate on LPG, although only a small percentage
(2.8 percent) of the U.S. count is used for transportation.
<sup><a href="end.html">90</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">LPG is liquefied by compressing the gas to
a pressure of more than 100 psi to reduce its volume for transportation
and storage.  This requires as much as 45 percent more tank space
than gasoline for an equivalent operating range.
<sup><a href="end.html">91</a></sup>  LPG tanks are
heavier than gasoline counterparts, but the fuel is lighter, which
yields a minimal net weight increase.
<sup><a href="end.html">92</a></sup>  Engine operating and combustion
characteristics yield cleaner starts, which increase engine life
by 50 percent or more.<sup><a href="end.html">93</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Engines can be dedicated to LPG or can be bi-fuel
(with either diesel or gasoline).  Using a dual-fuel system reduces
the efficiency of using propane and requires the complication
of having two simultaneous fuel systems.  Diesel engines can also
be converted to LPG usage, reducing the emission of particulates.
 At present, engine builders are working on dedicated LPG engines
for heavy duty use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the United States, most LPG is produced
from stripping wet gases from natural gas, and the remainder is
a by-product of oil refining.  LPG represents three percent of
natural gas and oil reserves.<sup><a href="end.html">94</a></sup>
  It is unclear if the availability
of LPG will be sufficient for widespread use as an alternative
fuel. For instance, a California Energy Commission report predicts
supply shortages, particularly in the winter months when propane
is used as a heating fuel.<sup><a href="end.html">95</a></sup>
  However, other studies show that supply
is not a constraint on LPG use in America.  U.S. refiners are
expected to increase their production of LPG due to changes in
refining processes, and the availability of imported LPG is also
projected to increase (which, of course, works against EPACT's
policy of reducing the importation of fuels).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Substituting LPG for gasoline reduces CO emissions
by as much as 23 percent, due to the fuel's lower carbon-to-hydrogen
ratio and higher thermal efficiency.  CO, HC, and NOx emissions
depend on the air-fuel ratio.  CO falls as the ratio increases,
HC falls, then increases as the ratio increases, and NOx increases,
then drops as the ratio increases.  Therefore, there is an HC/NOx
tradeoff at different air-fuel ratios.<sup><a href="end.html">96</a></sup>
  CO reductions are the
largest relative to gasoline.  EPA reports an 80 percent reduction,
making LPG attractive for use in confined spaces such as warehouses.
<sup><a href="end.html">97</a></sup>
 EPA also reports nonmethane hydrocarbon reductions for current
LPG vehicles of 41 percent.  Chang estimates a 35 percent reduction
in ozone-forming potential (OFP),<sup><a href="end.html">98</a></sup>
 but Cleanfleet reports a 68
to 71 percent OFP reduction.  Due to a relatively less expensive
storage system, LPG conversions generally cost less than CNG conversions.
 Estimates usually range from $700 to $1500.  Fuel prices are
in the same range as CNG prices.<BR>

gas is currently the least expensive and widely used raw material
for methanol production, the fuel also can be made from coal or
biomass.<sup><a href="end.html">99</a></sup>
  Methanol can be used in neat form (M100 or 100 percent
methanol), but is currently only used as a gasoline blend (M85,
or 85 percent methanol).  The fuel has a high octane rating, and
its efficiency increases with an increased compression ratio and
with an increased leaning of the air/fuel mixture, which increases
engine efficiency by approximately 10 percent relative to gasoline.
 Methanol fueled engines can produce more horsepower than their
gasoline counterparts, but the gains are offset by the necessary
heavier fuel tank.<sup><a href="end.html">100</a></sup>
  Because of its power-to-volume traits, a methanol
AFV must have an 80 percent larger tank than a gasoline vehicle
for an equivalent driving range.  Pure methanol presents a cold-start
problem that is resolved with 85 percent blends with gasoline.
 The blend with gasoline obviously reduces some of the air quality
advantages.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Methanol is highly corrosive, but corrosion
inhibitors in the fuel, particular alloys and polymers in engines,
and certain lubricants can help to overcome this problem.  The
fuel conducts electricity, is volatile, burns with an invisible
flame and has wide-ranging flammability limits.  Methanol is highly
toxic, but odorless and tasteless, which increases exposure risks.
 Other problems include accelerated cylinder wear, fuel system
durability for unaltered engine parts (due to its corrosiveness),
and the explosivity of vapor in fuel tanks at ambient temperatures.
 Adding gasoline to pure methanol to form M85 mitigates the invisible
flame and vapor explosivity problems.  Blends allow the fuel to
be identified by odor or taste, a valuable property for a toxic
substance.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As a practical matter, domestically produced
methanol is not a current contender for a major role the U.S.
AFV fleet market.  The plant capacity does not exist, and while
U.S. production facilities could be expanded at exceptionally
high costs, substantial and immediate increases in demand would
likely be satisfied from overseas, which provides little in the
way of energy security benefits.<sup><a href="end.html">101</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are no standardized test procedures for
methanol, thus it is difficult to characterize the test data.
Some research indicate methanol use will reduce CO and HC, but
NOx emissions could increase or decrease.  Depending on gasoline
blends, VOCs could decrease by as much as 80 percent and ozone
forming potential by 30 percent.  However, an American Petroleum
Institute study shows reductions in VOCs to range from zero to
75 percent and ozone reductions to average 13 percent.
<sup><a href="end.html">102</a></sup>  The findings
for NOx indicates that methanol vehicles could not meet California
standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In 1994, Chrysler offered three light vehicles
equipped for 85 percent methanol; Ford produced one.
<sup><a href="end.html">103</a></sup>  In 1995,
Chrysler reduced its offering to one vehicle while Ford continued
to make its single offering.  The corrosive nature of the fuel
creates substantial hurdles for engine manufacture and modification.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol is the most widely used alternative
fuel in the world.  Brazil, with more than four million vehicles
using ethanol, has a highly subsidized program to produce ethanol
from sugarcane.<sup><a href="end.html">104</a></sup>
  All standard gasoline-fueled vehicles can burn
ethanol/gasoline blends with little, if any, difficulty.  In 1988,
880 million gallons of ethanol were produced in the United States,
blended with gasoline and used as a motor fuel, accounting for
almost one percent of the motor fuel market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the United States, ethanol is produced from
corn and thus is dependent on the world price of grain.  Like
methanol, ethanol is an alcohol fuel that can be used as 100 percent
ethanol or as a blend with gasoline (10 percent ethanol/90percent
gasoline blend is known as gasohol).  Ethanol's corrosion properties
lie between those of gasoline and methanol.  Most vehicles, however,
can use gasohol without problems.  Ethanol burns with a luminous
flame, unlike methanol, making it easier to detect fires.  It
is less flammable than methanol, but can be explosive in tank
vapor space.  It has no known carcinogenic compounds, but ingestion
can nevertheless cause severe problems.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol blends do not provide significant improvements
in smog-forming emissions. An American Petroleum Institute study
concludes that total VOC emissions are 20 percent higher for vehicles
using ethanol blended fuel.<sup><a href="end.html">105</a></sup>
   EPA estimates an impact of 15 percent
higher VOCs in 1990 and 20 percent higher in 2000.
<sup><a href="end.html">106</a></sup>  In addition,
NOx emissions tend to be higher with gasohol than gasoline. When
ethanol is substituted for diesel, the main benefit is reductions
in particulates.  HC and CO standards can be met, but NOx emissions
may be a problem.   In 1995, efforts by EPA to require the use
of ethanol in reformulated gasoline were stopped by the U.S. Court
of Appeals (D.C.).<sup><a href="end.html">107</a></sup>
  The court chastised EPA for pushing ethanol
in a program designed to produce cleaner air when EPA itself had
admitted there were no environmental benefits and that ethanol
&quot;might make air quality worse.&quot;<sup><a href="end.html">108</a>
</sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Currently ethanol costs substantially more
to produce than gasoline.  Production costs range from $1.10-$1.65
per gallon, making wholesale costs almost double that of gasoline.
 Since a gallon of ethanol has two-thirds the energy of a gallon
of gasoline, ethanol, which wholesales for, say, $1.20 per gallon,
equates to a gasoline cost of $1.80 per gallon. Since ethanol
blends require no changes to the vehicle and distribution poses
no problems, the higher price of the fuel is the only relevant
cost.  Of course, a substantial increase in demand for ethanol
could raise other issues.  For example, reliance on gasoline for
ethanol blends reduces the national security benefits of this
alternative fuel and the associated increase in demand for corn
could, in turn, increase food prices.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Electric vehicles </FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Popular in the late 1800s, electric vehicles
(EVs) have been in use for more than a century.  Of the 4,200
vehicles sold in 1900, 38 percent were electric vehicles, 22 percent
were gasoline fueled and 40 percent were steam powered.
<sup><a href="end.html">109</a></sup>  The invention
of the electric starter in 1911 eliminated the major inconvenience
of gasoline-fueled vehicles, thus eliminating the demand for EVs.
 Since then there have been three surges in interest in EVs. 
The first, in the 1960s, was due primarily to air quality concerns.
 The second, in the 1970s, was a result of the concerns over the
U.S. dependence on imported oil.  The third began in the mid-1980s
and continues to the present.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Relying on ubiquitous standard electricity,
EVs have no refueling problems.  Since there is no energy combustion
on board, there are no tailpipe and no vehicle emissions.  But
storage of electricity in vehicle batteries raises a major constraint.
 EVs in the 1960s used tubular lead-acid batteries.  Many different
technologies have been tried since then, but potential problems
including high costs, questionable durability and the recycling
of toxic components remain.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Aside from their high purchase price, which
currently approaches $30,000, EVs are not particularly attractive
to motorists due to long recharging times, lack of heating and
air conditioning, reduced range, and limited speed and acceleration
compared to gasoline vehicles.  Existing battery technology limits
the driving range to about 100 miles between charges, and replacing
batteries that have a two-year life runs as much as $10,000.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As a result of intense R&amp;D efforts, the
performance for batteries increased 30 percent in the past decade.
 They are now expected to last 30,000 miles with deep dis-charge
cycles and longer with light use and frequent charging.  Advanced
maintenance-free designs are expected to last up to 60,000 miles.
<sup><a href="end.html">110</a></sup>
 Due to lengthy charging periods, EVs are often charged at night,
which dovetails in nicely with the excess generating capacity
of electrical utilities. But EVs are substantially heavier than
their gasoline or diesel counterparts due to the battery weight,
adding to their energy use per mile.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EV marketing efforts received a potential reversal
when the Ozone Transport Commission moved toward the new National
Low Emission Vehicle as the flagship of its ozone control efforts.
 Despite that, General Motors announced that it will offer an
EV produced by its Saturn Division in the fall of 1996.
<sup><a href="end.html">111</a></sup>  This
EV, to be marketed in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson,
will have a 70-mile range and sell in the mid-$30,000 price range.
 Chrysler is offering a $100,000 minivan conversion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The elimination of tail-pipe emissions is the
major benefit of EVs.  If the electricity is generated from nonpolluting
sources (nuclear, wind, water, solar), then there may be clear
environmental benefits. But, if power generation comes from fossil-fuel
powerplants, then pollution concentration may actually increase.
 Thus while EVs have an extreme advantage in point-of-use emissions,
they do not necessarily reduce global emissions.  For this reason,
EVs may address local nonattainment problems at the expense of
regional air quality.  For instance, a DOE paper cites one study
that estimates the changes resulting from substituting EVs for
conventional vehicles in Southern California's South Coast Air
Basin to be HC reduction of 98.9 percent; CO, by 98.7 percent;
and, NOx, by 60.9 percent.  SOx increased by 495.8 percent, and
particulates, by 570.5 percent.<sup><a href="end.html">112</a></sup>  The increases were due to emissions
from coal-burning power plants.  If the electricity had been nuclear
generated (as in the case of Chicago), then there would be no
SOx and particulates emission increases.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EVs suffer from severe cost penalties arising
from lower power and limited range.  Weight limitations impose
another restriction.  EVs are small.  An American Petroleum Institute
study by Henderson and Rusin concludes that these penalties range
from $6,700 to $7,700 per vehicle.<sup><a href="end.html">113</a>
</sup>  The study concluded that EV
life-cycle costs are from $2,000 to $5,000 more than a conventional
vehicle, which gives a total incremental cost of from $8,700 to
$12,700.  Mass production of EVs would likely bring substantial
reductions in vehicle prices.  But the prospects for their widespread
use are still rather dim.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Summary and Comparisons</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Upon completing our review of the various emission
studies described here, we returned to a 1990 General Accounting
Office (GAO) report that summarized similar findings.
<sup><a href="end.html">114</a></sup>  The GAO
summary closely parallels our findings.  Focusing on four of the
alternative fuels, the report states that CNG reduces hydrocarbons
by an estimated 40 to 90 percent and may reduce CO emissions by
50 to 90 percent.  According to the report, LPG produces 50 percent
fewer hydrocarbon emissions and may reduce CO by 25 to 80 percent.
Methanol was found to reduce ozone-forming hydrocarbons by as
much as 40 percent when blended in an 85 percent mix with gasoline.
 Ethanol had similar characteristics.  The GAO summary and our
review suggest strongly that CNG is the cleanest of the gas-based
and alcohol fuels, followed by LPG, methanol and ethanol.  Of
course electricity is the cleanest of all, if the generating source
is nonpolluting.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our assessment of AFV characteristics and costs
indicates that LPG and CNG vehicles have emerged as competitive
technologies in niche markets.  Many fleet owners are already
turning to CNG as a fuel source in order to cut transportation
costs and provide environmental benefits.  LPG is a weak second-place
contender, and its reliance on petroleum feedstocks places the
fuel at a disadvantage when assessed in terms of energy security.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Of the alcohol fuels, ethanol is clearly a
strong contender.  Its market penetration is not hampered by the
availability of refueling stations, but its supply depends on
the relative price of corn. Ethanol received the most favorable
tax and government incentive support, but even with heavy subsidies
its production has faltered in recent years.  Since ethanol is
blended with gasoline, the fuel does not provide the emission
reductions of LPG and CNG.  Methanol's corrosion and safety problems
puts it in last place in the gas and alcohol technology struggle.
 Relative to the other AFVs, electric vehicles are clearly in
an early stage of technological development.  EVs are being produced,
and significant and productive R&amp;D is underway.  With breakthroughs
in battery technologies, EVs could become a contender in the highly
specialized small commuter car market.  At present, however, we
do not see EVs as a major force in the light vehicle market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our review of AFV emission and cost characteristics
provides a basis for drawing some tentative conclusions regarding
emission reduction costs.  We emphasize the word &quot;tentative.&quot;
 As noted before, there is no single set of consistent emission
and cost studies for all AFVs.  The first approach we took illustrates
the wide variation in costs.  Here, we estimated a set of emission
reduction costs for CNG-AFVs and EVs using the Gas Research Institute
emission data on reactive organic gases and cost estimates provided
by Deborah Gordon that reflect fuel and retrofit costs alone.
<sup><a href="end.html">115</a></sup>
 These calculations show the cost of reducing one ton of ozone
precursors to be $16,194 for CNG and $91,679 to $155,233 for EVs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the interest of providing a more comprehensive
and practical basis for estimating the cost of reducing a ton
of smog-forming emissions, we took EPA data on VOCs emissions,
ranges of purchase premium values and EPA's mid-point estimate
for fuel costs for light vehicles fueled with CNG, LPG, ethanol
and methanol.  We recognize that smog production requires interaction
of NOx with VOCs but were unable to obtain comprehensive data
that showed interaction for AFVs.  We made our calculations without
assigning any dollar value to improved environmental quality.
 In brief, our calculations simply reflected the costs paid by
consumers who might purchase AFVs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our calculations relied on a number of key
items of EPA data.  These were supplemented with several critical
assumptions.  The fuel prices used in the calculations were drawn
from the EPA database for 1990. We assumed the typical vehicle
fleet has a 10-year life, so we used an undiscounted one-tenth
share of the price premium as the annual fixed charge for each
AFV.  For the analysis, we assumed the vehicles achieve an average
of 20 mpg and are driven 20,000 miles annually.  On this basis,
an average AFV would use the equivalent of 1,000 gallons of gasoline
annually.  The range of annual fuel charges and purchase price
premiums for each vehicle formed our annual incremental cost.
<sup><a href="end.html">116</a></sup>
 For example, EPA's upper estimate for the premium for CNG light
vehicles is $3,250.  Our calculations showed the annual incremental
cost for CNG including fuel costs is $265 per vehicle.  That for
blended ethanol is $960, while blended methanol vehicles carry
an annual incremental cost of $110.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We then considered a hypothetical fleet of
17,231,516 passenger cars, which happens to be size of the 1991
California fleet.  If the hypothetical fleet used conventional
gasoline, then, using EPA's baseline of 1.75 g/mile of VOCs, approximately
665,000 tons of VOCs would be emitted in one year.  If the entire
fleet were converted to CNG, there would be roughly 615,000 fewer
tons.  The annual incremental cost per ton would be $7,400.  Converting
the entire fleet to 85 percent ethanol would likely increase VOCs
emissions.  But methanol blends would reduce VOCs by approximately
435,000 tons annually at a cost of $4,300 per ton.  Unfortunately,
EPA provided no data for VOCs on LPG vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, to place AFVs in perspective with
vehicles using reformulated gasoline (RFG), we made similar calculations
for that fuel, drawing on other reports for data and assuming
the entire fleet is converted to RFG vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">117</a>
</sup>  That conversion
would remove approximately 133,000 tons of VOCs at a cost per
ton of $2,600.  Table 6 summarizes our findings.  Recall, the
1991 baseline fleet using conventional gasoline emitted 665,000
tons of VOC.  A move to 100 percent RFG vehicles would reduce
133,000 tons at the lowest price per ton of $2,600.  However,
more than 500,000 tons would remain.  Conversion to methanol blends
would reduce 435,000 tons at a price per ton of $4,300.  More
than 200,000 tons would remain.  CNG vehicles would practically
eliminate all the VOCs at a price per ton of $7,400.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We conclude this analysis by noting an underlying
issue that explains why emission reductions are so costly.  Vehicle
emissions are at a very low level, which means that a large number
of vehicles must be affected to generate annually a ton of emission
reductions.  On the basis of the EPA data we used, CNG vehicles
emit 5.7 pounds of VOCs annually.  Ethanol and methanol blends
emit 26.5 pounds, and RFG-fueled vehicles emit 61.7 pounds.  A
conventional vehicle using standard gasoline emits 77.2 pounds
of VOCs each year.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">V.  EMERGING AFV NICHE MARKETS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><br><p>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our comparison of AFVs has focused almost exclusively
on light vehicles, and for good reason:  The CAA and EPACT look
to the larger light vehicle fleet for reducing smog and improving
energy security.  For example, EPACT is limited to vehicles weighing
less than 26,000 pounds, which is the beginning weight for large
18-wheelers.  California AFV statutes are limited to vehicles
weighing less than 8,000 pounds.  Furthermore, the vast majority
of research on emissions and costs has been devoted to emerging
light vehicle technologies.  Indeed, when compared with light
vehicles, EPA emission standards for large diesel engines are
at a very rudimentary level.  As indicated by our discussion of
infrastructure, conversion costs, price premiums, vehicle choice
and continued improvement of gasoline-fueled vehicles, penetration
of the light vehicle market by AFVs faces high hurdles.  The growth
experienced by AFVs continues to be found in public and private
fleets where refueling and vehicle choice present little difficulty.
 But the capture of some significant share of the conventional
consumer market is not likely to occur in the foreseeable future.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Many of these seemingly insurmountable challenges
largely disappear when the market for heavy trucks, buses, locomotives
and off-the-road machinery is considered.  Refueling for fixed-schedule
trucks and buses can be conveniently located at terminals, and
the additional tanks required for alternative fuels adds a small
proportional increment to the vehicles' weight.  With almost two
million plying the nation's highways, annually consuming 17 billion
gallons of diesel fuel, heavy trucks present a significant market.
<sup><a href="end.html">118</a></sup>
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A large part of the heavy-duty truck market
is composed of tractor/trailor vehicles weighing more than 26,000
pounds, the limit for EPACT programs.  But there are still significant
federal and state tax incentives for purchasers of heavy-duty
AFVs.  The federal government provides an income tax deduction
of $5,000 for intermediate weight trucks and vans, and a $50,000
tax deduction for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds. Among
states, Arizona provides funds for the conversion of buses; Wisconsin
provides grants for alternative fuel trucks, vans and buses purchased
by municipalities; and, Maryland, Montana and North Dakota provide
state income tax credits to assist the purchase of vehicles weighing
more than 10,000 pounds.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Since heavy-duty vehicles are large fuel consumers,
fuel-cost savings weigh heavily in the balance when AFVs are considered.
 Indeed, in a 1994 report, Weaver and Turner concluded that converting
from diesel to natural gas could be economically justified on
fuel savings alone.<sup><a href="end.html">119</a></sup>
 In a survey of 4,000 fleet operators, 59 percent
reported use of AFVs.<sup><a href="end.html">120</a></sup>
  Of these, 40 percent burned LNG and 39
percent used CNG.  Both user-groups reported substantial fuel
cost savings.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">AFVs offer significant clean-air gains relative
to heavy-duty diesel trucks and vehicles.  In addition to producing
VOCs and nitrogen emissions, conventional diesel engines are heavy
emitters of particulates, CO and sulfur dioxide.  According to
EPA, conversion of 1991 diesel engines to CNG (or LNG) reduces
hydrocarbon emissions by 67 to 80 percent, NOx by 10 percent,
particulates by 40 to 76 percent and CO by 74 percent.
<sup><a href="end.html">121</a></sup>  Switching
to methanol virtually eliminates particulates, but may increase
CO and hydrocarbon emissions.  Movement to LPG eliminates particulates
and reduces CO, but may increase NOx and hydrocarbon emissions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a study of 44 LNG heavy-duty vehicle projects
nationwide, Robert Nimocks found some 2,277 LNG heavy-duty vehicles
in service.<sup><a href="end.html">122</a></sup>
  Some 30 additional LNG projects were initiated in
just four years.  Nimocks found that 17 of 51 fleets covered by
his survey were composed of long-distance delivery, less-than-carload
and refuse haulers.  This was concentrated in California and Texas,
where air quality problems are most severe.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Urban buses provide another important niche
market for AFVs.  For example, Brooklyn Union recently announced
that its 12 CNG fueling stations provided the equivalent of one
million gallons of CNG in 1995 to its 2,200 CNG vehicles operating
in New York.<sup><a href="end.html">123</a></sup>
  Included in the fleet are 53 commuter and two shuttle
buses that operate in Brooklyn and Queens.  Some 330 additional
buses are being considered for conversion. The organization estimated
that conversion from diesel fuel eliminated 43 tons of air pollution
in one year.  With 300 alternative-fueled buses, the Houston Metropolitan
Transit Authority operates the world's largest LNG fleet, and
some 10 other transit agencies have converted buses to LNG use,
including Sun Metro in El Paso, which will eventually operate
121 LNG buses.<sup><a href="end.html">124</a>
</sup>  Out of concern about particulate emissions, the
governor of Massachusetts ordered the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority to purchase exclusively buses that use alternative fuels.
<sup><a href="end.html">125</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Throughout our discussion of AFVs, the chicken-and-egg
problem surfaced regularly.  How can people be induced to purchase
AFVs when there is no refueling capability?  Or, how can refueling
infrastructure be built when there is no mass market?  The heavy-duty
truck and vehicle market tends to resolve this problem because
refueling infrastructure can be justified for fleets of urban
buses and operators of heavy-duty trucks that are refueled at
either end of a scheduled run.  The facilities that are built
can then be made available for public use, which strengthens the
overall market for AFVs.  But what about suppliers of engines
and vehicles?  Have they responded to the emerging market forces?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Major engine and truck producers have responded
to the market for LNG and other alternative-fuel vehicles.  Navistar,
General Motors and Peterbilt are offering LNG-fueled engines.
 Mercedes, General Motors, Flxible and Ikarus offer LNG-fueled
buses, and practically every large engine manufacturer now makes
available LNG and other alternative fuel engines.  Although the
price premium for equipping a heavy-duty truck or bus with an
alternative-fuel engine runs as much as $60,000, the gain in fuel
and operating costs comes close to offsetting the premium. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to these niche players, a potential
market may be developing for locomotives and operators of mining
machinery and ore carriers.  Again, refueling presents a smaller
challenge than in the light-vehicle market.  Here too, the gains
from fuel cost savings go a long way toward offsetting conversion
costs and purchase premiums.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The evidence we have compiled indicates that
AFVs are a viable force in the heavy-duty market.  Again, LNG
and CNG appear to be the major contenders in this market.  Regional
pressures to reduce air emissions form part of the stimulus, but
sheer economic forces push in the direction of alternative fuels
in these significant niche markets.  AFVs can surely be a component
of Environmental Innovation Areas. </FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">VI. ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AREAS:
 A REGIONAL APPROACH TO ACHIEVING NATIONAL GOALS<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Think Globally, Act Locally<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Most of us are familiar with the bumper-sticker,
&quot;Think Globally, Act Locally.&quot;  As it happens, this
slogan provides exactly the right framework for thinking about
the use of alternative fuel vehicles to achieve environmental
and national security objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As discussed above, two federal government
objectives can be addressed by expanding the use of AFVs:  1)
 Improving air quality in specific regions of the country; and,
2) reducing America's reliance on imported petroleum. The first
objective is defined by the CAA.  The second emerges primarily
from EPACT and CAFE.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA correctly recognizes that the clean
air problem is local or regional in nature. Different atmospheric
conditions and other characteristics make prospects for one national
solution for smog reduction very unlikely.  For example, Atlanta
has a heavy background level of hydrocarbon emissions from trees,
while Chicago has heavier NOx emissions and little in the way
of natural hydrocarbon emissions.  Uniform national command-and-control
 regulations simply will not get the job done.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Energy security, on the other hand, is a national
problem.  Simply put, EPACT calls for a reduction in the aggregate
importation of petroleum products into the United States - an
objective that could in principle be met through the use of AFVs
anywhere in America.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The solution:  Think globally, act locally.
 Create national objectives, but implement them on a geographically
&quot;customized&quot; basis that focuses on achieving maximum
environmental benefits.   And, do so in a way that encourages
further innovation, so that the best technologies are brought
to market and applied where they can do the most good.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To achieve these objectives, we propose the
creation of Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The essence of the proposal is simple:  Allow
those regions for which the federal government has identified
specific environmental objectives to achieve those objectives
in a way that makes the most sense for each area.  Further, because
the objectives are (at least in part) national, provide national
resources to meet them. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In principle, the EIA concept could be applied
to address a wide variety of environmental problems which share
the national/regional characteristics of the clean air challenges
we have addressed in this paper.  However, we focus here on describing
a specific proposal for implementing EIAs to address the clean
air and national security benefits associated with AFVs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Identifying Regional Candidates
for EIAs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The boundaries of an EIA should be determined
by the environmental issue it is meant to address.  In the case
of smog, smog production is a local or regional phenomenon tied
directly to emissions from mobile and stationary sources of particular
pollutants.  An EIA set up to deal with smog should have geographic
boundaries covering the sources of the smog, regardless of whether
those boundaries are consistent with political boundaries, such
as a city or state.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA addressed the regional nature of the
problem establishing 22 metropolitan nonattainment areas and the
12-state Ozone Transport Region (plus the state of California)
as controlling units.  Indeed, the CAA defined decision-making
organizations for each of these regions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We propose that each of the 22 urban areas
plus the 12-state Ozone Transport Region and the state of California
be designated automatically as EIAs.  Further, any other region
wishing to establish an EIA should be allowed to apply for approval
by federal authorities for such designation.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs and Clean Air Standards</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs should be granted open-ended flexibility
in achieving air quality goals based on EPA-approved interpretations
of national standards.<sup><a href="end.html">126</a>
</sup>  The measurement of their success should
be their progress toward achieving overall performance standards
based on air quality monitoring - not whether they use specific
technologies or follow specific command-and-control regulation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Utilizing this flexibility, each EIA will employ
its own, unique package of control instruments to deal with its
unique problems.  In some cases, control of NOx is more important
than obtaining reductions in VOC.  In other cases, stationary
controls are more crucial than seeking additional emissions reductions
from mobile sources.  But each EIA will have one common element:
 their efforts will be outcome-based;  inputs alone will not count.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To replace the current input-based approach
with one based on outcomes will require waiving numerous EPA and
other mandates.  To obtain such waivers, each EIA would specify
how it plans to achieve the nationally mandated smog-reduction
goals, including detailing the actions to be taken and the means
by which the region would monitor outcomes and enforce decisions.
 However, we would propose that EPA be required to approve all
initial waiver requests based on a standard of &quot;reasonable
evidence&quot; that the EIA's proposal would achieve the desired
goals.  Further, waivers should only be revoked if an EIA consistently
(e.g. three years running) fails to achieve the specified outcomes
in terms of emissions reduction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We expect that EIAs would examine a wide variety
of options for achieving their objectives, including: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Differential fuel taxes that reflect emission
characteristics for different vehicle fuels;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Provision of tax credits or deductions
for the purchase of AFVs and construction of refueling facilities;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Requirements that AFVs be used in particular
locations;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Purchase of clean fuel vehicles by public
entities, or incentives for purchase by private ones;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Inspection and maintenance programs that
provide low cost, effective means for assuring emission reductions;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Transportation plans that reduce the use
of private automobiles; and,</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Development of emissions trading schemes
that provide incentives for the use of cleaner fuels and technologies
and allow optimal tradeoffs between stationary and mobile source
emission reduction.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to these tools, we are confident
that the implementation of EIAs will generate many new ideas,
as groups at the grass roots level who will live with (and pay
for) the EIAs' policies seek to find the most effective and efficient
solutions.  In general, we would expect less reliance on inflexible
command-and-control regulations, strict rules requiring centralized
inspection of vehicles and fleets, high taxes on emissions, and
burdensome transportation plans relative to the use of flexible
market-based approaches.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">With EIAs around the nation utilizing different
control instruments, a discovery process will occur that leads
to fresh approaches for improving environmental quality. EIAs
will learn from each other what works and what does not, what
are more efficient and less costly ways to meet the standards.
Metropolitan areas, states and regions are naturally involved
in a competitive market for growth and change, and environmental
quality is an important consideration for people and firms when
making location decisions. The means chosen for maintaining and
improving environmental quality matter as well.  If one region
can provide cleaner air at lower cost than another, then more
wealth will be produced in the low-cost region.  There will thus
be pressure on EIAs to develop and adopt the most innovative,
efficient and effective mechanisms to meet their goals.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Federal Role in EIAs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government will play a crucial
role as referee in the EIA process.  By statute, it defines the
clean air goals to be achieved.  The national standards should
reflect a public policy choice made by Congress and enforced by
the EPA.  For instance, the national ambient air quality standards
would be a baseline EIAs would first be challenged to achieve,
after which they are obviously free to go further.  Given rising
incomes and strong preferences for improved air quality, it is
likely that the EIA process would inspire a race to the top. 
Allowing flexibility places a heavier burden on air quality monitoring.
 The EPA would be challenged to provide better, more complete
data on emission levels, and to give regular progress reports
to EIAs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government also plays a key role
by leveling the playing field for competing fuels and AFVs.  For
example, federal tax policy currently favors electric vehicles
and penalizes the use of propane.  Vehicle taxes should be set
on the basis of gasoline equivalence, relying fundamentally on
the notion of taxes as a highway user fee.  Alternately, the federal
government should apply emissions-based taxes to all fuels that
affect truly national environmental concerns, such as upper atmospheric
conditions or emissions that travel across national boundaries
or large populous regions.  States and EIAs should be encouraged
to continue to use emission-based fuel taxes.  In addition, the
federal government should gear its subsidies for urban transportation
programs to encourage the use of clean fuel buses.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs and Energy Security</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT, related executive orders and CAFE form
the second major force pushing the entry of AFVs into U.S. markets.
 Unlike improvements in air quality, which redound to the benefit
of people in local areas, a one-barrel reduction in imported oil
does not generate locally identifiable benefits but serves to
accomplish a national mandate.  Under EPACT, DOE is charged with
reducing American reliance on imported petroleum.  AFVs are an
important means of accomplishing this objective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Currently, DOE is considering rules that could
require providers of alternative fuels, public sector fleets and
private fleet operators with 20 or more vehicles to increase their
purchase and use of AFVs, with the objective that AFVs will account
for 75 percent of new fleet purchases by the turn of the century.
 Presidential executive orders require similar mandates for federally
operated fleets.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A requirement that the federal government itself
purchase AFVs is one thing. However, a requirement that private
firms and state and local governments purchase AFVs is an unfunded
mandate.  In the first instance the costs borne by the federal
government are visible; they are in the U.S. budget.  In the latter
instance, the costs are hidden but nonetheless real.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In conjunction with EIAs, we propose that all
required purchases of AFVs be funded sufficiently to cover related
incremental costs.  For private firms, income tax credits or direct
payments would be preferred.  For public sector fleet purchases,
the federally provided offset may take the form of trades involving
other federal programs.  With all costs made visible, U.S. taxpayers
and their representatives can better appreciate the opportunity
cost of the mandate and more effectively allocate funds for that
purpose.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">What size budget would it take to fund an incremental
cost of mandated AFVs? One illustrative approach to answering
the question involves consideration of failed 1992 congressional
attempts to expand AFV purchases.<sup><a href="end.html">127</a>
</sup>  Under the proposed 1992 National
Energy Security Act, Congress described AFV purchase targets for
federal, state, local and private business fleets.  The bill called
for 1.2 million AFVs in private fleets by the year 2000 and twice
that number in operation by 2010.  Some 1.4 million light vehicles
were included in the 2010 count.  If, for example,  the current
incremental cost of $3,500 for CNG vehicles were budgeted, the
total cost of achieving the 2010 goal of an additional 1.4 million
light vehicles would be $4.9 billion. If spread over a 15-year
period, the annual cost would run $326 million.  (Although this
illustration is for light-duty vehicles, we would expect, at least
initially, much of the AFV budget to be concentrated in the purchase
of heavy-duty vehicles, which are less dependent on a distribution
infrastructure.  The incremental costs of these vehicles are highly
variable, depending on vehicle type.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This cost could be at least partly offset by
using funds from a variety of existing federal programs designed
to promote the use of AFVs.  EPACT currently provides income tax
deductions of up to $2,000 for the purchase of light-duty AFVs
and greater amounts for heavy-duty vehicles.  Funds are also provided
through DOE's Clean Cities Program and through DOT programs to
promote AFVs.  These existing subsidies could be redeployed to
fund the incremental cost of AFV purchases through EIAs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An additional 1.4 million light vehicles, which
would be about 10 percent of the privately owned fleet, would
reduce annual oil consumption by about 14 million barrels and
emissions of VOCs by about 40,000 tons.  Although this constitutes
a relatively small percentage of total VOC emissions, through
the EIA process this reduction would be concentrated in the areas
where smog is of greatest concern.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To achieve the maximum environmental benefit
from AFVs, funding priorities for AFV purchases should be determined
in conjunction with the EIAs.  Specifically, we propose a periodic
tournament process, managed by the Department of Energy, to establish
how much AFV funding each EIA should receive, with funding decisions
based on air quality conditions in the competing EIAs.  That is,
the first decision-making criterion in allotting AFV funding should
be to see which EIAs would achieve the greatest environmental
benefits by using AFVs.  Once ranked on the basis of how much
AFVs contribute to air quality gains in each EIA, the DOE would
then consider other factors, such as the availability of fuels
and the development of a critical mass for viable infrastructure
and markets, in making the final funding allotment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, federally mandated fuel economy standards
(CAFE) should be reexamined in the light of AFV technologies.
 An expansion of AFVs can have the same effect on oil importation
as higher CAFE standards, which carry a high cost in human life.
 We believe the increased use of AFVs can make CAFE unnecessary
and, ultimately, that CAFE can and should be eliminated.  Auto
producers will then be able to channel energies used currently
for achieving CAFE to designing and producing AFVs.</FONT>

Areas as a</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Next Step in a New Environmental
Agenda<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The EIA concept can be used for managing most
forms of environmental pollution.  Few environmental challenges
are truly national in scope but typically local or regional in
nature.  Indeed, the history of environmental law indicates that
the federal government's first environmental regulation was aimed
at efforts to coordinate state and local actions.
<sup><a href="end.html">128</a></sup>  Even after
the formation of the federal blueprint in the 1970s, the federal
government continued to rely on states for operating federally-approved
programs and, in the case of water quality, setting water quality
goals for streams, rivers and lakes.  All attempts to impose uniform
standards across the entire country have met with frustration,
exemptions, delays and variable enforcement.  To some degree,
variations reflect differences in the nature of the pollution
problems encountered and the ability of communities to deal with
the national goals.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Embryonic EIAs may already be forming.  Under
DOE's Clean Cities program, almost 50 metropolitan areas have
submitted plans and gained approval for cooperative assistance
in promoting AFVs and clean air.<sup><a href="end.html">129</a></sup>
  Each designated city has its
own specialized plan for achieving clean air goals.  In some cases,
the plans include cooperative private/public efforts to expand
alternative fuel infrastructure along with efforts to be taken
by stationary sources to reduce emissions.  In others, the plans
involve transportation systems and expanded AFV fleets.  For example,
a school transportation agency in California's Long Beach Clean
City area is converting an aging fleet of 180 diesel-fueled school
buses to vehicles using CNG, methanol and advanced designed diesels.
 To assist in the process, Southern California Gas Company installed
a CNG refueling station, and the district is building an electric
recharging station for an electric powered demonstration school
bus.  In another case, leaders in Honolulu formed a coalition
to promote the use of propane, methanol and electricity as vehicle
fuels. The coalition plans to add 480 AFVs to the existing fleet
of 300. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Coachella Valley Region of California,
best known as the location of Palm Springs, provides a more complete
example of how the Clean Cities program could form a foundation
for EIA designation.<sup><a href="end.html">130</a></sup>
  Leaders across nine cities in the region
organized an association for promoting clean air.  By combining
the interests of industrialists, educators and operators of bus
companies, the association moved forward with a program that promotes
AFVs, improved transportation systems and the location of specialized
manufacturers in the area.  Their plan includes the production
of hydrogen fuels, making available CNG refueling units in newly
constructed homes, and the expansion of refueling facilities.
 The Coachella Valley now has the largest CNG refueling station
in Southern California along with mobile refueling units for commercial
users.  After converting 40 vehicles to CNG, the local bus company
has achieved some 30 tons of NOx emission reductions that it is
now seeking to sell in the Southern California emissions credit
market.  With a number of key stakeholders in place, the Coachella
Valley group could readily move to embrace larger environmental
goals and seek flexibility for attaining them as an EIA. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An effort in North Carolina to achieve water
quality goals provides the best example of an operating EIA. 
North Carolina's Tar-Pamlico River Basin Association was formed
in 1988 for the purpose of achieving reductions in phosphorous
and nitrogen discharges in the Tar River and Pamlico Sound.
<sup><a href="end.html">131</a></sup> EPA
agreed to alter its command-and-control approach to mandatory
point-source controls, without which Tar-Pamlico could not achieve
the desired standard.  Instead, EPA allowed the Association to
meet a water quality performance standard.  Tar-Pamlico's solution
was a plan involving the trading of pollution reductions:  the
association facilitates trading between farmers who reduce their
discharge of nitrogen and phosphorous and municipal treatment
works that are required to reduce their discharge of the same
pollutants.  Funds for these trades come from members of the association
that pay discharge fees based on emission characteristics.  Even
more to the point, the Association members represent a regional
watershed, which is the relevant zone of control, that does not
conform to any particular political boundary.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Visions of EIAs are also seen in other countries.
 For example, all French rivers are managed by autonomous and
distinct regional authorities.<sup><a href="end.html">132</a></sup>
  Each of the associations must
obtain its own funding, and each is accountable for improving
water quality.  In the United States, EPA's bubble and offset
policies for air pollution control, which allow low-cost sources
of pollution control to exchange emission reductions with higher
cost sources, represent steps in the direction of EIAs.<sup><a href="end.html>133</a></sup>  These
instruments decentralize control by allowing plant operators to
meet overall standards instead of meeting standards at each-and-every
source and to obtain pollution offsets from other plants.  In
other words, rudimentary forms of EIAs are emerging.
<sup><a href="end.html">134</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs represent a next logical step that can
be taken to move environmental protection forward. By focusing
on the appropriate zone of control; emphasizing outcomes, not
inputs; and, allowing flexibility in achieving desired goals,
environmental control authorities can assist the development of
incentive-based institutions that will more effectively yield
environmental improvement. </FONT>

<P>
<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:
 Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference,
hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22,
1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment
and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in
America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the
new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to
the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?
 Which (if either) American political party is best positioned
to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential
election?</I>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
<B>by Bill Myers</B>
<P>
Earlier today, Vin Weber began our discussions by arguing that
we have had our revolution, it is now over and our job is to stop
scaring folks with revolutionary rhetoric and to begin the real
work of rebuilding society consistent with the principles which
drove our successful revolution.
<P>
This afternoon, we will talk about the future of the revolution,
of our revolution.  Is Vin right?  Is our revolution over and
is reconstruction about to begin?  Have we already won?
<P>
Or, as I suspect is more likely, has our revolution yet to begin?
 Is the current-day Congressional imperative - to balance-the-budget-in-seven-years-using-CBO-numbers
- the rallying cry of a successful revolution or simply one more
repudiation of a failed order?  Can we really look at a policy
agenda heavy on process reform and light on substantive change
and declare a revolution even started, much less won?
<P>
Our panel will consider these question.  But to begin, let me
suggest that our talk of revolution - won or not - may be little
more than hubris masking a disappointing policy agenda bereft
of vision or revolutionary fervor.  Can we really claim a &quot;green
eyeshade&quot; agenda to be revolutionary when, as Jeff Eisenach
points out, it is much more reminiscent of Herbert Hoover than
of Newt Gingrich?  When will a new majority (any new majority)
emerge that champions a positive vision for America and offers
a policy agenda that advances that vision?
<P>
Perhaps the elections of 1994 were really not all that different
from those of 1992 - in both, voters expelled unsatisfactory incumbents,
and installed newcomers who promised Big Change.  Will those same
voters conclude that they have won that change come 1996?  Or
will they decide that another<I> revolution</I> is necessary then?
 And if so, who will lead it?
<P>
<a name="Miller"></a>
<B>A Way Ahead</B> by <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Miller">Jim Miller</a>
<P>
Let me begin by saying the good news. We revolutionaries have
an army in the field and that army has worked hard, but so far
the success has been holding in check the status quo, the elitists,
the socialists.  But we haven't overcome them.  We've also won
a few important skirmishes, but by and large, they have been rather
modest - things such as making sure that the laws that apply to
everyone else also apply to Congress.  The major reason we haven't
won more skirmishes is that every time we get ready for a skirmish,
the Senate pulls back or the Administration threatens to veto
and we lose the resolve.  So we have an army in the field.  We
have engaged the enemy at times, but we haven't yet prevailed.
<P>
Now what do we do to prevail?  It seems to me that we have to
take the moral high ground.  We must not fight simply on these
little issues. I say little, not because they're not hard fought,
but because they're part of a bigger puzzle, a part of a bigger
overall theme, part of the bigger revolution.  We have been fighting
for a balanced budget.  We have been fighting to save Medicare
and Medicaid.  We have been fighting to slow the overall rate
of growth of government.  But we also have a much broader agenda,
and it's an agenda predicated on our philosophy and the notion
of what constitutes an appropriate role of government.  
<P>
I personally believe that we need to talk more about returning
government to our fondest vision of a limited government, one
that insures our freedom, does what's absolutely necessary, but
otherwise stays out of our pockets and off our backs and out of
our hair.  
<P>
We want a frugal government, a government that doesn't waste our
money - and I can't even begin to tell you all the places and
ways in which the Federal government wastes our taxpayer money.
 We want a prudent government, a government that makes the right
kinds of decisions and employs common sense in its decision making.
 We have drifted far from that.  I think the revolution of 1994
was a revolution to bring government back to basic principles,
not just to balance the budget, not just to continue the rate
of growth of government, but to recognize the fundamental powers
that were established in the Constitution and the vision of our
Founders for our national government.
<P>
The second thing that we need to do is to get on with the rest
of the agenda.  We need to be talking about such things as getting
government out of the business of undermining the institutions
of civil society.  Institutions that frankly are more important
than government.  The Federal government, whether it means to
or not, is undermining our faith and undermining our family. 
For example, the marriage penalty tax undermines and is biased
against the family - you have a situation where under certain
circumstances people are better off financially if they simply
live together rather than be married, and that's nuts.  That's
a nutty proposal, a nutty policy for a government to be following.
 So we need to change a lot of these institutions of government
and to eliminate bad incentives or incentives that tend to tear
down those institutions that are more important to government
and are more necessary to the preservation of a civil society.
 
<P>
I think the third thing we've got to do is to change tactics a
bit.  We have to go from where we are now.  We can't revisit the
fact that we have lost the public relations war on the current
fight over the budget. A year ago, Citizens for a Sound Economy
did polling and focus groups. We found that people thought that
if you have a budget impasse and it was a matter of fighting for
principle, they would blame the President if there were a shutdown,
but if it were perceived as business as usual gridlock, then they
would blame the Congress, the new Republican Congress.  Well,
I think the Administration has won, and they won for several reasons.
 One, the revolutionaries didn't recognize the importance of the
public relations message soon enough.  We were caught up in the
euphoria of winning and extrapolated from that.
<P>
The second reason that we got caught is that frankly we underestimated
the willingness of the statists - particularly the Administration
and many Democrats in Congress - to represent incorrectly what
the facts are and what's at stake.  We  know that what the revolutionaries
are trying to achieve is not to destroy Medicare or Medicaid,
not to have big cuts in spending on some of these entitlement
programs to finance tax cuts.  The willingness of the Liberals
and the statists to misrepresent, and notice I'm using a very
nice term, to misrepresent the facts is far beyond what we would
have believed.
<P>
I think we need to take the moral high ground, we need to get
on with the agenda and we need to change that tactics on the public
relations front and characterize the fight better and do a better
job in representing what's at stake to the American people.

The GOP has had a string of bad news recently: In a recent ABC/Washington
Post poll, 74 percent disagreed with how the Republican Congress
is handling the economy  (versus 50 percent disagreeing with Clinton's
performance).  The GOP has been completely outmaneuvered by Clinton
on the balanced budget and appears to be retreating even on its
promise not to raise the debt ceiling; and, the President is universally
expected to continue hijacking, in his State of the Union address,
the conservative rhetoric of strengthening families and renewing
institutions. 
<P>
There are two ways for Republicans to deal with all these setbacks.
 One: They can spin them.  Two: They can heed them as the wake-up
call they are.  So far they've chosen the spin cycle.  They're
comforting themselves with transparent excuses:  It's the Senate
with wimpy Republicans caving in; it's the uncompromising House
freshmen, recalcitrant and extremist; it's Clinton, the Great
Empathizer; it's Dick Morris, the brilliant strategist.   
<P>
As anyone familiar with 12-step programs can tell you, there is
nothing as inventive as the human mind in denial.  And since the
GOP is unquestionably in denial, here is my suggested seven step
recovery program. (In the budget saving spirit of the times, we
have reduced 12 steps to 7.)
<P>
The first step for the GOP is to acknowledge that it has a problem.
 
<P>
The second step is to stop whining, especially about the media.
 As Michael Barone once said,  the Constitution guarantees a free
press - it does not guarantee a fair press.  The GOP should forget
about whether the media is misrepresenting their message and go
about improving it.
<P>
The third step is to stop sounding like accountants and to begin
sounding like leaders.  The good news for Republicans is that
80 percent of the American public wants a balanced budget.  The
bad news for them is that so does Bill Clinton - in seven years
with CBO numbers.  So Republicans need to move the debate beyond
balancing the budget, not because this battle is over, but because,
for the moment, the President has framed the debate in way that
makes it impossible for Republicans to win.  Both sides want to
balance the budget, but the President, in his own words, wants
to &quot;balance the budget in a way that reflects our values.&quot;
<P>
The fourth step is for the GOP to stop repeating, ad nauseum,
 that it is not cutting anything - but merely reducing the rate
of growth.  This may be factually correct, but didn't Republicans
campaign on the theme of cutting things - cutting government,
cutting entitlements, cutting taxes?  Did they come to power to
reduce the rate of growth of government or did they come to power
to reduce government?  
<P>
So instead of being so defensive about what they are doing, I
suggest that they take step five and be courageous enough to tell
the American people just what they want to do: reverse 60 years
of New Deal and Great Society thinking, according to which all
solutions to social and economic problems revolve around government.
 Yes, this is bold, but a time of crisis requires boldness, decisiveness,
and honesty.  This rethinking of the role of government has to
go hand in hand with a fundamental redefinition of the role of
the citizen - challenging the American people to meet less from
Washington with more from themselves and their communities.  
<P>
The sixth step, without which the revolution will remain stalled,
is to talk about community solutions - about what is working around
America.  They must talk about it  not once in a while but as
frequently and as seriously as they have been talking about balancing
the budget.  The GOP must go beyond just talking about dismantling
government, and start talking about with what they are going to
replace it.  This is a critical step.  When Newt Gingrich first
became Speaker, he was going to hold Congressional &quot;success
hearings.&quot;  He was going to bring to the Capitol the community
leaders who are making things work and are turning lives around
- introducing them to the American public as the people who embody
the alternative vision of rebuilding America.  
<P>
The final step is to bring a sense of urgency to the debate -
to shift it from balancing the books in seven years to taking
steps right now to reform conditions in education, in welfare,
in the ways we deal with those most in need among us.  Let Dick
Gephardt and David Bonior defend a broken system of government
programs that has left millions of children hungry, abused or
neglected, and let the Republicans speak of weaving a real safety
net from the involvement and resources - in time and money - of
millions of Americans.  
<P>
Instead of spinning all these setbacks or blaming the media, it
is time the GOP took these seven simple steps to produce a message
that has both economic and moral truth on its side.  If Republicans
truly want to recover from what ails them, they must seize the
moral high ground without which no party can be a majority party.
<P>
<a name="Norquist"></a>
<B>The Leave Us Alone Coaltion</B> by Grover Norquist
<P>
I think there will always be tactical up and downs.  I'm in the
long run very optimistic about the course of the revolution and
the reason is both about ideas and institutions.  
<P>
First of all, I'm not surprised at the level of opposition.  I
don't think we should be surprised that this White House and the
present defenders of the welfare state are willing to lie and
bully and repeat lies.  Every day in this country or every week
in this country, people are killed in an attempt to rob somebody
of $100.  This revolution is talking about taking about $1.5 trillion
away from the people who have run this welfare state, the annual
federal budget.  We are lucky that they haven't put snipers up
on the roof to come after us.  I mean this is an awful lot of
resources that are presently in the hands of the welfare state
that are being threatened by this revolution, and they will defend
it by lying and calling names and throwing all sorts of heavy
objects.  So the level of opposition I don't find surprising;
 I just think we have to continue through it.
<P>
But most importantly, I think if we look at the assets of the
coalition and the cohesiveness of the conservative or Republican
coalition, we see a very strong coalition going into not just
this next election, but the next 20 elections.  A lot of people
focus on Washington, and yes, there was a big win in 1994 for
the Republican Party and for the party representing the values
of less government: 52 House seats; 8 new Senate seats; then 5
more Democrats from the House joined the Republican Party; 2 Senators
joined the Republican Party.  But at the state level, radical
change is deeper.  
<P>
The Republican party picked up about 480 state legislative seats;
51 Democrats in state legislatures now have switched parties in
addition to the 480.  Prior to 1994, there were 17 states where
the Democratic party controlled the governorship and both houses
of the legislature, which meant they could change labor law, tax
law, campaign finance law, any kind of rule change they wanted
for their benefit. There were three states over which the Republicans
had similar control.  Now, after the 1994 election, there are
seven states that the Democrats control: they have Hawaii, Georgia,
and the rim of the Confederacy: Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky,
West Virginia and Maryland.  The Republican Party has 15 states
where they control the governorship and both houses.  This is
where a lot of the interesting activities happen around the country,
and what makes a lot of the devolution that federalists and others
have been advocating and talking about possible. Fifteen states.
States like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan,
Wisconsin - large states - and that number is going to grow in
the next several elections.
<P>
The states are fundamental building blocks, not just of the nation,
but of the polity as well, and I think it's particularly important
that this revolution happened at the state and local level as
well as the federal level. If Mario Cuomo was still Governor of
New York, and Ann Richards was still Governor of Texas, do you
really believe despite our best intentions that this Republican
House and Senate would run and send medicaid and welfare out to
the states and hand $7 billion over the next seven years to Ann
Richards or $20 billion to Mario Cuomo to spend on Democratic
precinct workers to try to kneecap the Republican party?  I think
it would be very, very difficult if you didn't have the depth
of 31 Republican governors and 17 totally Republican states.
<P>
In additon, we have a coherent and cohesive governing, conservative
Republican coalition as we move forward in the 1996 elections.
I would argue that what holds the Republican conservative coalition
together, this revolution, is that everybody in the coalition
wants to be left alone by the government.  They're the leave us
alone coalition: property owners who don't want their property
taken away or declared a wetland; taxpayers that don't want their
money taken away from them; gun owners who don't want the guns
taken away.  You have home schoolers who want their children left
alone.  These are not people who want everybody else to home school.
 They don't want to tell you how to educate your children.  They
just want the government out of their family life and their decisions
as parents. 
<P>
We're trying to recreate civil society and have competent charitable
institutions that need to be left alone, where people who are
actually doing something about getting people off of drugs and
trying to help people who need help.  They can't have the government
coming in and taking a quarter to a half of what people earn and
a quarter to a half of people's time and then expect people to
have time or resources for voluntary and charitable.  Nor can
you afford bad government charity driving out and hobbling good
private sector and faith-based charitable work, because if down
the street from your effort to help people get their lives turned
around, the government says you don't have to bathe, you don't
have to get up in the morning, you don't have to work and we'll
give you money and we'll give you food for free, then you can
continue to be a drug addict.
<P>
Thus one of the most important things in this coalition is that
everybody in it simply wants to be left alone by the government.
 I include the social conservatives and the Christian right, because
they can best be understood as a parents rights movement that
wants the government out of the lives of their families and their
children.  Remember that the so-called religious right got organized
in a self-defense effort in 1978 when the government was going
after Christian radio stations and Christian schools.  The conservative
coalition is very cohesive.  They don't want anything from each
other.  They can work together in a room and everybody can work
together toward the same end: of getting the government out of
everybody else's lives and opening up space for return to a civil
society.

<B>Looking for Leadership</B> by Charles Kelly
<P>
There is obviously in everything you've heard today a series of
assumptions about what's going on in Washington and how this government
has to be restructured here in Washington.  And I know that's
how most of the people in Washington feel.  Yet when I travel
as I do and speak at rotary clubs and little tiny groups wherever,
from the redneck bars of the south to whatever drinking establishment
seems to be appropriate in the community to get a feel for the
people, one thing always comes back. It is not that they're thrilled
with the Republican revolution, not that they're thrilled with
the Presidency of Bill Clinton, but that they detest government,
not only government in the abstract, but the individuals of government,
the living, breathing Congressmen up here.
<P>
It is not as if you get a resurrection or belief and trust by
turning out one bunch of people as the public did in this country;
they threw George Bush out of office.  They said that's enough.
 Two years later, they threw as many Democrats out as they could
and said that's enough.  Now is that a Republican revolution or
is that a manifestation of some more profound and deep seeded
distrust for the whole institutional abstraction of the way this
country lives?  
<P>
It is certainly the experience that came to me working seven days
a week pretty much for two years.  Now this trust can only be
met I think by something that restores confidence and that is
trust, and that's what people have for Colin Powell.  They believed
that Colin Powell was a trustworthy leader.  The reason they believe
in Colin Powell is that he's a real person.  He's lived a real
life.  Character does count.  He's not one of these abstractions
that goes from high school politics into the local Congressman's
office and then worms his way up the process and becomes a legislator.
 
<P>
When I traveled around the country and talked to people in the
states, including the governors, our strategy was to try to get
the governors' attention.  The governors, most of them, have come
out of legislatures and they admire Bob Dole as a legislator.
They think he's a wonderful legislator.  He knows how to cut a
deal; he knows how to split the difference. But it is precisely
what happens when the difference is split that offends people
because it is the giantism, the endless and prostration of more
and more, that people have come to distrust.  People do want to
be left alone.  That's true.  They want to be left alone to collect
their checks from the government and &quot;take what's due me.&quot;
 They don't want to have it all disappear over night. 
<P>
The word revolution is a tough word.  We had one revolution in
this country.  Patrick Henry perhaps started the revolution, but
he couldn't conclude it.  We needed a George Washington to carry
the revolution forward.  We do not have in this country trusted
leadership.  We have people who are exercising power and are deeply
distrusted, and until we can understand that, I don't think we've
learned the lesson.  
<P>
The French Revolution brings the echoes of the troubles' wheels.
 It didn't end in a pretty fashion.  But the worst thing it seems
to me was not just the guillotine, the worst thing was the pleasure
that people took in watching the beheading, and that's what people
see around the country in this Congress.  They say these guys
are taking pleasure in the beheadings, and that's not the way
leadership works, and that's my second word.  The first word is
trust.  The second word is leadership.  Legislation is not leadership.
 The Constitution was not written around the idea that Congress
should be the executive of the government.  Accountants are not
leaders.  We've got to have people who can be trusted for who
they are, what they have done, what kind of character they have,
what kind of lives they've lived.  Without that, I don't think
we can be successful as a Republican party or as a governing party.
 
<P>
That brings me to the third point, people are desperate for something
that they can do.  They want a belief in themselves as citizens,
not as puppets on a string, not as people whose pockets are being
picked.  The idea of citizenship is a very, very powerful one
in this country, and nobody is talking about that.  They're talking
about hobbling together coalitions of various special interest
groups that fund various political activities.  People don't care
about that, at least they don't in the scope and experience that
I've had.  I was on a board of directors some years ago with a
man that I admire greatly named Peter Drucker, and Peter says
the secret of success is to see as a whole what others see only
in parts. You hear it all the time. 
<P>
We've got to have someone who will say, what is our safety net?
 What is the level that we're going to have for our people?  Nobody's
talking that way.  We're talking about a subterfuge really, as
people see it.  We'll give it to the states and let the states
take care of it.  I was trained as a lawyer some years ago, and
I don't practice, but I will tell you that out of all of the people
that I knew in law or in the Bar, nobody wanted to go into the
state court if they possibly could avoid it because they didn't
trust the state courts.  They wanted to get into the federal system.
 That attitude is still present.  People are suspicious about
the way some states are run.  They're certainly entitled to be
suspicious about Arkansas.  We've learned a little bit.  They're
suspicious about Alabama and Mississippi and Georgia, and they're
probably suspicious about some of the western states because they
don't have the kind of problems that people have in New York or
Pennsylvania or Ohio.  So there is a great deal of discontinuity,
disconnect and disorientation in our society, that nothing that
happens in this town deals with at all because there is no leader
to speak to them.  There is no trusted person.  
<P>
Having said all that, the answer is not easy for me because I
believe that Colin Powell would have won the general election
by at least 70 percent of the votes. Therefore he would not be
dependent upon various groups of financing and other support,
and thus he alone could speak for the national interests as opposed
to being a captive of a bunch of special interests. I think that
the Republican revolution when it decided, suddenly when it came
to power that it wasn't interested in campaign finance reform,
I think it lost a very great deal.  
<P>
<a name="Galston"></a>
<B>How to Move Forward</B> by Bill Galston
<P>
Well, for obvious reasons, I'm not here to praise your revolution.
But for less obvious reasons I'm not here to bury it either. 
I'd like to step back a little bit from the front lines of partisan
combat, which, by the way, the American people detest as heartily
as they detest government itself, and reflect on problems that
we're all trying to grapple with in one way or another. I believe
that politics done right in a democracy means addressing the people's
most fundamental concerns in a forward looking way that takes
account as much as possible of the common interests and the common
good.  That is a very high standard, but I think that was George
Washington's standard, and as George Washington once said, &quot;Our
duty is to raise a standard to which the wise and honest may repair,
the event is in the hands of God.&quot;  
<P>
So I prefer to begin not where Washington is, but where I think
the American people are.  What's on their minds? I think that
there are three central concerns on the minds of the American
people today, which I will summarize as economic anxiety, social
disintegration and political dysfunction.  
<P>
Many of my conservative friends are inclined for one reason or
another to underplay the existence of economic anxiety in this
country.  I think you would be better off spending your time taking
that phenomenon seriously and thinking about ways of addressing
it.  We are not making up the statistics about wages.  We are
not planting stories about AT&amp;T's layoffs on the front page
of the daily newspapers.  We are not creating gaps between front-line
workers and CEOs. These are social facts that the American people
are grappling with.  They don't necessarily want our answers,
but they certainly don't want anybody to say, no, this isn't happening,
these aren't real problems and we don't care about them.  It's
just not true. 
<P>
Social disintegration, I don't need to tell this group about that.
You know, concentric circles of disintegration starting with the
family, broadening on out to neighborhoods and communities.
<P>
 
<P>
Political dysfunction is a sense that our fundamental institutions
of government are not performing they way they ought to in a democracy.
 They are not responsive.  They are not effective.  They are not
transparent.
<P>
So to turn this around, what do the American people want?  I think
for the economy they want opportunity and at least a modicum of
security as well.  They are not satisfied with an opportunity
society that removes all elements of security from their economic
lives.  That is not an acceptable answer to the American people,
and you should think about that.  For the society, they want I
believe a restoration, a restoration of social order and also
a restoration of sense of social connection.  There's a profound
sense of social disconnection, and I believe the American people
are crying out for some response.  With regard to politics, I
believe that they want a much greater measure of responsiveness
and also of integrity than they see today.  
<P>
Now if these are the concerns, if this in broad outlines is what
they want, what's the way forward?  I think we're all in one way
or another grappling with the question of the way forward.  As
far as the framework is concerned, I would suggest that what the
country needs and what the American people want is something like
a new progressive politics for the information age.  We lead them
to believe that politics is irrelevant to the question of how
to have liveable lives for average families in the new information
age.  Politics is not irrelevant to that set of concerns.  
<P>
I believe that the American people today are in favor neither
of paternalism nor of libertarianism.  I agree with Vin Weber
that the American people are not rejecting government root and
branch.  Speaking as a Democrat, I would be delighted if Republicans
wage the 1996 election as the leave us alone coalition, because
the leave us alone coalition is not and will not be a majority
in this country. I would add that the leave us alone coalition
is frequently the leave our subsidies alone coalition.
<P>
 
<P>
I was very struck with Frank Luntz's presentation about the American
people are thinking.  He offered a long string of negatives: they
don't like this; they don't like that.  But no political movement
can build a majority on negatives.  I don't care who you are,
especially when you're talking about a permanent national governing
majority that includes the Presidency.  That's not what Presidential
leadership is about.  It is not about negation.  It is about dismantling
what no longer works and replacing it, whether it's government,
civil society or the market, with something that works better.
 
<P>
What does this mean more specifically?  With regard to the public
sector, with regard to government, the goal I believe as far as
the American people are concerned is empowerment.  The means:
incentives rather than regulations or commands whenever possible.
 The level: as local and close to the people as possible. The
extent: government only when market and civil society cannot do
the job.  I think there's a substantial measure of agreement in
the country on those four points and the question is to devise
policies that are consistent with those four points.  
<P>
I would submit to you that today there is no great public support
for either political party in Congress.  From the people's standpoint,
I would suggest to you neither party is seen as standing for reform
of the political system, neither party is seen as offering clear
answers to the profound problems of social and moral disintegration
in this country, and with regard to the economy, we have an unholy
split where Democrats are offering security without opportunity
and Republicans are offering opportunity without security, two
losing formats.  
<P>
Now what is the path to the new majority in these circumstances.
 Here I'm going to offer more of a negative than a positive point.
 It's not simple at all given where we are.  Why not? Because
the detached center is heterogenous.  It's not all one thing.
 There are different people in this detached center unassociated
with either political party.  Colin Powell's detached centrists
are not just the same as Ross Perot's detached centrists, who
are certainly not the same as Pat Buchanan's radicalists.  These
people are all untethered from the party system as we know it
today, but they do not agree among themselves.
<P>
I would add that there are profound generational differences as
well, very important generational differences. For instance, the
depression was a unifying experience.  The Second World War was
a unifying experience; creating a middle class and fighting the
Cold War and defeating communism in the 1940's and '50's was a
unifying experience.  For the past 30 years, we've had nothing
but disunifying experiences, and we now have two generations whose
political outlook reflects the politics of disunity and I think
putting Humpty Dumpty together again is not simple.  
<P>
I will conclude with some grandiose historical retractions.  As
I look at American history, I see three eras of fundamental party
change and of new majority creation.  The 1850's, the 1890's and
the 1960's.  In the 1850's, you had the creation of a new majority
through the disappearance of an old party and the rise of a new
one.  In the 1890's, you had the creation of a new political system
because the ideas that the Progressive movement launched in one
way or another soon became the common property of the entire political
system. By 1912 you had the most important political debate between
two Progressives, Wilson and Roosevelt, and the guy who stood
squarely for the old order - the incumbent President of the United
States - who happened to come in third. The political change model
of the 1960's is neither party replacement, like the 1850's, nor
change of overall political outlook in the system as in the 1890's,
but rather fundamental change in one political party, namely the
Republican party and the long march to power of the conservative
movement.
<P>
I do not know which of these three models of party transformation
and of new majority building will be the model that governs the
next 20 years, but I do offer this prediction, that as we look
back on 1996 from the vantage point of 2016 or even 2006, the
current partisan affiliation and the current lines of partisan
confrontation will come to seem as antique to us as the politics
of the 1880's and early 1890's came to seem by the first and second
decade of the 20th Century.
<P>
<a name="Barone"></a>
<B>A Return to de Tocqueville</B> by Michael Barone
<P>
Let me say I think that we are in the midst of a revolution, but
perhaps we ought to call it a small revolution or perhaps think
up another word as they thought up the word recession in the 1930's
to describe the depression that wasn't as big as the depression.
 This revolution has been going on for a little longer than we
think, and will continue to have important effects regardless
of which party wins the elections.
<P>
We've had a return to Tocquevillean in America.  I think that
today's post-industrial America in important respects, not in
every respect, but in an important respect more closely resembles
the pre-industrial America that Alexis de Tocqueville described
in the 1830's in <I>Democracy in America</I> than it does the
industrial America in which we grew up.  Industrial America was
a big unit America: big government, big business, big labor. Those
big units recovered from the depression, won World War II, built
prosperous post-war America.
<P>
Big institutions developed enormous prestige in that period. 
We're always talking about the decline in respect for institutions
and trust in institutions in America, and we take as our base
point polling data that was started in the 1950's or early 1960's
when trust in institutions was very high. There seems to be an
unspoken assumption by a lot of people who use these figures is
that, hey, trust in institutions in America was always high, you
know, from 1620 and stuff and then it tumbled down in the 1970's
and '80's. In fact, I wonder if we weren't in an unusual period
in the 1950's and '60's.  I mean Mark Twain in the 19th century
certainly was not the only American who referred to Congress as
our only native criminal class.  There was other skepticism about
institutions.  We have had different qualities of leadership at
different points in our time.  The first President Buchanan did
not have the same qualities that the man who hopes to be the second
President Buchanan does.  
<P>
Industrial America was a culturally uniform America. So many people
went through that same thing, World War II, that we were literally
a nation in uniform.  It was a conformist America.  A lot of people
in the fifties thought there was a lot of problems with that.
 It was an America that believed in basic institutions and big
government, and it tended as a natural course because of its character
as a civil society to vote more often for the Democrats than the
Republicans, because they were the party on balance most closely
identified with big government.  And even a Republican President,
Eisenhower in 1952, with a Republican House and a Republican Senate,
didn't make major tax cuts.  He refrained from cutting the very
high tax programs that he thought were bad.  He refrained from
attacking the Social Security program which he personally felt
wasn't a great idea.  He started building interstate highway programs,
major public works, the National Defense Education Act, getting
the government into financing graduate school education and so
forth.  He was moving with the times and with the character of
the country against, in his case, his own personal inclinations
because he felt that was the right thing to do as a leader of
the country at that time.  
<P>
Today I think we've changed.  We've watched the big institutions
crumble in different ways.  We've watched big government become
incompetent in different ways that the people of 30 years ago
would not have believed.  I mean if you were driving around Washington,
D.C. this weekend, the big government of the District of Columbia
which by any standards of local governments is a huge local government
with enormous money, the traffic lights were out all weekend at
the entry points to the city. I mean this is a city government
that is incompetent, a big government that's incompetent to perform
even the most basic levels of public safety and protection here.
 We've seen big government get corrupted in various ways, and
the District of Columbia is obviously an example at one end of
the spectrum.  
<P>
Big business changed vastly, having to down size, having to change.
The big three auto companies, supposedly in total possession of
the American market, John Kenneth Galbraith assured us in 1967,
now in big trouble.  Big labor is almost disappearing.  Today,
we are a culturally fragmented country.  Religion was the single
demographic factor that most separated Americans voting in the
1992 and 1994 elections, even more than race. It's an America
which naturally tends to favor, not always, but tends to favor
devolution of power, tends to oppose concentration of power, and
therefore more often tends to favor the Republican party rather
than the Democratic party. I think that this revolution, the Newtonian
revolution if we want to call it that, has been going on longer
than we think, even though it has gone over something of a rocky
road.
<P>
The language of reporters and journalists is very interesting.
 During the 1993-94 political struggle over health care reform,
we in Washington were writing that there will be reform of health
care financing based on an assumption that reform will only happen
if Congress passes a federal law.  Otherwise, there won't be reform.
 Well, if you go out and look as Bob Samuelson did in a competing
publication of my own some weeks ago, what has actually happened
to health care finance around the country over the last five years,
there have been immense numbers of changes and reforms and differing
ways or organizing and financing health care.  The rise in health
care costs, which we were assured for all sorts of what seemed
like excellent reasons were going to go higher, have been cut.
In fact, health care reform has been going on and the failure
of the Clinton health care plan was in effect a decision to let
that issue stay devolved.  Let it be handled in a decentralized
way.  Some people may feel that was an unfortunate decision, but
it was the decision that the society through the political process
made when we had a Democratic Congress, when Newt Gingrich could
hardly get on network television. It was impossible to cobble
together in a devolution minded society a centralized program
that a majority would not have some problems with.  
<P>
Obviously in 1995, looking at the budget issue now, the Republicans
have not had complete success.  On the other hand, at the lower
levels of government, spending and taxation are very substantially
different from would have occurred if even a slender Democratic
majority had been re-elected to control Congress.  We are in a
process where the actions of the political process are ratcheting
the size of government down.  They don't always ratchet it successfully,
but the movement is in that direction instead of the series of
political forces that we had starting with the New Deal that attempted
to ratchet the size of government up.  If you wanted an egg program
in the old days and I wanted an urban program like food stamps,
we'd say, hey, let's do them both, and we'd ratchet the government
up.  Now we're doing it more in the other direction through cuts.
I think even some of the failures with the Contract with America
have been successes.  I mean Congress, and to some extent - even
if I think insincerely - the Clinton White House, are acting as
if the balanced budget amendment was passed.  We're sitting here
talking, not entirely in fictitious terms, about how to balance
the budget in seven years.   With term limits, Members of Congress
are acting almost as if term limits have been passed.  We see
all these members who everybody assumed had lifetime careers,
that wanted lifetime careers, deciding to go onto something else.

<P>
The basic trends in society are having their effects in the political
process regardless of the polls and the problems that the Republicans
currently are having.  In retrospect, looking at the budget thing,
I think that the Republicans made a mistake in a couple of ways.
 They made mistakes a lot of liberals make that others shared
their views when they assumed that other people would be delighted
at seeing government shutdown, and I think they failed to understand
that when you're perceived as being in charge, disarray, disorder
works against you, but I think the tendency of the Presidential
election this year is going to change the political posture in
which people are looking at these issues.  
<P>
I think disarray now works against President Clinton and will
continue to do so up through the election.  Disarray does not
help a President, and I think that while people have been looking
at the plans that the Republicans have brought to the table, brought
to the floor in Congress, and asking questions about them as they
quite reasonably might, in the summer and fall of 1996, people
are going to be asking what both parties will do, and in that
respect, I think that also in my view that we are in an era of
greater straight party ticket voting and that means that the voters
might very well have to face the question, do you want a Republican
government?  Do you want a Democratic government?  
<P>
In that regard I would say  Republicans have something of an advantage.
Voters have questions and qualms about a Republican government,
and we've seen those go through the Republican opinion polls,
but voters' attitude toward a Democratic government was pretty
well showed in the 1994 elections.  One party has a potential
majority.  The other party has a very hard time getting a majority
in my view in light of where we're going.
<P>
My conclusion is that this revolution, if it's a revolution, or
this change in direction in the flow of public policy, will continue
to a greater or lesser extent regardless even if Bill Clinton
and the Democratic Party are elected in 1996.

<B>The Correct Vision and Projects</B> by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Higgins">Heather Higgins</a>
<P>
 
<P>
The subject is the future of the revolution, and I'd like to break
this into three parts.  The first is where we are now.  The second
is how we ought to proceed, and the third is an assessment of
the future of this little venture on which we think we've embarked.
<P>
Where we are now I'd like to present to you in Gingrichian model
terms since Gingrich is perceived as being the central force of
the revolution.  Any of you who have listened to Newt at any length
surely have heard his modeling plan of vision, strategies, projects
and tactics.  If you are in fact trying to be a force for change
in a society that will lead it forward, then you have to start
at the very top when you describe your vision. I think the vision
we are talking about is a world in which individuals have the
authentic liberty to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens.
 If that is your vision, then one of your strategies would be
to limit the size of government to allow greater responsibilities
for citizens, and if that is one of your strategies, then one
of your projects, one of them, is to call for a balanced budget
with no increase in taxes, because, as we all know, balanced budgets
in and of themselves are something of a shibboleth.  You could
balance the budget by nationalizing the economy.  It's all a game
and it's where you balance it and how you balance it and what
the programs are that you have in place that matters.  
<P>
The problem that the Republicans have now, to be very frank, is
that somehow the mere project of balancing the budget has been
elevated to the language of a vision.  An economic language will
always unnecessarily be trumped by a moral language, and Bill
Clinton has been very smart.  He has used moral language.  He
is really speaking to a vision or representation of a vision.
 Whether or not we think that it's all a lie or we think that
it's all a fraud, it is convincing language to the listeners.
 On the one side you have economic data and accountant talk, and
on the other side you have moral language.  
<P>
This was entered into quite innocently.  Balanced budget was a
slogan shorthand that meant a great deal to a great many people.
 Most of them understood exactly what was meant, understood it's
context, but forgot that that needed to be explained to the larger
community lest it be trumped by more explicit language on the
other side.  There are signs, however, and I am optimistic that
this language is slowly being learned.  For example, Dick Army's
recent language about the extensions on the debt ceiling being
tied to specific language in any bill which changed the shape
and form of government and allowed us our liberties back.  He
was not just talking about CBO numbers in seven years, which I
think is quite important.  I think that there will be a return
to what Gingrich had stated as being the unshakable, non-negotiable,
principles which were a balanced budget with tax cuts, radical
and substantial changes in the way we do welfare, and changes
in the way we do Medicare.  
<P>
How to proceed.  There recently has been a spade of articles which
I would urge you all to pay attention to because I think they
are the latest analysis, and I think that they are in some measure
wrong.  The first salvo to this effect was in <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, the last day of 1995.  There's been a variant on
the theme by David Brooks in a recent <I>Standard,</I> which is
a very good article and he makes a number of good points, but
there's one particular aspect where I disagree with him. It is
a variant I would say on the argument that we have heard ever
since, even before the Congressional elections, that there would
be a split between the moderates and the conservative radicals
 in the Republican Party.  The prognosticators have always said
it's going to happen.  It was going to happen before we ever got
to January, after they won.  It was going to happen all the way
through the Contract; if you will remember, the tough part was
always still coming.  It was going to happen all the way through
the appropriations process.  It was going to happen as we got
down to the budget negotiations themselves.  
<P>
I think that people have learned that this split doesn't quite
work out the way they think it's going to, and so the latest version
that you're hearing now is that there is a split between the leave
us alone coalition and - shall we call them cultural conservatives
- otherwise referred to <U><I>by The Wall Street Journal</I></U>
mistakenly as communitarians.  Actually, in fact, I would argue
that this is a very superficial difference.  The problem, however,
is just simply one of language.  
<P>
Leave us alone tells us what people want.  It doesn't tell you
why they want it. But in fact, if you think about it, adults need
to be left alone in order to exercise their moral responsibilities
from the excesses of government.  Yet unless you explicitly spell
out why you want what you want, you leave yourself vulnerable
to attacks that you want to be left alone because you're cold
hearted and cruel and your ultimate objective is to leave them
alone - them being the people who are genuinely in need.  That
is not in fact what this coalition is about.  In fact, if one
believes in limited government, one has a greater moral obligation
to take care personally of people who are in need than those who
simply assume that the government is going to take care of it
for you.  
<P>
Yet the reality is that the Republican party has a great deal
of trouble with the language of compassion and the language of
values and morals, and I think in large part that problem comes
about from the fact that for the last 30 years caring and compassion
have been code words for larger government programs.  They are
not part of the rhetoric and the debate, and they need to be learned.
<P>
Where do we go from here and what is the future of the revolution?
 As much as we all like to give Newt Gingrich credit for it, I
would contend that the revolution was going to happen eventually
without him in any event, and I would say that the revolution
itself is doing fine while the Republican party may be in some
trouble right now, but I think that it is merely temporary.  
<P>
The revolution was inevitable because of a confluence of external
events. If you look at, for example, communist systems of government,
there was always an original claim made for them that they were
tremendous for productivity.  And if you looked at them in their
early years, there was a tremendous jump in the redistribution
of wealth, and there really was a sort of kick to the economy
as Lenin's crowd came in and redistributed wealth and all the
rest.  The problem is that it didn't last as a system.  It imploded
from its own weight, and I think that we're starting to see the
inevitable outcome of flawed systems.  You're starting to see
the inevitable outcome of an entitlement mentality, both in terms
of the dollars that need to be spent and in terms of the behavior
that it induces.  You're seeing the inevitable outcome of a focus
on groups as opposed to individuals, or on bureaucrats as opposed
to families, or on centralized regulation as opposed to common
sense. It obvious to people that the system itself does not seem
to be working.
<P>
 
<P>
More than that, though, we have an aging demographic and ultimately
that is probably one of the most important variables out there.
 We live in a society which in my lifetime has been completely
dominated by the Baby Boom generation.  When they were young in
the fifties, this was a totally child centered society.  As they
got to be adolescents in the sixties, we got an adolescent culture.
 As they moved through their various life stages in the seventies
and then the eighties, as they got inquisitive, society got inquisitive,
they are now having children.  If there is any factor which is
going to reshape how a society thinks about its future, it's going
to be its concern about raising it's own children, and I guarantee
you that the rules you wanted for you are not the same rules you
want for your children.  
<P>
Ultimately I think we are going to find this new synthesis.  I
suspect it will be through the Republican party, although I do
not make any guarantees that that will be in fact the claim, and
we will hopefully establish a new vision of government that will
itself have moral legitimacy for its limited role and return power
to the people.

<title>The Property Status of Airwaves - PFF</title>

<h2>
The Property Status of Airwaves</h2>
<b>By Ayn Rand</b>
<P>
<blockquote>
<i>
The closing days of the debate over the Telecommunications Act of 1996 saw
the emergence of a hot public policy issue:  The Spectrum.  Should government
sell it or keep it, manage it -- or "dezone" it and let the market decide?
<P>
One question that hasn't been asked is the one Ayn Rand addresses in this
remarkable 1964 article:  What makes it government's property in the first
place?  Her answer:  They stole it fair and square.  Specifically, Secretary
of Commerce Herbert Hoover, in 1927, successfully pushed legislation to
expropriate from America's citizens an asset that now is worth substantially
more than all the public lands outside of Yellowstone, Yosemite and a few
other unique parks.
<P>
Rand's thoughtful analysis not only challenges the current policy of
government ownership and micromanagement of the airwaves; it also raises
fundamental questions about whether government has any right to "sell" the
spectrum.  Or is it a case of trafficking in stolen goods?
<P></i>

Any material element or resource which, in order to become of use or value to
men, requires the application of human knowledge and effort, should be
private property  by the right of those who apply the knowledge and effort.
<P>
This is particularly true of broadcasting frequencies or waves, because they
are produced by human action and do not exist without it.  What exists in
nature is only the potential and the space through which those waves must
travel.
<P>
Just as two trains cannot travel on the same section of track at the same
time, so two broadcasts cannot use the same frequency at the same time in the
same area without "jamming" each other.  There is no difference in principle
between the ownership of land and the ownership of airways.  The only issue
is the task of defining the application of property rights to this particular
sphere.  It is on this task that the American government has failed dismally,
with incalculably disastrous consequences.
<P>
There is no essential difference between a broadcast and a concert; the
former merely transmits sounds over a longer distance and requires more
complex technical equipment.  No one would venture to claim that a pianist
may own his fingers and his piano, but the space inside the concert hall 
through which the sound waves he produces travel  is "public property" and,
therefore, he has no right to give a concert without a license from the
government.   Yet this is the absurdity foisted on our broadcasting industry.
<P>
The chief argument in support of the notion that broadcasting frequencies
should be "public property" has been stated succinctly by Justice
Frankfurter: "(Radio) facilities are limited; they are not available to all
who may wish to use them; the radio spectrum simply is not large enough to
accommodate everybody.  There is a fixed natural limitation upon the number
of stations that can operate without interfering with one another."
<P>
The fallacy of this argument is obvious.  The number of broadcasting
frequencies is limited; so is the number of concert halls; so is the amount
of oil or wheat or diamonds; so is the acreage of land on the surface of the
globe.  There is no material element or value that exists in unlimited
quantities.  And if a "wish" to use a certain "facility" is the criterion of
the right to use it, then the universe is simply not large enough to
accommodate all those who harbor wishes for the unearned.
<P>
It is the proper task of the government to protect individual rights and, as
part of it, to formulate the laws by which governments responsibility to
define the application of individual rights to a given sphere or activity 
to define (i.e., to identify), not to create, invent, donate, or expropriate.
 The question of defining the application of property rights has arisen
frequently, in the wake of major scientific discoveries or inventions, such
as the questions of oil rights, vertical space rights, etc.  In most cases,
the American government was guided by the proper principle: it sought to
protect all the individual rights involved, not to abrogate them.
<P>
A notable example of the proper method of establishing private ownership from
scratch, in a previously ownerless area, is the Homestead Act of 1862, by
which the government opened the western frontier for settlement and turned
"public land" over to private owners.  The government offered a 160-acre farm
to any adult citizen who would settle on it and cultivate it for five years,
after which it would become his property.  Although that land was originally
regarded, in law, as "public property," the method of its allocation, in
fact, followed the proper principle (in fact, but not in explicit ideological
intention).  The citizens did not have to pay the government as if it were an
owner; ownership began with them, and they earned it by the method which is
the source and root of the concept of "property": by working on unused
material resources, by turning a wilderness into a civilized settlement.
 Thus, the government, in this case, was acting not as the owner but as the
custodian of ownerless resources who defines objectively impartial rules by
which potential owners may acquire them.
<P>
This should have been the principle and pattern of the allocation of
broadcasting frequencies.
<P>
As soon as it became apparent that radio broadcasting had opened a new realm
of material resources which, in the absence of legal definitions, would
become a wilderness of clashing individual claims, the government should have
promulgated the equivalent of a Homestead Act of the airways  an act
defining private property rights in  the new realm, establishing the rule
that the user of a radio frequency would own it after he had operated a
station for a certain number of years, and allocating all frequencies by the
rule of priority, i.e., "first come, first served."
<P>
Bear in mind that the development of commercial radio took many years of
struggle and experimentation, and that the goldrush of the "wishers" did not
start until the pioneers  who had taken the risks of venturing into the
unknown  had built it into a bright promise of great commercial value.  By
what right, code, or standard was anyone entitled to that value except the
men who had created it?
<P>
If the government had adhered to the principle of private property rights,
and the pioneers ownership had been legally established, then a latecomer
who wished to acquire a radio station would have had to buy it from one of
the original owners (as is the case with every other type of property).  The
fact that the number of available frequencies was limited would have served,
not to entrench the original owners, but to threaten their hold, if they did
not make the best economic use of their property (which is what free
competition does to every other type of property).  With a limited supply and
a growing demand, competition would have driven the market value of a radio
(and later, TV) station so high that only the most competent men could have
afforded to buy it or to keep it; a man, unable to make a profit, could not
have long afforded to waste so valuable a property.  Who, on a free market,
determines the economic success or failure of an enterprise?  The public (the
public as a sum of individual producers, viewers, and listeners, each making
his own decisions  not  as a single, helpless, disembodied collective with a
few bureaucrats posturing as the spokesmen of its will on earth).
<P>
Contrary to the "argument from scarcity," if you want to make a "limited"
resource available to the whole people, make it private property and throw it
on a free, open market.
<P>
The "argument from scarcity," incidentally, is outdated, even in its literal
meaning; with the discovery of ultra-high frequencies, there are more
broadcasting channels available today than prospective applicants willing to
pioneer in their development.  As usual, the "wishers" seek, not to create,
but to take over the rewards and advantages created by others.
<P>
The history of the collectivization of radio and television demonstrates, in
condensed form, in a kind of microcosm, the process and the causes of
capitalisms destruction.  It is an eloquent illustration of the fact that
capitalism is perishing by the philosophical default of its alleged
defenders.
<P>
Collectivists frequently cite the early years of radio as an example of the
failure of free enterprise.  In those years, when broadcasters had no
property rights in radio, no legal protection or recourse, the airways were a
chaotic no mans land where anyone could use any frequency he pleased and jam
anyone else.  Some professional broadcasters tried to divide their
frequencies by private agreements, which they could not enforce on others;
nor could they fight the interference of stray, maliciously mischievous
amateurs.  This state of affairs was used, then and now, to urge and justify
government control of radio.
<P>
This is an instance of capitalism taking the blame for the evil of its
enemies.
<P>
The chaos of the airways was an example, not of free enterprise, but of
anarchy.  It was caused, not by private property rights, but by their
absence.  It demonstrated why capitalism is incompatible with anarchism, why
men do need a government and what is a governments proper function.  What
was needed was legality, not controls.
<P>
What was imposed was worse than controls: outright nationalization.  By a
gradual, uncontested process  by ideological default  it was taken for
granted that the airways belong to "the people" and are "public property."
<P>
If you want to know the intellectual state of the time, I will ask you to
guess the political ideology of the author of the following quotation:
<P>
Radio communication is not to be considered as merely a business carried on
for private gain, for private advertisement, or for entertainment of the
curious.  It is a public concern impressed with the public trust and to be
considered primarily from the standpoint of public interest in the same
extent and upon the basis of the same general principles as our other public
utilities.
<P>
No, this was not said by a business-hating collectivist eager to establish
the supremacy of the "public interest" over "private gain"; it was not said
by a socialist planner nor by a communist conspirator; it was said by Herbert
Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, in 1924.
<P>
It was Hoover who fought for government control of radio and, as Secretary of
Commerce, made repeated attempts to extend government power beyond the limits
set by the legislation of the time, attempts to attach detailed conditions to
radio licenses, which he had no legal authority to do and which were
repeatedly negated by the courts.  It was Hoovers influence that was largely
responsible for that tombstone of the radio (and the then unborn television)
industry known as the Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio
Commission with all of its autocratic, discretionary, undefined, and
undefinable powers.  (That Act  with minor revisions and amendments,
including the Act of 1934 that changed the Federal Radio Commission into the
Federal Communications Commission  is still, in all essential respects, the
basic legal document ruling the broadcasting industry today.)
<P>
"What we are doing," said F.C.C. Chairman Newton N. Minow in 1962, "did not
begin with the New Frontier."  He was right.
<P>
The Act of 1927 did not confine the government to the role of a traffic
policeman of the air who protects the rights of broadcasters from technical
interference (which is all that was needed and all that a government should
properly do).  It established service to the "public interest, convenience,
or necessity" as the criterion by which the Federal Radio Commission was to
judge applicants for broadcasting licenses and accept or reject them.  Since
there is no such thing as the "public interest" (other than the sum of the
individual interests of individual citizens), since that collectivist
catch-phrase has never been and can never be defined, it amounted to a blank
check on totalitarian power over the broadcasting industry, granted to
whatever bureaucrats happened to be appointed to the Commission.
<P>
"The public interest"  that intellectual knife of collectivisms sacrificial
guillotine, which the operators of the broadcasting stations have to test by
placing their heads on the block every three years  was not raised over
their heads by capitalisms enemies, but by their own leaders.
<P>
It was the so-called "conservatives"  including some of the pioneers, some
of the broadcasting industrys executives who, today, are complaining and
protesting  who ran to the government for regulations and controls, who
cheered the notion of "public property" and service to the "public interest,"
and thus planted the seeds of which Mr. Minow and Mr. Henry are merely the
logical, consistent flowers.  The broadcasting industry was enslaved with the
sanction of the victims  but they were not fully innocent victims.
<P>
Many businessmen, of the mixed-economy persuasion, resent the actual nature
of capitalism; they believe that it is safer to hold a position, not by
right, but by favor; they dread the competition of a free market and they
feel that a bureaucrats friendship is much easier to win.  Pull, not merit,
is their form of "social security."  They believe that they will always
succeed at courting, pressuring, or bribing a bureaucrat, who is "a good
fellow" they can "get along with" and who will protect them from that
merciless stranger: the abler competitor.
<P>
Consider the special privileges to be found in the status of a certified
servant of the "public property."  Not only does it place a man outside the
reach of economic competition, but it also spares him the responsibility and
the costs entailed in private property.  It grants him gratuitously the use
of a broadcasting frequency for which he would have had to pay an enormous
price on a free market and would not have been able to keep for long, if he
sent forth through the air in the kind of unconscionable trash he is sending
forth today.  
<P>
Such are the vested interests made possible by the doctrine of the "public
interest"  and such are the beneficiaries of any form, version, or degree of
the doctrine of "public property."
<P>
Now observe the practical demonstration of the fact that without property
rights, no other rights are possible.  If censorship and the suppression of
free speech ever get established in this country, they will have originated
in radio and television.
<P>
The Act of 1927 granted to a government Commission total power over the
professional fate of broadcasters, with the "public interest" as the
criterion of judgment  and, simultaneously, forbade the Commission to censor
radio programs.  From the start, and progressively louder through the years,
many voices have been pointing out that this is a contradiction impossible to
practice.  If a commissioner has to judge which applicant for a broadcasting
license will best serve the "public interest," how can he judge it without
judging the content, nature, and value of the programs the applicants have
offered or will offer?
<P>
If capitalism had had any proper intellectual defenders, it is they who
should have been loudest in opposing a contradiction of that kind.  But such
was not the case; it was the statists who seized upon it, not in defense of
free speech, but in support of the Commissions "right" to censor programs.
 And, so long as the criterion of the "public interest" stood unchallenged,
logic was on the side of the statists.
<P>
The result was what it had to be (illustrating once more the power of basic
principles): by gradual, unobtrusive, progressively accelerating steps, the
Commission enlarged its control over the content of radio and television
programs  leading to the open threats and ultimatums of Mr. Minow, who
merely made explicit what had been known implicitly for many years.  No, the
Commission did not censor specific programs: it merely took cognizance of
program content at license-renewal time.  What was established was worse than
open censorship (which could be knocked out in a court of law): it was
unprovable, intangible, insidious, censorship-by-displeasure  the usual, and
only, result of any non-objective legislation.<a href="#footer1"><sup>1</sup>
</a>

<P>
All media of communication influence one another.  It is impossible to
compute the extent to which the gray, docile, fear-ridden, appeasement-minded
mediocrity of so powerful a medium as television has contributed to the
demoralization of our culture.
<P>
Nor can the freedom of one medium of communication be destroyed without
affecting all the others.  When censorship of radio and television becomes
fully accepted, as a fait accompli, it will not be long before all the other
media  books, magazines, newspapers, lectures  follow suit, unobtrusively,
unofficially, and by the same method: overtly, in the name of the "public
interest"; covertly, for the fear of government reprisals.  (This process is
taking place already.)
<P>
So much for the relationship of "human" rights to property rights.
<P>
Since "public property" is a collectivist fiction, since the public as a
whole can neither use nor dispose of its "prosperity," that "property" will
always be taken over by some political "elite," by a small clique which will
then rule the public  a public of literal, dispossessed proletarians.
<P>
If you want to gauge a collectivist theorys distance from reality, ask
yourself: by what inconceivable standard can it be claimed that the
broadcasting airways are the property of some illiterate sharecropper who
will never be able to grasp the concept of electronics, or of some hillbilly
whose engineering capacity is not quite sufficient to cope with a corn-liquor
still  and that broadcasting, the product of an incalculable amount of
scientific genius, is to be ruled by the will of such owners?
<P>
Remember that this literally is the alleged principle at the base of the
entire legal structure of our broadcasting industry.
<P>
There is only one solution to this problem, and it has to start at the base;
nothing less will do.  The airways should be turned over to private
ownership.  The only way to do it now is to sell radio and television
frequencies to the highest bidders (by an objectively defined, open,
impartial process)  and thus put an end to the gruesome fiction of "public
property."
<P>
Such a reform cannot be accomplished overnight; it will take a long struggle;
but that is the ultimate goal which the advocates of capitalism should bear
in mind.  That is the only way to correct the disastrous, atavistic error
made by capitalisms alleged defenders.
<P>
I say "atavistic," because it took many centuries before primitive, nomadic
tribes of savages reached the concept of private property  specifically,
land property, which marked the beginning of civilization.  It is a tragic
irony that in the presence of a new realm opened by gigantic achievement of
science, our political and intellectual leaders reverted to the mentality of
primitive nomads and, unable to conceive of property rights, declared the new
realm to be a tribal hunting ground.
<P>
The breach between mans scientific achievements and his ideological
Development is growing wider every day.  It is time to realize that men
cannot keep this up much longer if they continue to retrogress to ideological
savagery with every step of scientific progress.

<title>Plan to Abolish FCC Unveiled
 -- PFF</title>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<H1>Plan to Abolish FCC Unveiled</H1>


<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation today unveiled a plan to abolish the
<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</A> within three years and replace it with a
vastly smaller "Office of Communications Policy."<p>

The comprehensive plan was developed by a working group that includes
representatives from the American Enterprise Institute, The Brookings
Institution, Citizens for a Sound Economy, The Heritage Foundation, The
Hudson Institute, The Manhattan Institute and the University of California.
  The group was led by Progress & Freedom Foundation Chairman <A HREF="/pff/people/director.html">G.A. (Jay)
Keyworth, II</A>, former White House Science Advisor.<p>

"This plan represents the first step in a broader effort to replace the
outmoded regulatory structures of industrial-age government," Foundation
President <A HREF="/pff/people/director.html">Jeffrey Eisenach</A> said in releasing the report.  "The current system
cannot be reformed; it must be replaced, and the FCC is a great place to
start."<p>

"The government in Washington is still operating within a legal framework
designed when AM radio was cutting-edge technology.  If America wants to be
competitive in the global race to build the digital infrastructure of
Cyberspace, then wholesale changes in current policy must occur," added
Keyworth.<p>

The report, "<A HREF="telecom_revolution.html">The Telecom Revolution -- An American Opportunity,</A>" examines
existing statutes, rules and regulations, and offers detailed and specific
recommendations that they either be eliminated immediately, subjected to a
three year sunset provision, or retained but reassigned to the Office of
Communications Policy.<p>

"The FCC has caused endless delays in the adoption of new telecommunications
technology and services, costing the American economy and consumers hundreds
of billions of dollars in lost economic benefits," said Peter Huber of the
Manhattan Institute and a member of the working group.  "I hope Congress will
hold hearings this summer on the 'de-authorization' of the FCC," continued
Huber.<p>

Among the report's main features are:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Streamlining the 2,200-employee FCC into a vastly smaller Office of
Communications Policy.<p>

<LI>Privatizing the government monopoly on spectrum, thereby generating rapid
development of new technologies, new jobs and new services and billions in
revenue for federal deficit reduction.<p>

<LI>Subjecting the telecommunications industry to full competition by
eliminating and repealing government regulations that stifle new products,
new services and new job creation.<p>

<LI>Providing basic dialtone service for the truly needy but replacing the
complex, hidden cross-subsidies scheme with a more efficient and targeted
needs-based system.<p>
</UL>

"All too often, instead of promoting competition and innovation, the FCC is
captured by the forces of the status quo.  Given heightened competition and
the accelerating pace of technological advance, the costs of delay imposed by
the FCC are no longer acceptable," said Peter Pitsch of the Hudson Institute
and also a member of the plan's working group.<P>

Crafted under the auspices of The Progress & Freedom Foundation, a
Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the plan was put together in consultation
with a working group whose members included:<P>

<ul>
<A HREF="/pff/people/director.html">Dr. G.A. Keyworth II</A>, The Progress & Freedom Foundation<br>
<A HREF="/pff/people/director.html">Dr. Jeffrey A. Eisenach</A>, The Progress & Freedom Foundation<br>
David Colton, Esq., The Progress & Freedom Foundation<br>
Dr. Robert Crandall, The Brookings Institution<br>
James Gattuso, Citizens for a Sound Economy<br>
<A HREF="http://polar.ucdavis.edu/new/twh.html">Dr. Thomas W. Hazlett</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</A><br>
Peter W. Huber, Esq., Manhattan Institute<br>
Dr. Thomas Lenard, The Progress & Freedom Foundation<br>
Peter Pitsch, Esq., Hudson Institute<br>
Kenneth Robinson, Esq., telecommunications consultant<br>
J. Gregory Sidak, Esq., American Enterprise Institute<br>
Adam Thierer, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

</ul>

"It is time to consider the creation of a new regime that does not impede
competition in the process of purportedly protecting consumers from a
no-longer existing monopoly," said Robert Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and a working group member.<p>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Internet Law Symposium</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><H3><I>From Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3><H3><CENTER>Click here for information on Internet Law Symposium 95 spekaers,sponsors, program, and how you can order a video of this groundbreakinglegal conference.</CENTER></H3><H1><CENTER><BR>Discovery Welcomes <BR>Internet Law Symposium 95 </CENTER></H1><BR>From Capitol Hill to the streets of Seattle, the Internet is the hottestthing in high technology - and Internet law is suddenly the hottest topicin the legal field. Questions about laws and the Internet are arising asthe new medium begins to realize its potential to transcend terrestrialboundaries. <BR><BR>Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95, October 30-31 in Seattle,Washington is bringing together legal experts from around the world, includingElectronic Frontier Foundation co-founder, John Perry Barlow, and high techanalyst and best-selling author, George Gilder. The Internet Law Symposiumwill pioneer the public policy side of a communications development thatseems destined to transform societies world-wide. <BR><BR><B>Sponsors for the Discovery conference include Perkins Coie, Microsoft,I.B.M., Netscape Communications, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, Forbes ASAP,Dun &amp; Bradstreet, GTE, US West, Corporate Computer, Northwest Nexusand Internet Group, Inc. </B><BR><BR>A key result of the gathering is expected to be formation of a permanentInternet Law Task Force to assess the legal dimensions of issues raisedby the Internet, from intellectual property rights to privacy. <BR><BR>Joining Gilder and Barlow in wrestling with international legal issues willbe Peter Harter, originator of the Internet Law Task Force, Albert Gidari,Discovery Institute Fellow and an attorney at Perkins Coie Seattle law firm,Chuck Marson, legal counsel for Nestcape Communications, Jeffrey Ritter,United Nations Rapporteur and over 25 other legal and Internet experts fromaround the world. By video conference from Washington, D.C., Senator SladeGorton and Rep. Rick White, both of Washington State, will describe thestate of debate in the U.S. capitol. <BR><BR>Evidence of the growing importance of Internet law abounds in scores ofnews reports of online gambling, conflicts on commerical rights, pornography,battles over free speech and civil liberties, and intriguing disagreementsabout intellectual property rights. Every e-mail, every website, every transactionmade over the Internet touches upon some aspect of the law, and in manycases brings forth new questions about the legalities of being online. <BR><BR>Perhaps the most intriguing question now is whether existing laws adequatelymeet the needs of the Internet. Or, is it time that a whole new sector oflaw be created? Internet Law Symposium 95 is the first conference wherethese questions will be addressed on both a domestic and international level,with active involvement from the participants and attendees. <BR><BR>&quot;One of the many problems,&quot; explains keynote speaker, John PerryBarlow, &quot;is that even if new laws need to be written, which they probablydo, it is not clear whether any of the world's governments have clear legalauthority to either write them or enforce them. It appears that most existinglaws, derived as they are for a very different social and commercial environment,may not serve us well as we try to assure order there.&quot;<BR><BR>Government involvement in regulating the Internet is currently one of themost controversial aspects of Internet law. In order to support self-regulationof the Internet, the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) will be officially launchedduring the Symposium. <BR><BR>The ILTF will be the legal policy and norms forum for the Internet, accordingto Peter Harter, Executive Director of the National Public TelecomputingNetwork. Modeled after the highly successful Internet Engineering Task Force,the ILTF will be instrumental in developing a legal framework for the Internet.It will work closely with existing organizations that already have focusedon aspects of Internet law and legislation, and will branch out into newareas that have yet to be examined, Harter explained. <BR><BR>Both the Internet Law Symposium and the ILTF will be working to lay thefoundation necessary for the future of Internet law. By bringing togetherso many legal and technical experts, the Internet Law Symposium is ableto offer interested parties the chance to influence the shape of Internetlaw. Such input will be crucial to companies that seek to sieze the businessadvantages that the Internet can offer. <BR><BR>&quot;Business activity on the Internet is increasing daily,&quot; saidRobert Cumbow, an associate at Perkins Coie and a scheduled speaker at theInternet Law Symposium. &quot;And now is the time the Internet is explodingand people are beginning to explore its possibilities as a means of commerceand transaction. There are a lot of unanswered questions of what one canand cannot do on the Internet, and what kind of liability will apply.&quot;<BR><BR>Even as they rush to establish themselves on the Internet, individuals andcorporations alike are ignorant of the legal ramifications of this new frontier.Now, Continuing Legal Education (CLE) conferences, such as the InternetLaw Symposium 95, that offer professional credit to attorney's who attend,are providing the means for educating Internet users about Internet law.<BR><BR>&quot;There have been a lot of seminars about the Internet for lawyers,&quot;said Cumbow, &quot;but most concentrate on how to use it. The legal communityneeds information on how to advise their clients about Internet issues andproblems, and that is what the Internet Law Symposium proposes to do. Lawyerswho are going to be making the law in this area need to educate themselves,so they can give advice to their clients.&quot;<BR><BR>Discovery plans to keep abreast of Internet law issues after the symposiumand to keep its members informed. For information, call Discovery Instituteat (206) 287-3144 or reach the Institute on the Internet itself at http://www.discovery.org.<BR><HR><BR><H3><CENTER><A HREF="ilsjrn.html">Discovery Journal Fall 1995 Table of Contents</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journal</A><BR><A HREF="views.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image/DIMHG.GIF" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="81"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<P><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<P>SEATTLE-Tourism industry leaders from throughout Cascadia will converge
on Seattle's new convention center June 6-7 to focus efforts on highlighting
the regions attractions worldwide. The Cascadia &quot;mainstreet&quot; region
includes Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tourism is one of the most important regional industries for Cascadia,&quot;
said Cascadia Project Director Bruce Agnew. &quot;By bringing everyone to
one place, to work together on how to promote the region and eliminate cross-border
barriers, this conference will be the key to focusing international attention
on Cascadia as a vacation destination and boosting annual tourism revenues.&quot;<BR>
As the world's tenth largest economy this vast Pacific Northwest region
- which also includes the states of Idaho, Montana, and Alaska as well as
the province of Alberta and the Yukon Territory - boasts tourism revenues
of nearly $20 billion (US$) and more than 100 million people annually visiting
the five states and two provinces and territory that make up Cascadia.<BR>
<BR>
This two day tourism conference, organized with the help of the Cascadia
Tourism Working Group led by the Port of Seattle, will bring together industry
leaders to strategize a regional outline of cooperative efforts, focusing
on off-peak season, to help benefit all of Cascadia. It will feature workshops
and seminars on resort destinations within Cascadia-such as Whistler B.C.
Ecotourism, adventure vacationing and regional sports issues like the Mariners,
Grizzlies, Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Olympic bid will also be among
the topics.<BR>
<BR>
Adam Leipzig, whose company Interscope Communications produced the hit films
Mr. Holland's Opus, Dead Poet's Society, and Good Morning Vietnam, will
talk about marketing the region to the television and movie industry to
increase the use of Cascadia for on-location filming.<BR>
<BR>
Ralph Munro Washington State Secretary of State, Rod Harris British Columbia
Asst. Dep. Minister of Tourism, Julie Courtis of the Oregon Tourism Commission
and Dick West President of Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West will be on hand
to moderate and facilitate discussion on Cascadia tourism and advertising
the region's appeal worldwide. The evening of June 6 will include Tourism
Vancouver's entertainment season program highlighting productions such as
Showboat, as well as the Grizzlies and Canucks.<BR>

<h2>Advancing Medical Innovation: Health, Safety and the Role of Government in the 21st Century</h2>
Remarks by Chairman Thomas Bliley
<P>
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  While I regret that I cannot
be with you in person today, it's nonetheless a pleasure to be
able to talk to you, as you begin your discussions, to shape a
new direction in the nation's thinking about the role of the federal
government in approving and regulating food products, drugs, and
medical devices.
<P>
 Last week, as you all know, we ended a 14-year gridlock, and
enacted sweeping new telecommunications reforms, the first overhaul
of this nation's communications laws since Marconi was alive.
<P>
 It is the most deregulatory bill in history, with an estimated
30 to 80 billion dollars in annual consumer and business benefits.
<P>
 Yesterday, after months of intensive work with the nation's governors
and the Blue Dog Democrats, we were able to secure unanimous,
bipartisan agreement by the governors to a historic restructuring
of the Medicaid and welfare programs.
<P>
 That will move responsibility away from Washington, and back
to the states, so they can deliver health care and welfare benefits
more fairly, more efficiently, and at lower cost.
<P>
 In the days ahead, our Committee will tackle another challenge,
in an effort to modernize the way we regulate foods and health
care products.
<P>
 Our goal here is the same kind of fundamental change that we
saw in telecommunications, and that we are working on in Medicaid
reform.  It is a simple objective.
<P>
 Opening up the marketplace, and stimulating innovation, while
continuing the protections that have afforded Americans a reliable
and safe supply of food, drugs, and medical devices.
<P>
 I certainly don't need to tell the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation
about the fundamental problems that exist in our nation's system
for regulating food and health care products.  I've heard them
in congressional hearings, and in countless meetings with my constituents.
<P>
 Your Foundation has described them in the report you issued today.
 We all want to stimulate innovation and development of lifesaving
new medicine and devices, and we all want them brought to the
patients who need them as quickly as possible.
<P>
 And we all want to continue consumer confidence in the safety
of those products.  We want the doctors and medical researchers
to communicate, to disseminate information, so patients can benefit
from the experience of others.
<P>
 But those goals are not achieved by the current regulatory structure.
 To accomplish those goals, we need fundamental structural change.
<P>
 My objective is a system of oversight of food and health care
products, in the 21st century, that is capable of matching the
developments that 21st century medical technology will doubtless
provide.
<P>
 The Progress and Freedom Foundation today will set forth a proposal
that seeks to establish a more efficient and innovative mechanism
to get safe products to the marketplace more quickly.
<P>
 One that utilizes private sector know-how to help meet the need
for government oversight.  The idea is not a new one, as you will
hear later today.
<P>
 Europe has had enormous success using private sector organizations
to conduct product reviews, reviews that, in the United States,
are exclusively being done by the FDA.
<P>
 Indeed, in other areas of government oversight, the United States
has already taken advantage of private-public cooperation.  In
fact, a substantial proportion of the foods that come under FDA's
jurisdiction are already overseen by nine federal organizations.
<P>
 I have yet to hear a good reason why safety reviews shouldn't
be performed by the private sector, or why safety practices cannot
be self-certified, or certified by third party inspection.
<P>
 In fact, President Clinton himself has proposed self-certification,
third party reviews of worker safety procedures.
<P>
 We have vast experience with third party reviews in the world's
greatest biomedical research institution, the National Institutes
of Health.  The NIH has achieved preeminence with a model using
non-governmental expertise to make research funding decisions.
<P>
 And its world-class research is conducted primarily by non-federal
research organizations.  There's no reason we should not turn
to those same scientists and institutions to help us better evaluate
new products.
<P>
 The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation today proposes a responsible
system of product review that keeps the federal government in
the critical role of deciding which products should go to market,
but which places greater reliance on private sector incentives
to drive the review process.  It ensures that government will
be involved only when necessary.
<P>
 For example, the simplest medical devices should not need to
undergo additional government approval, if they have already been
accepted by independent, private sector review organizations as
meeting clearly established, rigorous government standards.
<P>
 I want you to know that the Committee on Commerce will continue
to vigorously address the need for fundamental reform at the FDA.
<P>
 Chairman Barton has already held a series of Oversight and Investigative
Subcommittee hearings, in this regard and those hearings have
shown an agency in need of serious reform.
<P>
 Once Congress returns to Washington, later this month, I anticipate
further hearings in both the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee,
and in Chairman Balarakis' Health Subcommittee, where we will
hear the views of distinguished Americans on what is wrong with
FDA, and what we should do about it.
<P>
 And I expect we will focus much of our attention on a system
for third party review.  I anticipate the first legislative hearing
will be held on February 27th.
<P>
 A number of FDA reform bills have already been introduced in
this Congress, and I expect to see several more, from members
of the Commerce Committee, that address the need for specific
reform in the areas of medical devices, drugs, biologics, and
food.
<P>
 An essential element of those proposals will be to assure that
the regulatory program for each category of products is suitable
for the particular product involved.
<P>
 Issues of safety and effectiveness are different, after all,
for each category of products.  And the regulation of each should
be no greater and no less than what is reasonably required.
<P>
 We should always strive to eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens,
and that means a level of federal regulation no greater than is
appropriate, given the circumstances.
<P>
 Finally, and most importantly, let me assure each of you that
our regulatory proposals will allow greater, more reasonable reliance
on appropriate, non-governmental organizations to conduct product
reviews under appropriate FDA oversight.
<P>
 We will retain the FDA's critical role in monitoring the review
process, and ensuring compliance, but we will examine mechanisms
to transfer the reviews themselves to third party organizations
wherever appropriate.
<P>
 Again, I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak to you
this morning, even if not in person.  You have helped me, and
my Committee with your work today, and I am grateful.  Thank you,
and God bless you all.

<P><br>

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

An Open Memo from Tom Lenard Summarizing PFF's Environmental Roundtable -- 4/21/96

<a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<P><br><br>

<P>
<B>Date:</B>March
21, 1996<br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">To:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Interested
Partiers </FONT><br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">From:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Thomas
Lenard, Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies</FONT><br>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">RE:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Summary
of Discussion at March 18, 1996, Environment Roundtable</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is a general consensus that the environment
has improved significantly over the last quarter century, as a
result of many factors including, but not limited to, government
programs.  The nation has in fact gotten something for the hundreds
of billions of dollars that it spends each year on the environment,
though not as much as it should have.  Our environmental policies
have from the outset been subject to criticism for their reliance
on rigid, command-and-control methods that stifle innovation and
the development of new technologies.  With more flexible, better-designed
policies, we could be getting much greater environmental benefits
and more economic growth at the same time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In an increasingly dynamic economy, the current
framework of environmental regulation is viewed as an increasingly
burdensome &quot;dinosaur.&quot;  As one of the participants observed,
the dinosaur, full of bones and therefore inflexible, did not
survive.  In contrast, the shark, a contemporary of the dinosaur,
had no bones, only cartilage, and has survived to modern times.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">MESSAGE<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There was widespread agreement at the roundtable
that proponents of change have not developed an effective way
of communicating with a population that is strongly environmentalist.
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">There was also agreement that the message
should focus on our ability to do a better job of providing environmental
benefits and on what a better environment means - not that we
can do it at lower cost.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, focusing on excessive regulatory
costs and the need to base regulations on good risk and cost-benefit
analysis does not resonate with the public.  In fact, it is likely
that lower costs translates into lower benefits in many people's
minds.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">DEVELOPING A REPLACEMENT<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A prerequisite to developing a good message
is developing a vision of the direction in which environmental
policy should go, as well as some specific policy proposals. 
<I>Criticizing the existing framework without proposing something
to replace it is not persuasive</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The business community has strongly supported
regulatory reform legislation, which had tough sledding in 1995
because it was proposed in a vision vacuum and was perceived (and
sometimes promoted) as a rollback of existing protections.  In
fact, the payoff to regulatory reform legislation is probably
overstated, because it is based on the assumption that we can
mandate regulation that is well-informed and rational.  This has
never been the case in any regulatory context, and there is no
reason to expect it now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Rather, <I>the challenge is to establish institutions
that create the right incentives to produce environmental benefits</I>
- but with appropriate incentives to also incorporate other values.
 Environmental policies should be more flexible, focus on outputs
rather than inputs, and rely to a much greater extent on property
rights and market-oriented approaches.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">EXAMPLES<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There was substantial support for devolving
environmental responsibilities to the states, and for the view
that this frequently leads to better decisions, because costs
and benefits are borne by the same population.  A recurring theme
was that the states are more receptive to new ideas and have adopted
them more readily than has the federal government.  For example:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">North Carolina's Tar-Pimlico River Basin
Association is North America's only operating river association
that brings together point and nonpoint sources of pollution in
a combined trading effort to reduce discharges into a river. 
This approach, which is common elsewhere, is based on property
rights and contracts and was achieved with the support of the
Environmental Defense Fund.  River basin managers monitor outcomes
- the quality of the river - and the responsibility of paying
for damages disciplines polluters.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The state of Pennsylvania now accepts ISO
14000 certification, which frequently is necessary for trading
in world markets, as a substitute for evidence that firms meet
Pennsylvania standards.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Numerous other examples, not necessarily new,
of ways to provide a better incentive structure were discussed:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Performance goals should be established
with complete flexibility to meet those goals in the most efficient
manner.  This rewards rather than penalizes innovation.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Auditing programs should provide an incentive
to uncover problems and provide solutions.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Positive incentives should be provided
to landowners for habitat conservation and wildlife protection,
through creation of markets or by bringing the costs of environmental
amenities on-budget.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, we can learn something from the Europeans,
who frequently deal with environmental issues in a less contentious
and litigious fashion than we do here.  For example, the European
system for dealing with abandoned hazardous waste sites is actually
producing results.  Depending on the level of the hazard, sites
are being contained or mitigated, sometimes at public expense,
and returned to appropriate uses.</FONT>

<H4>Not long ago, the American Jewish experience was a rich and distinctive
culture.  Now it has been so mainstreamed that temples are holding sessions

Has American Judaism lost its roots?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Dr. Philip Gold<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="gldbar2b.gif" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</H3>
<BR>
Modern American spirituality is a lot like Interstate Five. Everybody seems
to be on it. Nearly everybody's changing lanes. The road signs are large
but not always helpful. Entry and exit can be tricky. If you drive long
enough you end up in Canada &shyp; decent and pleasant, though not often
inspiring. But if you drive long enough the other way, you find yourself
in . . . well, California.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, American Judaism took to the interstates. Specifically, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), the major Reform organization,
began offering &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; outreach seminars, designed
for anyone with any kind of interest in the subject. Seattle was the 16th
city on the UAHC list. From March through May of this year, thirteen sessions
were conducted at area Reform temples.<BR>
<BR>
I became aware of the program through an ad in the EastsideWeek. <I>A  Three
Session </I>Journey &shyp; Come <I>Share</I>. The simple invitation accessed
some files I thought I'd deleted decades earlier. Not an entirely  pleasant
retrieval. Despite, or perhaps because of the discomfort, I made the phone
call. For the first time since 1973 (a bizarre Passover <I>seder</I> in
the Marines) I would enter a Jewish activity. Just to check up on the tribe,
I told myself. Just to see if  anything had changed.<BR>
<BR>
Nothing had. And, perhaps, everything. And, perhaps, much more than the
tribe was involved.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
To anyone over 40 with knowledge of the American Jewish experience &shyp;
my own background was Orthodox, intensely ethnic/Yiddish, and included yeshiva
time &shyp; the most striking aspect of the current situation is what's
no longer there. The old ethnicity: gone. This was, of course, inevitable.
The immigrant generations have passed, and with them their dialects, their
neighborhoods, their ways. And so have most of those who knew them well,
and who participated in American Jewry's version of the Eternal Triangle:
the three-generation struggle of immigrants, their conflicted, striving
children, and their affluent, baby-boomer-bratty grandkids to adapt and
succeed, yet  keep the faith available.<BR>
<BR>
Reform Judaism began in Europe two centuries ago as an avant-gardish, highly
intellectualized attempt to bring Judaism into the modern world, to offer
alternatives to the tradition-encrusted Orthodoxies of  the  ghetto and
the ghetto mentality. In the United States, Reform became a  pensive half-way
house for ambitious immigrant children, eager to shed their parents' ways
yet unwilling or unable to discard the old faith entirely. A Yiddish joke
tells of a conversation between an old Orthodox mother and her successful
Reform son. Do you still keep Kosher, Hymie? No, Mother. Do you still go
to <I>shul? </I>No, Mother. Do you date Jewish girls? No, Mother.<BR>
<BR>
So tell me, Hymie. Are you still circumcised?<BR>
<BR>
Beneath the humor, the anguish of  a past, no longer visible. Some one else's
war.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also, the Holocaust as an omnipresent, suffocating yet binding American
Jewish reality. The memory's been institutionalized and, to some extent,
denatured. It has to be to survive beyond the lives of those who knew it,
and of it, personally. There's the museum in Washington, D.C., its power
fittingly unspeakable. There's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and a healthy
academic and literary output. But the Holocaust  memory-as-solidarity is
different when the European branch of your family ended up in Auschwitz
and you learn the details from those who knew and mourn them. It's different
when the woman next door has a number on her arm that she neither conceals
nor talks about, and three houses up, the couple from Dachau  won't let
their kid out of their sight and on quiet nights you can hear their dream-screaming,
<I>Gangsters</I>! <I>Teuffeln!</I> and your street's more or less like the
rest of the neighborhood in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also: Israel &shyp; or, at least, the pre-1967, or pre-1982, or pre-1996
wide-eyed adoration and unquestioning support. &quot;Exodus,&quot; Leon
Uris' perennial seller about the creation of the Jewish state, used to be
dismissable as bad fiction. Now it's obscene.<BR>
<BR>
But, most of all, American Judaism no longer seems quite so special, American
Jews no longer quite so intriguing. Certainly, chunks of the old culture
have been mainstreamed. Jewish humor's everywhere; Yakov Smirnoff now works
The Nashville Network. There are probably more varieties of bagels in Seattle
than synagogues. But by the standards of the 1950s/1960s, when a confluence
of forces (Israel, the Holocaust, economic and intellectual success, the
waning of the more virulent anti-Semitisms) made Jews a fashionable minority,
it's over. And today, despite the well-hyped pronouncements of Mr. Farrakhan,
a few militia G-mo's, and some armed-and-ugly confrontations back east,
Jews don't get persecuted much anymore. Indeed, by the standards of the
1950s/1960s, most American Jews don't even seem all that interested in each
other, or themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Some years ago, the UAHC noticed this. Their sociological and statistical
researches showed that over half of all American Jews consider themselves
unaffiliated with any form of  organized Judaism. Over half of all Jews
now marry outside the faith. If present trends continue, American Jewry
could constitute less than one percent of the population within a couple
of decades.<BR>
<BR>
So the UAHC took the first step toward renaissance. They got a grant. Then
they put together &quot;A Taste of Judaism.&quot;  Kathryn Kahn, the national
program co-ordinator and assistant director of the UAHC's Commission on
Reform Jewish Outreach in New York, says that much of the material derived
from previous experiences working with lapsed Jews wandering home and interfaith
couples in which the Jewish partner wanted to cling to some part of the
tradition, but couldn't articulate why. &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; would
take it national.<BR>
<BR>
Says Kahn: &quot;We wanted to set up a barrier-free program. No cost. No
books. No homework. A minimal investment in time. We wanted to let Judaism
speak for itself. We started out with the three Jewish verities of God,
Torah, and Israel. But we felt that might be a little formidable, so we
changed it to Spirituality, Ethics, Community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Kahn, the program's success astonished even its creators. &quot;We
ran ads in secular publications. They weren't professionally done. People
said the ads just jumped off the page at them. Since 1994, we've had over
4000 people take the seminar. We're just starting to send out a major survey,
asking people at least six months out of the course, 'What Jewish choices
have you made?' We may never know the full impact. But we've had conversions,
temple joinings, many levels of response.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pam Waechter, the program's Seattle-area co-ordinator, says that the series
drew over 850 queries. 470 people took this year's offerings; there's a
waiting list for 1997. She adds that much of the interest here came from
adult children of interfaith marriages who'd been raised as Christians,
or in no tradition. <BR>
<BR>
So perhaps American Jews are still interested; all they need to re-up is
just some no-heavy-lifting spirituality. Or perhaps it's part of something
larger, a more general American returning to God and roots.<BR>
<BR>
In part, no doubt. But the most striking aspect of the &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot;
was that, within the context of Reform Judaism's oddly constricted view
of things, and beneath the back-to-faith patina, the class was doing something
of which it seemed utterly unaware. Of course, there was no way for them
to know that they were engaging in an ethical exercise of pagan origin which
could well provide the moral basis for 21st century American civilization,
Jewish, Christian, humanist, and a whole lot else.<BR>
<BR>
But first, let's  look at it the old-fashioned way.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Twenty-five people show up at Temple D'Hirsch Sinai on Pike Street. During
the obligatory self-introductions, more describe themselves as &quot;recovering
Catholics&quot; than wayward Jews. There's a cute little blonde who's pondering
conversion, some interfaith couples (one very pregnant), a Mercer Island
Episcopalian woman now dating a Jew, a black gentleman of the Ba'hai faith,
professing curiosity. A few others, Gentiles, mention curiosity; they either
 want to understand their Jewish friends, or have no Jewish friends but
want to understand, anyway. No one would mistake this crowd for refugees
from the club scene. They're older, serious, earnest.<BR>
<BR>
There's no strict curriculum. According to Kahn, the instructors were &quot;asked
to pick passages [from the Torah and other literature] that they feel passionate
about, and to talk on those.&quot; The temple provides the instructors:<BR>
<BR>
Associate Rabbi Beth Singer, one of those clergypersons who can't pronounce
her title without italicizing it and who, on ordination day, must have been
issued an inexhaustible supply of timed-release sincerity capsules. She'll
do Spirituality  (the session originally designated, &quot;God&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick, a retired public school teacher now working as the temple's
director of education. <I>(Gott i</I>n<I> Himme</I>l, he looks just like
my Uncle Milton). Chernick's the teacher everybody had once, if they were
lucky, the lively guy who humanized the course they dreaded taking. He was
also Chaucer's clerk in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; &shyp; &quot;Glad
would he teach, and gladly learn.&quot; He'll handle Ethics (formerly known
as &quot;Torah&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
Cantor Kenneth Koransky, a South African-emigre with an international reputation
and a passion for the people he sings for. He'll teach Community. Israel
receives mention as a place where Israelis do not follow the traditional
ways.<BR>
<BR>
The course is designed to entice people to Judaism,  not to confer advanced
degrees or conduct Talmudic disputations. But, almost immediately, two intellectual
weaknesses become apparent. One is an astonishing lack of basic knowledge
among the instructors, far in excess of the usual podium tongue-slippages.
One does not expect to hear from an ordained rabbi that King David built
the First Temple or that &quot;parts&quot; of the Hebrew Bible are found
in the Christian Old Testament. The class, properly more concerned with
impact than with trivia, says little about it. At one point in his session,
Koransky asks aloud why he keeps turning to me for answers, and muses that
I look like a rabbi, sent to spy on the proceedings. I'm not, I tell him.
I'm far worse. I'm a journalist.<BR>
<BR>
And don't mess with me, man. I been to<I> cheder</I>.<BR>
<BR>
The second flaw, and the second astonishment, concerns more substantive
matters. Reform has always tended toward a certain self-satisfied  parochialism:
part 19th century social gospel, part anachronistic New Deal liberalism,
part 60s time warp, with PC aplenty for spice. The positions, and the posturing,
hadn't changed one iota in thirty years.  The great sin of the Pharisees
&shyp; the  pride-in-goodness which even Jesus found incorrigible &shyp;
still resides among those who've done their best, for centuries, to distance
themselves from the Pharisees' putative descendants.<BR>
<BR>
Rabbi Singer leads off. She assures the room that she will be &quot;nonjudgmental&quot;
and &quot;noncoercive.&quot; She flits over a selection of quotations compiled
by a Rabbi Rossove of Temple Israel, Hollywood, CA. She tells the class
that Judaism is &quot;experiential,&quot; that you don't have to believe
in God to be a good Jew, as long as you feel it. She calls Orthodox Jews
&quot;fundamentalists&quot; &shyp; the first time I've ever heard one Jew
apply that inappropriate epithet to another. She asserts that, as far as
the old ways go, &quot;We take what makes sense to us and skip over the
rest.&quot; Some things &shyp; homosexuality and women, for example, &quot;they
just didn't understand the way we do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Concludes Rabbi Singer: &quot;Sometimes I wish I could go through the Torah
with a bottle of White-Out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Then &shyp; wink/wink, giggle/giggle &shyp; &quot;Don't quote me on that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I decide to write. After class,  I identify myself to her as a journalist
and ask for a one-on-one follow-up interview to discuss her teachings. She
tells me how busy she is. A few weeks later, I leave another request on
her voice mail. Two days after, a woman from the temple calls. Rabbi Singer
wants to investigate my background before &quot;granting an interview.&quot;
The next day, another woman checks in. Rabbi Singer will be unable to schedule
anything, but I am authorized to write that she &quot;enjoyed teaching the
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reform seminaries, if they do not already do so, might consider offering
instruction in media relations.<BR>
<BR>
(Author's note: Before sending this article off into cyberspace, Rabbi Singer
received a third interview request. She did not respond.)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick takes Ethics. He's excellent on expounding Jewish notions of
the sacralized life. You can sleep with your girl friend and it's not a
sin. But it's better if you do it married. You can eat your food without
a blessing, but it's better to say a little grace. No, you don't have to
believe in God, or in any particular conception of God, but we do insist
on monotheism and we do these things because God commands them.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming God exists.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick teaches with fervor that the essence of Jewish ethics is how
we treat each other, and how we work to bring on the Messianic Age that
may or may not require a physical Messiah.<I> Tikku</I>n<I> Ola</I>m. Repair
of the world. We must do this for the poor. We must do that for the environment.
I ask him if this ethic mandates any particular political ideology or action.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You bet it does. We don't have to get into the details here, but everybody
knows what they are. We have an obligation to insist that our government
reach where we can't. We have to be sure that our government is acting as
ethically as we are. If we're going to be holy, we have to use every venue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I don't respond that Jerry Falwell couldn't have put it any better. A few
days later, at lunch, I ask him to elaborate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, if caring about other people means you're a liberal, then I'm
a liberal. If not caring means you're a conservative . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Does caring require fealty to any particular bureaucracy or way of doing
things?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, obviously not . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OK. This guy's sincere. In Jewish ethics, civility comes before scoring
points.<BR>
<BR>
Koransky, in class and on the phone later, proves the most challenging.
&quot;A Jew can eat a ham sandwich on Yom Kippur,&quot; he says, &quot;and
still be a Jew. Not a good Jew, but a Jew. You can disbelieve in God and
still be a Jew. But you can't be a Jew by yourself. Without the synagogue,
what does the Jew have?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I ask him whether a Jew can acknowledge his identity and heritage and believe
in God, but not care for the company of his fellows.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jewish self-hatred is an old thing. So is social-climbing. So is disagreement.
Once, two Jews were stranded on a desert island. A few years later, a ship
happened by and rescued them. One of their rescuers noticed that they'd
built three synagogues. He asked why. 'Well,' one of the Jews said. 'That's
the synagogue I attend. That's the synagogue he attends. And that's the
synagogue neither of us would be caught dead in.'<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The unaffiliated Jew,&quot; he concludes, &quot;just hasn't come home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
No exceptions?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't be a Jew in a vacuum.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Still, there are vacuums and vacuums. Solitude is not the worst. Far more
vacuous (forgive the pun) is so much of what passes for modern American
religious questing &shyp; the endless shopping down at the spiritual supermall,
looking for just the right accessories for just the right spiritual life-style,
and for that perfect, nonjudgmental, noncoercive, get-the-White-Out deity.
 Seen in this sense, Reform Judaism's just one more boutique.<BR>
<BR>
Yet seen in another, exactly the opposite is true. Throughout this century,
the Orthodox Jewish rap against Reform was that they wanted to be Jews without
doing the hard Jewish work, indeed, to be Jews without being anything Jewish
in particular.  The yeshiva boys might drive you crazy, but at least you
knew where to find them. Reform wasn't Judaism. It was warm-and-fuzzy, feel-good
religion; it was an accommodation of convenience for life among the<I> goyim</I>.
In the end, to borrow a phrase, there was no &quot;there&quot; there.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick disagrees vehemently. The people he deals with, especially
in his adult education classes, aren't dilettantes. They're determined to
find a way to make Judaism a real presence in their real lives. Their what
to leave in/what to leave out decisions are based on personal and family
needs, not fashion or whim. I got the same sense with the people in the
seminar &shyp; that the question on their minds was neither what's hot nor
what's not, but<I> How shall I liv</I>e?<BR>
<BR>
And therein lies the possible ethical future of this land.<BR>
<BR>
To explain:<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the only civilization in history to adopt, as its de
facto official value-system, &quot;How do I feel, especially about myself?&quot;
No other culture has ever elevated feeling &shyp; emotion beyond all external
validation or linkage to the outer world --  to the status of an absolute.
Most would have considered it insane. It doesn't work. The wreckage of the
attempt lies all about us: failed marriages and relationships, failed politics,
the culture of anarcho-banality, the endless immersion in the formulaic
pornographies of violated flesh and spirit.<BR>
<BR>
But for those who wish to move beyond the failed American psychobondage,
modern ethics offers only two alternatives, neither really workable. One
is submission to some external authority, technically known as the deontological
approach. What does the Pope say? What does the Torah say? What does the
Party say? How would Dan Quayle, or Hillary Clinton, handle this situation?
What would Arnold Schwarzenegger think of me?<BR>
<BR>
What is the law?<BR>
<BR>
Some folks need to submit. Others choose to do so, often in the belief that
they're returning to &quot;tradition.&quot; or doing it for the sake of
the kids, or just to structure their lives. But a multicultural, essentially
libertarian society doesn't have this option. As far as the rules go, one
size no longer fits all.<BR>
<BR>
The other modern ethical alternative is to live by trying to predict the
results of one's actions. But consequentialism doesn't work much better.
No one can know all the implications, or control all the results. Should
I marry Jack or Jill? If I give this street person money, will she use it
for food or drugs? At the political level, consequentialism leads from inept,
intrusive social engineering to the tyrannies of  &quot;the greatest good
for the greatest number.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there is a third alternative, slowly emerging from centuries of obscurity.
Its technical moniker is &quot;virtue-ethics&quot;.  It first regained general
notice in the 1970s, with the publication of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre's<I>
After Virtu</I>e. Since then, its most effective expositors have been classicists
and philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum <I> (The Therap</I>y<I> of Desire</I>)
 and Julia Anna<I>s (The Morality of Happiness)</I> &shyp; women writing
for a general audience, but also seeking  an ethic for women of the post-feminist
era. During the Vietnam War, virtue-ethics were practiced by the American
prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton. Admiral James Stockdale, who won the Medal
of Honor for his prison leadership and who once described himself as &quot;the
lawgiver of an autonomous colony of Americans who happened to be located
in a Hanoi prison,&quot; had studied virtue-ethics in graduate school. His
extensive writings on how he and his comrades adapted and applied them in
prison were totally ignored by the media during  and after Stockdale's painful
performance in the 1992 vice-presidential debates. (For the record: Jim
Stockdale introduced me to the field, first in his writings, then in a series
of personal conversations and letters in the 1980s. Everybody should have
the opportunity to get to know a great man or woman, at least once.)  <I>
</I><BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, the relevant question is neither &quot;What are the rules?&quot;
nor &quot;What are the consequences?&quot; It is certainly not, &quot;How
do I feel?&quot; Nor does it have much to do with the currently fashionable
&quot;Books of Virtues&quot; available in the bibliotherapy section of your
local bookstore. The vital question is &quot;How should I live?&quot; Rules,
emotions, consequences all matter, but only as guides. The North Vietnamese,
for example, did not want to torture their prisoners. They wanted information,
propaganda statements, help in breaking other prisoners. The torture decision
was American. Knowing full well that, in the torture room, they would ultimately
submit, they nonetheless decided that<I> their live</I>s required them to
take torture before surrender . . . and then to start the whole hideous
process again the next time.<BR>
<BR>
Virtue-ethics is a Hellenistic creation. It dominated the final centuries
of antiquity. It comes in many forms, among them the Aristotelian, Epicurean,
Stoic. It leaves many concepts vague. Virtue-ethics provides no answers
to the question it poses: How shall I live? It does offer ways of finding
answers.<BR>
<BR>
An Aristotelian might hold that virtue is the &quot;golden mean,&quot; that
midpoint between excess and defect in any character trait. Courage, for
example, would be the mean between cowardice and rashness. The wise woman
would then apply this trait to the situations of her life. An Epicurean
might hold that, since the world is a meaningless jumble of atoms and random
events, and since the gods either don't know we're around or else don't
give a damn, the wise person maximizes his or her own pleasure &shyp; but
only in ways that don't cause painful and anxious dependence on that pleasure.
 Curiously, the virtue-ethic most appropriate to a libertarian, multicultural
society &shyp; a society desperately trying to amend its materialistic,
planet-trashing ways &shyp; might well be an updated Stoicism.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism today connotes little more than heroism in the dentist's chair,
or taking the bad news in a certain way, on maybe Mr. Spock on the bridge
of the Enterprise. In reality, it's far more subtle.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism was founded in the third century, BC by Zeno, a native of Cyprus,
an  island with a large Jewish community. The doctrine received its name
from the Stoa, or colonnade in Athens, where he held forth. Its most famous
expositors were a Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and a Greek slave, Epictetus.
Stoicism, the most popular of the philosophies of late antiquity, filled
that half-millennium gap between the waning of the pagan gods and the rise
of Christianity. Many of its concepts were, in fact, taken into the new
faith. And many of its concepts have an oddly Jewish intinction.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism holds that there is indeed deity in the universe. Most often that
deity is pantheistic, present throughout creation but with no separate existence.
Yet Stoicism also allows for other gods, capable of suffusing human affairs.
 Stoic cosmology bears an eerie likeness to the current Big Bang theory.
And the Stoic insistence that the universe is an inter-related whole, with
that condition conferring ineluctable responsibilities on humanity, anticipates
modern deep ecology by two thousand years.<BR>
<BR>
But what matters here is the Stoic answer to the question, &quot;How shall
I live?&quot; Stoicism doesn't say, &quot;Be rid of your feelings.&quot;
It does say, &quot;Don't let your feelings &shyp; especially certain kinds
of feelings &shyp; jerk you around.&quot; Stoicism holds that the only thing
we can truly call our own is our will (or, if you prefer, intellect or spirit).
All else is beyond our control, and therefore, in technical terms, &quot;indifferent.&quot;
But some indifferents are clearly to be preferred to others, because we
are creatures inextricably involved with our fellows,, with the environment,
with deity. What form those relationships take depends on chance and circumstance.
Stoicism, for example, would never say, &quot;Get married. Have kids.&quot;
It would say, &quot;Whatever you choose, you cannot escape the responsibilities
to yourself and others inherent in that choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Epictetus put it, &quot;Let whatever seems to you the best, be to you
an inviolable rule.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Or Marcus Aurelius, writing his own creed: &quot;The man who values a soul
that is rational and universal and social no longer cares for anything else,
but aims solely at keeping the temper of his own soul and all its activities
rational and social, and works together with his fellows to this end. .
. . I have a city and I have a country; as Marcus I have Rome, and as a
human being I have the universe; and consequently what is beneficial to
these communities is the sole good for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But only Epictetus could decide what was the inviolable rule for Epictetus,
and only Marcus could make the final decision in what Marcus would do about
it.      <BR>
<BR>
In this sense, Reform Judaism is a something of a Stoic virtue-ethic. God
remains vague. A Jew can accept anything from a personal deity to a suffusion
of the universe with ethical implications. Laws and traditions offer guidance
only, even if their origin is taken as divine. The sovereign individual
reasons, asks,<I> listen</I>s, and decides. And &shyp; a fundamental tenet
of nearly all virtue-based systems -- this sovereign deciding leads the
individual, in the end, to the conclusion that others, and community, and
planet, and deity, make legitimate claims.<BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, you can't be  sovereign &shyp; or human &shyp; in a vacuum.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot; people see themselves as participating
in, and encouraging, a return to tradition. Perhaps it would be more accurate
to say that they're returning to a blending of traditions. Or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that all ages blend traditions, whether they
care it admit it or not. We live amid a mingling of strange gods. But then,
so did Abraham, and Moses, and Aristotle, and Jesus. As for virtue-ethics,
you don't have to be pagan to understand, or practice it.<BR>
<BR>
You also don't have to be Jewish.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>When most of us think of the controversy over evolution</B>
in the public schools, we are likely to think of fundamentalists pulling
teachers from their classrooms and placing them in the dock. Images from
the infamous Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial of 1925 come to mind. Unfortunately,
intolerance of this sort has shown itself in California in the 1990s as
a result of students complaining about a biology instructor. Unlike the
original Scopes case, however, thiscase involves a distinguished biology
professor at a major university -- indeed, an acknowledged expert on evolutionary
theory. Also unlike Scopes, the teacher was forbidden to teach his course
not because he taught evolutionary theory (which he did) but because he
offered a critical assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
The controversy first emerged last fall after Dean Kenyon, a biology professor
at San Francisco State University, was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot;
by John Hafernik, the chairman of his biology department. Mr. Kenyon, who
included three lectures in biological origins in his introductory course,
had for many years made a practice of exposing students to both evolutionary
theory and evidence uncongenial to it. He also discussed the philosophical
controversies raised by the issue and his own view that living systems display
evidence of intelligent design -- a view not incompatible with some forms
of evolutionary thinking. <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Hafernik accused Mr. Kenyon of teaching what he characterized as biblical
creationism and ordered him to stop. <BR>
<BR>
After Mr. Hafernik's decree, Mr. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote
the dean, Jim Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kelley replied by insisting that Mr. Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view,&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation
on a young earth.&quot; Mr. Kenyon replied again (I paraphrase): I do teach
the dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and
that some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. <BR>
<BR>
He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching introductory
biology and reassigned to labs. <BR>
<BR>
There are several disturbing aspects to this story: <BR>
<BR>
First, Mr. Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary theory and the
scientific study of the origin of life. He has a Ph.D. in biophysics from
Stanford and is the co-author of a seminal theoretical work titled &quot;Biochemical
Predestination&quot; (1969). The<BR>
book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific publications
on the origin-of-life problem. But by the late 1970s, Mr. Kenyon began to
question some of his own earlier ideas. Experiments (some performed by Mr.
Kenyon himself) increasingly contradicted the dominant view in his field.
Laboratory work suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves
into complex information-bearing molecules such as DNA -- without, that
is, &quot;guidance&quot; from human experimenters. <BR>
<BR>
To Mr. Kenyon and others, such results raised important questions about
how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was. If undirected
chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information found
in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence have
played a role? By the 1980s, Mr. Kenyon had adopted the second view. <BR>
<BR>
That a man of Mr. Kenyon's stature should now be forced to lobby<BR>
for the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of
origins, is absurdly comic. Mr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in
the world about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research
scientists. Yet he now finds that he may not report the negative results
of research or give students his candid assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
What is more, the simplistic labeling of Mr. Kenyon's statements as &quot;religion&quot;
and the strictly materialistic view as &quot;scientific&quot; seems entirely
unwarranted, especially given the philosophical overtones of much origins
theory. Biology texts routinely recapitulate Darwinian arguments against
intelligent design. Yet if arguments against intelligent design are philosophically
neutral and strictly scientific, why are Mr. Kenyon's arguments for intelligent
design inherently unscientific and religiously charged? In seeking the best
explanation for evidence, Mr. Kenyon has employed the same method of reasoning
as before he changed his view. His conclusions, not his methods, have changed.
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is that in biological origins theory, dominant players currently
insist on a rigidly materialistic mode of explanation -- even when, as Mr.
Kenyon maintains, explanation of the evidence requires more than the limited
powers of brute matter. Such intellectual strictures reflect the very essence
of political correctness: the suppression of critical discourse by enforced
rules of thought. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, San Francisco State University's Academic Freedom Committee
has come to a similar conclusion, ruling decisively this summer in Mr. Kenyon's
favor. The committee determined that, according to university guidelines,
a clear breach of academic freedom had occurred. <BR>
<BR>
Apparently, however, Mr. Hafernik and Mr. Kelley disagree. Mr. Hafernik
has emphatically rejected the committee's recommendation to reinstate Mr.
Kenyon, citing his own freedom to determine scientifically appropriate curriculum.
In response, the American Association of University Professors informed
the university last month that they expect Mr. Kenyon's mistreatment to
be rectified. Meanwhile, as SFSU considers its response, a worldclass scientist
waits -- yet another casualty of America's peculiar academic fundamentalism.<BR>

<i>February 7, 1996</i>
<p>

<h2>Plan Kicks-Off FDA Reform</h2> 
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation today released a plan to
<a href="/pff/mip/fdatoc.html">replace FDA's current, obsolete approval mechanism</a> for new drugs
and medical devices with a decentralized process relying heavily
on private sector certification agencies.
<P>
The plan, released at a major conference sponsored by the Foundation,
calls for the creation of new, private certification organizations.
The FDA's role would shift from certifying and regulating products
to certifying and regulating these new entities.
<P>
The Foundation's report also criticized the current process for
being much too slow to bring new medical products to market, depriving
patients of treatments needed for them to live longer, healthier
lives.
<P>
&quot;As a physician I have seen people suffer when potential
help was just across the border. Pharmaceuticals and medical devices
available in Europe and Asia are not available in America because
we have a regulatory system that operates at its own slow place
and for its own convenience,&quot; said <a href="/pff/mip/sull0207.html">Dr. Louis Sullivan</a>, former
Secretary of Health and Human Services and Chairman of the Advisory
Committee that oversaw preparation of the proposal.
<P>
The report, <a href="/pff/mip/fdatoc.html"><I>Advancing Medical Innovation: Health, Safety and
the Role of Government in the 21st Century</I></a>, proposes replacing
the current FDA monopoly over approval with a competitive &quot;third
party&quot; review process. Under the plan, Drug or Device Certification
Bodies (DCBs) would compete for the most timely, efficient and
cost-effective methods to review new products. However, all existing
standards for safety and effectiveness would be maintained.
<P>
&quot;The reforms detailed in this plan will lead to greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness via competition among the DCBs. Subject
to the legal standard of safety and effectiveness, DCBs will be
encouraged to devise innovative and more efficient ways of developing
drugs and getting them approved,&quot; said Dr. Henry Miller,
a co-author of the plan and the former founding director of FDA's
Office of Biotechnology.
<P>
Under the new plan, the FDA's primary function would be to certify
the quality of the third party reviewers, not to actually perform
the review function itself. While the FDA would retain authority
to issue the final approval before a product is marketed, the
plan creates a new appeal procedure in the event of disagreement
with a company and/or DCB. The FDA also retains a powerful post-marketing
system for monitoring the safety of products.
<P>
Many components of the plan draw from the experience with third
party reviewers in the European Union. &quot;In Europe, third
party reviewers compete with each other on the basis of price,
timeliness and availability. This results in our patients being
deprived of medical devices that are already approved in Europe.
We have taken the best of the European model in designing a new
approval system for America,&quot; said <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Epstein">Dr. Ralph Epstein</a>, a co-author of the report and professor of anesthesiology at the University
of Connecticut.
<P>
&quot;The FDA is currently a prototypical centralized, bureaucratic
regulatory agency that is cumbersome, slow and expensive. Not
only does the outmoded FDA approval process directly result in
jobs being exported overseas, but, most importantly, it denies
advances in medicine to patients who need them to live healthy
lives, or even to survive,&quot; said <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Eisenach">Jeffrey A. Eisenach</a>, President
of the Foundation.
<P>
Dr. Sullivan added that the plan &quot;is about freedom - about
choice, about alternatives, about helping people prevent illness
and injury, about successfully treating disease when it strikes.
Real reform must make the system more accessible, less costly
and less bureaucratic for all our citizens.&quot;

<h2>The Symposium on Advancing Medical Innovation: &quot;Regulating Medical
Technology in the 21st Century&quot;</h2>

<p>Remarks by Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="http://www.pff.org/pff/people/sfellow.html#Lenard">Tom
(Lenard)</a>. I agree with much that has already been said in the morning
session. The current FDA regulatory review system is outdated, archaic,
costly, and wasteful. It is too bureaucratic, byzantine, and enigmatic.
It is time for thoughtful, workable, and innovative change in the FDA regulatory
review process. </p>

<p><b>Experience at HHS</b> </p>

<p>I have first hand knowledge of the cost and delay you discussed. I already
have spent four years trying to reform FDA from the top down. During my
tenure as Secretary of <a href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov">Health and Human
Services</a>, we undertook substantial reform to increase the flow of pharmaceuticals
and medical devices to the market - and I'm proud of the work we did. You
see, I agreed with the critics who argued that unnecessary cost, duplication,
and delay prolonged treatable illness and disability, and often cruelly
denied help for those who were dying. As Secretary, I spoke with people
who flew to Europe or Asia to obtain life-saving pharmaceuticals internationally.
As a physician, I was angry that many people suffered and died wen help
was just across the border. And I was shocked at how easily many people
turned to charlatans and con artists because they had lost faith in a regulatory
system that operated at its own pace, for its own convenience, pursing
its own agenda. As a former <a href="http://www.nih.gov/home.html">NIH</a>
grantee, I talked with researchers who were frustrated, and often defeated,
by the overwhelming and illogical regulatory maze that must be negotiated
before approval of new products. I understood that reform was a life and
death matter. And I knew that something has to be done - we could do better.
We had to do better. </p>

<p><b>Structural Reform Necessary</b> </p>

<p>Administratively there is much that can be done - and should be done.
But fundamental structural changes are also needed. This country must re-examine
the role and function of FDA regulatory review. We must work to make all
products on the market safe and effective. But we can no longer allow the
regulatory system to set up hurdles that are unnecessary, redundant, and
impractical - hurdles that increase costs and delay without warrant. </p>

<p><b>Endorsement of Report</b> </p>

<p>That is why I endorse the proposals in <a href="http://www.pff.org/pff/mip/fdatoc.html">today's
report</a>. They are a sound first step toward improving the way our country
reviews and approves pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Thanks to the
work of Drs. Epstein, Lenard, Miller, Tollison, Viscusi, and Wardell, we
now have two important components for reform - a vision of regulation that
can lead us into the 21st century and a set of workable proposals that
speed up the review process without sacrificing our government's guarantee
of safety or efficacy. I thank all of you for your hard work, your commitment,
and your vision - because today you are helping to change the way our citizens
will think about FDA regulatory review, and because you have started in
motion a process that will eventually help millions of our citizens who
desperately need access to pharmaceuticals and devices that have already
been proven safe and efficacious about but are not accessible on the market.
</p>

<p>Let me give you a comparative example. I was interested in a recent
article in the <i><a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a></i>,
reporting that Hoechst AG, the German chemical company, Merck, and Glaxo
Wellcome are all working on drugs that keep cells from malfunctioning by
blocking signal transduction. Such a development could revolutionize disease
prevention for allergic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis,
and transplant rejection. There might also be a payoff in terms of controlling
cancer cells. I agree with John Kuriyan of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
- research on signals inside cells &quot;is an area of explosive growth.&quot;
</p>

<p>But once this research on signal transduction is translated into new
pharmaceutical, how long will it take to get them into the hands of physicians
and patients under the current FDA regulatory system? And at what cost?
Under the current system we probably won't see any pharmaceuticals for
at least fifteen years. European and Japanese approval will probably happen
years before we get around to it. And the research cost to meet FDA regulations
- easily in the hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>

<p>Surely we can do better. Unfortunately, the current regulatory system
gives the Food and Drug Administration a monopolistic power to approve
new pharmaceuticals and medical devices for marketing. This system may
only benefit large pharmaceutical companies, who are best able to bear
the tens of millions of dollars necessary to gain FDA approval for one
pharmaceutical product. As a result, consumers pay more for medication.
The FDA also jealously controls the review process, often adding years
of duplicative study before giving approval. Again, as a result, consumers
have to wait longer for the life-saving and life-enhancing pharmaceuticals
they should have. And all of this cost and delay means that some pharmaceutical
companies abandon promising pharmaceutical products, conduct less expensive
testing overseas, and chill further innovation. Because the FDA review
process is not efficient, and actually drives up health care costs, we
must change that process as part of any coherent health system reform effort.
</p>

<p>But we must make the drug review process more efficient and speedy without
compromising safety and efficacy. For example, biotechnology companies
must be allowed to move more easily from pilot to full-scale production
facilities, and to modify their plants and manufacturing procedures without
prior FDA approval, if the risk is negligible. As you know, at the present
time, even minor changes require FDA approval. </p>

<p>Under today's proposals, a major step forward would be to allow third-party
review is common in Europe, but not here. I would like to see contract
review organizations, academic health centers, some professional organizations,
and other groups receive licenses to conduct review of pharmaceutical products,
thereby cutting industry costs and the time lag for drug review, while
making the review process more inclusive of other organization in the health
system. Such a change would also broaden our biomedical research base,
creating more opportunities for universities, institutions, and organizations
to become involved in the review process. There would be a tremendous educational
advantage for students and researchers involved in nongovernmental drug
certification bodies. More people would become invested in cutting edge
biomedical research, geometrically increasing the advantages from expanding
the frontiers of knowledge. </p>

<p>In addition, I agree that it is time for this country to adopt the European
approach and exempt from pre-market review up to 125 categories of low-risk
medical devices. I am pleased that a bill was recently introduces in the
Senate to designate that some classes of devices could be marketed without
FDA pre-notification and review. This proposal only covers a handful of
classes. In my view, we need to broaden the bill's scope to include all
classes of devices that pose no problems of safety or efficacy. </p>

<p>But, of course, the riskiest products should receive pre-marketing design
approval by a drug certification body. Pre-market FDA notification will
provide an additional check on the appropriateness of introducing a risky
medical device. </p>

<p>Finally, we must reduce the regulatory burden faced by the pharmaceutical
and medical device industries. Environmental assessments are not needed
for every individual drug. Individual batches of insulin do not need to
be certified. Redundant studies are not necessary, especially if extensive
testing has already been done in Europe. </p>

<p>I specifically endorse a streamlined appeals process through establishment
of a Medical Review Board at HHS. This will underline the accountability
of the Secretary of HHS to the American people, and provide a closer involvement
between FDA and the Office of the HHS Secretary. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line</b> </p>

<p>The real question is - whom are we trying to serve? If it is the patient,
then let's make the changes necessary to help the patient save money and
time, without compromising quality. If we are trying to serve the government,
we have in place a bureaucrat-friendly, convoluted, and wasteful system.
</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>In the end, it will be a question of vision and leadership. Our vision
must be a patient priority. </p>

<p>Over the past several years I have spoken about the goals that must
guide health care reform, whether we are looking at changes in reimbursement
or alterations of pharmaceutical approval. In my view, real reform must
make the health care system more accessible for all of our citizens. It
must give them choices, empower them, and make the treatment more effective.
A patient priority - an emphasis on making the health care system more
user-friendly - must become an overriding philosophy. </p>

<p>In his autobiography, Nelson Mandela spoke of &quot;indivisibility of
freedom.&quot; We urged each of us to &quot;walk the long road to freedom&quot;
by recognizing that limitations on the freedom of some of us eventually
curtail the freedom of all of us. </p>

<p>Today's discussion is about freedom - about choice, about alternatives,
about helping people prevent disease, and successfully treat disease when
it strikes. Health people have more independence. Empowered people need
fewer government services. Free people can do better for themselves, and
make their life more rewarding and satisfying. </p>

<p>The proposals in this report will give our citizens more choices. It
will give them more control over their lives. We will have introduces reform
that assists the patient. And a patient priority is how we can best meet
the needs of our citizens. With such a vision, we can become powerful agents
for change. We can provide the leadership needed to secure a more compassionate,
more efficient, and more effective health care system. We can be a catalyst
for helping patients to become more empowered, to expand their range of
choices, to have more choices to evaluate, to have more pharmaceuticals
and medical devices to choose from, to have access to those pharmaceuticals
more quickly and without increased risk, and to become full partners in
providing top-quality health care for all Americans. You and I can do this,
if we always remember that the health care system should continue to be
structured to serve the patient. That is how we can help all of our citizens
to walk the long road to freedom. </p>

<p>Again, I applaud each of the authors of this remarkable and timely report.
And I appreciate the excellent work from Tom (Lenard), <a href="http://www.pff.org/pff/people/staff.html#Wright">Libby
(Wright)</a> and Rick (Teske). You have provided an important forum in
today's conference. </p>

<p>Thank you for inviting me to share these perspectives with you. </p>

<H3>George Washington Fellows</H3>
<PRE>Discovery Institute's annual <A HREF="religion.html">George Washington Fellows Program</A> will be held this Summer from July 15 to
August 11, 1996. An intensive four-week seminar on religion and politics for upper-level undergraduates and
first-year graduate students, the program is designed to give Fellows an in-depth understanding of the role
religion can play in a free society.

In addition to regular classroom discussion sessions, there will be a number of special forums on specific issues
led by nationally-recognized scholars and thinkers. Past forums have been led by George Gilder, George
Weigel, Edwin Meese, and Program Fellows Stephen Meyer and Edward Larson.

Questions or requests for information should be directed to Dr. John West at Discovery Institute. Applications
may be obtained by calling 287-3144. The deadline for applications is April 26.


</PRE>
<H3>Upcoming conference</H3>
<PRE>The Religion, Liberty, and Civic Life Program will also sponsor a one-day conference on &quot;Faith and Politics&quot;
on August 10, 1996 at Seattle Pacific University. The proceedings from last Summer's conference, &quot;The Death
of Materialism,&quot; have recently been published as a special issue of The Intercollegiate Review. More
information on this year's conference may be found in the June issue of the Journal.


</PRE>
<H3>Book publication</H3>
<PRE>The University Press of Kansas will publish <I><A HREF="preface.html">The Politics of Revelation and Reason: Religion and Civic Life
in the New Nation</A></I>, the new work by Discovery Fellow John West. 

Described by noted historian Mark A. Noll as &quot;a fresh, well researched, and extremely well-balanced account
of religious-political connections in the early republic,&quot; the book by the Director of Discovery's Religion,
Liberty, and Civic Life Program will be released in May.  Though West's book focuses primarily on the past rather than the present, he thinks it holds many lessons for
today. 

&quot;The more I studied the early years of our nation,&quot; says West, &quot;the more I realized that present controversies
are simply a continuation of arguments that have been going on from the start. There is a tremendous amount
we can learn from how religion became involved in politics in early America. The issues may be different,
but the principles are the same.&quot;

Discovery members wishing to place prepublication orders for the book should call the Institute at 287-3144.

<h2>The Symposium on Advancing
Medical Innovation:  &quot;Regulating Medical Technology in the
21st Century&quot;</h2>
<P>
Remarks by George B. Rathmann, Ph.D. 
<P> 
High costs to develop health care products in the United States
and the overly risk-averse attitudes of regulators impede the
ability of the research-based pharmaceutical industry to do what
it excels at: innovating in the discovery, testing, and marketing
of safe and effective products. The time required from drug discovery
to approval for marketing now requires approximately 12-15 years,
and time is a critical commodity: It represents therapies lost
to patients, revenues lost to companies, and research monies &quot;burned.&quot;
The financial burden has become staggering: The most recent estimate
(in 1990) was that the cost of each drug emerging from the end
of the pipeline was, on average, $359 million.
<P>
Attempts to &quot;streamline&quot; the drug approval process recently
have focused inappropriately on the end game of drug development;
that is, on the final marketing approval for a new drug. The time
needed to reach the stage of filing for marketing approval represents
90 percent of the costs of drug development. This time is often
dramatically extended by overly conservative dosing regimens (limiting
dosage to a single dose for up to one year), extended observation
periods between patients and requiring FDA meetings and discussions
between subphases of the clinical study. Companies' researchers
and regulatory affairs professionals spend progressively more
time and resources meeting unnecessary requirements and shifting
requests.
<P>
There seems to be no means for correcting the FDA reviewers and
managers who - no doubt with the best of intentions - are inappropriately
slow or conservative and who, thereby, cause a drug to be delayed
or even abandoned.
<P>
<a href="/pff/mip/fdatoc.html">The Progress and Freedom Foundation's proposal</a> addresses some
of these shortcomings forthrightly and cleverly, by altering the
basic incentives and disincentives that drive the current system.
By transferring much of the FDA's oversight of the IND process
and marketing approval to non-governmental expert bodies which
have a strong incentive both to maintain high product standards
and expedite the drugs through the development pipeline, the system
is made altogether more rational and productive.
<P>
The improvement is manifest in three ways. First, the reforms
apply to virtually the entire drug process. Second, non-governmental
bodies, competing with one another for clients, are encouraged
to be expert, fast, and innovative. Third, there are potent fail-safe
mechanisms to assure the quality of the oversight.
<P>
I would emphasize that the reforms proposed by the Progress and
Freedom Foundation are important and conservative. The standards
for safety and efficacy are retained; and the FDA retains a substantial
role in certifying the non-governmental bodies, issuing final
sign-offs for marketing approval, overseeing regulatory compliance
and broadly overseeing and accumulating safety data. This is a
regime that will benefit both patients and industry. It should
establish a benchmark for the regulatory reform proposals that
will be discussed at Congressional hearings during the coming
weeks.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>The awful case of Commander Stumpf</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B><I>From the Seattle Times Friday, January 26, 1996<BR></I></B><H1><CENTER>UNWRITTEN LAWS GROUND <BR>STAR NAVY PILOT</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>By <BR><I>Philip Gold </I></CENTER></H3><HR><BR><BR>The Romans had a proverb. Of all our laws, some are written and some arenot. <BR><BR><BR>As is often the case with proverbs, their surface simplicity conceals deepertruths. In this instance, at least two. <BR><BR><BR>First, written law can't do it all. There must be other sources of valueand discipline and mercy: religion, morality, honor, tradition and commonsense. <BR><BR><BR>Second, these &quot;unwritten laws&quot; are just that - laws. They toocan become unjust, oppressive, insane. <BR><BR><BR>Latest American example: The case of Commander Robert E. Stumpf, UnitedStates Navy. The particulars concern his career. But his situation shouldbe a warning, a clear signal that the &quot;unwritten laws&quot; of thecivilian political processes are corrupting the military, just as they'vetainted politics. And the growing bipartisan support for Cmdr. Stumpf shouldalso be read as a sign. The American people are beginning to say, enough.Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf is, by all standard measurements, a man on the fast track to thestars. An accomplished fighter pilot, he flew with distinction in the GulfWar, commanded the Navy's elite Blue Angels precision flying team and enjoysa fine reputation within the service. The Navy selected him for promotionto captain in 1994; the Senate confirmed him. He was then selected for futureassignment as an aircraft carrier group commander, perhaps the most covetedflying job in the Navy. <BR><BR><BR>Now, what's wrong with this picture? For starters, three things: Cmdr. Stumpf'spresence at the notorious Tailhook '91 convention; a Navy clerical error,and the judgment of some people in very high places. Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf attended Tailhook under orders to receive an award for the squadronhe commanded. He flew there in an F/A-18, logged as a training mission -a totally acceptable practice, when such training missions have to be flownanyway and other forms of transportation are either inconvenient or costly.Cmdr. Stumpf was present in one of the &quot;hospitality suites&quot; andwitnessed a hired stripper's performance; tacky, but hardly illegal. Heleft and retired for the night before some reprehensible but consensualactivities took place. No assaults occurred in this particular suite. .<BR><BR><BR>Stumpf was later investigated by the Navy, along with everybody else sweptup in that botched inquisitorial frenzy. He was completely exonerated andreturned to duty. <BR><BR><BR>His second ordeal began a few months ago, after the Senate had confirmedthe promotion list on which his name appeared. Apparently, the Navy hadviolated Senate instructions to &quot;flag&quot; the name of anyone connectedwith Tailhook. The Navy informed the Senate Armed Services Committee ofthe error. It seems senatorial pique at having been &quot;deceived&quot;coincided with an anonymous phone-accusation campaign directed at the committee.Last October, apparently at a non-quorum meeting, the committee voted tooppose the promotion. The result was a letter so indicating to Navy SecretaryJohn Dalton, signed by committee chairman Strom Thurmond and ranking DemocratSam Nunn. The letter noted that, since, the full Senate had already acted,rescinding the promotion was the Navy's job. <BR><BR><BR>Secretary Dalton complied. <BR><BR><BR>As of this writing Cmdr. Stumpf has been informed neither of the &quot;accusation&quot;against him nor the identity of his &quot;accusers.&quot; He has been refusedpermission to meet with the committee, or to defend himself in writing.Mr. Dalton defends the reversal by citing the need to maintain the &quot;integrityof the process.&quot; Also as of this writing, the Navy is considering anew policy to let promotion boards view &quot;potentially adverse&quot;information on officers that would not be contained in an individual's officialfile - such as anonymous accusations. The Marines have already adopted thispolicy. <BR><BR><BR>Let's dispose of the obvious first. Tailhook was abhorrent. So was the Navy'sresponse. The guilty walked. The innocent bled. The service humiliated itselftwice over. <BR><BR><BR>Also obvious is the fact that the Navy needs to change its &quot;unwrittenlaws&quot; governing treatment of female service members, perhaps its attitudetoward women in general. However, the Navy and the Pentagon, need to startstanding up to the shrill minority of feminists for whom no sacrificialexpiation will ever be enough. How ironic it is that service women havemore in common with their male &quot;oppressors&quot; than with their anti-military&quot;defenders&quot; in The Sisterhood. And how sad it is that militarywomen now complain that they can't get the kind of counseling and mentoringthey need from their male superiors. The guys are afraid to be alone withthem. <BR><BR><BR>Now to the less obvious but vital fact. The handling of Cmdr. Stumpf's casereflects what is now the unwritten law of the United States. While the &quot;written&quot;legal system stands ready to excuse almost anything (remember O.J.?), theunwritten system is always ready to convict. Accusation now equates to guilt,perpetual guilt. Punishment is automatic and severe. And those who are persecutedbecome not deterrent examples of evil, but warnings to &quot;good people&quot;to stay away. <BR><BR><BR>Men and women are leaving the service in disgust, their numbers lost amidthe statistics of the personnel drawdown. Others, whose names will neverbe known, are simply refusing to enter. The same is happening in civilianpublic life. <BR><BR><BR>Who needs it? When a hero's career can be destroyed for simply being ina room where somebody else later did something; when a woman can lose aCabinet appointment because she didn't pay her nanny's Social Security;when a man can win a Supreme Court seat yet remain pilloried for life onthe basis of He Said/She Said, this is no longer a partisan issue. Thisis not the upholding of any moral standard remotely related to reality.This is a vicious, pharisaical, ex post facto, pseudo-moral McCarthyism,and worse. <BR><BR><BR>Cmdr. Stumpf should be the symbol around which can rally everyone - Democrat,Republican, civilian, military, male, female - who wants this way of doingthings stopped. <BR><BR>Let the inquisitions end here. <BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospace studiesat the Seattle-based Discovery Institute and a lecturer at Georgetown University.</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<P>Much hype and misinformation has been churned out about cyberspace and
the information highway. While the mass media's coverage of this new medium
does not rival that of the O.J. trial, attention being paid to users and
providers of computer networks and online services has grown intense during
the past two years. Culminating this misinformation glut is legislation
in Washington, D.C.: Senator Exon's Decency Act of 1995. <BR>
<BR>
The Exon Bill represents leadership that is uninformed of the citizenry
it is attempting to rule over, reminiscent of the British style of &quot;taxation
without representation&quot; legislation during America's frontier days.
Despite the stories of security problems and the wilderness of data, the
electronic communities that comprise the Net are in most cases stable and
self-regulating as their citizens hold each other and their system administrator
accountable for their online content and conduct. <BR>
<BR>
In an era when government is trying to downsize so that it may live within
its means, an attempt at regulating a medium residing within and beyond
the jurisdiction of the terrestrial courts and agencies of the U.S. is shortsighted
and embarrassing. Specifically, many electronic communities whose computer
and databases reside physically in the U.S. have users (i.e., online citizens)
who reside in the U.S. and in other countries. Despite differences in culture
and legal standards, individuals meet and share information on a regular
basis. <BR>
<BR>
Such users can meet peaceably because they adhere to what is generally known
as an acceptable use policy (AUP), or netiquette, or terms of service. Ranging
from an informal understanding of what is proper to a structured code and
signed contracts, users agree with an electronic community's system administrator
to abide by rules in order to participate in that particular community.
By letting their contracts be their conscience, users have much liberty
and responsibility as they act and speak in cyberspace. While there are
rogue and raucous electronic communities out there, there are thousands
of communities that have gotten along fine over the years because their
users care about what goes on while online. Users turn misusers in to system
administrators (a.k.a., &quot;sysops&quot;) and in cases where the violative
conduct touches upon a terrestrial law, the sysop turns the offender over
to the appropriate authorities (e.g., the recent incident of child pornographers
being turned in by America Online's chief sysop and CEO Steve Case). <BR>
<BR>
While Senator Exon's Bill is well intentioned -- laws that argue to protect
children will always be deemed to be a &quot;good thing&quot; -- it is unnecessary
for the most part. If, however, there needs to be regulation of the Internet,
then such rule making should come from an authority other than an elected
representative who is not even a user of e-mail. Instead, a more appropriate
body for the consideration and recommendation of laws for the online world
is one that does not yet exist formally but one whose time has come: an
&quot;Internet Law Task Force&quot; or ILTF. Analogous to the Internet Engineering
Task Force or IETF, a volunteer body that meets regularly to discuss and
determine what technical standards should be agreed upon in furtherance
of the interoperability of the various networks that make up the Internet,
an ILTF could be a body of lawyers and technical experts from the U.S. and
other countries whose mission would be to support the positive use of the
Net. Already, many individual professionals here and abroad work together
on issues of mutual interest because they enjoy it and because they deem
it as a necessity. <BR>
<BR>
An ILTF could be called upon by elected representatives in Washington, D.C.,
and elsewhere for expert testimony and for fact finding missions. However,
an ILTF would be in the best position to hear and understand the interests
of online citizens and sysops. Also, an autonomous and volunteer ILTF would
appreciate the fact that users and sysops of individual electronic communities
do not wish to have their rules subverted by an outsider. <BR>
<BR>
In the absence of an ILTF, legislation like Senator Exon's will most likely
result in the Balkanization of cyberspace, chilling participation and openness,
increasing costs through heightened liability (thus decreasing access for
the poor), and dividing the medium on jurisdictional boundaries -- dividing
lines wholly inconsistent and incompatible with the meaning and working
mechanism of the fluid and global medium that is the Net. Data will be driven
offshore to computer networks in other countries, connectivity will be cut
short, and electronic commerce will blossom elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
Even if content providers on the Net were to voluntarily submit to a government
requirement for a rating system similar to the motion picture industry (re:
How About X Ratings On the Internet? by G. Griggs, 29 March 1995, The New
York Times, A14), implementation of adequate software in support of such
online notification symbols and protocols would take years. Also, and perhaps
more importantly, such a measure ignores the same fact that the Exon Bill
does: the Net is a global phenomenon. Attempts to control information here
will simply mean that such information will be stored elsewhere and accessible
remotely from the U.S.. The interconnected nature of the Net permits users
to route around barriers and get to the information they want. <BR>
<BR>
Recently in these Op-Ed pages it was written that :&quot;The successful
marketspace will be one that makes shopping a transaction not just involving
goods and services but also experience. It will not forsake community for
commerce.&quot; (Steven Alburty, It's a Buyer's Marketspace, The New York
Times, A15, 20 March 1995.) Similarly, successful governance should not
forsake communities and their rules falsely in the name of children. <BR>

<title>What Is The American Conservative Union?</title> 
 </head>
<body>
<CENTER><H2>What Is The American Conservative Union? </H2></CENTER> 
<HR> 
<center><a name="table"></a>
<a href="#ratings">Ratings</a><br>
<a href="#pubs">Publications</a><br>
<a href="#cpac">CPAC</a><br>
<a href="#staff">Staff and Officers</a><br><hr>
  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep.

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.
<pre>
 				Year &amp; Billions of Dollars 
			----------------------------------------------------	
Net Exclusion of 						Total
Pension Contributions 	1994	1995	1996	1997	1998	'94-'98
&amp; Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employer Plans 		55.3 	58.5 	62.0 	65.7 	69.6 	311.1

IRAs			6.2 	6.5 	7.0 	7.5 	8.0 	35.2

Keogh Plans 		3.0 	3.1	3.3 	3.5 	3.7 	16.6

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

<H3><I>From the Fall 1995 Discovery Journal:</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER>Lynne Cheney tells Seattle the Truth </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
&quot;The idea that truth is something to be invented rather than pursued,&quot;
Lynne Cheney writes in her new book <I>Telling the Truth</I>, &quot;has
passed beyond narrow academic circles to influence many fields of endeavor&quot;
including: education, historical writing, journalism, psychology and even
politics. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney, former Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will
speak about the importance of truth and what we can do restore it, at a
Seattle luncheon sponsored by CityClub and Discovery Institute. <BR>
<BR>
Cheney's book, subtitled <I>Why Our Culture and Our Country Have Stopped
Making Sense-and What We Can Do About It</I>, is elevating the level of
debate about truth and society all over the nation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of us think of Lynne Cheney as a highly decorated veteran-many
ribbons for heroic service, and some purple hearts-of the culture wars,&quot;
said columnist George Will. &quot;This book is a vivid report from the war's
many fronts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If you'd like to hear Cheney's thoughts on Telling the Truth, call (206)
682-7395 for information and to reserve your seat. The luncheon is Thursday,
November 16, 12 noon - 1:30 p.m. at the downtown Seattle Sheraton Hotel
and the cost is $25. <BR>

WINCONFERENCE '95<BR>
Geneva, Switzerland<BR>
May 5, 1995<BR>
by Jack Kemp<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


Thank you for the opportunity to address WINCONFERENCE 1995.  I am especially honored to be in the company of such distinguished speakers as President Von Weizsacker, Minister Wu Ti, Arthur Dunkel, and Professors Robert Fogel and Grigory Yavlinsky.
<P>
As we begin the celebration in but two days, of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, we are reminded of how far the world has progressed.  The victory of Nazism and Fascism are outdone only by the more recent victories over Communism and apartheid.  We are seeing, however, not just an ending but the triumph of those 18th-century liberal democratic ideas today in extraordinary ways and in places we could never have predicted just a few years ago.
<P>
Consider events in South Africa.  Many people--with good reason--expected the Mandela government to lean leftward toward socialism and collectivism.  But look at what South Africa is doing in the field of housing. <I> The Wall Street Journal </I>reported recently, "The new South African Government's approach to housing for the poor is quite different from those of Western nations: the emphasis is on private ownership, not subsidized rental. . . . the South African way offers a route for its poor to build a better life, step by step.  Moreover, it is a historic departure from those of first-world welfare states and merits consideration elsewhere."
<P>
We live in a historical moment of tremendous opportunity in the world economy--a moment when so many nations are finally escaping the prison of centrally planned economies to discover the new world of free markets, free economies, free trade and free people.  It isn't very orderly and it isn't inevitable, but it's an exciting opportunity for leadership.
<P>
In addition, the United States has experienced no less than a political revolution in the last six months.  The Republicans, led by Speaker Gingrich, now control the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954.  Due in great measure to that shift of political power, in my opinion, the United States is poised to make significant contributions to the global economy.
<P>
I've been asked to speak specifically about America's role in this new world.  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say that America's policies and America's attitudes will help determine not only its shape but its future.  America's foreign policy, and that of our friends and allies, has, at its best, long sought to advance the inter-connected causes of economic freedom and liberal democracy.  After the Second Work War, the United States recognized it had a responsibility as steward of these ideals.  The policy of containment was conceived not merely as military and territorial, but also as economic and ideological.  In announcing the Truman doctrine before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned:
<P>
The seeds of oppressive regimes are nurtured by misery and want.  They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife.  They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.
<P>
We must keep that hope alive, indeed nurture and enhance it in the world.
<P>
The United States had enough faith in our democratic political system to help establish it in the lands of our former adversaries--and now close allies--Japan and Germany.
<P>
But we did more.  We recognized that a free international order requires certain international institutions to maintain it.  With the memories of beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism of the 1930s still fresh in our minds, the United States helped lead the world in establishing, at Bretton Woods, an international trading system and monetary regime based on a common and predictable unit of account, thereby removing exchange rate instabilities and fluctuations.  We have worked together in GATT to establish a system of open, free trade among nations.  All of this laid the groundwork for the incredible growth of work trade and the remarkable stability of the new quarter century as the West recovered from World War II.
<P>
It is my belief that an active, engaged America, and a United Europe, must help play that same vital role today;  promoting free markets, restoring stable and honest money, and helping build the institutions of democratic capitalism (particularly in the third world and former communist nations).  But fulfilling that promise directly depends on avoiding two great temptations.
<P>
One is the temptation of isolationism and protectionism which is sometimes found on the far-right.  The other temptation is the mindless multi-lateralism of the left.
<P>
With regard to the first temptation, two events have reshaped America's image of itself since World War II.  First is the recovery and prosperity of the Pacific Rim and Europe in particular.  Protectionist have attempted to use this fact to stir up resentment and fear.
<P>
Second, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own brutality and broken promises.  Isolationist have tried to use this as an argument that America's international role has ended.
<P>
The goal of both isolationists and protectionists is the same;  to narrow America's focus to domestic concerns, protect our markets and allow a world of strangers to take care of itself.
<P>
But the whole approach is based on the myth that the world economy is a zero-sum game, where every winner must be matched by a loser.
<P>
Fortunately, I think that most Americans and Europeans recognize and understand that the growth and prosperity of a unified Europe is good for America, and the growth and prosperity of the United States is good for Europe.  I was a strong supporter of NAFTA and GATT because I believe they are a vision of the entire world's future--free trade that extends to the Pacific rim and Europe so all can share in new markets and new prosperity from expanding global markets.  Now is the time to link a new trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade zone to NAFTA.
<P>
Protectionism in any form undermines efficiency by creating privileged industries and reducing the standard of living of workers and consumers.  Free trade is the best way to promote international development and attack third-work poverty.  Open markets bring benefits to both consumers in developed nations and workers in developing ones and vice versa.
<P>
The second great temptation, which is more common on the left, is for the United States to remain involved in the world, but to pursue a mindless and counter-productive multi-lateralism which turns over the economies of Third World and Eastern European countries to the IMF.  Mexico has been the most disturbing and recent example of the zero-sum approach.
<P>
The crisis in Mexico was not caused by some unexplainable force or unavoidable economic law.  It was caused by an explicit policy decision by the Clinton administration and international financial institutions, a policy of competitive devaluation that is based on the idea that Mexico would be better off by repudiating its debt, devaluing its currency, and dramatically reducing its imports.  The United States and the IMF advised the Mexican Government to devalue the peso, which has led to the institution of wage and price controls, higher taxes, the adoption of a comprehensive austerity, and loss of jobs, wages and pensions.
<P>
But austerity and devaluation are the problem, not the solution.  You can not enrich poor nations by impoverishing their people.  The answer to poverty is economic growth and entrepreneurial capitalism, which flow from the freedom of individuals to work, save, invest, be entrepreneurs and produce new wealth.  The role of government is to protect these freedoms.  This means preserving the value of people's money, not cheating them out of their savings, pensions and wages through so-called competitive devaluation.
<P>
Governments have a moral and pragmatic responsibility to protect, promote, and preserve the value of their currencies.  Argentina's minister of finance, Domingo Cavallo, put it best when he said his currency, the peso, is "a contract between the government and the peso holder.  That contract guarantees that each peso-- as a unit of value that the holder has worked hard to get--will be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.  If the government breaks that contact, it's breaking the law.  The only role of the government in the economy should be to guarantee the integrity of market transactions."  He could have said the same thing about the U.S. Dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the Yen, the Swiss Franc or any other currency.
<P>
It is interesting that ten years ago, when the dollar was a at a peak, the U.S. was advised that the budget deficit was causing the dollar to soar, and thus causing a trade deficit.  Now the dollar has fallen compared to the Yen from 270 to 83, yet the trade deficit has increased.  The conventional wisdom is telling us that our budget deficit causes a weak dollar and thus a trade deficit.  The lesson in this?  There is no connection between exchange rates and budget deficits.  You cannot cure a monetary problem with a fiscal solution.
<P>
A nation's people are its primary source of wealth.  What they need most is honest money and low tax rates to create opportunity--access to capital, ownership, and entrepreneurialism, which create wealth, jobs and enterprises.  Jude Wanniski, author of<I> The Way the World Works</I>, explained it well when he wrote, "The difference between people is the difference in the amount of capital available to them--financial capital or education capital.  Men are the same everywhere in the world, insofar as you give them a shovel to dig a hole with.  They do about as well in Rwanda, Bulgaria, Morristown or Sacramento.  Because we dig with power tools here and with sticks in Rwanda, our real wages are much higher.  If you tax capital too heavily, you are taxing this type of capital, and thus limiting the incomes of people."
<P>
We in the developed nations of the world should use our resources to help foster third-world and former Soviet bloc countries in the skills of market capitalism.  We should help build the institutions that liberate individual enterprise--private property, access to market, access to credit, stable legal structures, and easy incorporation of new businesses.  This is the best hope of developing world and the best definition of true cooperation and compassion for the less developed world.
<P>
The conventional wisdom on the left and the right all too often says the same thing:  that economic recovery, if possible at all, will be painful, hard to endure, and of such duration that not much can be done except inject massive doses of government assistance and IMF austerity.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly the same thing people said and believed about post-war West Germany.
<P>
Devastated post-war Berlin was the essence of a zero-sum society.  History records that young men fought with senior citizens for food scraps in the ruins and trash bins.  The Reichsmark was all but abandoned and replaced by a so-called "Zigaretten Wirtschaft" or cigarette economy.  A carton of Lucky Strikes became the unit of account, food, construction costs, workers wages . . . just about everything was priced in cigarettes.  The German press speculated about a possible U.S. loan of 50 million cartons of cigarettes to support the worthless Reichsmark.
<P>
People were losing hope that life would ever rise above this bleak level.  In the United States there were worries that democracy itself would fail in Europe if prosperity could not be restored.  And then, suddenly, something happened.
<P>
A finance minister who had studied the classical writings of Smith and Ricardo came to the forefront.  In just a few strokes of incredible political courage and economic vision, Ludwig Erhard changed the course of German history, and thus Western hopes for reconstruction.
<P>
One day in June--the 20th of June, 1948--he reformed the currency by abolishing the Reichsmark and substituting the Deutschemark.  He crushed inflation by tying the new currency to the U.S. Dollar, which, in turn, was tied to the stable exchange rate system worked out at Bretton Woods and thus established the integrity of this new West German numeraire.
<P>
Henry Wallich, a one time U.S. Federal Reserve Board member, in his book<I> The Mainsprings of German Revival</I>, wrote, "The spirit of the country changed overnight.  The gray, hungry and dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their ever-lasting search for food came to life as, pocketing their 40 D-Marks, they went on their first spending spree."
<P>
On June 22, because inflation had pushed West German people into extremely high tax rates, Erhard indexed the tax brackets, dramatically lowering effective tax rates.  On July 7, he abolished rationing, canceled hundreds of regulations and eliminated wage and price controls, against the advice of the U.S. State Department and the military command.
<P>
According to the history books, within a year, West German workers were eating more and better food than those in austerity-ridden Britain, which had turned to a socialist government and, incidentally, received more Marshall aid money.
<P>
In two years, West Germany's real income increased 40 percent.  By 1952, her exports had risen 60 percent.  Over 12 years, from 1950 to 1962, while the U.S. GNP was increasing by a healthy 50%, West Germany's rose at a rate five times as great--247%.  Within a generation an autocratic nation twice defeated in the century's most destructive wars had become not only a world economic power, but a trusted friend and ally.
<P>
What caused this <I> Wirstchaftswunder-- </I>this economic miracle?  Well, first of all, it was not a miracle at all.  chancellor Adenauer and his Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, both said the Marshall plan had little to do with it.  It wasn't some government industrial policy.  It certainly wasn't a world bank or IMF-imposed austerity program.
<P>
Ludwig Erhard did not discover some magic formula or experience a sudden Utopian vision.  He simply, yet profoundly, applied the socially responsible free market prescriptions of classical supply-side economics.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>He established a stable currency and maintained its integrity as a storehouse of value and a unit of account.
<LI>He slashed tariffs and other trade barriers.
<LI>He allowed the markets to work freely in setting prices and wages, and in allocating resources by eliminating, in one bold stroke, all rationing and price controls.
<LI>He dramatically rescued the steeply graduated tax rates on working, saving, investing, and producing.
<LI>He applied orderly principles of law to private property, patents, and contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Erhard's reforms all rested on one fundamental principle of democracy:  that prosperity, wealth, and opportunity can only be created by people acting freely and entrepreneurially--by strengthening the people and their markets and relying on free enterprise--not government planning.
<P>
This is a message for Mexico and, indeed, every nation on earth:  The key to wealth and prosperity is allowing people freedom--freedom to work, to save, to trade, to succeed, and yes, to fail and yet try again.  The ultimate causes of wealth of nations are free people, free trade, and free enterprise.
<P>
This means preserving the value of people's money; not cheating them out of their savings through devaluation.  This will encourage them to save more.
<P>
This means defending their property rights through the rule of law, so the people need not fear the confiscation of the fruits of their labors.  This will encourage them to produce more.
<P>
This means taxing solely to raise revenues for the legitimate needs of the state, not to punish wealth and success to promote so-called egalitarian ends.
<P>
This means preserving the competition of the marketplace at all levels of enterprise, resisting the impulse to protect big business and state enterprise at the expense of young entrepreneurs who ultimately create most new wealth and new jobs.
<P>
These are the lessons we have learned in the West in the last two centuries, beginning with the linkage of Jeffersonian democracy and Adam Smith's economic system of natural liberty.  We have relearned and refined these lessons with Erhard's miracle in Germany, President Reagan's revolution in the United States, Margaret Thatcher's revitalization of Great Britain, Vaclav Klaus' success in the Czech Republic, and in the dramatic achievement of Asian economies.  Once started in motion, ideological momentum is difficult to stop.  Having achieved a victory in one place, it transcends borders and cultures and acquires a life of its own.
<P>
This is the genius of economic freedom from which every nation can benefit, both rich and poor, north and south.  No one succeeds at the expense of another.  Everyone benefits from their neighbor's prosperity.  It is the common ground on which to build a stable international community.  Protectionism yields conflict.  Economic freedom yields cooperation.  We create the conditions for peace throughout the advance of trade.
<P>
And that same freedom provides hope to nations that have lived too long without it.  Poverty is not an immutable condition.  Every nation is richly supplied with the most important natural resource--human creativity.  This is the seminal message of democratic capitalism's triumph:  growth is the product of individual effort, where the link between effort and reward is both preserved and promoted.
<P>
As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we should look once again at the 1944 conference of Bretton Woods.  The agreement at Bretton Woods successfully established an international monetary regime and helped promote free and open markets throughout most of the free world.  Ultimately, the agreement was responsible for unprecedented growth, prosperity, and trade.
<P>
Now with the end of the cold war, we have the perfect opportunity to have a new "Bretton Woods" international conference of the leading industrial and developed nations of the world to conclude the work begun at the G-7 in 1985 under Secretary James Baker.
<P>
But before that, the United States must get our own monetary house in order by re-establishing the U.S. Dollar as a reliable numeraire.  It must once again be as good as gold, which will have the effect of lowering interest rates.  As Utah Senator Bob Bennett pointed out, "For every one percent [interest rate] deduction on $4.5 trillion debt, that is $45 billion dollars in annual savings."  Furthermore, the U.S. must reduce the deficit not by raising taxes but through spending restraint and cuts, and tax-rate cuts.  I have been asked by the Republican leadership in Congress to chair a commission to restructure the tax system in the United States.  It is my goal to work toward a flatter, simpler, and fairer code which broadens the tax base and stimulates growth and capital formation.  This would strengthen the U.S. Dollar without requiring higher interest rates.
<P>
We should also immediately expand NAFTA to include Chile and other Latin American countries.  And it is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market.  We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left.
<P>
And fourth, restore the IMF to its original purpose, which was to manage the exchange rate system and provide short term balance payments assistance for developing nations.
<P>
Finally, we must remember that there are no limits to growth in our world--just frontiers waiting to be opened and opportunities waiting to be explored.  If the United States encourages those economic pioneers who cross those frontiers--with policies that favor enterprise over planning, sound money over devaluations, growth over austerity--it will play a leading role in the advance of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  It is a role that will not only serve the interests of the United States, but will help unleash the creative ingenuity and vast resources of the rest of the world as well and lead us to the peace and prosperity so long dreamed about by our founders.  We must remember the words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address to the British Parliament:  "We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings."  What a great challenge for us all to undertake.<P>

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in United States
in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were<I> &quot;forever forming associations</I>.&quot;
Tocqueville found especially noteworthy the myriad of civic associations
that Americans organized for moral and educational purposes. Instead of
looking to the government for help, publicly-spirited citizens sought to
solve societal problems on their own.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">What Tocqueville may not have realized was that this
national enthusiasm for association was of recent vintage. Although Americans
had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations
did not occur until the second decade of the nineteenth century. And perhaps
no one was more important in bringing it about than Lyman Beecher. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet
Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, Lyman Beecher
was a towering preacher and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues
commented after his death, &quot;in massive talent Lyman Beecher stood among
his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate alone.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">As a young minister in the early 1800s, Beecher faced
a disintegrating society. Church attendance was down, and alcoholism and
other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox
Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. In the political
sphere, elected officials were increasingly reticent about enforcing either
morality or piety by law, and there was growing political support for abolishing
tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism
in New England.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like
most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could
not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry
depended on religion. Now that state support for religion was collapsing,
he feared the worst. But instead of giving into despair, he came up with
a brilliant response: If the government could no longer be relied on to
support religion and morality, he announced, religious adherents themselves
had to do what the government could not.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling
people to &quot;support the gospel and attend the public worship of God,&quot;
Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. &quot;But these means
of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute
but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable
contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians,
and by all classes of the community who love their country.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher advocated replacing government support for
religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread
the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute.
In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations
would seek to create a public consensus through educational efforts because
in a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Following Beecher&Igrave;s lead, evangelicals soon
organized scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and
for social and political reform. They formed groups to help end poverty,
to teach reading and writing to the poor, and to prevent the abuse of alcohol.
Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American
Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of
the sabbath. This multitude of private associations transformed American
society in a way that few government programs ever could. By the time of
the 1830s, it was a well developed system of voluntary activity and benevolence.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">They say ministers have lost their influence,&quot;
Beecher wrote years later. &quot;The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary
efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence
than ever they could&quot; have by state support. He had learned through
experience that the free enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile
to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish.
Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and
Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state
as beneficial to true religion. But they tended to view religion as a private
matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher&Igrave;s unique contribution
was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once state
support of churches had ended.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Interestingly, even as Beecher championed Christianity&Igrave;s
civic role, he had a keen appreciation for the limits of religious activism.
Unlike many later reformers, he had a firm belief in human sinfulness, and
he harbored no illusions that human beings could create an earthly paradise.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher further recognized the dangers that political
activism posed for Christianity. Political ambitions could easily overwhelm
the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher subsequently advised Christians
to restrict their political efforts to the &quot;great questions of national
morality&quot; instead of trying to formulate an explicitly Christian position
on every conceivable political issue. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">&quot;When great questions of national morality are
about to be decided,&Oacute; he wrote, &Iuml;such as the declaration of
war; or, as in England, the abolition of the slave trade&Ouml; it becomes
Christians to lift up their voice, and exert their united influence. But,
with the annual detail of secular policy, it does not become Christians
to intermeddle, beyond the unobtrusive influence of their silent suffrage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">During our own era when questions are again being raised
about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might benefit
from Beecher&Igrave;s free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion
in public life. <BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Death and taxes are known as life's certainties. Far less common,
but much more enjoyable to contemplate, is the death of a tax. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a little-known technology may be about to accomplish what generations
of Americans have joked and dreamed about -- and both the new Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer and his predecessor, Chairman Sam Gibbons,
have said they desire: the annihilation of the income tax. Now it is becoming
possible, and perhaps even necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before proceeding to describe (in loving detail) the imminent demise, let's
remember why the murder is justifiable. The income tax discriminates against
savings and investment. Economic growth and job creating are penalized.
As the tax system grows ever more complex, and changes pile on changes,
the cost of compliance grows even more rapidly--unalloyed economic dead
weight. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of the resources that would be freed, and the human happiness that
would accrue, if all the tax lawyers and accountants were put to work doing
something useful. Think of all the gains to taxpayers once they were freed
from the burden of compliance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The cost is more than economic. The complexity of the system also causes
fear. People rarely know what the proper tax liability is. For most large
businesses and many individuals, the only thing they know is that the amount
they paid is probably wrong. And though we may be amused each April-by the
news stories about leading accounting firms and IRS offices each calculating
a different liability from the same data, the consequenes are not so funny.
Each year the IRS tries to send people to jail for not determining a liability
that is, by the very nature of the system, almost impossible to calculate.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, also, the very Congress that claims to want to get the government
off people's back is complicating the system even further. Among the various
tax cut bills that have been introduced, only Rep. Dick Armey's flat tax
bill will produce significant simplification. Left to themselves, it is
unlikely that the legislators, buffeted as they are by the lobbyists and
lawyers, will ever summon the courage to put the IRS out of its, and our,
misery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, computer hardware and software may soon do what Congressmen
and Senators will not. For centuries, people have paid their bills, and
received their income, by cash or check. But, these costly methods of payment
may be coming to a rather abrupt end. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transfers greatly reduce the costs of transaction and the possibility
of loss. Americans are now starting to pay their bills by using credit and
debit cards, and by inexpensive &quot;Smart Phones.&quot; These systems
provide customers with a full record of income and payments: good for record-keeping,
bad for privacy. In fact, the IRS is already working on a system to gather
all your financial information electronically and prepare your income tax
return for you. That might crimp the tax lawyers and accountants a bit,
but the Big Brother/police state aspects are at least as unpalatable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There is, however, a technological alternative. An experiment now underway,
called &quot;E-cash,&quot; is operating in Amsterdam by a company named
DigiCash. The electronic version of the anonymous paper dollar is now with
us. Individuals will be able to move their funds around the world, literally
at the speed of light, from one bank to another or to a creditor, without
the bank knowing to whom the money was paid, or the creditor knowing from
which bank or even country the money came. <BR>
<BR>
Through the use of cryptographic technology (scrambled numbers for personal
codes), the ease of conducting electronic transaction would be combined
with the elegant anonymity of paying in cash. The two most important features
of the E-Cash system -- security and anonymity -- will be ensured by using
cryptographic digital signatures to establish the authenticity of the payer,
wile at the same time assuring his anonymity and untraceability. The virtual
electronic dollar bills will, at the same time, be assigned individual electronic
serial numbers, which will also be checked for authenticity. The bank will
know how much to pay and what code to pay it to, but will not know the owner
of the receiving code, hence the payee too remains anonymous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, the IRS doesn't like it. But the matter may be beyond their control.
In the next few months, Americans will be offered two competing versions
of the future. The first is the society in which all of your transactions
can be monitored by the government (and other interested parties). The second
is where you as an individual choose which of your transactions will be
made available to curious eyes, and which will remain anonymous. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many in the government and other organizations will argue for a ban on anonymous
systems arguing that such capabilities benefit primarily drug traffickers,
money launderers, assorted terrorists, and plain old tax dodgers. Libertarians,
on the other hand, will warn of the dangers that accrue when government
has almost total scrutiny of individuals. One doesn't have to imagine what
a Hitler or Stalin could have done with such a system. Merely imagine anyone
trying to get Senate confirmation for government service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the fears of both sides are correct. Happily, some of the
legitimate fears of the government can be mollified by repealing the income
tax and substituting a value-added or business transfer tax. Anonymous systems
will still make it easier for criminals and evaders to do what they are
already doing successfully, especially as private encryption protocols are
developed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But without an income tax it won't matter. The gains to the American people,
economically and psychologically, will be magnificent. Even the government,
which relies on public trust, will gain. And on such terms, that would be
a very good thing. <BR>

TO TEACH ALL THEORIES</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">by Stephen C. Meyer</FONT>

<HR></CENTER>
<H3>The sky is falling.</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or so you might think if you've been reading press accounts
of the controversy in Sultan over how to teach biological origins. Some
say that if Sultan allows students access to information challenging contemporary
Darwinism, all manner of ill will prevail. Not only would such information
confuse students about the facts, it would mislead them about the very nature
of science. Worse, it would let fundamentalist religion into the science
classroom. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Such thinking misses the mark. Contrary to predictions,
greater openness in the biology curriculum is necessary if our students
are to achieve scientific literacy and escape ideological indoctrination.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Current biology instruction presents only half the scientific
picture. For example, none of the standard high school biology texts even
mentions the Cambrian explosion, arguably the most dramatic event in the
history of life. Indeed, fossil studies reveal &quot;a biological big bang&quot;
near the beginning of the Cambrian period 530 million years ago. At that
time, at least fifty separate major groups of organisms or &quot;phyla&quot;
(including all the basic body plans of modern animals) emerged suddenly
without clear precursors. Fossil finds have repeatedly confirmed a pattern
of explosive appearance and prolonged stability in living forms&oacute;not
the gradual step-by-step change predicted by neo-Darwinian theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet students don't learn about these findings. Some science
educators justify the omission on the grounds that it would confuse students.
But scientific literacy requires that students know all significant facts
whether or not they happen to support cherished theories. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or consider another example. Many biology texts tell
about the famous finches in the Galapagos Islands whose beaks have varied
in shape and length over time. They also recall how moth populations in
England darkened and then lightened in response to varying levels of industrial
pollution. Such episodes are presented as conclusive evidence for evolution.
And indeed they are, depending on how one defines evolution. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet few biology textbooks distinguish the different meanings
associated with &quot;evolution&quot;&oacute; a term that can refer to anything
from trivial change to the creation of life by strictly mindless, material
forces. Nor do they explain that the processes responsible for cyclical
variations in beak length or wing color do not explain where birds, moths
and biologists came from in the first place. As a host of distinguished
biologists (e.g. Kauffman, Raff, Miklos) have explained in recent technical
papers, small-scale &quot;micro-evolutionary&quot; change cannot be extrapolated
to explain large scale &quot;macro-evolutionary&quot; innovation. Micro-evolutionary
changes (such as variation in color or shape) merely utilize or express
existing genetic information; the large-scale macro-evolutionary change
necessary to assemble new organs or body plans requires the creation of
entirely new genetic information. Leading evolutionary biologists know this
distinction poses serious difficulties for neo-Darwinism. Students should
too.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, students should not only know the strengths and
weaknesses of neo-Darwinian theory, they should know about alternative theories,
both materialistic and otherwise. Most importantly, they should know that
many scientists do not accept the Darwinian idea that life arose as the
result of strictly mindless processes&oacute;that many scientists see powerful
evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the case of Dean Kenyon. For nearly twenty years
Professor Kenyon was a leading evolutionary theorist who specialized in
origin-of-life biology. While at Berkeley in 1969 he wrote a book that defined
evolutionary thinking on the origin-of-life for over a decade. Yet during
the late 1970s Kenyon found himself doubting his own theory. As molecular
biologists learned more about the complexity of living things, Kenyon began
to wonder whether undirected chemistry could really produce the intricate
information processing systems found in even &quot;simple&quot; cells. Studies
of the genetic molecule DNA showed that the instructions encoded along its
spine displayed all the hallmarks of intelligent communication or language.
Kenyon and many other scientists have now concluded that the information
in DNA&oacute;like the information in a computer program, an ancient scroll
or in this newspaper&oacute;had an intelligent source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Another advocate of intelligent design, Lehigh University
biochemist Michael Behe, has just written a book entitled <I>Darwin's Black
Box</I> (The Free Press 1996). Behe explains that during Darwin's time the
biochemistry of life was as mysterious to scientists as the wires and chips
inside a computer are to small children. As long as scientists didn't know
how the biochemical machinery worked, they could reasonably believe that
life had gradually self-assembled. Now that we know the inner workings of
living systems, however, we can no longer entertain such superstitions.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In one section, Behe examines the intricate workings
of an acid powered rotary engine. What does this have to do with biology?
Well, curiously this engine does not power a lawnmower or an automobile,
but the propellor-like tails of certain bacteria. Professor Behe shows that
the intricate machinery in this molecular motor requires the coordinated
interaction of some two hundred complex protein parts. Yet the absence of
almost any one of these proteins would result in the complete loss of motor
function. To believe this engine emerged gradually in a Darwinian fashion
strains credulity. Natural selection only selects functionally advantageous
systems. Yet motor function only ensues <I>after</I> the necessary parts
have independently self-assembled&oacute;an astronomically improbable event.
Behe concludes that a designing intelligence must have played a role. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Many parents in Sultan had hoped that their students
could learn about such scientific developments. The controversy began when
two ex-teachers Brent and Cindy Rappun asked the school board to consider
placing copies of Professor Kenyon's supplementary biology text, <I>Pandas
and People, </I>in the school library. <I>Pandas</I> has been endorsed by
Professor Behe and many other scientists including professors from Princeton
and Oxford.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nevertheless, many asserted that the book's defense of
intelligent design did not qualify as science, since the intelligent designer
postulated by scientists cannot be observed or tested. Yet scientists often
infer unobservable entities&oacute;quarks, forces, fields, the big bang&oacute;to
explain observable evidence. Darwinists themselves postulate unobservable
&quot;transitional&quot; organisms and allegedly creative processes that
occur too slowly to be observed. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Further, origins theories, whether Darwinian or otherwise,
are not tested by making predictions and observing the results in controlled
laboratory settings as some seem to assume. Rather, they are tested by comparing
the explanatory power of one theory against another. Historical scientists
evaluate theories rather like detectives who must determine which crime
scenario best explains the available evidence. Contemporary design theorists
favor their theory precisely because they believe it has greater explanatory
power than strict Darwinism. And there's nothing unscientific in that. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Of course, many claimed that allowing students to consider
evidence for intelligent design would constitute religious indoctrination.
Many tried to equate design with fundamentalist religion and the discredited
&quot;creation science&quot; movement. But design theory is not &quot;creation-science.&quot;
It does not reject modern geology. Nor is it derived from religious authority
or biblical teaching. Instead, intelligent design is an inference derived
from biological evidence. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even so, all origins theories have some unavoidable philosophical
(and even religious) implications. The present crop of biology texts make
no attempt to hide the anti-theistic implications of contemporary Darwinism.
Douglas Futuyma's book tells students that Darwinism makes &quot;theological
explanations&quot; of life &quot;superfluous.&quot; Kenneth Miller's book
insists that &quot;evolution works without either plan or purpose.&quot;
By denying any evidence of intelligent design in nature, Darwinist texts
promote the anti-theistic philosophy known as materialism. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The threat of indoctrination does not come from allowing
students to ponder the philosophical questions raised by the origins issue.
Instead, it comes from force-feeding students a single ideological perspective.
The rather modest effort in Sultan to prevent this, is hardly cause for
hysteria.</FONT> <BR>

<PRE>
Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder continues to be widely-published and sought after for his thoughts
on the future of high technology and telecommunications. Gilder's &quot;Telecosm&quot; series is featured in each issue of the highly influential Forbes ASAP magazine. His work
was the subject of a lengthy cover story in the March 1996 issue of Wired magazine. In addition, his theories
were the focal point for a piece in the January 1996 issue of the same magazine.

Frequently testifying before the U.S. Congress, <A HREF="ggtstmny2.html">(read Gilder's April testimony)</A> Gilder will next appear in April before the Senate Commerce
Committee on the need for change in spectrum allocation policy and the future of the FCC. In late March,
Gilder will premiere an eight hour multimedia presentation on the technological future, developed at Discovery
recently. The first showings: a conference of 1,000 business executives in Brazil, followed by presentations
in Japan and Italy. In addition to his work on high technology, Gilder has written a number of notable articles recently on other
subjects: on the immigration debate (&quot;Geniuses from Abroad&quot;) in the Wall Street Journal, and on welfare
reform (&quot;How Welfare Seduced Sam Brewer&quot;) in the February 1996 Reader's Digest. </PRE>
<H3>Program Notes</H3>
<PRE>Frank Gregorsky, former chief assistant to Rep. Newt Gingrich and a Discovery Fellow, will move to Seattle
this Spring. He is currently completing his latest work editing the recent speeches and presentations of George
Gilder.

</center>

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in 
communications from Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. She and 
her husband, Michael Hamrick, reside in Northern Virginia.

<title>Daily Commentary - January 21, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 21, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

One of the most important lessons of Watergate is that the abuse
of presidential power is very dangerous.  That's why the latest
reports of the Clinton administration conducting politically-motivated
tax audits are so troubling.

<p>

The IRS is headed by Margaret Milner Richardson, a close friend
of Hillary Clinton.  Miss Richardson is conducting audits of several
high-profile conservative organizations.  Some of these groups
have been characterized as &quot;enemies&quot; by the White House.
What's really fishy about this is not a single comparable liberal
group is being audited.

<p>

Tax audits are intrusive; they drag out for months and cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars in legal fees.  They have the power to
destroy these groups, and they're an awesome weapon in silencing
political opponents.  But it's illegal for any administration
to use the IRS for political purposes.

<p>

That's why we are calling for a Congressional investigation of
the IRS's selection of targets for audit.  Using law enforcement
to punish political opponents is an intolerable abuse of power
in a free country.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.
That number again:  1-800-225-4008.

<title>January 21, 1996 Press Release</title>

<body>

<font size=-1>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
January 21, 1996<br>
CONTACT: Kristi S. Hamrick -- (202) 393-2100. For Radio: Kristin Hansen.

<p>

<center><h2>MEDICAL MARIJUANA<br>
BLOWING SMOKE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>RICHMOND, VA --</b> Family Research Council Senior Policy Analyst
Robert L. Maginnis testified Tuesday before the Virginia General
Assembly that no reliable evidence exists to support the idea
that so-called medical marijuana is either safe or effective.
Maginnis said the &quot;marijuana for medicine&quot; strategy
that the pro-legalization lobby has spent 25 years developing
is merely a ploy designed to undermine public resolve against
legalization.

<p>

Virginia's legislative hearing is one of several that will be
held around the country at the state level as the concept marijuana
for medical purposes gains nationwide attention.  Twenty-five
states currently have laws permitting the use of marijuana for
so-called medical purposes.

<p>

Maginnis said: &quot;The most frightening aspect of these laws
is the message they send to our children.  At a time when teens'
pot use is skyrocketing, continuing to officially label marijuana
as anything other than a dangerous drug is wrong.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis added:  &quot;Most doctors would never recommend smoking
tobacco to lose weight; foxclub plant for heart failure; or utrebark
for breast cancer.  These materials may contain chemicals with
therapeutic value for the affliction, but doctors would never
think to recommend smoking as a health therapy.  Pot is crude
and impure.  Using it for medicine is like offering a patient
pond water rather than bottled water.  It's bad medicine.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis concluded:  &quot;Laws permitting marijuana as medicine
are not compassionate but a bad practice.  We should never encourage
our doctors to recommend something that is harmful and addictive
when effective therapies are readily available.&quot;

<p>

<b>For more information or scientific studies that expose the
fallacy of so-called medical marijuana call the FRC Media office.

<p>

Bob Maginnis is available for interviews.</b>

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<PRE>

The tremendous growth of the Internet over the past few years has brought a host of issues to the fore. Those
of immediate concern include security, intellectual property, digital records management and access,
jurisdiction, taxation, privacy, electronic payments and transactions, and the resolution of Internet disputes.
Attempts by governmental bodies to resolve these issues have resulted in rulings that are inconsistent and
unsatisfactory to the vast majority of Internet users.

To resolve current and future issues of importance to the international community of users, the Internet Law
Task Force (ILTF) was created at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium held in Seattle last year. After
months of deliberations, the Internet Law and Policy Forum has been created. A non-governmental, global
organization, it is based for the interim at Discovery Institute. The goal of the Forum will be to achieve a
secure Internet, facilitate Internet communications in an atmosphere of self-regulation, and achieve the
harmonization of Internet law and policy at a global level, according to Albert Gidari, Discovery Senior
Fellow and one of the organization's founders.

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

 REAL REFORM OR PILOT PROGRAMS?
</h2>

by Thomas M. Lenard <p>


<br>
The most important idea now under consideration for reforming the Food and

Drug Administration is to permit manufacturers to use private organizations,

accredited by the FDA, to certify the safety and effectiveness of their new

drugs and medical devices.  This idea is central to the FDA reform

legislation on which the House will hold hearings this week, and is also an

element in the Senate Bill.<p>

Faced with a mountain of evidence supporting third-party review, from both

Europe and from U.S. pilot projects, the FDAs only response is to propose

yet another pilot project  for third-party review of low-risk medical

devices.  Let us hope the Congress will see this for what it is --

bureaucratic stonewalling by an agency trying to protect its turf -- and

conclude that the time for pilot programs is past.
<p>
Third-party review is of critical importance to FDA reform because it

addresses the fundamental cause of current deficiencies in drug and device

oversight -- the FDAs "monopoly" on new product approvals.  Like any other

monopoly, the FDAs stranglehold on entry to clinical research and new

product approvals means there is no effective institutional check on the

regulatory creep that inexorably has added time, costs, and unpredictability

to the review and approval process.  Over the last thirty years, the time

required to bring a new drug to market, from the test tube to the patient,

has increased steadily, from a little more than six years in the mid-1960s to

almost 15 years currently.
<p>
The viability of third-party review as a solution to the FDAs problems is

well established.  European medical device regulation is based entirely on a

system of competing, private, government-certified "notified bodies."
<p>
 Manufacturers retain these companies to certify compliance with a large set

of design and production standards.  With the exception of low-risk devices,

which manufacturers can self-certify, a medical device can gain access to the

European market only through one of these notified bodies.  Because of this

system, a product that requires six years to bring to market in the United

States takes four years in Europe.  As a result, medical device manufacturers

in large numbers are first introducing their products offshore, and American

patients increasingly are receiving therapies that are several generations

behind those available in Europe.
<p>
In the case of pharmaceuticals, private entities in this country have

performed all functions including implementing clinical development programs,

preparing New Drug Applications (NDAs) and even, on a pilot-project basis,

conducting final reviews.  In 1992, as part of a project to study the use of

outside experts, the Mitre Corporation was chosen to review five

"supplemental" NDAs (applications for new uses for already-approved products)

using FDAs statutory criteria.  They were consistent with FDAs policies and

the agency found no reason to overturn them.  The Mitre reviews were by all

accounts high quality and low cost.  And, they were conducted very

efficiently:  While the FDA takes an average of 28.3 months for its

supplemental reviews (according to data collected by Joseph DiMasi at Tufts),

Mitre completed its reviews in from two to four months.
<p>
The FDAs new proposed pilot project is so tepid that Rep. Jim Greenwood, who

is leading FDA reform efforts in the House, was prompted to observe:  "With

American heart patients having to travel to Italy for life-saving cardiac

stents, with FDA delays causing one-fifth of our medical device industry

moving overseas, the best the FDA can come up with is a pilot program for

third party review of tongue depressors!"
<p>
When the European system of device regulation has been so successful that it

is in the process of capturing our medical device industry, another pilot

program is no more than a delaying tactic.  For proof, we may simply ask what

use the FDA has made of lessons learned from its last pilot.  The answer:

 Despite the success of the Mitre project, the FDA has not increased the use

of outside reviewers.  So much for FDA pilot programs!
<p>
Meaningful FDA reform must address the agencys certification monopoly and

introduce competitive pressures into the drug and device approval processes.
<p>
 As long as the only route to the American market is through the FDA, the

development of new medical products will continue to be plagued by

unnecessary costs and delays and the adverse trends in product availability

and development times are likely to continue.
<p>
While third-party review would produce radical reform, it is not a radical

idea; the Europeans have been using third parties for years to certify their

medical devices.  Could we ask for a better "pilot program"?

<BR>
<B>Less than a decade</B> after the great victories of the Cold War and
Desert Storm, the U.S. military faces a very different kind of crisis&oacute;indeed,
a crisis unique in all of military experience. Numerous factors have contributed:
a complex, volatile world situation; the spread of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD); the military technological revolution; deep budget cuts; and the
ill-advised use of the military to advance certain Politically Correct civilian
political and cultural agendas. Each of these problems can and must be addressed
individually, through normal policy channels. But, taken together, they
constitute a crisis so profound that the American people must also become
involved. Unfortunately, for reasons ranging from media bias to normal peacetime
inattentiveness, the American people have scant idea of either the depth
or the complexity of the crisis.<BR>
<BR>
It is time to make the people aware. It is also time for a new, historically
unprecedented covenant between the American people and the defense establishment
that exists to protect them, their territory, and their interests. In the
past, the American people have supported the military with their treasure,
and their sons and daughters. They shall continue to do so. But now &oacute;
and this is the essence of the new covenant &oacute; the American people
must defend their defenders against unwise and unwarranted civilian political
pressures and agendas. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives have argued for years against excessive budget cuts and imprudent
use of the military in other-than-war situations. But only in recent months
have conservatives and concerned centrists begun seriously to address the
problems of subjecting the military to social engineering and experimentation.
There has been outcry, and the marshaling of evidence. But, sadly and predictably,
the public debate has descended into a &igrave;rights versus readiness&icirc;
mode. Conservatives have argued the needs of the military while the PC left
has argued &igrave;rights&icirc; &oacute; unfortunately, a far more evocative
theme in this era. The conservative approach is necessary and correct, but
insufficient either to save the military or to place the military crisis
in a larger national context. Conservatives know that, ever since Vietnam,
the PC left has assailed the military as a strategic target in the Culture
War: the final bastion of traditional values. But conservatives naively
underestimated the tenacity and ferocity of the PC foe. The results are
now becoming clear: military resignations by the thousands, ruined careers
by the hundreds, suicides, and the gradual degradation of the ability to
fight. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives (and concerned centrists and non-PC liberals) understand this.
But conservatives, by and large, have yet to do what the PC left has done
so successfully: make the military a cultural issue, and do so in a manner
relevant and compelling to the largest possible audience. There are two
reasons for this, both valid. First, many of those most knowledgeable about
the military tend not to venture beyond their area of expertise (a notable
and happy exception: decorated marine veteran, novelist, and former navy
secretary James Webb). Second, many conservatives of non-military background
stress only the need for traditional values: again, a correct and necessary
approach, but insufficient to reach and influence the widest possible audience.
<BR>
<BR>
This Discovery Inquiry provides a strategy for a &igrave;Culture Wars&icirc;
approach to military issues that can help generate the popular support necessary
for policy changes. The Inquiry has two parts. The first proposes the contours
of a new covenant between people and military. The second suggests the structure
of a new debate, through which conservatives and concerned centrists can
carry the subject to the largest possible audience: the general public as
well as decision-makers, analysts and punditry. Accordingly, this Inquiry
contains no policy recommendations. These will be provided in forthcoming
papers. What matters here is to introduce a concept that is as relevant
to the American society as to the American military, as relevant to the
Culture Wars of the last few decades as to future military conflicts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, Americans worried that the military might grow too distant
from the people. Today, the reverse has happened. The American military
has become too much like the society it exists to defend. Indeed, the military&iacute;s
crisis provides a metaphor for the ills of the culture as a whole. In a
sense, when Americans look at the military, they&iacute;re looking into
a mirror. <BR>
<BR>
And it&iacute;s time to start asking: Do we entirely like what we see?<BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>I. Toward a new covenant</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Any covenant between people and military must contain two
elements: a clear statement of what the people expect and require of the
military, and a statement of what they&iacute;re prepared to do to ensure
that the military meets these requirements. But first, it would be useful
to clarify one of the most abused and misunderstood concepts in the American
political lexicon: civilian control of the military.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Civilian control of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The American military belongs to the American people. It
does not belong to the government. Today, the government has expanded the
doctrine of &igrave;civilian control of the military&icirc; in ways that
the Founders would have deemed abhorrent, and which common sense indicates
can only lead to catastrophe.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Founders desired civilian control of the military to forestall
military adventurism, foreign and domestic. But control was never meant
to entail government micromanagement and arbitrary interference in purely
military matters. The Congressional power to raise armies and maintain navies
did not imply that Congress should routinely substitute its opinions for
the professional judgment of the military on military matters. The president&iacute;s
role as commander-in-chief does not entitle him to command troops in the
field . . . or to supervise routine military matters and operations from
the comfort of the Oval Office. No one save the Supreme Court ever decreed
that the Court should intervene in military affairs. Civilian control meant,
and should mean, making sure that the military remains subordinate and responsive
to the will of the people (through the instrumentality of the government)
in its defense of the people. The government abuses its authority when it
forces the military to abdicate its professional expertise and values to
honor the whims and advance the fortunes of whoever happens to occupy the
White House or hold some position in Congress.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The institutional trend toward civilian micromanage-ment and
interference in purely military affairs began in 1947, with the establishment
of the Department of Defense, and creation of a secretary of defense whose
full-time job it was to manage services whose secretaries formerly reported
directly to the president. The trend intensified during the Kennedy and
Johnson years, when secretary Robert McNamara , who pointedly denied the
validity of military expertise &igrave;There is no more strategy, only crisis
management&icirc; &oacute; usurped many of the planning and budgetary powers
of the services, and began using the military for social engineering and
experimentation. Project 100,000, which forced the military to accept unqualified
entrants for service during the latter years of Vietnam, may indeed have
helped some unfortunate souls. For the military, it was at best a costly
and disruptive additional burden. Since then, the routine and often arbitrary
substitution of civilian for military judgment in purely military matters
has permeated the military and corrupted its functioning, its ethics, and
its morale.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, the military of a democratic society must reflect,
to the extent possible, the core values of that society: equality, justice,
the value of the individual. But the military is also a unique profession,
engaged in a unique activity. The issue is balance, and the balance of one
era will differ from another. Today, the government is upsetting that balance
by advancing PC civilian agendas, just as surely as it upsets the balance
by buying pork-barrel weapons or maintaining useless bases while starving
essential programs. In this sense, the use of the military to advance PC
civilian agendas is part of the larger problem of the limits of governmental
interference in internal military affairs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the people</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>In the abstract, the requirements of the people have not
changed one iota since the Founders determined to provide for the common
defense. These include protection of people and territory; defense of vital
national interests; and the occasional use of military capabilities for
other purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But defense is not an abstraction. Forces are raised and maintained
to deal with specific threats in specific places at specific times. They
also exist to deal with the unexpected, the evolving, and the accidental.
They cannot, therefore, be artificially limited by bureaucratic or professional
preferences, or by constricted views of what a military should or should
not do. This is especially true in periods of rapid change.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, this does not mean that, in such periods, &igrave;anything
goes.&icirc; The present world and domestic situations are complex and in
some ways incoherent. Still, the lack of a clearly-defined mortal enemy
&oacute; an Axis or a Soviet Union &oacute; and the lack of a clear national
consensus on certain cultural and moral matters does not justify incoherence
or expedient military thinking. Nor should the blurring of previously distinct
boundaries between domestic law-enforcement and the military be used as
an excuse for avoiding serious consideration of why that blurring may be
necessary. The United States may have to live without a clear declaratory
strategy for some time to come, and with an increasingly unpalatable cultural
and social situation. But, in the long run, it cannot live without a clear
sense of the requirements of national survival and welfare.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Homeland Defense</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>First and foremost, the people require that the military defend
their lives, territory, and property against deadly attack. Today, this
means defense against weapons of mass destruction (WMD), whether a single
terrorist device or an accidental or limited launch by a hostile state or
subnational group. Sadly, it may also include defense against domestic terrorism/insurrection
that may have foreign support. Defense against WMD is no longer a nice-to-have
adjunct to conventional military capabilities. Nor does it become a law-enforcement
matter when such devices are assembled or brought into the United States,
rather than fired at it. Indeed, never before has the fundamental problem
of home defense seen such a confluence between foreign and domestic threats.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Militarily, the vital task is: How to locate little things
(Scud launchers, cruise missiles on yachts, suitcase bombs, anthrax canisters)
in big places (the Iraqi desert, Manhattan, the Pacific Ocean) and then
get the information to those who can do something about it before the detonation.
The military&iacute;s primary responsibility here is to develop and field
&igrave;multi-use&icirc; defenses and supporting systems that can protect
troops in the field, theater-level operations, and the homeland. For example,
Aegis-equipped naval vessels, originally designed to protect carrier battle
groups against massed air attack, can do picket duty off the coast of Saudi
Arabia . . . or Puget Sound. 747s equipped with anti-missile lasers can
deploy in defense of London or Long Beach. Countering small numbers of relatively
rudimentary weapons is far easier than the challenges faced during the Cold
War. Vital technologies are far more advanced. Only lack of political will
(and wisdom) prevent anti-WMD defenses from becoming reality.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The military&iacute;s second homeland responsibility entails
operating in that gray area between conventional war and law enforcement.
Here the military finds itself in an alliance of convenience with the civil
libertarians. Neither wants the military involved, the former for professional
and bureaucratic reasons, the latter for fear of constitutional trespass.
Both concerns are valid. But the military&iacute;s responsibility is to
defend the nation against the threats it faces, whether those threats be
&igrave;conventional&icirc; or not. And whatever else may be said of the
Bill of Rights, it is not a suicide pact. Military participation in two
counter-terrorism activities &ntilde; intelligence and armed response &ntilde;
must, of course, be carefully monitored and limited when it occurs within
the United States. But it must not be proscribed for fear that any military
involvement automatically and inevitably produces mass violations of civil
liberties, military dictatorship, or worse. The issue is balance, not a
spurious either/or.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third homeland responsibility is disaster relief after the
use of WMD. This mission should be entrusted to the National Guard, and
funded appropriately. The advantages are obvious. Guard units already know
the territory they&iacute;ll work in and routinely participate in non-terrorist
disaster relief. Since the active-duty military rarely needs this capability
in peacetime, assigning the mission to the Guard cuts the expenses by 50
percent or more. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Major conventional conflict</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Properly maintained and modernized, U.S. conventional forces
will remain by far the most capable on earth. Their primary function should
be to serve as a deterrent. Failing that, conventional forces should be
prepared to win, quickly if possible, but always decisively and with minimal
loss of life.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>These capabilities need not be linked to dubious concepts such
Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, ground power should reside in
the reserves and the National Guard. These forces cost considerably less
than full-time equivalents and can be made combat ready in less time than
&igrave;weekend warrior&icirc; folklore &ntilde; or the instinctive preferences
of the active establishment for active forces &oacute; would indicate. This
does not mean, of course, that reliance on reserves should be used to justify
excessive cuts in active structure. Simplistic formulas such as &igrave;all
heavy forces into the Guard&icirc; should be avoided. It does mean that
the bulk of the country&iacute;s land combat power should reside with the
people.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is true for another reason. Mobilization of the reserves
and Guard provides a crucial test of popular will and support, as the Persian
Gulf experience demonstrated. The war demonstrated this because, in the
aftermath of Vietnam, the Army structured itself so that it could not wage
protracted war without the reserves. That policy paid political as well
as military dividends. Further, in this era of power devolving from the
federal to state levels, the National Guard &oacute; a classic &igrave;multi-use
system&icirc; &oacute; should be strengthened.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Operations other than war and short of war</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States cannot be the world&iacute;s policeman. It
should not try to be the world&iacute;s social worker, therapist, or nanny.
There is more misery out there than America can ever hope to alleviate.
U.S. forces do not exist for these purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, a world in which aggression runs rampant, and in which
atrocity becomes standard media fare, is in nobody&iacute;s interest, save
that of aggressors and criminals. From time to time, humanitarian, peace-keeping,
or peace-enforcing operations may become desirable. The American people,
generous and humane, understand this. They also understand that such operations
rarely achieve their objectives. And those with experience in this area
know that such operations are costly, demanding, demoralizing, and distracting.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because of the uncertainty of the world situation, it is probably
unwise to rely on a checklist approach to decision-making. As a rule, commitment
to other-than war operations generally should be regarded with healthy skepticism
and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Further, belief in the value of &igrave;America&iacute;s
global leadership role&icirc; should not be used as justification for imprudent
engagement. &igrave;Showing our resolve to show our resolve&icirc; rarely
fools anyone for long. Further, every global problem is also a regional
and local problem, and best handled at those levels. Only when these fail,
or cannot succeed without U.S. support, should direct involvement become
an option. And if U.S. direct involvement is vital, it goes without saying
that no compelling reason exists to place U.S. forces under foreign command.
It also goes without saying that funding for such operations should not
come out of military appropriations, and that other nations should be encouraged
to contribute.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Beyond this, operations short of/other than war should make
maximum use of reserve and National Guard assets. This has been true since
Vietnam for certain capabilities, including air transport, medical, special
operations, and supply. Reserve and Guard use should be expanded to include
ground forces. Just as mobilization provides a de facto &igrave;people&iacute;s
veto&icirc; on entering major war, so does selective participation offer
a test of popular support for lesser contingencies.<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>We now come to the most difficult issue: What are the obligations
of the American people to the military? Throughout most of this country&iacute;s
history, the answer has been, nothing. Properly speaking, there has never
been a covenant between people and military, certainly nothing on the Israeli
or Prussian models. There has been no need.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>American attitudes toward the military have always been conflicted.
Belief in military service as an obligation of citizenship coexisted with
a lively detestation of that obligation&iacute;s practical expression, the
draft. Admiration of the military as a profession &oacute; admiration for
qualities of courage, purpose, discipline, and devotion &oacute; still thrives,
but so does distaste for &igrave;lifers&icirc; and contempt for bureaucrats
in uniform. Traditionally, the military has enjoyed a higher status than
the well-publicized &igrave;detestation&icirc; of the left might suggest.
But this good will rarely has translated into direct support for the institution.
Americans have paid taxes, sent their sons and daughters, supported the
troops, and aided the veterans for centuries. The people have also benefited
the military by their innate caution regarding foreign involvements and
reluctance to accept heavy casualties. But the sense of obligation has been
attached to citizenship and to country, not to the military as such. Never
before have the American people been asked to defend their domestic political,
social, and cultural forces.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the American people have two new responsibilities
toward their defenders. The first is to insure adequate funding for development
and deployment of defense against WMD, and for modernization sufficient
to maintain the conventional deterrent (a modernization that should include
further downsizing and outsourcing of support functions and major restructuring
of combat forces). The second responsibility is to defend the defenders
against civilian PC agendas that produce significant erosion of military
capability, while the military evolves a new balance appropriate to its
needs and democratic values of equality and opportunity. It is often forgotten
that, when President Truman ordered the desegregation of the military, African
Americans were already present in force, and had proven themselves in two
world wars. The inclusion of women in non-support roles is an entirely different
matter; no civilization in history has ever tried it, save in extremis.
So are issues related to the inclusion of openly homosexual men.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>II. To contour the debate</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Since the 1970s, the U.S. military has been under implacable
assault by an array of radical feminist, gay-rights, and other forces who
regard the military as &igrave;key terrain&icirc; in the Culture War and
who appear willfully oblivious to, and sometimes delighted by, the damage
they do. But (to reiterate) only recently has conservatism recognized the
seriousness of the assault. The conservative strategy has been to reaffirm
the obvious: that the military exists to perform certain unique functions;
that its traditional values relate to its functions; and that whatever harms
the ability to perform those functions is unacceptable. This strategy is
not wrong. But, to those with agendas of their own, and to much of the public,
it is largely irrelevant.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In order to begin to correct this situation&oacute;in order
to defend the defenders successfully&oacute;it is necessary to reformulate
the issue, away from the scripted pseudo-exchanges of &igrave;rights versus
readiness,&icirc; toward forms resonant in the larger culture and society.
This can be done in two ways: first, by changing the structure of the debate
and, second, by presenting the military as symbolic of what&iacute;s been
happening in the country as a whole. Conservatives and concerned centrists
must not confine themselves to presenting the military as an institution
apart, the unique exception to the rules. The present crisis should be seen
as a metaphor for what happens when individual &igrave;rights,&icirc; sexuality,
and &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; come to negate, not only individual responsibilities,
but also common purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Therefore, emphasize the following:</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The vast majority
of women and minorities in the military are not the enemy. The problem rather
comes from those self-appointed activists who presume to speak and act on
their behalf, while damaging the very institution to which these women and
minorities have dedicated themselves. Equality is here to stay, and equality
means equality of responsibility as well as equality of opportunity. Equality
of opportunity includes the chance for honest failure: There are things
not everyone can do, and honest failure is no disgrace. Equality of responsibility
does not, and cannot, mean sameness.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>There is no such
thing as a &igrave;right&icirc; to serve in the military. No one has it.
Nor is there any right to any particular job or security clearance. There
is no right to remain in the military, commensurate with civilian employment
protection. To define the military in terms of rights is to reduce it to
a vehicle for advancing the careers and agendas of individuals and pressure
groups. This is like saying that the purpose of a business is to benefit
its employees, with no reference to what that business is supposed to produce
or how it functions against the competition. Military necessity takes precedence
over manufactured individual &igrave;rights.&icirc;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>But &igrave;military
necessity&icirc; is not an historical absolute. Once, military necessity
required corporal punishment and drumhead courts martial. Once, military
necessity seemed to require exclusion of African Americans. In the largest
sense, a democracy&iacute;s military must reflect its values. Today, these
values include an unprecedented degree of tolerance and willingness to experiment
with social arrangements. But even these values must, in the end, recognize
that reality imposes limits, in the military as in all other activities.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>That said, sexuality
poses peculiar problems for the military. Sexuality, unlike race or ethnicity,
entails behavior. Sexual behaviors acquire special significance in an institution
as hierarchical as the military, and under conditions of extreme danger,
stress, and privation. The radical feminist agenda requires that heterosexual
males conform completely to their codes of behavior and thought, while demanding
nothing of women. The gay agenda demands total acceptance under any and
all conditions. One need not be either male chauvinist or homophobic to
ask what self-controls might be required of women and gays, especially under
extreme conditions. By the same token &oacute; and this is an issue that
conservatives have yet to address &oacute; it seems wrong to exclude entire
categories of persons from service, or from certain kinds of service, on
the basis of what they might do. It also seems wrong to legitimize the notion
of &igrave;behavioral minorities.&icirc; A more compelling approach would
be to emphasize that the responsibilities of women and gays toward the military
&oacute; indeed, toward the country &oacute; could conceivably include not
serving, or not serving in particular capacities.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And therein may lie a possible new balance, with &igrave;role
model&icirc; potential for the larger society. At a July 1996 Heritage Foundation
National Security Symposium, retired Army Col. William Hauser suggested
that the military should be deemed to have a central &igrave;core&icirc;
&ntilde; the combat arms &ntilde; which must be allowed to retain its traditional
values and exclusions. The non-combat portions of the military could adopt
far more liberal personnel policies. The PC left will no doubt object that
this violates their principles of &igrave;equality&icirc; as the only absolute,
and &igrave;equality&icirc; no matter what the real-world cost to other
people and to common purposes. Conservatives may emphasize negative effects
on readiness and object to the perceived surrender of principle. Still,
it seems a reasonable compromise: exclusion only when absolute military
necessity requires it, inclusion the rest of the time.</FONT> <BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5></FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>To bring about a new covenant between people and military,
two separate but related efforts are necessary. One is to emphasize that,
while the abstract responsibilities of the military have not changed, the
real-world situation is unprecedented. Old formulas, old divisions of labor,
no longer avail. The second is to emphasize that support of the military
can no longer be limited to paying taxes and waving flags. The defenders
need to know what they&iacute;re expected to defend, and that they will
be defended in turn. One effort should resemble that of the late 1970s and
early 80s in making public the need to rebuild America.s defenses &oacute;
a campaign that helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1980, and then aided his defense
program during the crucial first years. The other effort should resemble
that of the late 1980s and early 1990s, documenting and publicizing PC in
the military as it was exposed on campus. In purely military terms, the
goal should be to convert popular awareness into pressures for policy changes
that will bring about a new and livable balance. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But, in the larger sense, the military disarray must be addressed
as part of the larger American crisis of values: specifically, of creating
a world of endless &igrave;rights&icirc; and demands, to the exclusion of
responsibilities and purposes, of elevating sexuality to the status of an
absolute, and of making &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; a legally actionable
standard of conduct. In this final sense, the goal should be to make the
struggle over the military the &igrave;beginning of the end&icirc; battle
of the Culture War &ntilde; to demonstrate both the limits of PC engineering
and the ability of the military to adapt to changing civilian values, and
thereby to suggest that reasonable compromise &ntilde; the way of democracy
&ntilde; can be attained, whether the PC crowd likes it or not.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And, in the end, the debate over the proper composition and
uses of the military reveals one of the fundamental truths of civilized
life. If what unites us is more important than what divides us, we are friends;
we can work it out. If what divides us is more important than what unites
us, we are enemies; our relations will be determined by the exercise of
power. The uniting issue here is the survival and security of the United
States: a goal which can be achieved in many different ways. Only those
united in this matter should have standing in this debate.</FONT> <BR>

But a nation can bestrong in the wrong ways. Since the 1994 election, there has been a growingdebate over the condition of the American military. Unfortunately, it isthe wrong debate, leading to the wrong conclusion-that America's defenseproblems can be solved by money alone. In reality, the present defense establishmentis an Industrial Age organization struggling to adapt to two new worlds:that of the post-Cold War disorder and that of the microchip. This year,the American people will devote well over a quarter-trillion dollars tothis increasingly obsolescent military structure. Because of mistakes duringthe post-Cold War builddown, some small selective, short-term increaseswill be necessary. But in the long run, the proper course is not to spendmore. The proper course is to spend smarter. This Discovery Inquiry offersa conceptual tool for thinking about such change. </I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><H4>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </H4><BR><BR>The current debate over national defense exhibits a curious sterility. Onthe surface, much of it involves the impassioned swapping of clich&eacute;s.Yes, we will always need somebody with a rifle on the ground; yes, aircraftcarriers can do things land-based aviation can't; yes, land-based airpowercan do things carriers can't; yes, redundancy of capabilities is important.Such statements have a &quot;true but not very helpful&quot; quality, sincethey say nothing about the proper mix of forces, or how to prepare and employthem. And, rather often, the clich&eacute;-mongers turn out to be thosewith special interests to protect. <BR><BR><BR>Beneath the bromides, the debate centers on two issues. One is readiness:real and perceived current inadequacies and the perhaps imminent dangerof a hollow force, unable to accomplish its missions, due to lack of training,equipment, and supply. The other is the capability of the current force,even if fully prepared, to handle the two &quot;nearly simultaneous majorregional conflicts&quot; posited as the strategic baseline in the Clintonadministration's Bottom-Up Review. <BR><BR><BR>So far, much of this debate has been an exercise in bean-counting, i.e.,quantitative assessments of how many billions spent, how many ships, divisions,and planes available, how many training days missed. These dry statisticsare often counterpointed by what might be termed &quot;analysis-by-anecdote&quot;-amelange of uncritically collected and repeated horror stories. <BR><BR><BR>The problem with this approach is twofold. First, readiness, like education,is a difficult condition to quantify. Statistics are easily manipulated,and readiness itself means nothing without asking: &quot;Readiness for what?&quot;For example, not everybody goes to war at once. If a division requires onemonth to prepare for deployment, but transportation won't be available forthree, high readiness is actually wasteful. Further, the services are stilldownsizing; it makes no sense to lavish resources on units slated for abolition.Many of the readiness horror stories appear to come out of lower-priorityunits. <BR><BR><BR>But more importantly, indices of readiness say nothing about what kindsof forces the U.S. ought to have. The analogy may be extreme but, in 1939,the Poles had the most ready cavalry in Europe. It is true that, short-term,the present force must be maintained at adequate, perhaps unprecedentedlyhigh levels. And, in fact, there is evidence that shortages have begun toaffect higher-priority units. But it is also true that the current forceis simply too large to be maintained at such readiness on any politicallyconceivable peacetime budget. Thus, the very attempt to maintain too largea force actually decreases overall readiness. A smaller force, differentlystructured and postured, is the logical alternative. <BR><BR><BR>Not surprisingly, the same bean-counting mentality that decrees the presentforce unready also calls for larger forces if the strategic requirementsof the Bottom-Up Review-the Clinton administration's conventional defensestrategy-are to be met. But the fundamental problem with the Bottom-Up Reviewis not that the forces available are inadequate. The problem with the Bottom-UpReview is that it's conceptually inadequate, and should be treated as such.<BR><BR><BR>The Bottom-Up Review posits the need to win two more-or-less simultaneousconflicts, presumably one in the Persian Gulf and one in Korea. The rationaleis that, should the U.S. find itself immersed in one war, another regionalpredator might be tempted to take advantage of the fact and start a second.Whether this might happen is speculative, at best. Less speculative is thefact that such a situation would be a national emergency unparalleled sincePearl Harbor (especially if an Iranian-Iraqi alliance ever materializes).Yet the Bottom-Up Review counts only active forces. In a two-front, perhapsa two-continent war, early and massive reserve mobilization would be unavoidable.<BR><BR><BR>Further, the Review accepts-indeed, effectively mandates-an operationalconcept guaranteed to produce maximum U.S. casualties and minimum results.In both wars, the U.S. would permit the aggressor to strike cross-borderfirst. U.S. forces would then &quot;stabilize the front,&quot; await reinforcements,counterattack and restore the status quo ante. Some of these forces, mostnotably heavy bombers and Marines, would &quot;swing&quot; between warsin a process lasting several months. This &quot;wait-get-hit-stabilize-reinforce-and-restore&quot;approach, itself a legacy of NATO planning for a Soviet invasion, workedin Desert Shield/Desert Storm largely because of Saddam Hussein's acquiescence.It must be doubted that the U.S. will ever again find so breathtakinglyco-operative an adversary. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, the Bottom-Up Review is far from the first U.S. strategy to sufferfrom a bad case of what is known at the Pentagon as the &quot;plans/realitymismatch.&quot; In the 1960s, Mr. McNamara and his Whiz Kids produced the&quot;2 1/2 War Strategy&quot;-simultaneous combat with the Soviets, theCommunist Chinese, and somebody else in a little war somewhere. (That 1/2war turned out to be Vietnam, which nearly wrecked the defense establishment.)Under Nixon, it became the &quot;1 1/2 War Strategy.&quot; During the Carteradministration, a &quot;Swing Strategy&quot;-moving hollow forces from warto war-enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame, and, mercifully, zero momentsof employment. <BR><BR><BR>In this sense, the Bottom-Up Review is not much different from its predecessors,and proof once again of General Eisenhower's dictum that &quot;Planningis essential; plans are useless.&quot; Or perhaps the Bottom-Up Review shouldbe regarded as merely a particularly inept transitional document, somethingto stick in the drawer until the world situation clarifies. But it mightnot be a bad idea if that drawer were to remain empty for a while. If theUnited States cannot currently produce a serious military strategy, perhapsit makes more sense to concentrate on the resources first. Then, with thattask underway, it might be useful to rewrite the brochure. <BR><H4>FORCE STRUCTURE, ROLES AND MISSIONS </H4><BR><BR>The military capabilities of any defense establishment are embedded in itsforce structure. Creating this structure is both art and science. Structuringentails an endless series of decisions and trade-offs: what to leave in,what to leave out, how to achieve the necessary combat synergies. Forcestructure is everything from how many divisions in the Army (and whetherdivisions are still a useful kind of organization) to how many riflemenin a squad and who will carry the grenade launchers and machine guns; howmany ships in the fleet and of what types; how many heavy bombers and whatkinds of munitions they will carry. <BR><BR><BR>Theoretically, and usually in practice, a nation's force structure is determinedby its geographical position and strategic needs. Historically, for mostnations, necessity requires that one service or form of power dominate;the others support. In the 20th century, for example, Germany and Russiawere land powers. Both got into serious strategic and economic trouble whenthey started acquiring navies they didn't need, but that threatened maritimepowers. Conversely, Great Britain was primarily a naval power; extendedland combat in two world wars devastated the country. Israel is a land power,although its situation dictates a very strong Air Force. Other countries-NorthVietnam comes to mind-succeed with little besides ground forces. <BR><BR><BR>Further, a country's force structure will be determined by whether its warsare fought at or close to home, or far away. Expeditionary forces cost muchmore than equivalent territorial forces, since they require sea and airlift,resupply, and, often, foreign basing. Expeditionary forces also tend tobe professional and available for duties short of all-out war. Often, theiruse does not signal long-term commitment. Territorial forces, on the otherhand, are often filled by conscripts, and-in the democracies-usually limitedto home defense or foreign wars fully supported by the population. <BR><BR><BR>But America's strategic needs are unique, and its military exhibits characteristicsof both territorial and expeditionary forces. <BR><BR>U.S. forces are, virtually by definition, expeditionary. They are also professional.But they operate under the severe political limitations characteristic ofdemocracies, not the least of which is the requirement that victory be rapidand relatively bloodless. U.S. force structure is also unique. No nationhas ever amassed the same mix: the normal array of land, sea, and air capabilitiesplus: <UL><LI>a fleet of large-deck aircraft carriers <LI>the world's largest Marine Corps <LI>long-range stealthy bombers <LI>an incomparable C3I (command, control, communications, intelligence)capability. </UL><BR><BR>America's mix of normal and unique, territorial and expeditionary capabilitieshas evolved throughout the 20th century. However, for a variety of reasons-fromchanging threats to technological revolutions and the popular insistenceon short, perhaps impossibly &quot;clean&quot; wars-the present structureis no longer adequate. The mix must change. <BR><BR><BR>Prior to the First World War, things were simple. If it happened on land,the Army tended to it; the Navy pursued its activities at sea. There were,of course, a few overlaps. The Army maintained coastal fortifications andartillery. The Navy might occasionally bombard a shore or land small partiesof Marines. But neither service could do, or take, the other's job. <BR><BR><BR>The airplane blurred this tidy division of labor. So did the mixing andmatching of hitherto unrelated systems. In World War II, carrier aviationroutinely struck ground targets. Land-based planes could take on fleets,provide convoy protection, etc. Simultaneously, a plethora of new capabilitiesdeveloped: armor, paratroops, submarines, large-scale amphibious forces,and strategic bombers, to name a few. Later came helicopters, missile-firingsubmarines, and the precision-guidance revolution. <BR><BR><BR><I>The result is that today, while military technologies and systems haveproliferated, their effects have converged</I>. It is now possible to fightin many different ways. For example, it used to be axiomatic that the bestanti-tank weapon was another (preferably larger) tank. But today, thereare easily over twenty different ways to destroy tanks: other tanks, infantryanti-armor weapons, special artillery munitions, helicopter gunships, attackaircraft, various mines. Conceivably, in a few years, submarines will beable to fire cruise missiles carrying anti-tank submunitions, each guidedto its target by internal sensors or by satellites. When ships underwaterfight tanks well-inland with the aid of systems in space, clearly, the conductof war could use some sustained rethinking. <BR><BR><BR>But there is another aspect to this proliferation and convergence of technologiesand systems. Capabilities that once were unique or clearly complementarycan begin to seem redundant, especially in an era of nebulous threats andconstrained resources. For example, once aircraft carriers and Marines couldgo where land-based aircraft and paratroop couldn't; ships had longer rangesand more staying power than planes, and that was that. They still do, butsuch staying power may not always be a relevant characteristic. Today, AirForce heavy bombers operating from only three bases (in the United States,Guam, and on Diego Garcia) can strike anywhere on earth within eighteenhours of alert. Paratroops out of North Carolina can reach, say, Beirut,faster than Marines steaming through Gibraltar. Thus, there are now at leasttwo ways to perform long-distance &quot;get-in-and-get-out&quot; air andground operations. <BR><BR><BR>This is not to say, of course, that carriers and Marines are obsolete. Farfrom it: Each service still possesses unique core competencies. Nor is itto suggest that redundancy is undesirable; in war, redundancy is vital.But it is to suggest that the current structure and mix of forces can bereconfigured to make maximum use of this new array of capabilities in anaffordable manner-even if this involves some alteration of each service'straditional roles and missions. <BR><BR><BR>From time to time, the Pentagon's internal struggle over roles and missions(technically, roles, missions, and functions) enters public consciousness.The subject can seem arcane. In reality, though, it's as simple as it issignificant. Imagine a theater company. Its mission is to stage &quot;Hamlet.&quot;To do this, it requires an on-stage cast. Each member plays a role. Somemay play, or prepare to play, more than one. Finally, the troupe needs alarge number of supporting functions: lights, tickets, PR, etc. <BR><BR><BR>At the highest military levels, joint and unified commanders (the GeneralSchwarzkopfs) receive missions. They draw their cast of characters and supportingspecialists from the individual services and from the larger defense establishment.Obviously, the needs of the combatant commands should determine what theservices purchase and train for. Indeed, the unified commanders and thePentagon's Joint Resources Oversight Council have achieved significant influenceover the process. But the individual services still write their own budgets,in accordance with roles and requirements carved into law decades ago. Andthe legal and bureaucratic history of this assignment process has been,in large measure, the history of making sure that the services get whatthey want. <BR><BR><BR>But today, the problem is how to make the new array of capabilities relevantto the myriad challenges of the 21st century. And one of the great hindrancesto a new force structure is the old division of labor. <BR><BR><BR>What follows is not so much a detailed list of recommendations for reallocationof roles, missions, and functions as it is a way of thinking about suchreallocations. <BR><BR><BR>To repeat: The problem is not money. This country can defend itself on abit less than three hundred billion dollars a year. But the establishmentmust be restructured. Less-of-the-same no longer avails. <BR><BR><BR>And neither does more-of-the-same. <BR><H4>GUIDING CONCEPTS FOR A NEW DEFENSE</H4><BR><BR>The following points provide a conceptual framework for restructuring defense.Full implementation would probably require changes to Title 10, USC, andto Department of Defense Directive 5100.1, the basic legal and tasking documents.For present purposes, such specific changes need not be addressed. <OL><LI><B>1) We're in an asymmetrical arms race. </B>It is obvious that thepost-Cold War world offers a variety of threats, from heavily armed aggressorstates to terrorist splinter groups. Less obvious is the fact that thereis an arms race going on-an historically unique arms race, in that it isthoroughly asymmetrical. The United States is, for practical purposes, outof the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) business. Development and productionof precision-guidance weapons and systems are now primary. Meanwhile, theplanetary predators develop or purchase nuclear, chemical, and/or biologicalweapons, along with crude but serviceable delivery systems. Thus, the fundamentaltask is to make U.S. power effective against both conventional forces andweapons of mass destruction. <LI><B>2) Culture constrains combat.</B> The American people, for reasonsranging from innate decency to media hype and hysteria, will not acceptprotracted land combat or heavy casualties. This means that, politicallyas well as militarily, it is vital to deter aggression or, failing that,to win rapidly and decisively. This is especially true because future aggressorsmay well try to create conditions in which the United States deters itselffrom responding to aggression. This can be done by initiating conflict inwhich protracted fighting and heavy casualties will be inevitable, or bystriking so quickly and successfully that response becomes pointless orcounterproductive. To avoid these situations, conventional deterrence mustbe overwhelmingly credible. Should deterrence fail, the rapid use of overwhelmingforce will be imperative. <LI><B>3) The U.S. is an aerospace power</B>. This overwhelming force hasa special character. Militarily, the United States is neither a land nora sea power, as these terms have traditionally been understood. The U.S.neither defends its territory against invasion nor covets the lands of others;there are few pieces of real estate anywhere for which this country wouldfight. Nor is there an enemy fleet to seek out and destroy, or sea lanesmenaced by raiders. The United States is, instead, an aerospace power: thefirst and only one in history. Aerospace power, in all its aspects, is thegreat American comparative advantage. Aerospace does not mean exclusively,or even primarily, &quot;Air Force.&quot; It centers on the Air Force, butalso includes naval aviation, Army capabilities, and-of great importance-precision-guidedweaponry and C3I systems. True, aerospace power will not be relevant toevery situation. But, since it is the great U.S. advantage, and since theAmerican people abhor bloody ground combat, as a general rule: Whatevercan be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. <LI><B>4) Aerospace forces come first.</B> It is time to recognize thatthe precision-guidance revolution, coupled with long-range and stealthydelivery platforms (submarines as well as aircraft) has the potential tochange the nature of conventional combat. For millennia, it has seemed axiomaticthat, since people live on land, wars must ultimately be settled on land,i.e., by the taking and holding of territory. However, as Clausewitz pointedout, war is a political act, intended to compel the enemy to do our will.In any given situation, territory may be a vital element of victory; itmay also be irrelevant. Terrorist groups or rogue states may or may notpossess territorial ambitions. Still, it has remained taken-for-grantedthat, in conventional war, the land campaign must be the centerpiece. Allelse supports the ground war. <BR>But in Desert Storm, land combat didn't win the war. Land combat finishedit. In the future, presidents and commanders may wish to repeat the DesertStorm sequence: a devastating air war followed by a relatively easy groundcampaign. Alternatively, they may decide, or be forced to decide, that theland campaign must be central. But they should have the aerospace option.This means that the Air Force's unique capabilities-global range, stealth,advanced precision weaponry-should not be tied, doctrinally or operationally,to the ground campaign. It also means that the air components of the otherservices should be kept strong and employed creatively within their ownrealms. <BR><BR><LI><B>5) Force structure must reflect reality.</B> From this it followsthat U.S. structuring priorities should be:<BR><BR>  <UL>  <LI>Aerospace power in its many aspects   <LI>Rapid response Marine and Army forces possessing substantial combatpower. This includes a Marine Corps of about 175,000 and a selection ofArmy paratroop, air-mobile, and light infantry units at battalion/ brigadelevel, plus other (Ranger, Special Forces, etc.) units.   <LI>Heavier Army units at brigade/division/light corps level capable ofrapid deployment and employment.   </UL></OL><BR><BR>For the Army, this entails both continuation of a post-Vietnam trend anda radical rethinking. In the 1970s, the Defense Department chose, for budgetaryand political reasons, to adopt and seriously implement the &quot;TotalForce Policy,&quot; declaring the reserves equal to the regular forces forplanning and employment purposes. This meant, among other things, that theArmy couldn't engage in protracted war without reserve mobilization. TheArmy wisely accepted this policy, recognizing that reserve mobilizationprovided a crucial test of popular support and national commitment. In the1990s, this policy should be pursued with renewed vigor. <I>Militarily aswell as politically, the capability to wage sustained ground warfare shouldreside with the people</I>. Today, the Army is a force of over a million,when reserve and National Guard units are counted: certainly an adequatenumber, if properly structured and prepared. <BR><BR><BR>Two principles follow. First, if a threat is not worth mobilizing the reservesto counter, or if the reserves can't be mobilized for political reasons,it's probably not wise to get into a major war. And, second, If large unitscan't be ready to fight in a very few weeks, they probably belong in thereserves. <BR><BR><BR>As a practical matter, this means that the Army must reconsider the natureof its larger active-force units. The old division and corps structure,with its many layers of command and staff, and its ponderous logistical&quot;tail&quot; may well be obsolete; future forces might better be a flexiblemix of brigades tailored into light corps, with reduced staffs and supportunits. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, not every active unit, regardless of size, can be ready all thetime. But large unready active units are a waste of money. The Army is themost labor-intensive of the services, and there are significant cost savingsin cutting personnel. Since World War II, the Army has been structured forexpansion as well as for immediate employment. World War II demonstratedthat, while a lieutenant or a private might be turned out in a few months,competent senior officers and non-commissioned officers took many yearsto develop. In effect, the Army stockpiled these people on active duty againstsome future mobilization requirement, finding them employment in bloatedstaffs, unnecessary organizations, and endless schools. But the days ofIndustrial Age warfare-of protracted mass mobilization-are gone. The activeArmy needs to downsize even more, modernize, and capitalize. And, in fact,the Army is moving toward these goals in a variety of experimental programs,although there is a certain reluctance to admit it too openly. This trendshould continue. <OL><LI><B>6) Structure determines spending priorities.</B> Defense spendingshould accord with these priorities. And, for the next few years, one ofthe top priorities should be acquisition of ample precision-guided munitionsand supporting systems, plus stockpiling of critical parts in the eventof a &quot;surge&quot; production requirement. The United States is indeedan aerospace power, but that doesn't mean that, just because something haswings, the Pentagon has to buy it. There must be rational trade-offs betweenplatforms and munitions. </OL><BR>The best example here is the B-2 stealth bomber. At over $800 million percopy for the 20 already on order, and at $20,000 per hour to operate, theplane is simply too expensive. Nor are next-generation fighter and attackaircraft an urgent priority; upgraded current models will serve for thenext few years. True, sometime after 2000, new aircraft will be required,and development should proceed aggressively. Air superiority is not a God-givenAmerican right; it must be maintained. But, for the next few years, themunitions will be more important than the platforms that launch them. Whenthe price of a B-2 bomber is also the cost of more than 800 Tomahawk cruisemissiles, for the Navy and the Air Force, the correct choice is obvious.<BR><BR><BR>Other high priorities include aggressive development of next generationsystems and ample funding for the Army's experimental programs. R&amp;Dis future readiness; it should not be sacrificed to maintain the presentforce at the present size. A final priority: airlift and fast sealift. Themost powerful military on earth is useless if it can't get to the war, orsustain itself once there. <BR><OL><LI><B>7) Presence and peacekeeping options expand</B>. In recent years,two activities short-of-war have consumed enormous resources. One is theso-called &quot;presence mission,&quot; i.e., keeping combat-ready forcesin and around various global hot spots. The most effective presence is,obviously, permanently overseas-based, combat-capable forces. But, for betteror worse, U.S. forces are coming home. The next-best presence forces aredeployed aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine amphibious ready groups;these units are mobile, operate in international waters, and have significantcombat power and sustainability. They are also vital during the transitionfrom crisis to war, and as the &quot;enabling&quot; force that permits theArmy and Air Force to get ashore. But they are also expensive, and presencemay now be defined as more than the up-close-and-personal. </OL><BR><BR>To the extent that presence is a condition in the mind of would-be aggressors-theknowledge that the stealth fighters and bombers and the Tomahawk-firingsubmarines and the paratroops are also out there-these capabilities mayaugment, and sometimes replace, more traditional forces. It's not a perfecttrade-off, but one that is both available and reasonable. The trade-offcan also lead to the conclusion that the constant deployment of carrierbattle groups may no longer be necessary in certain areas. The Navy hasrecognized this for years. Its efforts and experiments in &quot;adaptiveforce packaging&quot;-sending out presence forces without the large-deckcarriers-should continue. Marine amphibious carriers and surface ships armedwith precision-guided weaponry may not be as powerful or versatile as thebig-deck battle groups, but the option is valuable. <BR><BR><BR>The other major short-of-war activity consists of peace-keeping and humanitarianoperations. These are expensive, exhausting, and demoralizing. They alsowreak havoc with operating schedules and tempos, especially when a crisiserupts and the Joint Chiefs call on whatever units might be available. Aspecial Army peacekeeping division might not be a bad idea; if established,it should not count against Army end strength, or be funded out of Armyappropriations. <BR><OL><LI><B>8) Home defense belongs in the structure.</B> Finally, defense, likecharity, begins at home. Although the United States is not vulnerable toinvasion, it is entirely open to attack by weapons of mass destruction.Too often, the debate over continental defense comes down to a spuriouseither/or. &quot;Why build defenses when bombs can be smuggled in?&quot;and equivalent arguments. But it's not either/or. And, in fact, many ofthe battlefield and theater weapons now coming into the hands of potentialpredators could be used against the continental United States. Launchinga crude cruise or ballistic missile from a yacht or merchant ship on thehigh seas may well be easier than assembling and emplacing so-called &quot;suitcasebombs.&quot; These weapons can now be targeted with the aid of commerciallyavailable satellite navigation systems. </OL><BR><BR>And the United States is not alone in facing this problem. Many other nationshave a vital interest in defense against limited attacks. Russia, especially.It is therefore imperative that the United States begin a serious home defenseprogram, based upon maximum use of available and developing battlefieldand theater defenses, and in concert with other nations, whenever possible.What will it cost? Less, no doubt, than someday pondering the crater whereManhattan once stood, or the million bloated corpses that used to be thegood people of Puget Sound. <BR><H3>Conclusion </H3><BR><BR>The preceding has dealt with the conceptual framework for defense restructuringin a transitional era. Today, there is no defining threat. There is, however,a defining opportunity, created by changing technologies and world politics.These require a new force structure. But unnecessary defense spending is,domestically as well as internationally, a clear and present danger. Evenduring the coldest days of the Cold War, President Eisenhower could warnthat it was possible to spend too much on defense, and to spend it wrongly.His admonition is still apt. <BR><BR><BR><HR><H4>Dr. Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and directorof the Institute's Aerospace 2010 Project.

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.
<P>
<center><blockquote>ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE UNIVERSAL, 
UNLIMITED, TAX-DEDUCTIBLE IRAS, AS EMBODIED IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT 
ACCOUNTS, MUST BE IMMEDIATE.</center></blockquote>

<H1><CENTER>Former head of EPA speaks out on the politics of the environment</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>
What have been the effects of the current Congress on the state of the environment? Specifically, what
changes has the new Congress considered in the statutory base of the Environmental Protection Agency? What
effects do the differences in Eastern vs. Western approaches to environmental legislation have on this
important issue?

These and other issues are addressed by William D. Ruckelshaus, former head of the EPA at an April 23,
1996 Discovery Institute luncheon. Currently Chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, Ruckelshaus recently
testified before the U.S. Congress on retooling the EPA statutory base to promote industry flexibility and
creativity while continuing to protect the environment. The luncheon is at the Four Seasons Olympic Metropole Room from Noon to 1:30 p.m. 

Cost for Discovery members is $40; non-members $45. Tables of ten are available for $400. Preregistration
is required, and prepayment is due by April 19, 1996. Please use the Event Order Form on the back page, or
call Julie Lanz at Discovery at 287-3144 for further information.

<h2><center><I><B>Inertia</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

Discovery 's Cascadia Project is host to a <A HREF="twonation.html">regional tourism conference</A> to be held June 6-7, 1996 at the Port of
Seattle's new Bell Harbor Conference Center.

The Cascadia Tourism Conference is designed to educate tourism leaders on regional cross-border initiatives
for commerce, conservation, and marketing. The conference will also explore new opportunities that
complement established partnerships. In addition, conference organizers hope to achieve greater support for
efforts to relieve port of entry congestion, enhance immigration clearances, and improve transportation
infrastructure and connections in the region. 

A Regional Tourism Fair, featuring displays from visitor associations, attractions, and tour operators, will be
held concurrently with the conference. Tourism industry practitioners are encouraged to contact Bruce Agnew or Stephanie Bowman at 287-3404
for information on workshops and general sessions as well as costs and registration for the two-day
conference.

The Cascadia Project's conference,&quot;The Cascadia Rail Stakeholders Session: Keeping Oregon Competitive,&quot;
has been rescheduled to April 12, 1996. To be held in Salem, the conference will feature an address by
Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber....The Cascadia Project is undertaking a year-long feasibility study on
Seattle's bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics for the Washington State Department of Community, Trade, and
Economic Development.....Over the past few months, the Cascadia Project has been assisted in its work by
Discovery Interns Marshall Sana and Jill Curtis.

</H1>
<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Times">by Stephen C. Meyer, Ph.D.</FONT> <HR></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Can scientists change their minds about controversial
ideas? Can they reject theories if evidence requires? That may depend upon
what theories are at stake. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider a disturbing case in California involving a
distinguished biology professor, Dean Kenyon. A year ago, Kenyon was removed
from his biology classroom at San Francisco State University after a few
students complained to administrators about ideas they heard in lecture.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The problem? Kenyon's approach to teaching evolutionary
theory. Professor Kenyon it seems has grown increasingly skeptical about
the textbook theory of how life first originated on earth&oacute;a theory,
as it turns out, he had earlier done much to advance. SFSU's administrators
have insisted that Kenyon not discuss the reasons for his new views with
introductory biology students. Ironically, they justified their actions
in the name of &quot;science.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Controversy in San Francisco</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The controversy emerged in the fall of 1992 after Kenyon
was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot; by John Hafernik, the chairman
of the biology department. Kenyon, who included three lectures on biological
origins (out of 27 total) in his introductory course, presented both standard
evolutionary interpretations of biological evidence and difficulties with
those interpretations. He also discussed philosophical controversies raised
by the issue and his own view that living systems display evidence of &quot;intelligent
design&quot;&oacute;a view not incompatible with some evolutionary thinking.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Hafernik accused Kenyon of teaching biblical creationism
and ordered him to stop. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote the Dean,
James Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; Was he not permitted to mention &quot;the important philosophical
issues at stake in discussions of origins?&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kelley insisted that Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation on
a young earth.&quot; Kenyon replied again. (I paraphrase): I do teach the
dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and that
some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching
introductory biology and reassigned to labs. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Recently, following pressure on the administration from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee, its Academic Senate and the American
Association of University Professors, Kenyon was reinstated. His administrators,
however, have continued to threaten to &quot;monitor&quot; his course and
content. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Academic Freedom: Disturbing Implications</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For several reasons, Kenyon's case raises troubling questions
about whether ordinary standards of academic freedom apply to science and
whether scientists must now pass ideological muster to maintain standing
in the church scientific. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">First, Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary
theory and the scientific study of the origin of life. After receiving a
Ph.D. in biophysics at Stanford, he later completed post-doctoral work at
Oxford, NASA and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1969, he co-authored
a seminal theoretical work titled<B> </B><I>Biochemical Predestination</I>.
The book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific
publications. As evidence rolled in during the late 1970s, however, he began
to question his own earlier ideas. When run under realistic conditions,
so-called &quot;simulation&quot; experiments repeatedly produced irrelevant
sludge or low yields of desired amino acids. Further, molecular biology
had revealed the presence of encoded messages along the spine of large biomolecules
such as DNA. Both experiments and developments in a field known as information
theory suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves into such
complex information-bearing molecules&oacute;without, that is, &quot;guidance&quot;
from human experimenters.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">To Kenyon and others, these results raised important
questions about how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was.
If undirected chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information
found in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence
have played a role? By the 1980s, Kenyon was sympathetic to the idea.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">That a man of Kenyon's stature should have to lobby for
the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of origins,
is absurdly comic. Dr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in the world
about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research scientists.
Yet he has been prevented from reporting the negative results of research
and from giving students his candid assessment of it.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Second, as Kenyon has repeatedly explained, his view
hardly qualifies as biblicism, let alone religious advocacy. When Kenyon
discussed &quot;intelligent design,&quot; he did so as an inference from
biological data, not a deduction from religious authority. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet even if Kenyon had been motivated by a prior belief
that &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1), it
is not clear that academic freedom means college students must be shielded
from such notions. Secular intellectuals now openly discuss the ideologies
and philosophies that motivate their scholarship and teaching, from Feminism
and Freudianism to Deconstruction and Marxism. Why must theistic professors
remain silent? </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Palatino">Ideological Neutrality?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The problem is Kenyon's
opponents assume science has a unique rational standing and ideological
neutrality. Subjective considerations from philosophy and religion do not
influence scientific theories; and scientific theories, in turn, can have
no philosophical or religious implications. Intelligent design, and its
potential implications, violates this alleged neutrality. Thus, despite
Kenyon's credentials and concern with data, Hafernik and Kelley decreed
that he had moved beyond science into &quot;religion.&quot; Therefore, he
needed to be muzzled&oacute;academic freedom notwithstanding.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This line of reasoning seems initially quite plausible,
since many areas of science have little ideological or philosophical import.
Upon closer inspection, however, it reveals a disturbing double standard
within an area of science notorious for its philosophical overtones. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">On any reasonable assessment of the origins controversy,
Kenyon's design theory and the dominant materialistic view are not two different
types of thinking, one religious and the other scientific. They are two
competing answers to the same question: 'What caused life to arise on earth?'
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This competition is tacitly
conceded in biology texts that routinely recapitulate Darwinian-style arguments
<I>against</I> intelligent design. Yet if arguments <I>against</I> intelligent
design are philosophically neutral and strictly scientific, why are Kenyon's
arguments <I>for</I> design inherently unscientific and religiously charged?
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In fact, neither approach to origins can claim philosophical
neutrality. Orthodox evolutionary theories, whether biological or chemical,
make the decidedly metaphysical claim that brute matter organized itself
into more and more complex living structures without assistance from purposeful
intelligence. Neo-Darwinism teaches, as the late Harvard biologist G.G.
Simpson put it, even &quot;man is the result of a <I>purposeless</I> and
natural process that did not have him in mind. He was not planned.&quot;
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolution conceived as a completely purposeless process&oacute;a
&quot;blind watchmaker&quot; as biologist Richard Dawkins calls it&oacute;eliminates
any role for creative intelligence in the origin of living things. It, therefore,
directly contradicts not only &quot;special creationism&quot;, but all theories
inconsistent with an aggressive philosophical materialism. This includes
&quot;God-guided evolution&quot; and even more generic notions such as &quot;intelligent
design.&quot; Whatever the merits of &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; evolution,
one can hardly assert its ideological neutrality. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Methodological Naturalism </FONT></I></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet Kenyon's opponents insist
that his approach to origins, unlike their own, does not qualify as science.
They argue that scientific theories must limit themselves to strictly materialistic
explanations. Science is by definition limited to observable realities.
Its explanations must, therefore, invoke only natural processes or events.
Scientists must obey what philosophers call the principle of &quot;methodological
naturalism.&quot; Explanations involving a designer are necessarily excluded.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This judgment may, again, seem reasonable for it comports
with popular conceptions of what most scientists, especially experimental
scientists, do. But &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; can not be justified
as a normative principle for all types of science&oacute;without doing violence
to science as a truth-seeking enterprise.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Prohibitions against inferring intelligent design are
particularly problematic in historical sciences such as archeology, forensics,
paleobiology, and origin-of-life studies. In historical sciences, researchers
want to answer different kinds of questions than in other sciences. For
example, scientists investigating the origin of life are motivated by the
question 'what happened to cause life to arise on earth?' This question
specifically asks about the cause of life's origin. Since, conceivably,
a designer could have played a role it is difficult to see why postulations
of intelligent agency must necessarily be excluded&oacute;especially if
biological evidence supports the idea. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It is true that scientists in many other scientific fields
do not generally make design inferences. They refrain, however, not out
of deference to rules dictating what they may theorize, but instead because
they are asking different types of questions: ones unconcerned with causal
origins. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the question 'how does atmospheric pressure
affect crystal growth?' The answer 'crystals were designed by a creative
intelligence' (or, for that matter, 'crystals evolved via natural processes')
entirely misses the point. The question demands an answer expressed as a
relationship between two physical entities: gases and crystals. A scientific
law expressing such a relationship can be described as wholly naturalistic.
Yet naturalism of this sort derives entirely from the particular focus of
scientific interest and the need to answer the question asked. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Answers to historical questions are, of course, also
subject to contextual constraints, but none that justify prohibitions against
considering design. Those who insist otherwise simply make an unwarranted
extrapolation. They mistakenly treat an accurate description of scientific
theorizing in one area as if it were a normative principle for all of science.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">True Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Defenders of methodological naturalism insist, however,
that prohibitions against design inferences are necessary to preserve the
rigor of scientific reasoning. For example, some of Kenyon's critics at
SFSU argue that his theory of intelligent design fails to qualify as scientific
because it refers to an unseen entity. The existence of an unobservable
designer, they say, can not be tested. Therefore, it can't be part of a
scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet many scientific theories postulate unobservable events
and entities. Physicists postulate forces, fields and quarks; biochemists
infer sub-microscopic structures; psychologists discuss their patients'
mental states. If unobservability precluded testability and scientific status,
many scientific theories would not qualify as science. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolutionary biologists themselves traffic in &quot;unobservables.&quot;
They invoke processes whose creative effects are often too slow to see and
infer the existence of extinct organisms for which no fossils remain. Like
Kenyon's designer, unobservable ancient forms are <I>inferred</I> because
their existence would explain evidence in the present. Darwinian theory
and design theory alike rely upon indirect inference and testing, not just
direct observation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">By inferring an unobservable entity, Kenyon violated
no canon of scientific method. In seeking the best explanation for evidence,
Kenyon employed the same method of reasoning as before he changed his views.
His conclusions, not his methods, changed.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Truth or Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The Kenyon case illustrates
another reason for challenging &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; in
the historical sciences: naturalism limits the ability of scientists to
seek the truth. Philosophers of science now recognize that theory evaluation
is often inherently comparative. Especially in historical sciences where
theories can not be tested by predicting outcomes or repeating experiments,
scientists must test theories indirectly. They do this by comparing the
explanatory power of competing theories to seek the best explanation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If this process of testing is subverted by excluding
theoretical options arbitrarily the rationality of science is compromised.
Theories that succeed in gerrymandered competitions can claim to be neither
'the best explanation' nor 'most probably true'. Instead, they can only
be considered 'most probable' or 'best' among artificially limited options.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">As Kenyon's case illustrates, such a situation now exists
in historical biology. Currently, evolutionary theories are protected from
challenge by arbitrary rules excluding non-materialistic theories. Yet the
question that must be asked about origins is not: 'which materialistic theory
can best explain the origin of life?' but 'what actually happened to cause
life to arise on earth?' Insisting upon strictly materialistic explanations&oacute;whatever
the evidence&oacute;may force scientists to reject a true theory for the
sake of an arbitrary convention. Science so encumbered is unworthy of the
name.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Evidence for Design</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Considerable evidence now contradicts the dominant evolutionary
approach. The universally-recognized failure of chemical evolution to explain
life's initial origin, is now matched by neo-Darwinism's failure to account
for subsequent biological form. Fossil studies now reveal a &quot;biological
big bang&quot; in which one hundred disconnected phyla (major groups of
organisms) emerged suddenly without clear precursors 530 million years ago.
Fossil finds repeatedly confirm a pattern of sudden appearance and prolonged
stability (not gradual change) in living forms. Biochemical evidence reinforces
the impression of organisms as systems whose parts&oacute;as with machines&oacute;can
not be altered gradually or dramatically without destroying the functioning
whole. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For naturalistic theories a growing awareness of biological
complexity has posed enormous, and perhaps insuperable, challenges. Organisms
display any number of distinctive features of intelligently engineered high-tech
systems: information storage and transfer capability, regulatory and feed-back
mechanisms, hierarchical logic and organization, and precisely sequenced
strings of code.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Confronted with evidence suggesting a new approach, the
full-time Darwinist lobby falls back on subjective complaints about the
&quot;imperfect&quot; design of human eyes and Panda's thumbs. They also
invoke their own self-serving rule&oacute;theories must be materialistic&oacute;to
disqualify challengers as &quot;crackpots.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet personal attacks and arbitrary rules can not suppress
alternative theories forever. With recent developments in probability and
complexity theory, the detection of intelligent design has already entered
science proper. NASA's $100 million search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) has been based upon the ability to detect the statistical and mathematical
signature of intelligently encoded messages. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Less exotic (and more successful) design detection occurs
routinely in both science and industry. Archeology and insurance fraud investigation,
forensic science and cryptography would all be impossible if prohibitions
against design inferences were applied universally. Imagine an archaeologist
forced to treat the Rosetta Stone as a natural erosional effect or a homicide
detective required to conclude that all victims died of natural causes.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Professor Kenyon believes similar absurdities now rule
origins biology. To Kenyon and others, the presence of biochemical messages
and a corresponding molecular grammar in the cell strongly suggests a prior
intelligent design. He may be wrong or right. His argument is based, however,
neither on ignorance nor religious authority, but on a biological expertise
informed by the modern informational sciences. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It has no doubt served the purposes of philosophical
materialists to portray Kenyon as a religious fundamentalist unwilling revise
dogma in the face of new evidence. In fact, it is their fundamentalism,
not his, that is on trial.<BR>

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder's </A>conservative cult classic, <I>Visible
Man</I>, is gaining attention in the midst of intense debates over welfare
reform and racism. Republication of <I>Visible Man</I>  is nothing if not
timely. <BR>
<BR>
In <I>Visible Man</I>, Gilder tells the the true story of Sam, a black youth
of the Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. For Gilder,
Sam is not a victim of racism, but the all-too conspicuous victim of government
policy. As the message of<I>Visible Man</I>  spreads the popularity of the
book seems to pick up momentum. <BR>
<BR>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich's monthly newsletter, &quot;Renewing
American Civilization,&quot; will feature <I>Visible Man </I>as the cover
article in November, and the book has been chosen as a monthly selection
for the newsletter's reader's circle. Gingrich, also has expressed interest
in including <I>Visible Man</I>  in the curriculum for his &quot;Renewing
American Civilization&quot; college course in 1996. Currently Reader's Digest
is considering publication of <I>Visible Man</I>  in a condensed form. In
August, Michael Medved had Gilder as a special guest on the Rush Limbaugh
radio program, which Medved guest-hosted while Limbaugh was on vacation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conventional wisdom holds that the truth is usually in the middle.
But when the middle is in the space between two erroneous extremes, the
truth is probably somewhere else entirely. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Case in point: the growing debate over the income tax and possible alternatives.
The macroeconomic statist approach - the legacy of Marx, Keynes, and assorted
other socialists and do-gooders - is now discredited. Few seriously hold
that the state has unlimited potential to do good, and should be funded
accordingly. But the microeconomic statist approach, in its unthinking acceptance
of the notion that alternative taxes should bring in at least as much revenue
as the income tax, is also flawed. For the fundamental question is not how
to raise money for the state, but what is the right size government to enable
maximum economic welfare. We now know that we should bring total government
spending down from one-third to one-quarter of GDP in order to maximize
the social welfare, opportunity and freedom of our citizens. This is how
we found out. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For thirty years after World War II, it was conventional wisdom that increasing
the size of government would lead to higher levels of prosperity. However,
by the 1970s, it was evident that the macroeconomic statist model wasn't
working. In much of western Europe and the U.S., capital formation and growth
rates fell and unemployment increased. By the 1980s, it was also evident
that the economies of some Southeast Asian nations with small governmental
sectors (such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) were growing at much
higher rates than had previously been thought possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Economists thus began looking at the relationship between government size
and economic growth. In 1986, economists of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
(myself included) analyzed this relationship for 22 countries. We found
that slowdowns in growth rates were significantly correlated with growth
in the government share of GDP. Our best estimate was that government maximized
economic growth when it was between 15% and 25% of GNP. Since then, many
more studies have confirmed our work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It should not be surprising that there is an optimal size for government.
Too little government can reduce growth. Government needs to spend enough
to assure a fair and predictable system of justice, national defense, and
basic public health and education, and to enforce contracts. However, all
government spending entails extracting wealth from the private sector, either
by taxing or borrowing. The larger government becomes, the more severe these
extraction costs become. Eventually, they crowd out private sector investment,
reducing productivity, capital formation, and growth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
High tax rates reduce incentives to work, save, and invest, and involve
ever-increasing collection and compliance costs. Also public spending is
less efficient than private because it often misallocates resources and
lowers incentives for cost-controls. Government spending programs also tend
to develop their own constituencies, and generate political pressures to
increase spending that have nothing to do with the general welfare. Benefits
concentrate in certain groups, while costs diffuse throughout the population.
When these benefits take the form of income redistribution rather than,
say, defense or capital spending, negative effects are especially severe.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, for the United States, the right size government (at all levels) is
no more than 25 percent of GDP, and perhaps considerably less. About two-thirds
of this necessary reduction, from the current 33 percent to 25 percent of
GDP, should come from relative reductions in federal spending. This will
require elimination of most counter-productive spending programs, such as
agriculture and energy subsidies, and changing Social Security and Medicare
into genuine annuity and insurance programs. And, a new tax system that
is less intrusive and less biased against work, saving, and investment needs
to be designed and implemented for the correctly sized government. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The country may be edging toward serious consideration of such a simple
but profound change. The first evidence is that people are finally willing
to start thinking about it in various academic and think tank seminars.
But the real test is likely to be the election of 1996 and whether a correctly
sized government - and what it entails - becomes part of a national political
debate. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Alfred North Whitehead once said that &quot;when
we consider what religion is for mankind and what science is, it is no exaggeration
to say that the future course of history depends upon the decision of this
generation as to the relations between them.&quot; Whitehead spoke early
in this century at a time when most elite intellectuals believed that science
contradicted classical theism with its traditional belief in a divine creation,
the uniqueness of man and the immortality of the human soul. For many intellectuals
a scientifically-informed world view was a materialistic world view in which
the mere mention of entities such as God, free will, mind, soul or purpose
seemed inherently disreputable. Materialism denied evidence of any intelligent
design in nature and any ultimate purpose to human existence. As Whitehead's
contemporary Bertrand Russell put it, &quot;man is the product of causes
which had no prevision of the end they were achieving&quot; and which predestine
him &quot;to extinction in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">It is not hard to see why many intellectuals held
this opinion. Despite the now-well documented influence of Christian thinking
on the rise of modern science from the time of Ockham to Newton, much of
science during the 19th century did take a decidedly materialistic turn.
Scientific origins theories in particular seemed to support the materialistic
vision of an autonomous and self-creating natural world. For example, at
the beginning of the 19th century the French mathematician Laplace offered
an ingenious theory known as the nebular hypothesis to account for the origin
of the solar system as the outcome of purely natural gravitational forces.
In geology, Charles Lyell explained the origin of the earth's most dramatic
topographical features&oacute;mountain ranges and canyons&oacute;as the
result of slow, gradual and completely naturalistic processes of change.
Most significantly, Darwin's evolutionary theory sought to show that the
blind process of natural selection acting on random variations could, and
did, account for the origin of new forms of life without any divine intervention
or guidance. According to Darwin, living organisms only <I>appeared</I>
to be designed by an intelligent creator; nature itself was the real creator.
Even in cosmology, a belief in the infinity of space and time obviated any
need to consider the question of the ultimate origin of matter. Thus, for
scientific materialists at the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
history of the universe and life could be told as a seamless&#130; or nearly
seamless, unfolding of the potentiality of matter and energy. No longer
could it be held that a pre-existent mind shaped matter. Rather, modern
science showed that matter shaped and created the capacities of mind (and
not the reverse). God did not create &quot;the heavens and the earth.&quot;
The heavens and the earth (i.e., matter) created (via evolution) the minds
that created the concept of God. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">By the turn of the twentieth century, this once
shockingly materialistic approach to science had become the norm. Most twentieth
century scientists have assumed no limits to the explanatory power of materialistic
forces. Materialistic modes of thought and assumptions have spread from
physics and biology to psychology, sociology, criminology, economics, educational
theory, and even theology. Thus, Whitehead would in the end attempt to reconcile
science and religion by asserting that even God himself evolves. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet now at the end of the twentieth century after
many wars and genocidal policies pursued in the name of materialistic &quot;science-based&quot;
ideologies, the scientific picture of the world is rapidly changing. From
the microcosm of the cell and the quantum world, to the macrocosm of an
expanding and finely-tuned universe, the materialistic vision of nature
now seems incomplete. Even in biology where Darwin's theory, perhaps more
than any other, inspired the possibility of a fully materialistic world
view, materialism now seems to be failing as scientists have uncovered an
awe-inspiring complexity in even the simplest of living cells. Indeed, nowhere
is the inadequacy of materialistic science more evident than in the contemporary
discussion of how life in its very &quot;simplest&quot; form might have
first originated. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Problem of Life's Origin</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">After Darwin published the <I>Origin of Species</I> in
1859, many scientists began to think about a problem that Darwin had not
addressed, namely, how life had arisen in the first place. While Darwin's
theory purported to explain how life could have grown gradually more complex
starting from &quot;one or a few simple forms,&quot; it did not explain,
nor did it attempt to explain, where life had first originated. Indeed,
by the 1870s with Darwin's theory of the origin of species, Laplace's nebular
hypothesis, and Lyellian geology enjoying widespread support, the origin
of life remained as the only salient milestone in cosmic history lacking
some materialistic explanation. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet, scientists in the 1870s and 1880s assumed
that devising an explanation for the origin of life would be fairly easy.
For one thing, they assumed that life was essentially a rather simple substance
called protoplasm that could be easily constructed by combining and recombining
simple chemicals such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. Thus, the
German evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel would refer to the cell as a
simple &quot;homogeneous globule of plasm.&quot; To Haeckel a living cell
seemed no more complex than a blob of jello. His theory of how life first
came into existence reflected this simplistic view. His method likened cell
&quot;autogony,&quot; as he called it, to the process of inorganic crystallization.
Haeckel's English counterpart, T.H. Huxley, proposed a simple two-step method
of chemical recombination to explain the origin of the first cell. Just
as salt could be produced spontaneously by adding sodium to chloride, so,
thought Haeckel and Huxley, could a living cell be produced by adding several
chemical constituents together and then allowing spontaneous chemical reactions
to produce the simple protoplasmic substance that they assumed to be the
essence of life. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Orthodox Chemical Evolutionary Theory: The
Oparin Scenario</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">During the 1920s and 1930s a more sophisticated version
of this so-called &quot;chemical evolutionary theory&quot; was proposed
by a Russian biochemist named Alexander I. Oparin. Oparin had a much more
accurate understanding of the complexity of cellular metabolism, but neither
he, nor any one else in the 1930s, fully appreciated the complexity of the
molecules such as protein and DNA that make life possible. Oparin, like
his nineteenth century predecessors, suggested that life could have first
evolved as the result of a series of chemical reactions. Unlike his predecessors,
however, he envisioned that this process of chemical evolution would involve
many more chemical transformations and reactions and many hundreds of millions
(or even billions) of years. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's theory envisioned a series of chemical
reactions (See Figure 1) that he thought would enable a complex cell to
assemble itself gradually and naturalistically from simple chemical precursors.
Oparin believed that simple gases such as ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4),
water (H20), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) would have rained down
to the early oceans and combined with metallic compounds extruded from the
core of the earth. With the aid of ultraviolet radiation from the sun, the
ensuing reactions would have produced energy-rich hydrocarbon compounds.
These in turn would have combined and recombined with various other compounds
to make amino acids, sugars, phosphates and other &quot;building blocks&quot;
of the complex molecules (such as proteins) necessary to living cells. These
constituents would eventually arrange themselves into simple cell-like enclosures
that Oparin called coacervates. Oparin then proposed a kind of Darwinian
competition for survival among his coacervates. Those that developed increasingly
complex molecules and metabolic processes would have survived and grown
more complicated. Those that did not would have dissolved. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Thus, cells would have become gradually more and
more complex as they competed for survival over billions of years. Like
Darwin, Oparin employed time, chance and natural selection to account for
the origin of complexity from initial simplicity. Moreover, nowhere in his
scenario did &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;intelligent design&quot; or &quot;a
Creator&quot; play any explanatory role. Indeed, for Oparin&oacute;a committed
Marxist&oacute;such notions were explicitly precluded from scientific consideration.
Matter interacting chemically with other matter, if given enough time and
the right conditions, could produce life. Complex cells could be built from
simple chemical precursors without any guiding personal or intelligent agency.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Miller-Urey Experiment <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The first experimental support for Oparin's
hypothesis came in December of 1952. While doing graduate work under Harold
Urey at the University of Chicago, Stanley Miller conducted the first experimental
test of the Oparin chemical evolutionary model. Miller circulated a gaseous
mixture of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water vapor (H20) and hydrogen
(H2) through a glass vessel containing an electrical discharge chamber.
Miller sent a high voltage charge of electricity into the chamber via tungsten
filaments in an attempt to simulate the effects of ultraviolet light on
prebiotic atmospheric gases. After two days, Miller found a small (2 percent)
yield of amino acids in the U-shaped water trap he used to collect reaction
products at the bottom of the vessel. While Miller's initial experiment
yielded only three of the twenty amino acids that occur naturally in proteins,
subsequent experiments performed under similar conditions have produced
all but one of the others. Other simulation experiments have produced fatty
acids and the nucleotide bases found in DNA and RNA, but not the sugar molecules
deoxyribose and ribose necessary to build DNA and RNA molecules. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Miller's success in producing biologically relevant
&quot;building blocks&quot; under ostensibly prebiotic conditions was heralded
as a great breakthrough. His experiment seemed to provide experimental support
for Oparin's chemical evolutionary theory by showing that an important step
in Oparin's scenario&oacute;the production of biological building blocks
from simpler atmospheric gases&oacute;was possible on the early earth. Miller's
work inspired many similar simulation experiments and an unprecedented optimism
about the possibility of developing an adequate naturalistic explanation
for the origin of life. Miller's experimental results also received widespread
press coverage in popular publications such as <I>Time</I> magazine and
gave Oparin's model the status of textbook orthodoxy almost overnight. As
one writer put it:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;James Watson and Francis Crick unraveled
the chemical basis of life . . . Stanley Miller discovered how matter and
energy could create the building blocks of life without a preexisting cell.
Unleashed from paralysis and spurred by the Space Age, research on the origin
of life was launched by these . . .momentous achievements into an era of
discovery and achievement.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, thanks largely to Miller's experimental
work, chemical evolution is now routinely presented in both high school
and college biology textbooks as the accepted scientific explanation for
the origin of life. Yet as we shall see, chemical evolutionary theory is
now known to be riddled with difficulties; and Miller's work is understood
by the origin-of-life research community itself to have little, if any,
relevance to explaining how amino acids&oacute;let alone proteins or livings
cells&oacute;actually could have arisen on the early earth.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Problems with the Oparin/Miller Hypothesis</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Despite its status as textbook orthodoxy, the Oparin
chemical evolutionary theory has in recent years encountered severe, even
fatal, criticisms on many fronts. First, geochemists have failed to find
evidence of the nitrogen-rich &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; required by Oparin's
model. Second, the remains of single-celled organisms in the very oldest
rocks testify that, however life emerged, it did so relatively quickly&oacute;i.e.
fossil evidence suggests that chemical evolution had little time to work
before life emerged on the early earth. Third, new geological and geochemical
evidence suggests that prebiotic atmospheric conditions were hostile, not
friendly, to the production of amino acids and other essential building
blocks of life. Fourth, the revolution in the field of molecular biology
has revealed so great a complexity and specificity of design in even the
&quot;simplest&quot; cells and cellular components as to defy materialistic
explanation. Even scientists known for a staunch commitment to materialistic
philosophy now concede that materialistic science in no way suffices to
explain the origin of life. As Francis Crick has written: &quot;An honest
man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state
that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost
a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been
satisfied to get it going.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To understand the crisis in chemical evolutionary
theory, it will be necessary to explain in more detail the latter two difficulties,
namely, the problem of hostile pre-biotic conditions and the problem posed
by the complexity of the cell and its components.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">When Stanley Miller conducted his experiment simulating
the production of amino acids on the early earth, he presupposed that the
earth's atmosphere was composed of a mixture of what chemists call reducing
gases such as methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen (H2). He also assumed
that the earth's atmosphere contained virtually no free oxygen. Miller derived
his assumptions about these conditions from Oparin's 1936 book. In the years
following Miller's experiment, however, new geochemical evidence made it
clear that the assumptions that Oparin and Miller had made about the early
atmosphere could not be justified. Instead, evidence strongly suggested
that neutral gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor&oacute;not
methane, ammonia and hydrogen&oacute;predominated in the early atmosphere.
Moreover, a number of geochemical studies showed that significant amounts
of free oxygen were also present even before the advent of plant life, probably
as the result of volcanic outgassing and the photodissociation of water
vapor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This new information about the probable composition
of the early atmosphere has forced a serious re-evaluation of the significance
and relevance of Miller-type simulation experiments. As had been well know
even before Miller's experiment, amino acids will form readily in an appropriate
mixture of reducing gases. In a chemically neutral atmosphere, however,
reactions among atmospheric gases will not take place readily and those
reactions that do take place will produce extremely low yields of biological
building blocks. Further, even a small amount of atmospheric oxygen will
quench the production of biologically significant building blocks and cause
any biomolecules otherwise present to degrade rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">An analogy may help to illustrate. Making amino
acids in a reducing atmosphere is like getting vinegar and baking soda to
react. Because the reaction releases stored chemical energy as heat (i.e.
it is &quot;exothermic&quot;), it occurs easily. Trying to make biological
building blocks in a neutral atmosphere, however, is more like trying to
get oil and water (or any two inert chemicals) to react. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Stanley Miller's experiment, and others like his,
are only relevant to the origin of life if the reducing conditions he assumed
actually existed on the early earth. Since independent geochemical evidence
now strongly suggests that chemically hostile conditions prevailed, Miller's
experiment cannot be said to &quot;simulate&quot; anything. Miller's work
was heralded as a positive test of Oparin's chemical evolutionary scenario
precisely because he had selected parameters for his experiment in accord
with a then-current understanding of early atmospheric conditions. What
made Miller's experiment significant was not the production of amino acids
<I>per se</I>, but the production of amino acids from presumably plausible
prebiotic conditions. As Miller himself stated, &quot;In this apparatus
an attempt was made to duplicate a primitive atmosphere of the earth, and
not to obtain the optimum conditions for the formation of amino acids.&quot;
Now, however, the situation has changed. The only reason to continue assuming
the existence of a chemically reducing prebiotic atmosphere is that chemical
evolutionary theory seems to require it. As <I>Science</I> magazine's Richard
Kerr put it, &quot;No geological or geochemical evidence collected in the
last 30 years favors a strongly reducing primitive atmosphere. . .Only the
success of the laboratory experiments recommends it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While laboratory simulation experiments have failed
to demonstrate the plausibility of chemical evolution, they may have inadvertently
demonstrated the necessity of intelligent agency playing an active role
in the design of living systems. Ironically, even successful simulation
experiments require the intervention of the experimenters to prevent what
are known as &quot;interfering cross reactions&quot; and other chemically
destructive processes. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Assume for the moment that the reducing gases
used by Stanley Miller do actually simulate the conditions on the early
earth. Would his experimental results, then, support chemical evolution?
Not necessarily. Miller-type simulation experiments have invariably produced
non-biological substances in addition to biological building blocks such
as amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Without human intervention, these
other substances will react readily with biologically relevant building
blocks to form a biologically irrelevant compound&oacute;a chemically insoluble
sludge. To prevent this from happening and to move the simulation of chemical
evolution along a biologically promising trajectory, experimenters have
often removed those chemicals that degrade or transform amino acids into
non-biologically relevant compounds. They must also artificially manipulate
the initial conditions in their experiments. Rather than using both short
and long-wavelength ultraviolet light which would be present in any realistic
atmosphere, they use only short-wavelength UV. Why? The presence of the
long-wavelength UV light quickly degrades amino acids. Thus, investigators
have routinely manipulated chemical conditions both before and after performing
&quot;simulation&quot; experiments in order to protect their experiments
from destructive naturally occurring processes. These manipulations constitute
what chemist Michael Polanyi called a &quot;profoundly informative intervention.</FONT>&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">They seem to simulate, if they simulate anything, the
need for an intelligent agent to overcome the randomizing influences of
natural chemical processes&oacute;processes that lead inexorably, under
realistic conditions, to biochemical dead-ends. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Molecular
Biological Revolution and the Origin of Information /FONT&gt;</I></B> <FONT FACE="Times">Yet
a more fundamental problem remains for all chemical evolutionary scenarios.
Even if it could be demonstrated that the building blocks of essential molecules
could arise in realistic prebiotic conditions, the problem of assembling
those building blocks into functioning proteins or DNA chains would remain.
This problem of explaining the specific sequencing and thus, the information,
within biopolymers, lies at the heart of the current crisis in materialistic
evolutionary thinking.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In the early 1950s, the molecular biologist Fred
Sanger determined the structure of the protein molecule insulin. Sanger's
work made clear for the first time that each protein found in the cell comprises
a long and definitely arranged sequence of amino acids. The amino acids
in protein molecules are linked together to form a chain, rather like individual
railroad cars comprising a long train. Moreover, the function of all such
proteins (whether as enzymes or as structural components in the cell) depends
upon the specific sequencing of the individual amino acids, just as the
meaning of an English text depends upon the sequential arrangement of the
letters. The various chemical interactions between amino acids in any given
chain will determine the three-dimensional shape or topography that the
amino acid chain adopts. This shape in turn determines what function, if
any, the amino acid chain can perform within the cell. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For
a functioning protein, its three-dimensional shape gives it a &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
fit with other molecules in the cell, enabling it to catalyze specific chemical
reactions or to build specific structures within the cell. The proteins
histone 3 and 4, for example, fold into very well-defined three-dimensional
shapes with a precise distribution of positive charges around their exteriors.
This shape and charge distribution enables them to form part of the spool-like
&quot;nucleosomes&quot; that allow DNA to coil efficiently around itself
and to store information. Indeed, the information storage density of DNA,
thanks in part to nucleosome spooling, is several trillion times that of
our most advance computer chips. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To get a feel for the specificity of the three
dimensional charge distribution on these histone proteins, imagine a large
wooden spool with grooves on the surface. Next picture a helical cord made
of two strands. Then visualize wrapping the cord around the spool so that
it lies exactly into perfectly hollowed out grooves. Finally, imagine the
grooves to be hollowed so that they exactly fit the shape of the coiled
cord&oacute;thicker parts nestling into deeper grooves, thinner parts into
more shallow ones. In other words, the irregularities in the shape of the
cord exactly match irregularities in the hollow grooves. In the case of
histone and DNA, there aren't actually grooves, but there is an uncanny
distribution of positively charged regions on the surface of the histone
proteins that exactly matches the negatively charged regions of the double
stranded DNA that coils around it. Proteins that function as enzymes or
that assist in the processing of information stored on DNA strands often
have an even greater specificity of fit with the molecules to which they
must bind. Almost all proteins function as a result of an extreme &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
three-dimensional specificity that derives from the precise sequencing of
the amino acid building blocks.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The discovery of the complexity and specificity of protein
molecules has raised serious difficulties for chemical evolutionary theory,
even if an abundant supply of amino acids is granted for the sake of argument.
Amino acids alone do not make proteins, any more than letters alone make
words, sentences or poetry. In both cases, the sequencing of the constituent
parts determines the function (or lack of function) of the whole. In the
case of human languages the sequencing of letters and words is obviously
performed by intelligent human agents. In the cell, the sequencing of amino
acids is directed by the information&oacute;the set of biochemical instructions&oacute;encoded
on the DNA molecule. </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Information Transfer:
From DNA to Protein</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During
the 1950s and 60s, at roughly the same time molecular biologists began to
determine the structure and function of many proteins, scientists were able
to explicate the structure and function of DNA, the molecule of heredity.
After James Watson and Francis Crick elucidated the structure of DNA in
1953, molecular biologists soon discovered how DNA directs the process of
protein synthesis within the cell. They discovered that the specificity
of amino acids in proteins derives from a prior specificity within the DNA
molecule&oacute;from information on the DNA molecule stored as millions
of specifically arranged chemicals called nucleotides or bases along the
spine of DNA's helical strands. (See Figure 2) Chemists represent the four
nucleotides with the letters A, T, G, and C (for adenine, thymine, guanine
and cytosine). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As in the case of protein, the
sequence specificity of the DNA molecule strongly resembles the sequence
specificity of human codes or languages. Indeed, just as the letters in
the alphabet of a written language may convey a particular message depending
on their sequence, so too do the sequences of nucleotides or bases in the
DNA molecule convey precise biochemical messages that direct protein synthesis
within the cell. Whereas the function of the protein molecule derives from
the specific arrangement of twenty different amino acids (a twenty-letter
alphabet), the function of DNA depends upon the arrangement of just four
bases. Thus, it takes a group of three nucleotides (or triplets as they
are called) on the DNA molecule to specify the construction of one amino
acid. This process proceeds as long chains of nucleotide triplets (the genetic
message) are first copied during a process known as DNA replication and
then transported (by the molecular messenger m-RNA) to a complex organelle
called a ribosome. There at the ribosome site, the genetic message is translated
with the aid of an ingenious adaptor molecule called transfer-RNA to produce
a growing amino acid chain. (See Figure 3) Thus, the sequence specificity
in DNA begets sequence specificity in proteins. Or put differently, the
sequence specifity of proteins depends upon a prior specificity&oacute;upon
information&oacute;encoded in DNA.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The explication of this system by molecular biologists
in the 1950s and 1960s, has raised the question of the ultimate origin of
the specificity&oacute;the information&oacute;in both DNA and the proteins
it generates. Many scientists now refer to the information problem as the
&quot;Holy Grail&quot; of origin-of-life biology. As Bernd-Olaf Kuppers
recently stated, &quot;the problem of the origin of life is clearly basically
equivalent to the problem of the origin of biological information.&quot;
As mentioned previously, the information contained or expressed in natural
languages and computer codes is the product of intelligent minds. Minds
routinely create informative arrangements of matter. Yet since the mid-nineteenth
century scientists have sought to explain all phenomena by reference to
exclusively material causes. Since the 1950s, three broad types of naturalistic
explanation have been proposed by scientists to explain the origin of information.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Biological Information: Beyond the Reach of Chance</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">After the revolutionary developments within molecular
biology in the 1950s and early 1960s made clear that Oparin had underestimated
the complexity of life, he revised his initial theory. He sought to account
for the sequence specificity of the large protein, DNA and RNA molecules
(known collectively as biomacromolecules or biopolymers). In each case,
the broad outlines of his theory remained the same, but he invoked the notion
of natural selection acting on random variations <I>within the sequences
of the biopolymers</I> to account for the emergence of their specificity
within these molecules. Others invoked the idea of a chance formation for
these large information-bearing molecules by speaking of them as &quot;frozen
accidents.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While many outside origin-of-life
biology may still invoke &quot;chance&quot; as a causal explanation for
the origin of biological information, few serious researchers still do.
Since molecular biologists began to appreciate the sequence specificity
of proteins and nucleic acids in the 1950s and 1960s, many calculations
have been made to determine the probability of formulating functional proteins
and nucleic acids at random. Various methods of calculating probabilities
have been offered by Morowitz, Hoyle, Cairns-Smith, Prigogine, Yockey and
more recently, Robert Sauer. For the sake of argument, these calculations
have generally assumed extremely favorable prebiotic conditions (whether
realistic or not) and theoretically maximal reaction rates among the constituent
monomers (i.e. the constituent parts of the proteins, DNA and RNA). Such
calculations have invariably shown that the probability of obtaining functionally
sequenced biomacromolecules at random is, in Prigogine's words, &quot;vanishingly
small . . .even on the scale of . . .billions of years.&quot; As Cairns-Smith
wrote in 1971:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Blind chance...is very limited.
Low-levels of cooperation he [blind chance] can produce exceedingly easily
(the equivalent of letters and small words), but he becomes very quickly
incompetent as the amount of organization increases. Very soon indeed long
waiting periods and massive material resources become irrelevant.&quot;</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the probabilistic hurdles that must be overcome
to construct even one short protein molecule of about one hundred amino
acids in length. (A typical protein consists of about 300 amino acids, and
some are very much longer). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">First, all amino acids
must form a chemical bond known as a peptide bond so as to join with other
amino acids in the protein chain. Yet in nature many other types of chemical
bonds are possible between amino acids; in fact, peptide and non-peptide
bonds occur with roughly equal probability. Thus, at any given site along
a growing amino acid chain the probability of having a peptide bond is roughly
1/2. The probability of attaining four peptide bonds is: (1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2
x 1/2)=1/16 or (1/2)4. The probability of building a chain of 100 amino
acids in which all linkages involve peptide linkages is (1/2)100 or roughly
1 chance in 1030. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Second, in nature every amino
acid has a distinct mirror image of itself, one left-handed version or L-form
and one right-handed version or D-form. These mirror-image forms are called
optical isomers. Functioning proteins tolerate only left-handed amino acids,
yet the right-handed and left-handed isomers occurs in nature with roughly
equal frequency. Taking this into consideration compounds the improbability
of attaining a biologically functioning protein. The probability of attaining
at random only L-amino acids in a hypothetical peptide chain 100 amino acids
long is again (1/2)100 or roughly 1 chance in 1030. The probability of building
a 100 amino acid length chain at random in which all bonds are peptide bonds
and all amino acids are L-form would be (1/4)100 or roughly 1 chance in
1060(zero for all practical purposes given the time available on the early
earth). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Functioning proteins have a third independent
requirement, the most important of all; their amino acids must link up in
a specific sequential arrangement just the letters in a meaningful sentence
must. In some cases, even changing one amino acid at a given site can result
in a loss of protein function. Moreover, because there are twenty biologically
occurring amino acids the probability of getting a specific amino acid at
a given site is small, i.e. 1/20. (Actually the probability is even lower
because there are many non-proteineous amino acids in nature). On the assumption
that all sites in a protein chain require one particular amino acid, the
probability the probability of attaining a particular protein 100 amino
acids long would be (1/20)100or roughly 1 chance in 10130. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">We
know now, however, that some sites along the chain do tolerate several of
the twenty proteineous amino acids, while others do not. The biochemist
Robert Sauer of M.I.T has used a technique known as &quot;cassette mutagenesis&quot;
to determine just how much variance among amino acids can be tolerated at
any given site in several proteins. His results have shown that, even taking
the possibility of variance into account, the probability of achieving a
functional sequence of amino acids in several functioning proteins at random
is still &quot;vanishingly small,&quot; roughly 1 chance in 1065 an astronomically
large number. (There are 1065 atoms in our galaxy). In light of these results,
biochemist Michael Behe has compared the odds of attaining proper sequencing
in a 100 amino acid length protein to the odds of a blindfolded man finding
a single marked grain of sand hidden in the Sahara Desert, not once, but
three times. Moreover, if one also factors in the probability of attaining
proper bonding and optical isomers, the probability of constructing a rather
short functional protein at random becomes so small as to be effectively
zero (1 chance in 10 even given our multi-billion year old universe. All
these calculations, thus simply reinforce the opinion that has prevailed
since the mid-1960s within origin of life biology: chance is not an adequate
explanation for the origin of biological specificity. What Mora said in
1963 still holds:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Statistical considerations,
probability, complexity, etc., followed to their logical implications suggest
that the origin and continuance of life is not controlled by such principles.
An admission of this is the use of a period of practically infinite time
to obtain the derived result. Using such logic, however, we can prove anything.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Pre-Biotic Natural Selection: A Contradiction
in Terms<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">At nearly the same time that many researchers
became disenchanted with &quot;chance&quot; explanations, theories of pre-biotic
natural selection also fell out of favor. Such theories allegedly overcome
the difficulties attendant pure chance theories by providing a mechanism
by which complexity-increasing events in the cell would be preserved and
selected. Yet these theories share many of the difficulties that afflict
purely chance-based theories. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's revised
theory, for example, claimed that a kind of natural selection acted upon
random polymers as they formed and changed within his coacervate protocells.
As more complex molecules accumulated, they presumably survived and reproduced
more prolifically. Nevertheless, to many, Oparin's discussion of differential
reproduction seemed to presuppose a pre-existing mechanism of self-replication.
Self-replication in all extant cells depends upon functional (and, therefore,
to a high degree sequence-specific) proteins and nucleic acids. Yet the
origin of these molecules is precisely what Oparin needed to explain. Thus,
many rejected the postulation of prebiotic natural selection as question
begging. Functioning nucleic acids and proteins (or molecules approaching
their complexity) seemed necessary to self-replication, which in turn seemed
necessary to natural selection. Yet Oparin invoked natural selection to
explain the origin of proteins and nucleic acids. As the evolutionary biologist
Dobzhansky would proclaim, &quot;prebiological natural selection is a contradiction
in terms.&quot; Or as Pattee put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;. .
. there is no evidence that hereditary evolution occurs except in cells
which already have the complete complement of hierarchical constraints,
the DNA, the replicating and translating enzymes, and all the control systems
and structures necessary to reproduce themselves.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
any case, as just discussed, functional sequences of amino acids&oacute;i.e.
proteins&oacute;cannot be counted on to arise via random events, even if
some means of selecting them exists after they have been produced. Natural
selection can only select what chance has first produced and chance, at
least in a prebiotic setting, seems an implausible agent for producing the
information present in even a single functioning protein or DNA molecule.
Oparin attempted to circumvent this problem by claiming that the first polymers
need not have been terribly specific. But this claim raises doubts about
whether self-replication (and thus, natural selection) could have proceeded
at all. The mathematician Von Neumann, for example, showed that any system
capable of self-replication would need to contain sub-systems that were
functionally equivalent to the information storage, replicating and processing
systems found in extant cells. His calculations and similar ones by Wigner,
Landsberg, and Morowitz, showed that random fluctuations of molecules in
all probability would not produce the minimal complexity needed for even
a primitive replication system. Indeed, the improbability of developing
a replication system vastly exceeds the improbability of developing the
protein or DNA components of such system. As P.T. Mora put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;To
invoke statistical concepts, probability and complexity to account for the
origin and the continuance of life is not felicitous or sufficient. As the
complexity of a molecular aggregate increases, and indeed very complex arrangements
and interrelationships of molecules are necessary for the simplest living
unit, the probability of its existence under the disruptive and random influence
of physico-chemical forces decreases; the probability that it will continue
to function in a certain way, for example, to absorb and to repair, will
be even lower; and <I>the probability that it will reproduce</I>, [is] still
lower. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For this reason most scientists now dismiss
appeals to pre-biotic natural selection as essentially indistinguishable
from appeals to chance. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><B><I>Self-Organizational
Scenarios</I></B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Because of these difficulties, many origin-of-life theorists
after the mid-1960s attempted to address the problem of the origin of biological
information in a completely new way. Rather than invoking pre-biotic natural
selection or &quot;frozen accidents,&quot; many theorists suggested that
the laws of nature and chemical attraction may themselves be responsible
for the information in DNA and proteins. Some have suggested that simple
chemicals might possess &quot;self-ordering properties&quot; capable of
organizing the constituent parts of proteins, DNA and RNA into the specific
arrangements they now possess. Steinman and Cole, for example, suggested
that differential bonding affinities or forces of chemical attraction between
certain amino acids might account for the origin of the sequence specificity
of proteins. Just as electrostatic forces draw sodium ion (Na+) and chloride
ions (Cl-) together into a highly-ordered patterns within a crystal of salt
(NaCl), so too might amino acids with special affinities for each other
arrange themselves to form proteins. This idea was developed in a book called
<I>Biochemical Predestination</I> by Kenyon and Steinman in 1969. They argued
that the origin of life might have been &quot;biochemically predestined&quot;
by the properties of attraction that exist between constituent chemical
parts, particularly between amino acids in proteins. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
1977, another self-organizational theory was proposed by Prigogine and Nicolis
based on a thermodynamic characterization of living organisms. In their
book <I>Self Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems</I>, Prigogine and Nicolis
classified living organisms as open, nonequilibrium systems capable of &quot;dissipating&quot;
large quantities of energy and matter into the environment. They observed
that open systems driven far from equilibrium often display self-ordering
tendencies. For example, gravitational energy will produce highly ordered
vortices in a draining bathtub; thermal energy flowing through a heat sink
will generate distinctive convection currents or &quot;spiral wave activity.&quot;
Prigogine and Nicolis then argued that the organized structures observed
in living systems might have similarly &quot;self-originated&quot; with
the aid of an energy source. In essence, they conceded the improbability
of simple building blocks arranging themselves into highly ordered structures
under normal equilibrium conditions. But they suggested that, under non-equilibrium
conditions, where an external source of energy is supplied, biochemical
building blocks might arrange themselves into highly ordered patterns.</FONT>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Order v. Information </FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">For
many current origin-of-life scientists self-organizational models now seem
to offer the most promising approach to explaining the origin of biological
information. Nevertheless, critics have called into question both the plausibility
and the relevance of self-organizational models. Ironically, perhaps the
most prominent early advocate of self-organization, Professor Dean Kenyon,
has now explicitly repudiated such theories as both incompatible with empirical
findings and theoretically incoherent.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">First,
empirical studies have shown that some differential affinities do exist
between various amino acids (i.e., particular amino acids do form linkages
more readily with some amino acids than others). Neverthless, these differences
do not correlate to actual sequencing in large classes of known proteins.
In short, differing chemical affinities do not explain the multiplicity
of amino acid sequences that exist in naturally occurring proteins or the
sequential ordering of any single protein. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
the case of DNA this point can be made more dramatically. Figure 4 shows
the structure of DNA depends upon several chemical bonds. There are bonds,
for example, between the sugar and the phosphate molecules that form the
two twisting backbones of the DNA molecule. There are bonds fixing individual
nucleotide bases to the sugar-phosphate backbones on each side of the molecule.
There are also hydrogen bonds stretching horizontally across the molecule
between nucleotide bases making so-called complementary pairs. These bonds,
which hold two complementary copies of the DNA message text together, make
replication of the genetic instructions possible. Most importantly, however,
notice that there are <I>no</I> chemical bonds between the nucleotide bases
that run along the spine of the helix. Yet it is precisely along this axis
of the molecule that the genetic instructions in DNA are encoded. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
other words, the chemical constituents that are responsible for the message
text in DNA do not interact chemically in any significant way. Just as the
letters in a Scrabble game can be combined and recombined in any way to
form various sequences, so too can each of the four nucleotide bases attach
to any site on the DNA backbone with equal facility, making all sequences
equally probable (or improbable). Thus, &quot;self-organizing&quot; bonding
affinities can not explain the sequential ordering of the nucleotide bases
along the spine of the DNA because <I>there are no chemical bonds</I> between
the nucleotides that make the message text. Because the same holds for RNA
molecules, researchers who speculate that life began in an &quot;RNA world,&quot;
have also failed to solve the sequencing problem&oacute;i.e., the problem
of explaining how information present in all functioning RNA molecules could
have arisen in the first place. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For those who
want to explain the origin of life as the result of self-organizing properties
intrinsic to the material constituents of living systems, these rather elementary
facts of molecular biology have devastating implications. The most logical
place to look for self-organizing properties to explain the origin of genetic
information is in the constituent parts of the molecules carrying that information.
But biochemistry and molecular biology make clear that forces of attraction
between the constituents in DNA, RNA and proteins do not explain the sequence
specificity of these large information-bearing biomolecules.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Significantly,
information theorists insist that there is a good reason for this. If chemical
affinities between the constituents in the DNA message text determined the
arrangement of the text, such affinities would dramatically diminish the
capacity of DNA to carry information. To illustrate, imagine receiving the
following incomplete message over the wire. The &quot;q-ick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog.&quot; Obviously someone who knew the conventions of English
could determine which letter had been rubbed out in the transmission? Because
&quot;q&quot; and &quot;u&quot; always go together by grammatical necessity,
the presence of one indicates the probable presence of the other in the
initial transmission of the message. The &quot;u&quot; in all English communications
is an example of what information theorists call &quot;redundancy.&quot;
Given the grammatical rule &quot;'&quot;u' must always follow 'q'&quot;,
the addition of the &quot;u&quot; adds no new information, when &quot;q&quot;
is already present. It is &quot;redundant&quot; or unnecessary to determining
the sense of the message (though not to making it grammatically correct).
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Now consider what would happen if the individual
nucleotide &quot;letters&quot; (A, T,G, C) in a DNA molecule <I>did</I>
interact by <I>chemical</I> necessity with each other. Every time adenine
(A) occurred in a growing genetic sequence, it would likely drag thymine
(T) along with it. Every time cytosine (C) found a slot, guanine would follow.
As a result, the DNA message text would be peppered with repeating sequences
of A's followed by T's and C's followed by G's. Rather than having a genetic
molecule capable of unlimited novelty with all the unpredictable and aperiodic
sequences that characterize informative texts, we would have a highly repetitive
text awash in redundant sequences&oacute;much as happens in crystals. Indeed,
in a crystal the forces of mutual chemical attraction do completely explain
the sequential ordering of the constituent parts and consequently crystals
cannot convey novel information. Sequencing in crystals is highly ordered
or repetitive, but not informative. Once one has seen &quot;Na&quot; followed
by &quot;Cl&quot; in a crystal of salt, for example, one has seen the extent
of the sequencing possible. In DNA, however, where any nucleotide can follow
any other, innumerable novel sequences are possible, and a countless variety
of amino acid sequences can be built. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The forces
of chemical necessity, like grammatical necessity in our &quot;q-and-u&quot;
example above, produce redundancy or monotonous order, but reduce the capacity
to convey information and create novelty. As chemist Michael Polanyi has
said:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Suppose that the actual structure
of a DNA molecule were due to the fact that the bindings of its bases were
much stronger than the bindings would be for any other distribution of bases,
then such a DNA molecule would have no information content. Its code-like
character would be effaced by an overwhelming redundancy. . . .Whatever
may be the origin of a DNA configuration, it can function as a code only
if its order is not due to the forces of potential energy. It <I>must be</I>
as physically indeterminate as the sequence of words is on a printed page.&quot;
(emphasis added)</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">So, if chemists had found that
bonding affinities between the nucleotides in DNA produced nucleotide sequencing,
they would have also found that they had been mistaken about DNA's information-bearing
properties. To put the point quantitatively, to the extent that forces of
attraction between constituents in a sequence determine the arrangement
of the sequence, to that extent, will the information carrying capacity
of the system be diminished. Bonding affinities, to the extent they exist,
mitigate against the maximization of information. They can not, therefore,
be used to explain the origin of information. Affinities create mantras,
not messages. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The tendency to conflate the qualitative
distinction between &quot;order&quot; and &quot;information&quot; has characterized
self-organizational research efforts and calls into question the relevance
of such work to the origin of life. As Yockey has argued, the accumulation
of structural or chemical order does not explain the origin of biological
complexity (i.e., genetic information). He concedes that energy flowing
through a system may produce highly ordered patterns. Strong winds form
swirling tornados and the &quot;eyes&quot; of hurricanes; Prigogine's thermal
baths do develop interesting &quot;convection currents&quot;; and chemical
elements do coalesce to form crystals. Self-organizational theorists explain
well what doesn't need explaining. What needs explaining is not the origin
of order (in the sense of symmetry or repetition), but the origin of information&oacute;the
highly improbable, aperiodic, and yet specified sequences that make biological
function possible. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To illustrate the distinction
between order and information compare the sequence &quot;ABABABABABABAB&quot;
to the sequence &quot;Help! Our neighbor's house is on fire!&quot; The first
sequence is repetitive and ordered, but not complex or informative. The
second sequence is not ordered, in the sense of being repetitious, but it
is complex and also informative. The second sequence is complex because
its characters do not follow a rigidly repeating or predictable pattern&oacute;i.e,
it is aperiodic. It is also informative because, unlike a <I>merely</I>
complex sequence such as &quot;rfsxdcnct&lt;e%dwqj&quot;, the particular
arrangement of characters is highly exact or &quot;specified&quot; so as
to perform a (communication) function. Systems that are characterized by
both specificity and complexity (what information theorists call &quot;specified
complexity&quot;) have &quot;information content.&quot; Since such systems
have the qualitative feature of complexity (aperiodicity), they are qualitatively
distinguishable from systems characterized by simple periodic order. Thus,
attempts to explain the origin of order have no relevance to discussions
of the origin of specified complexity or information content. Significantly,
the nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of DNA have, by all accounts,
a high information content&oacute;that is, they are both highly specified
and complex, just like meaningful English sentences. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conflating
order and information (or specified complexity) has led many to attribute
properties to brute matter that it does not possess. While energy in a system
<I>can</I> create patterns of symmetric order such as whirling vortices,
there is no evidence that energy alone can encode functionally specified
sequences&oacute;whether biochemical or otherwise.</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As Yockey warns: </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Attempts
to relate the idea of order . . . with biological organization or specificity
must be regarded as a play on words which cannot stand careful scrutiny.
Informational macromolecules can code genetic messages and therefore can
carry information because the sequence of bases or residues is affected
very little, if at all, by [self-organizing] physico-chemical factors.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Return of the Intelligent Design Hypothesis<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The preceding
discussion suggests that the properties of the material constituents of
DNA&oacute;like those of any information-bearing medium&oacute;are not responsible
for the information conveyed by the molecule. Indeed, in all informational
systems, the information content or message is neither deducible from the
properties of the material medium nor attributable to them. The properties
of matter do not explain the origin of the information. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To amplify this point consider, first, that many
different materials can express the same message. The headline of this morning's
<I>New York Times</I> was written with ink on paper. Nevertheless, many
other materials could have been used to convey the same message. The information
in the headline could have been written with chalk on a board, with neon-filled
tubes in a series of signs, or by a sky-writer over New York harbor. Clearly,
the peculiar chemical properties of ink are not necessary to convey the
message. Neither are the physical properties (i.e., the geometric shapes)
of the letters necessary to transmit the information. The same message could
have been expressed in Hebrew or Greek using entirely different alphabetic
characters. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conversely, the same material medium
(and alphabetic characters) can express many different messages&oacute;i.e.
the medium is not sufficient to determine the message. This November the
<I>Times</I> will use ink and English characters to tell the reading public
that either a Democrat, a Republican or a third-party candidate has won
the Presidential election. Yet the properties of the ink and the 26 letters
available to the type-setter will not determine which headline will be broadcast
by the <I>Times.</I> Instead, the ink and English characters will permit
the transmission of whatever headline the election requires, as well as
a vast ensemble of other possible arrangements of text, some meaningful,
and many more not. Neither the chemistry of the ink nor the shapes of the
letters determine the meaning of the text. In short, the message transcends
the properties of the medium. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The information in DNA also transcends the properties
of its material medium. Because chemical bonds do not determine the arrangement
of nucleotide bases, the nucleotides can assume a vast array of possible
sequences and thereby express many different messages. (Conversely, various
materials can express the same messages, as happens in variant versions
of the genetic code or when laboratory chemists use English instructions
to direct the synthesis of naturally occurring proteins). Thus, again, the
properties of the constituents do not determine the function&oacute;the
information transmitted&oacute;by the whole. As Michael Polanyi has said:
&quot;As the arrangement of a printed page is extraneous to the chemistry
of the printed page, so is the base sequence in a DNA molecule extraneous
to the chemical forces at work in the DNA molecule.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">If the properties of matter (i.e., the medium)
do not suffice to explain the origin of information, what does? Blind chance
is, of course, a possibility but <I>not</I>, as we have seen in the case
of DNA and proteins, where the amount of information (or the improbability
of arrangement) gets too immense. The random selection and sequencing of
Scrabble pieces out of a grab bag might occasionally produce a few meaningful
words such as &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;ran.&quot; Nevertheless, undirected
selection will inevitably fail as the numbers of letters required to make
a text increases. Fairly soon, chance becomes clearly inadequate as origin-of-life
biologists have almost universally acknowledged. /FONT&gt;<FONT FACE="Times">Some
have suggested that the discovery of some new scientific laws might explain
the origin of biological information. But this suggestion betrays confusion
on two counts. First, scientific laws don't generally explain or cause natural
phenomena, they describe them. For example, Newton's law of gravitation
described, but did not explain, the attraction between planetary bodies.
Second, scientific laws describe (almost by definition) highly regular phenomena&oacute;i.e.,
order. Thus, to say that any scientific law can describe, or generate, an
informational sequence, is essentially a contradiction in terms. The patterns
that laws describe are necessarily highly ordered, not complex. Thus, like
crystals, all law-like patterns have an extremely limited capacity to convey
information. One might, perhaps, find a complex set of material conditions
capable of generating high information content on a regular basis, but everything
we know suggests that the complexity and information content of such conditions
would have to equal or exceed that of any system produced, thus again begging
the question about the ultimate origin of information.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">For
example, the chemist J. C. Walton has argued (echoing earlier articles by
Mora) that even the self-organization produced in Prigogine-style convection
currents does not exceed the organization or information represented by
the the experimental apparatus used to create the currents. Similarly, Maynard-Smith
and Dyson have shown that Manfred Eigen's so-called hypercycle model for
generating information naturalistically is subject to the same law of information
loss. They show, first, that Eigen's hypercycles presuppose a large initial
contribution of information in the form of a long RNA molecule and some
forty specific proteins. More significantly, they show that because hypercycles
lack an error-free mechanism of self-replication, they become susceptible
to various &quot;error-catastrophes&quot; that ultimately diminish, not
increase, the information content of the system over time. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Instead,
our experience with information-intensive systems (especially codes and
languages) indicates that such systems always come from an intelligent source&oacute;i.e.,
from mental or personal agents. This generalization holds not only for the
information present in languages and codes but also for the non-grammatical
information (also describable as specified complexity) inherent in machines
or expressed in works of art. Like the text of a newspaper, the parts of
a supercomputer and the faces on Mount Rushmore require many instructions
to specify their shape or arrangement and consequently, have a high information
content. Each of these systems are also, not coincidentally, the result
of intelligent design, not chance or material forces. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Our generalization about the cause of information
has, ironically, received confirmation from origin-of-life research itself.
During the last forty years, every naturalistic model proposed has failed
to explain the origin of information. Thus, mind or intelligence or what
philosophers call &quot;agent causation,&quot; now stands as the only known
cause known to be capable of creating an information-rich system, including
the coding regions of DNA, functional proteins and the cell as a whole.
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Because mind or intelligent design is a necessary
cause of an informative system, one can detect (or, logically, retrodict)
the past action of an intelligent cause from the presence of an information-intensive
effect, even if the cause itself cannot be directly observed. Since information
requires an intelligent source, the flowers spelling &quot;Welcome to Victoria&quot;
in the gardens of Victoria harbor, lead visitors to infer the activity of
intelligent agents even if they did not see the flowers planted and arranged.
Similarly, the specifically arranged nucleotide sequences&oacute;the encoded
information&oacute;in DNA imply the past action of an intelligent mind,
even if such mental agency cannot be directly observed.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Moreover, the logical calculus underlying such
inferences follows a valid and well-established method used in all historical
and forensic sciences. In historical sciences, knowledge of the present
causal powers of various entities and processes enables scientists to make
inferences about possible causes in the past. When a thorough study of various
possible causes turns up just a single adequate cause for a given effect,
historical or forensic scientists can make fairly definitive inferences
about the past. Several years ago, for example, one of the forensic pathologists
from the original Warren Commission that investigated the assassination
of President Kennedy spoke out to quash rumors about a second gunman firing
from in front of the motorcade. Apparently, the bullet hole in the back
of President Kennedy's skull evidenced a distinctive beveling pattern that
clearly indicated its direction of entry. In this case, it revealed definitely
that the bullet had entered from the rear. The pathologist called the beveling
pattern a &quot;distinctive diagnostic&quot; to indicate a necessary causal
relationship between the direction of entry and the presence of the beveling.
Inferences based on knowledge of necessary causes (&quot;distinctive diagnostics&quot;)
are quite common in historical and forensic sciences, and often lead to
the detection of intelligent, as well as, natural causes. Since Criminal
X's fingers are the only known cause of Criminal X's fingerprints, X's prints
on the murder weapon incriminate him with a high degree of certainty. In
the same way, since intelligent design is the only known cause of information-rich
systems, the presence of information&oacute;including the information-rich
nucleotide sequences in DNA&oacute;implies an intelligent source. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Scientists
in many fields recognize the connection between intelligence and information
and make inferences accordingly. Archaeologists assume a mind produced the
inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone. Evolutionary anthropologists try to demonstrate
the intelligence of early hominids by arguing that certain chipped flints
are too improbably specified to have been produced by natural causes. N.A.S.A.'s
search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (S.E.T.I.) presupposed that information
imbedded in electromagnetic signals from space would indicate an intelligent
source. As yet, however, radio-astronomers have not found information-bearing
signals coming from space. But closer to home, molecular biologists have
identified encoded information in the cell. Consequently, a growing number
of scientists now suggest that the information in DNA justifies making what
probability theorist William Dembski and biochemist Michael Behe call &quot;the
design inference.&quot; </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Conclusion<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During the last
forty years, molecular biology has revealed a complexity and intricacy of
design that exceeds anything that was imaginable during the late-nineteenth
century. We now know that organisms display any number of distinctive features
of intelligently engineered high-tech systems: information storage and transfer
capability; functioning codes; sorting and delivery systems; regulatory
and feed-back loops; signal transduction circuitry; and everywhere, complex,
mutually-interdependent networks of parts. Indeed, the complexity of the
biomacromolecules discussed in this essay does not begin to exhaust the
full complexity of living systems. As even the staunch materialist Richard
Dawkins has allowed, &quot;Biology is the study of complicated things that
give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet
the materialistic science we have inherited from the late-nineteenth century,
with its exclusive conceptual reliance on matter and energy, could neither
envision nor can it now account for the biology of the information age.
As Werner Gitt has said, throughout the natural sciences &quot;energy and
matter are considered to be basic, universal quantities. But the concept
of information has become just as fundamental and far reaching. . . information
has rightly become known as the third fundamental quantity.&quot; Or as
Norbert Weiner put it, &quot;Information is information, neither energy
nor matter. No materialism that fails to take account of this can survive
the present day.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The molecular biology of
the cell raises the possibility that &quot;no materialism&quot; will survive
the revolution beginning to take root in science. While established journals
and institutions continue to propagate the orthodoxies of a generation ago,
many scientists, philosophers of science and mathematicians have begun to
challenge these views and to formulate alternative approaches. Recent work
in probability theory has defined information more precisely and articulated
clear mathematical criteria for the identification of intelligently designed
systems, thus providing a theoretical framework for a new science based
upon the reality of design. A new book on the &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;
of biochemical systems explains why gradual undirected evolution cannot
produce such systems, and suggests intelligent design as the most viable
scientific alternative. A new peer-reviewed journal, <I>Origins &amp; Design,</I>
opens this spring with a seminal article by a former chemical evolutionist
turned design-advocate. Other work promises to reshape our conception, not
only of living things but of our science and ourselves. If the simplest
life owes its origin to an intelligent Creator, then perhaps man is not
the &quot;cosmic orphan&quot; that twentieth century scientific materialism
has taught. Perhaps then, during the twenty first century, the traditional
moral and spiritual foundations of the West will find support from the very
sciences that once seemed to undermine them. </FONT><BR>

<H1><CENTER>From the President</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>
This redesign of Discovery Journal is a sign of the Institute's move &quot;to the next level&quot; of activity and maturity. 
Board members, friends, and other advisors all urged us to make a prompt and brisk leap ahead. It is happening
this year.


We have enlisted for the first time an Executive Director and are setting out to hire a professional development
officer. The redesign of publications will extend to our other publications: Inquiry, our white paper series, and
Views, our compilation of Discovery Fellows' articles. Thanks to the generosity of the M.J. Murdock
Charitable Trust and our corporate sponsors, we have built a well-received interactive Internet website and are
creating a new computer network for staff and Fellows. 


Financial planning, staff functions, and events development are all being reorganized. There are several new
projects--and Fellows--to be announced soon. Having been the grateful guests of the Perkins Coie law firm
for nearly six years, we also expect to move soon into new, more capacious offices. 
Discovery Institute's purpose is clearer than ever: to move beyond today's public policy problems to discover
tomorrow's opportunities. We look for the big idea. And for practical ways to make it happen. Guiding our
big ideas (such as the freedom model of high technology, exploring life after materialism, common sense
environmental law, revolutionizing Social Security, and overhauling the adversarial legal system) are the
principles of personal responsibility, civic virtue, free market economics, internationalism, and representative
democracy.


Discovery Institute has always stood for this purpose and these principles. Only now we are trying to move
ahead a bit bolder and faster. 


We appreciate your joining us on the journey.


All the best,
Bruce Chapman</PRE>

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<H1><CENTER>SAM BEARD WANTS TO RESTORE HOPE IN AMERICA BY REFORMING SOCIAL
SECURITY</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Any American currently earning $10,000 per year pays $23.85 a week, or $1,240
a year, into Social Security.  If invested at market rates, at the retirement
age of 65, that investment would make anyone a millionaire (before inflation).
 That is the conclusion of Sam Beard, Chairman of the National Development
Council, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow, and author of Restoring Hope
in America: The Social Security Solution, to be published by ICS Press of
San Francisco in May.  Beard, who has worked for four U.S. Presidents, has
been investigating Social Security and exploring ways that all Americans
can be secure in retirement.  <BR>
<BR>
He begins a national book tour in Seattle at a Discovery program on May
14, 1996 at Kane Hall (Room 220) on the University of Washington campus.
 Co-sponsored by the UW Graduate School of Public Affairs and the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, the program begins at 7:00 p.m. and is free to Discovery
members; $5.00 for non-members.  Students will be admitted for free.  <BR>

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Five -- PFF</title>
<h3>Renewing American Civilization: Class Five</h3>
Pillar Four: The Spirit Of Invention And Discovery,
	And The Development Of Pragmatism And Practical
	Common Sense<P>
February 4, 1995<P>
Reinhardt College<P>

The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt college
television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the fifth of 10
class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course, which presents the
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization.
This week's lesson, pillar four, the Spirit of Invention and Discovery,
focuses on the spirit of invention and discovery and the development of
pragmatism and practical common sense as key characteristics of and
contributors to American Civilization.
<P>
Let me welcome everyone this morning.  Let me, in particular, welcome the
students of Mind Extension University.  And I want to remind everyone that
you can mail your comments to:  Renewing American Civilization, post office
box 6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065, or if you prefer, you can fax your
comments to 404-528-9806.  Or you can e-mail your comments to America
Online, which is at renewam@aol.com.  In addition, for those of you who
want to get the class transcripts and other class materials -and I should
mention that this is available on the Internet web page http//www.pff.org,
but if you check in, we automatically give you permission to reproduce it.
<P>

And I say that because one of the Internet memos we got, or the e-mail
memos we got this week was from somebody who has a totally different
bulletin board in a totally different place who was asking could he take
off the transcripts off of Internet and put them on their particular
bulletin board, and the answer is "yes."  We copyright so nobody can
copyright it.  That is, we wouldn't like to wake up Thursday morning and
have somebody who had copyrighted the whole course and I couldn't use it,
so we copyright it only for protective reasons, but, in fact, we encourage
people to reproduce these things.
<P>
Now, let me also remind folks that a lot of the ideas in the course are
carried out.  You can get either the "American Civilization" newspaper, the
video or audio tape of the course and the course readings by calling
1-800-to-renew, which is, for most Americans, still easier than figuring
out how to get on Internet, although the number getting on Internet's going
up all the time.
<P>
The framework of this course starts with the premise that America is a
unique civilization and that it has five pillars:  the historic lessons of
American Civilization, personal strength, entrepreneurial free enterprise,
the spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined by Deming.
And that as we go through these five pillars that define how American
Civilization works and study them, we will then, after we've spent two
hours on each of those, apply them to four areas, and the four areas to
which we will apply these pillars are, one, the third wave and how it will
affect American Civilization.  Two, creating American jobs in the world
market.  Three, replacing the culture of violence and poverty with a
culture of productivity and safety.  And, four, citizenship and community
in the 21st century.
<P>
Now, today's topic is the spirit of invention and discovery, which is
pillar number four, and we're going to talk a lot about the spirit of
invention and discovery, but I can't resist, since just before the class
started here at Reinhardt, I was asking y'all -- you know, I've been
talking a lot about Peter Drucker's "the Effective Executive."  Why you
should buy it, why you should use it?  For anybody who's watching us for
the first time, this is Drucker's "the Effective Executive."  It's
available in paperback.  It is, I believe, the best single volume on being
effective ever written.  I think as you all begin to encounter it, you're
having the same effect.
<P>
One of Drucker's points is that Effective Executives monitor their own
time.  That they actually, by 15-minute increments, will record how they
spend time just to find out:  what are they really doing with their time?
How many of you did that over the last week?  Okay, almost half of you.
What was your big learning?  What did you learn from doing that?
<PRE>
>> I have a lot more time than I thought.

>> you have a lot more time than you thought.  Who else?

>> I didn't spend the time where I actually thought that I had spent it.

>> what was the difference?

>> I think the big difference was I wasn't able to focus on the priorities
>>that I thought that I was focusing on.  I need to refocus my priorities.
>>

>> who else?

>> I spent a lot of time in the car, and I found that by planning on doing
>>things, like taking tapes or taking my recorder or whatever, I can
>>utilize that time rather than just being dead time.

>> okay.

>> I find that the telephone is interrupting and sidetracking me to other
>>areas that I need to be not so involved on, to keep focused on what I've
>>got to accomplish.

>> who else?

>> I found that if I wrote it down, that I stuck by it.  If I had it on
>>paper, then I'd actually do what I was planning on doing.

>> yeah, but, you know, if you planned it in advance, if you planned it,
>>like, the night before, if you planned it out in 15-minute increments,
>>you got a lot more done the next day.

>> yeah.

>> but it's hard to stick to that 15-minute increment when things come up
>>in the middle of the day and you go, "oh, my gosh, I have to take care of
>>this and this," and that sets your whole schedule back.

>> now, let me ask you something:  if you found, as you kept track of your
>>schedule, that that was happening to you every day, what would you do?

>> plan in time to --

>> Right, start saying, "okay, I really know that I'm going to spend two
>>hours every day doing things I didn't plan on, so I will block in two
>>hours every day."  Because part of the message is you have a finite
>>amount of time, and so -- and you're going to lose a fair amount of that
>>time because things will come up you can't avoid, so you have even less
>>time than you thought you had.
</pre>
So you'd better really decide:  what are my highest priorities?  And that's
what you do during the time you have available.  And then gradually, you'll
get into the habit, as I am today, you know, I now plan my schedule on an
annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and sometimes hourly basis.
<P>
And I'll redesign my schedule three or four times a day and stop and say,
"we've got to change this, change this, add this, move this," and the
result is you're constantly coming back to first priorities:  what are the
things you have to get done?  And Drucker has a rule that you get 80% done
in 20% of the time. Yeah.  And then the other -- the rest of the time you
spend finishing it, and so his theory is if you get 80 done and then you
shift and you get 80 done, remember, five 80s is 400.  So in the length of
time it normally takes a person to complete the first 100%, under the
Drucker model, you're consistently dropping the 20% that's least important.
So you're actually getting four times as much done.  Do you all follow me?

<P>
And if you then set priorities so that you're actually focusing each time
on the most important priorities, it is amazing how it changes your
effectiveness.
<P>
So anyway I'm glad to see that at least half of you now are up to speed.
The rest of you -- everybody ought to, just for a few days, track your time
for 15-minute increments, and then look at what you thought you were doing
and look at what you're actually doing, and I think you'll all be very
surprised. And if you get in that habit and then the rest of Drucker's
"Effective Executive" works just as well.  That if you take each of the
ideas and actually do it, apply it to your life, don't just go, "that's
interesting," apply it to your life, you'll be shocked a year from now how
much more effective you are.
<P>
Now, for today, though, we're going to talk about the spirit of invention
and discovery.  And we deliberately talked about it as a spirit, because
it's not how to be a scientist or how to be an engineer or how to be an
inventor.  It's an attitude.  It's a way of thinking about things.  It's an
approach to life that emphasizes Inventing and discovering.  And in a way,
I think that America's uniquely committed to this, because the pioneering
spirit led to the spirit of invention and discovery.
<P>
Remember, pioneering occurs first in your mind.  Very important concept.
That what you have is a pioneer of the mind.  You think about going west.
You think about going to the mountains.  You think about reaching the
Pacific Ocean.  Lewis and Clark started by visioning in their own head the
idea of an expedition to the pacific.  You thought about creating a wagon
train.  It's something you'll see again when you come to Deming next week.
That the father of the quality movement talks about the idea that first
there has to be a theory.
<P>
You know, your theory may be:  if I put water on the stove in a pan and I
turn the stove on and the water bubbles and I take an egg out of the cold
thing called a refrigerator and I put it now on the hot thing called a
stove and I let it wait three minutes, it will cook.  That's a theory you
have of how eggs get cooked.  And if you don't have the theory before the
action, there's no reason for you to take the action.
<P>
That's part of why when you're young and you're first learning how to cook
and you don't quite get the theories right, like putting water in the pan,
and then you have a  whole -- and many of you probably had these kind of
experiences.  Or, you know, remembering that you're actually supposed to
put yeast in with the flour so it rises, or whatever it was that you goofed
up on when you were younger.
<P>
Now, if you think of all -- the American tradition is to be a pioneer in
your own mind, which in a sense is a quintessentially American sense of a
spirit of seeking the new.  More than any other country on the planet, we
have this constant passionate desire to reach out to something new.  I
mean, that's why New, Improved Tide is a term that's been used now for 30
years or 40 years.  I mean, every other year there's a new, improved Tide.
And it works.  It works every time.  That's why they've been successful for
so long.  But this is a nation where if you say to people, "wow, they're
opening a new mall," or "there is a  new" -- you know, "there's a new six
flags ride," or "have you seen the new Nikes" or whatever, but it's a very
powerful word, and it's because I think we are permanently intrigued with
the idea of being at the edge of the future.
<P>
There's a fascinating book called "At the Edge of the Future" which argues
that Los Angeles -- that Americans kept moving west until they reached Los
Angeles.  That you can't go any further on the continent, and so they sat
around waiting for the earthquake.
<P>
Think about California.  There was recently a James Gardner -- a "Rockford"
movie where they had the fire and Malibu, they had the earthquake, and they
had the riots all in one movie, and at the end of the movie, he's still
staying in Los Angeles, and, of course, millions of people are, but there's
a sense of overcoming that Americans are just remarkable at overcoming.
You know, you know there's going to be eight inches of snow in Washington
today.  People will go rush about and overcome.  I mean, it's automatic.
<P>
And so the sense of the spirit of seeking the new.  I think that this topic
matters because inventions and discoveries, science and technology change
things dramatically.  And this is a point I want to make just for a second,
because it's one of the places where bureaucracies and academics least
understand the world.  People are used to this kind of a gradual change.
<P>
And when you read government reports and you look at most academic studies,
they're talking about very, very incremental change. But if you have a
stagecoach and then you have a railroad and then you have an airplane --
and this is what Drucker means by the word  "discontinuities" -- that you
can say over here:  we're going to really improve stagecoaches, make them
lighter, better wheels, you know, grow bigger horses, et cetera, train
people so they can really change the horse teams fast.  Then you get to a
railroad.  A railroad is not a better stagecoach.  A railroad takes a huge
capital investment.  You've got to lay all the rails.  You've got to build
the engine.  You've got to find a system of procuring -- early on it was
wood, and then it became coal, and then it became fuel, diesel fuel, or
oil.
<P>
Okay?  So now you've got:  well, we'll build better rails, they'll last
longer.  One of the early problems in the early American railroads,
Boorstin's book "the Americans" really describes some of this.  Early
American railroads were built with very shoddy ties and with iron that
wasn't strong enough, so they wrecked all the time because the Americans go
very fast.  Europeans complained -- would talk about how exhilarating it
was to be on American railroads because it scared you to death and they
wrecked all the time.  Then you come over here, and the airplane is a
totally different system.  Doesn't require rails, but does require
airports.
<P>
And it occurred to me the other day, I mean, it's just an interesting
study, the fastest way to -- if you want to go from this point to this
point and the airport is here, you actually move away from your destination
to get there faster. Just think about the logic of that.
<P>
Each of these has its own objective requirement.  Each of these is an
invention.  This one was invented probably by the Assyrians, who invented
chariots. This one was invented, of course, by George Stephenson in England
about 1820 and became very popularized.  And this was invented by the
Wright brothers.  But what I'm trying to suggest to you is that inventions
like this dramatically change our lives, and as you'll see later on, one of
the great weaknesses of the modern period is when we run into a problem in
the period of the counterculture, we just stop and get fascinated by the
problem.
<P>
Historically, Americans immediately said, "so what's the solution?"  And
the passion was not for studying the problem. The passion was for finding
the solution.  And you're going to see that right now, because you're going
to see a video about one of the most remarkable Americans who is almost
never studied in the counterculture because all of his values are exactly
wrong. He was successful, he was a work -- he was very work-oriented, he
was highly creative.  He was generous, and he was a unique individual who
changed the history of America as much as any single person other than
Washington and Lincoln.  And so I'd like you to spend just a couple minutes
now with Thomas Edison.<P>
<PRE>
>> born on February 11th, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, Thomas A. Edison applied
>>for his first patent, an electrical volt recorder, in 1868 at age 21.
>>Before he died at age 84 in October of 1931, Edison had received patents
>>for an incredible 1,097 U.S. Inventions and changed the world we live in
>>forever.  Although he is perhaps best known for inventing the
>>incandescent lamp, which now lights the dark of night for people the
>>world over, Edison's genius gave us hundreds of other inventions that
>>have become indispensable parts of our daily lives, from simple
>>conveniences like waxed paper, band-aids, and the gummed envelopes in
>>which millions of letters are mailed every day, to major contributions,
>>such as the phonograph, the motion picture projector, the automatic
>>telegraph system, the universal electric motor for AC and DC current,
>>fluorescent lights, the alkaline storage battery, Edison Portland cement,
>>the fluoroscope, which Edison chose not to patent because of its
>>universal need in surgery and medicine, and hundreds of others.  Among
>>them are the first embossing machine, Edison's electric pen, the
>>mimeograph machine, and an early Edison ediphone.
</pre>
Here we see a display on the invention that gave Thomas Edison the most
difficulty, the storage battery.
<P>
In fact, after 9,000 experiments, all failures, his assistants tried to
discourage him.  "those are not failures," he responded. "those are 9,000
things we've learned that don't work."  And after 41,000 more experiments,
he gave the world his nickel alkaline storage battery, which for more than
75 years has been used on everything from London transit buses to the
submarines of the U.S. Navy.
<P>
Thomas Edison gave birth to the motion picture industry with his invention
of the kinetoscope, kinetograph, and kinetophone, which are displayed here
and which combined made possible the sound movies we all enjoy today.  Of
all of his inventions, Edison's personal favorite was the phonograph,
because the phonograph offered music in every home and he felt that music,
next to religion, has done more to elevate man than any other thing since
the birth of Christ.
<P>
Charles Kettering, famous in his own right as an inventor, said that as
surely as if they were named in Edison's last will and testament, every man
and woman alive was the beneficiary of the labors of this great man.  For
he was the founder of organized research and gave us the principles of
modern electronics, and today as we watch television, listen to the radio,
pound a typewriter, send a telegram, talk on the telephone, go to the
movies, listen to recorded music, turn on an electric switch, take the
waxed paper from a loaf of bread, or put a band-aid on our finger, we are
in debt to the genius of Thomas Edison.
<P>
His friend and neighbor, Henry Ford, called him the world's greatest
inventor and worst businessman.  However, in 1931, the year that Edison
died, businesses that were created by his inventions amounted to
$25,683,544,000.  This was twice the total of all federal, state, and local
government budgets.
<P>
Edison said that anything we had the mental capacity to conceive, we had
the physical ability to produce.  To Thomas Edison, nothing was impossible.
Yet all this man wanted was to make the world an easier, more enjoyable,
and comfortable place to live.  Edison himself said, "if I have spurred men
on to greater effort and if our work has widened the horizon of man's
understanding even a little and given a measure of happiness in the world,
I am content."
<P>

How many of you had any notion that he was that broadly the base of your
life?  Okay.  About a fifth of you.  And there are a couple things here.
One is, inventions change everything.  I mean, the discovery of the polio
-- or discoveries do.  The discovery of the polio vaccine changed
everything.  The invention of the electric light which we're using, the
invention of television which we're using, the invention of the satellite,
which is how we're projecting the  show -- this particular class is shown
all over the country by things that are inventions.
<P>
So one thing, you know, that we're going to argue today is that you want to
have a society which focuses again and again on inventions.  But there's a
second part:  look how persistent he had to be.  50,000 experiments to get
to the electric battery? 4,000 to get to the electric light.  And think of
what lessons children could learn if it was routine in third, fourth, and
fifth grades to study Edison, and how much it would liberate you.
<P>
I mean, the fact that you may not be a great academic or you may not like
sitting still or you may not like doing whatever it is that modern
academics wants you to do, people like Edison would all have been
considered hyperactive children.  They were too aggressive, too energetic,
too persistent, and far from seeing himself as a victim, I think it's a
true story that Edison was very hard of hearing and actually used his teeth
on the edge of the phonograph machine in order to check the records,
because he couldn't hear.  He was a very persistent man.
<P>
And think about all the habits we ought to be teaching ourselves just
coming out of the life of this one man.  He actually contributed about
one-sixth of the gross national product came out of his inventions by the
1930s.
<P>
Now, to give you an example of how it applies to the modern world and why
I'm an optimist.  People -this is not just glandular.  It's based on
serious thought about how the modern world works.  Bill Loughrey, who's a
good friend of ours at scientific Atlanta, he has the following rule:  the
computer chip now has over one million times the power of a vacuum tube for
the same price.  If the federal government had improved in efficiency as
much as the computer has since 1950, we would only need four federal
employees, and the federal budget would be $100,000.
<P>
Now, the analogy's not actually -- is not actually a valid analogy, but
it's a wonderful way of thinking about this.  There's a similar version of
that that talks about cars.  You'd pay, you know, $300 for a car and would
get 90 million miles to a gallon.  That's how dramatic the computer chip
industry is.  You're about to have the same explosion in biology, as we'll
discuss later.  I mean, there are places where suddenly -- and this is why
I talked earlier, people get used to the idea of, "okay, this is what my
life will be like."  And then suddenly you hit a discontinuity, and now
it's here.
<P>
This is what happened to physics in the first half of the 20th century.
>From Einstein around 1913 to the atomic and hydrogen bombs.  This is what
happened to the computer chip -- to the computer beginning about 1950 to
the transistor, which was discovered in 1949.  This is what happens right
now.  We're just seeing the beginnings of the DNA revolution in biology.
It will do this.
<P>
And that's why sometimes what you're really looking for -- remember
Drucker's "Effective Executive," you're sitting right  here -- what you're
really looking for all around you is:  where are the places that are about
to go through this discontinuity?  Because that's where the big money is,
that's where the big change is, that's where you have the real
opportunities.  Now, the point at one level of this -- of focusing in on
this as a pillar is that as technology changes, we change.  The technology
has a tremendous impact on us.
<P>
I mean, why do more people move to Florida?  Because of air conditioning.
And try living in Florida in mid summer without air conditioning.  It's a
big factor in the rise of Florida as a year-round place that was the
popularization of air conditioning after World War II.  Similarly, I think
you've got to look at the degree to which change occurs over time.  One of
the people -the person who is the center of next week is W. Edwards
Deming, and Dr. Deming was born in 1900, and he is a man who taught the
Japanese the concept of quality.  And his lifetime was a lifetime of
commitment.
<P>
I want to use -- next week we're going to talk about his ideas in detail.
But what I want to do for a few minutes today is to get you to think about
a lifetime, your own lifetime, somebody else's, because Dr. Deming, who is
a man who really did change history.  He taught the Japanese the concept of
quality.  He came back home and taught us a lot about it.  He had a set of
ideas that are very, very profound about how the world works.
<P>
And yet he is well worth looking at in his own right, but he's also a very
useful analogy for us, because Dr. Deming was born in 1900.  He was very,
very active.  He stayed very busy, and he was still teaching four days a
week, 10 hours a day, when he died at the age of 93.  He died in 1994
before his 94th birthday.  Now, what I want you to think about is: look at
1900 to 1994 as a lifetime of change.  I mean, think about Dr. Deming's
lifetime.  1903, the airplane is invented by the Wright brothers.  1903,
the first motion picture with a -- with a plot, first American motion
picture with a plot, "the Great Train Robbery," was made, which you see at
Disneyworld.  1903, Henry Ford begins his first mass-produced automobile
and begins lowering the cost of buying a car.  After that comes commercial
radio, commercial television, microwave ovens.
<P>
I mean, just go down the list sometime.  Dryers, refrigerators.  I'm old
enough, I still remember the ice man.  That was the very end of the age of
the ice man when I was a child.  I know friends who remember when
electricity came to their home.  All of this occurred in Deming's lifetime,
so if you will, I mean, think about the notion what a lifetime -- what an
incredible lifetime that was and how much the world changed.  And guess
what?  It's going to change for us, too.  Now, to give you a sense of how
-- in Deming's personal life, one lifetime, let's take a look at the spirit
of flight, and look from the Wright brothers to the space shuttle, all of
which occurred in Deming's lifetime.
<P>

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not
because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will
serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because
that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone, and one we intend to win.
<PRE>

>> look at the sand! Man! [cheering and applause]

</pre>
All of that is in one man, one lifetime.  Now, which then leads you to ask
about your own lifetime.  You see, one of the great failures of the
counterculture and one of the places where it broke with the American
tradition, if you remember the thesis I've been developing that you've had
a continuous American pattern of cultural thought up to 1965, then you had
a discontinuity, a breakdown, and we are now beginning to reassert
traditional American Civilization.
<P>
One of the problems you're going to see is the way in which -- and just
think about all the news stories you see and all the analysis you see which
is static, and let me show you how it works.  The current counterculture
view of technology is from us to the past.  Okay? So everything is
described as though the present is the end of history.  In fact, the term
"history," history means that's past, but so that, for example, my favorite
line was a woman who wrote Wernher von Braun during the effort to get to
the moon, and he was the head of the program at Redstone arsenal over in
Huntsville, Alabama, and she wrote him and she said, "you know, you
shouldn't try to go to the moon.  "you're breaking God's will.  "why don't
you stay home and watch color television the way God intended?"  Because
wherever we are now is stasis.
<P>
Now, there's a very different way to think of it, and this is the way I
think -- this is one of the things which has made American history, I
think, remarkable, and it's a much more accurate view of technology.
Notice where it puts you.  The reason you study the past is to learn the
future.  You're in the middle.  So not only do you look at Edison, but you
say:  okay, where are the Edisons of 1995?  Where are the Wright brothers
of 1995?  Where is the -- what's our generation's equivalent of the Apollo
program to get to the moon?  So you're constantly seeing yourself in a
continuum where on the one side is the past, on the other side is the
future, you're in the middle, but it's a dynamic environment, because you
always have this opportunity to invent the future.
<P>
And let me put it in actual terms.  Take Deming's lifetime, 1900 to 1994.
Imagine that a child was born last year and lived to be Deming's age, 2088.
A way of illustrating that would be to do this.  This is the amount of
change in Deming's lifetime.
<P>
So you can make one of two assumptions.  The Toffler assumption is change
is accelerating.  Now, if you think change is accelerating, let's say
there's going to be twice as much change in the next lifetime.  If that's
true, then this would be the amount of change that the child born last year
will live through.  Now, when you start describing:  what does lifetime
learning mean, what should you prepare your life for, how will you earn a
living?
<P>
I mean, can you imagine in 1900 saying to somebody that "by the time you're
27 or 28, you can go to work for eastern airlines"?  "by the time you're
45, you can be flying routinely as a transcontinental pilot."  In 1900,
they hadn't invented the car -- I mean, they, hadn't invented the airplane
yet.  I mean, imagine you'd said to somebody born in 1920, the year that
the -- the year before the first commercial radio station, KDKA in
Pittsburgh, opened up, what if you'd said to them, you know, "you're now 3
years old.  "you could have a future in television"?  Which would have
been, by the way, about right.
<P>
That's -- do you all see what I'm talking about?  It's a dynamic.  It's not
a static.  It's not past.  You look to the past in order to create the
future.  And you're always constantly saying to yourself:  wow, what comes
next?  I mean, how can you be a pessimist?  If you think about all the
breakthroughs of his -- of Deming's lifetime, which would be a great paper.
I mean, the discovery of Penicillin, the invention of the Polio vaccine,
or the discovery of the Polio vaccine, the inventions of new kinds of
surgery, the development of the Cathode Ray Tube -- I mean, of cat scans.
The development of all sorts of things that will -- remember, x-rays were
invented when Deming was already a mature adult.
<P>
Now x-rays are something you get routinely when you go to the dentist.  I
mean, x-rays were very expensive in Texas in 1948.  I talked to a doctor
who brought the first x-ray to Dallas.  It was a big deal.  If we'd had the
modern government controls, they probably would have only had three there
today because it was expensive and it was new.
<P>
Now, one of the people who's trying to say to us, "be optimistic, be
aggressive, be risk-taking, the world is changing," is George Gilder.  And
I want you to look just for a minute at Glider's very, very optimistic
vision of the future, and then I want to share with you very briefly a
point that Gilder makes about how big the change is going to be.

<P>
In the next decade, it's going to be possible to put a billion transistors
on a single sliver of silicon.  That will be shortly after the turn of the
century.  A billion transistors is equivalent to 16 Cray Ymp supercomputers
that would cost some $320 million to buy today.
<PRE>
>> that's extraordinary.

>> that kind of computer power will be manufacturable for less than $100
>>shortly after the turn of the century.  That means approximately a
>>million-fold rise in the cost effectiveness of computing hardware.  I
>>think that during the next decade, the most pervasive personal computer
>>will be a digital cellular phone.  It will be as mobile as your watch, it
>>will be as personal as your wallet, it will recognize speech, it will
>>navigate streets, I will collect your mail, collect your paycheck.  It
>>will be a large variety of wireless devices that will transform America.
>>It will also collect your news, in all likelihood.  I think that what
>>they can expect in the future is that this industry will solve a lot of
>>the most crucial problems that Americans face.
</pre>
For example, the home life.  I mean, what the computer allows connected to
fiber optic networks is a return to the home.  The home can become the
center of production in the society again.  Each person with a personal
computer can command the creative power of a factory tycoon of the previous
era and the communications power of a broadcast executive. It empowers
people.
<P>

Gilder is one of the great writers of modern times.  His book on wealth and
poverty is maybe the classic modern restatement of entrepreneurial free
enterprise.  This is "Microcosm," and if you want to pursue just the scale
of the ideas, the sense of how big the change is going to be, just in one
area, remember that there are other areas, like biotechnology, the DNA
revolution, that are equally powerful, but he does a neat thing.
<P>
He quotes from people.  This is from Carver Meade.  "listen to the
technology and find out what it is telling you."  Let me explain to you
about this notion of you let the technology draw you forward, let the
technology tell you what you're doing.  He then has -- and I'm quoting him
from.  Page 61, he quotes Victor Hugh go in "Les Miserables":  "the common
sand that you tread under foot, let it be cast into the furnace to boil and
melt, and it will become a crystal as splendid as that through which
Galileo and Newton discovered the stars."  That is, the sand can be
converted into fine crystal and into telescopes and other things.  What
else is sand converted into?  Computer chips.
<P><PRE>

>>Baptiste say basically argues that supply creates demand.  See, no modern
>>bureaucrat can understand this.  Say's law is -- s-a-y, just like it
>>sounds -- that supply creates demand.
</pre>
Now, a modern economist, because all modern government economists start,
and all -- virtually all bureaucrats and academics start with the idea of
continuities, so if you're going to measure demand, the demand is for
postal service.  Then you say:  somebody invented the fax.  But there was
no demand for the fax.  Because nobody knew it existed.  The second they
learned it existed, guess what?  There is huge demand for the fax.  Huh?
Now it's e-mail. Cellular telephones.  There were no cellular telephones.
People had very expensive radio telephones which only very, very wealthy
people or government institutions could afford, and then one morning
somebody invented the cellular phone.
<P>
How many of you have a cellular phone?  Look at this.  I mean, what a --
now, granted, you're an upper middle-class group of people and you're all
sort of semi-wealthy, at least by the standards of Bangladesh, but, you
know, you look around, there are 20 -- I think the number now is 25 million
people use cellular phones. 10% of the country has a cellular phone.  It
will probably be 40% by the end of the decade, and it's routine, right?  I
mean, there are now billboards telling you how to order your domino's or
your pizza hut on the way home so it will be there by the time you are.  I
mean, just think about that concept.  I mean, home delivery pizza was an
invention which promptly found a demand.
<P>
It's very important.  If the concept is that -- and this is why all modern
liberal economics is essentially wrong.  I mean, if the concept is supply
precedes demand, then what you want to do is maximize the number of
inventors.  If the idea is that demand is a limited thing, what you want to
do is what the federal reserve does, which is control demand.  But, in
fact, if you are an entrepreneurial, "spirit of invention and discovery"
oriented society, you never worry about it, because you figure out people
will come along and invent the next phase of winning.  Microwave ovens,
which are now invaluable.
<PRE>
>> could it also, though, be argued that there was already a demand for
>>communication?  There was already a demand.

>> sure.  There's a demand for eating, but that doesn't mean you can say
>>that therefore, we'll have a microwave.

>> well, I understand that, but as far as the supply meeting the demand --

>> No, of course, of course.  I mean, if you were to produce a supply of
>>something humans had no use of, it would sit in a warehouse.  So
>>obviously, lots of things are invented that don't create demand.  But
>>there's a very important question: which comes first?  And you'll find
>>that in all the big breakthroughs, it is the supply which precedes the
>>demand, so it's not just you've studied the market.  You have a vision of
>>the future.  You have a vision of what humans like.  You have a vision of
>>what they need.
</pre>
Now, let me give you an example out of the counterculture of how different
it is.  I think of it as imagine that Thomas Edison invented the electric
light today in the age of the counterculture.  I think it would be reported
on the evening news in a story which began, "the candlemaking industry was
threatened today."  Okay?  Or imagine the Wright brothers going into EPA
and OSHA to get permission to try to fly at Kitty Hawk?
<P>
Have you ever thought about what it would have been like, you know, having
to do the surveys, having  to -- you know, how unlikely it would be that
they'd ever get around to doing it? What I'm trying to suggest to you here
is that invention and discovery are a matter of mind, that they are a way
of life. That, in fact, people -- you have to think about the eccentricity,
the energy, the spirit, the attitude that led to this.
<P>
One of the really superb works on this is Peter Collier and David Horowitz,
their biography of the  Fords.  This is quite a remarkable book, and I want
to just share with you a couple of quick examples from the history of Henry
Ford.  This is the prologue:  "Detroit, June 4th, 1896.  "it was after
midnight when a light summer mist started to fall outside the backyard
workshop and Henry Ford began putting the final touches on the
peculiar-looking machine which had obsessed him in one form or another all
his adult life."  Remember, this is June 4th, 1896. "on most other
evenings, Felix Julian, the old man who lived in the flat next door to the
Fords and had cleared out his half of the shed to give the machine more
space to grow, would have been there too, sitting in a corner of the shed,
watching the painstaking assembly in silent awe.  "in fact,  Ford had often
arrived home from his daytime job" -- compare that to the modern world.  He
worked all day -- "his daytime job as chief mechanic at Detroit's Edison
illuminating company, to find Julian sitting alone in the shadows staring
at the odd contraption slowly taking shape, impatient for him to hurry
through dinner and get to work. "But now on this night of nights, the old
man had unaccountably decided to go to bed early, and so he missed the last
act of the great drama.  "It was almost 2:00 AM. When henry and his friend,
Jim Bishop, finished work.  "although he was haggard from having gone two
nights without sleep,  Ford's recessed gray eyes flashed with excitement.
"his invention was finally ready for a test, but as he began to maneuver it
toward the door, there was a revelation of the myopia everyone who knew him
accepted as a paradoxical part of his visionary nature:  the machine was
too big to fit through the doors of the shop."
<P>
How would you like to have the modern media covering live this
self-proclaimed genius's failure to measure his car?  Can you imagine the
ridicule he would have faced?  And notice again, he didn't apply for a
government grant.  He didn't say, "I can't invent unless you subsidize me."
He worked all day to go home and work all night. "without hesitating,
Ford seized a maul and began to knock out an opening in the brick walls.
"Henry rolled the vehicle he later referred to as the baby carriage, a
light chassis on four bicycle wheels, out into the night.  "the metaphor
came naturally.  "it was as if the womb of his creativity, gravid since
boyhood, was finally opening.  "
<P>
Ford would tell what happened next thousands of times in the coming years,
never tiring of the repetition, always speaking in the tones of wonderment
most men use to describe the birth of their first born.  "as it became worn
smooth with frequent retelling, the story eventually came to have the
understated simplicity of a creation myth.  "quote, it was raining.  "Mrs.
Ford threw a cloak over her shoulders and came outside.  "Mr.. Bishop had
his bicycle ready to ride ahead and warn drivers of horse-drawn vehicles,
if, indeed, there were any to be met at such an hour.  "I set the choke and
spun the flywheel, and as the motor roared and sputtered to life, I climbed
aboard and started off.  "the car bumped along the cobblestones of the
alley as Mr.. Bishop rode ahead on the bicycle to warn any horse-drawn
vehicles.  "we went down grand river avenue to Washington boulevard.  "then
the car stopped".
<P>
Again, imagine the modern media.  "we discovered that one of the igniters
had failed.  "when we had it repaired, we started the car again and drove
back home.  "both Mr.. Bishop and I went off to bed for a few winks of
sleep.  "then Mrs..  Ford served us breakfast, and off we went to work as
usual."  This is the beginning of the second largest industrial company in
the world, in his back yard, in a garage, in his spare time, after he works
all day.  He goes on to say, by the way, "the rest of the week,  Ford drove
all through Detroit.  Jim Bishop bicycled ahead of him as a flagman,
stopping at saloons and stores to tell people to come out and hold their
horses.  "one day, the little vehicle knocked a man down.  "by the time
Ford had turned off the engine and climbed down, the victim lay on the
ground caught between the front and rear wheels.  " Ford leaned over and
discussed the problem with him.  "should he start the engine again and
finish driving over him, or should he try to move the car?  "finally,
another man appeared and helped Ford pick up the quadricycle and move it
off the prostrate man, who stood up, dusted himself off, accepted  Ford's
apologies, and walked off, victim of the first recorded auto accident."

</pre>
Again, if you'd had a government study in 1899 of the most probable system
for propelling cars, it probably might well have come out steam.  It would
not necessarily have come out gasoline.  It was not obvious in 1899 that
gasoline worked.
<p>
There are a couple of other examples of this, though.  In 19 -and this is,
again, so hard to get across in the age of the welfare state and the
counterculture.  Success grows out of failure.  Remember the Edison point,
we've had 9,000 experiments that we now know don't work?  That's progress?
And think about the mindset.  "in 1900, 38 new companies began production.
"another 47 the following year, and 57 more in 1902.  "but others were
falling by the wayside.  27 companies failed in 1903, 37 more in 1904.
"already in the field were Franklin, Pierce, Locomobile, Packard, Stanley,
names to conjure with in the future.  "in 1903, a former carriage maker
named William Durant bought the Buick company and made it the centerpiece
in a grandiose plan to assemble the combine that would eventually become
General Motors.
<p>
"Ransom Olds," for whom Oldsmobiles are named, "stole a march on all the
producers with his vision of a cheap small car, the curved dash two-seater
Oldsmobile costing $650, including mudguards.  "a friendly and familiar car
of the sort that inspired popular songs.  "at this historic moment, Henry
continued to put his efforts into racing, hoping that a fast car would
attract potential investors."  Talks about how he built cars and he
actually won races, and that was the beginning.
<p>
So here's a guy who has to win a race to raise the money to create the
company which invents mass-produced automobiles, which lowers the price of
cars, popularizes the automobile across the entire planet, and invents the
modern automobile age.  And he begins working at night after working all
day in his garage. Compare that to the modern attitude:  if you don't
subsidize me, how can you expect me to do it?  If you don't loan me the
money, how can you expect me to do it?  It's exactly wrong and exactly not
the way the real world works.
<p>
Which gets me to the question I want to close with for this first hour:
how does a pro-invention and discovery way of life work?  That's what I
want you to think about for -- just ask yourself for a second.  I mean,
think about the stories we've heard so far about Edison, about Henry  Ford.
Think about the models we've looked at in terms of change.  What kind of
attitude would you have if this was a society that every morning decided
that we wanted all of our citizens to have a vision of themselves inventing
the future?  What would some of the characteristics be?  Ask yourself:  how
would you wake up?  How would you confront life?  What would your mood be?
What would you think like?  Not necessarily what would you think about.
<p><pre>
>> you'd want to get up in the morning.

>> yeah.  Huh?  You'd want to get up.  Now, again, psychologically, think
>>of the person on welfare who has all day long to invent the automobile,
>>but they have nothing to get up for, because we haven't found a way to
>>plant inside them this sense of wanting to get up.  Somebody said you'd
>>be optimistic. Of course you would.  9,000 down, 41,000 to go.  What a
>>great business.  You'd have a quest for knowledge.  Huh?

>> doesn't fear motivate sometimes?

>> sometimes.  What's a good example of fear?

>> hunger.  Afraid of --

>> hunger is a good example.

>> it is.  When you've got meals to put on the table --

>> that drives entrepreneurs.  Putting the meal on the table drives the
>>entrepreneur.  Show me a fear that would drive the inventor.

>> mortality.

>> mortality.  Can I discover a cure for cancer?  I mean, the number of
>>people who have a member of their family who get sick and that's why
>>they're research biologists.  Somebody who has a friend who goes blind,
>>and that's why they go to work on inventing a computer for the blind.  Or
>>somebody who has a friend who's in a car wreck, and that's why they go to
>>work to invent a better way to rehabilitate.  I mean, fear is a real
>>component. What other kinds of motivations?

>> curiosity.

>> that's right.  Curiosity.  I mean, a big motivation, we tend to be -- if
>>it's not beaten out of us, and the beating can be cultural.  One of the
>>great problems we have now in the inner city is that kids who do well are
>>often literally attacked by kids who aren't doing well.  So they're
>>psychologically under barrage.  I mean, you can beat out of people
>>healthy behaviors, but curiosity is a natural human behavior, it seems to
>>me, and it's one of the things that keeps me going, is I get up every
>>morning curious.  I'm just, you know, what will happen next?

>> looking for cookies.

>> looking for cookies.  I mean, since I'm psychologically 4
Years old and I'm always looking for cookies, you know, I wake up in the
morning and I think my aunts and my mother and grandmothers drilled into me
that there's always a cookie somewhere.  It's my variation on the old
Reagan story about the kid who was looking for the pony.  I mean, you know,
that I wake up in the morning and go:  not just cookies, but it will be
interesting.  A cookie will be under a dinosaur or something. We've got to
-- you know, so you know the cartoon about the kid who has the tiger?
What's the --

>> Calvin and Hobbes.

>> Yeah, Calvin -- I mean, my wife read one of those one day and said,
>>"okay, I get it" and handed it to me, because it was -they both become
>>-- they both had run back and they were being chased by a Tyrannosaurus
>>and they wererunning, that's how I live my life.  I'm permanently

>>and it's -- you know, and so -- one of my best friends said I was the
>>only person he knew who walked into rooms and he heard trumpets whether
>>there were any or not, and so you have there this that comes out of the
>>idea of:  wow, this will be exciting.
</pre>
But notice, see, in the modern age all too often, what we say to people is:
well, be practical.  Be reasonable.  Well, look at the people we're looking
at.  I mean, do you think -- can you imagine a modern therapist dealing
with Edison?  "this fruitcake thinks that 9,000 failures is a great start."
Or talking to Henry Ford.  "this guy is so incompetent, he can't even plan
a car small enough to get out of the garage."
<P>
I mean, he literally knocked down part of the wall of the garage.  That's
right.  I mean, he was not a young guy.  He was already on -- I mean, just
think about all the things that your vocational counselor at school would
tell you. "you really want to go off with your brother and fly what?"  I
mean, and this is my point:  there's a dull grayness in the counterculture
and the modern bureaucracy and the welfare state that says:  "oh, don't
break out.  "conform."  But out here -you can break out if you want to be
a performance artist doing something weird.  But don't break out if you
want to be an inventor, or a scientist or a discoverer.
<P>
But the great breakthroughs are out here.  They're the people who say:  I
think I'll be nutty for five years.  I think I'll just go and work on bread
mold, penicillin.  Or:  I think I'll go work on inventing an airplane
instead of just being a bicycle mechanic in Toledo. Or in Dayton, rather.
I mean, it's that -- it's that kind of thing.
<P>
So what I'm partly saying to you is almost all of the spirit of invention
and discovery is in our minds, and our minds are shaped by our culture, and
so the question is:  how do we -and we're going to come back to this in
the second hour -- how do we now come back and make American Civilization
healthy so that every child in America, male or female, any ethnic
background, could say:  I could be Edison, I could be Carnegie, I could be
the Wright brothers?  Because the real answer is:  why not?  If that's the
game you want to play, if it's the contribution you want to make, go for
it.  Have a great time.  Not guaranteed to succeed.  We're guaranteed the
right to pursue happiness.  And we'll pick this back up when we come back
in a few minutes.
<P>
(break)
<P>

We were just talking during the break about Thomas Edison and the fact that
companies were called, for example, Edison Electric.  He didn't own them.
But one of his major fights early on was Edison was a genuine populist.  He
wanted everybody to have access to power.  And so Edison insisted on
central generating stations so that everybody could have electricity.  One
of the arguments early on had been that -- by financiers that you could
have a very profitable company that just made individual generating
stations for factories and for rich people so that you would have bought
your own small generating plant.
<P>
And there was a very serious debate for a few years about which way to go.
And Edison was adamantly in favor of large central generating stations that
would allow how everybody to have access to electricity, and he was a
genuine populist.
<P>
Let me explain -- somebody asked me during the break what happened to some
of these attitudes and ideas?  Which I think if you were to look at America
from really its founding up through the beginning of the Depression,
clearly was a dominant attitude and remained, I think, the preeminent
attitude till 1965, gradually being undermined to some extent, but was in
many ways still the preeminent attitude until 1965, and then broke down.
<P>
And what I would suggest to you is that the spirit of invention and
discovery is undermined by seven welfare state cripplers of progress.
There are seven things the welfare state does to cripple progress:
credentialism, bureaucratism -- we're going to go back through these in a
minute -- taxation, litigation, centralization, an anti-progress cultural
attitude, and just plain ignorance.  Let me walk you through this for a
second.
<P>
The first is credentialism.  What did it take to be an inventor or a
discoverer?  It took inventing and discovering.  I mean, it's very
interesting that Bill Gates dropped out of college.  That the founder of
Apple Computers dropped out of college.  I mean, the fact is a lot of great
entrepreneurial inventors and discoverers just go do it.  I mentioned the
other week the author of "T-Rex," one of the leading dinosaur -vertebral
paleontologists in the country was a college dropout. But he -- but he's
interested in dinosaurs.  I mean, he wasn't interested in learning all the
other junk you have to get out. He was interested in learning about
dinosaurs which he learned a lot about, and he's now a world authority.
<P>
And the reason I start from here is that in an earlier era, if you could do
it -we had this discussion this week, in fact.  We had 10 street salvation
specialists.  These are people who help drug addicts, they help alcoholics,
they help prostitutes, they help teen gangs.  None of them have a college
degree.  Many of them are former addicts themselves.  And they were making
the point that in the modern bureaucratic age, they are being asked by the
government to hire somebody who has the right master's in social work, who
knows nothing about the street, because the people they are hiring are all
ex-addicts from the street who have no degrees.
<P>
So even though they're doing a wonderful job, they're saving people, and
they have much higher salvation rates in terms of drug addiction and
alcoholism than do the traditional government programs -- sometimes it's as
much as 10 times as high, but they don't have any degrees.
<P>
Therefore, they can't really be good people, so the state says we have to
hire somebody who has graduated from college, and this one guy said, "I
only hire drug addicts and street people."  So it's an interesting -- just
a very different kind of way of thinking about it.  Do you measure what
people can accomplish, or do you remember what papers -- what piece of
paper they have?
<P>
The second one is bureaucratism.  I started earlier telling you about -- I
want you to think now about the Wright brothers.  They walk into the
Environmental Protection Agency, Orville and Wilbur, and they say, "hi,
we're bicycle repair people in Ohio, and we want to fly an airplane, and
the best place to fly an airplane is on the Atlantic coast near Kitty Hawk
where there are big sand dunes and lots of wind."  Sand dunes?  Just
typical of those kind of Ohio industrial types, right?  Don't even care.
There's only about 1500 miles of sand dunes left.  And, of course, the
first key question: "have you done the endangered insect species form?"
<P>
You can imagine now these two bicycle mechanics, right?  "what endangered
insect?"  "well, you're going to have this plane, it's going to go through
the air, it's going to have a propeller, it's going to hit things.  "how
will you know whether or not you wipe out a species if you don't first
check to see if there's a species to be wiped out?"  You can imagine going
through all this stuff, right?
<P>
Then they walk down the hall to OSHA, the occupational safety and health
agency.  Have you ever seen the Wright brothers' original flyer which was
made of spruce and muslin?  It's very, very light.  One person lays down
flat.  The reason they had to find a windy hill was they couldn't get
enough power for it to fly if it flew -- this is how light it is and how
underpowered it is.  Can you imagine what it would have looked like if OSHA
had gotten done?  The sucker would never have worked.
<P>
So you couldn't have flown anyway.  You'd have had to take a train, unless
in the 1820s, George Stephenson, when he was inventing the rocket, which
was the first train, had had to walk into OSHA to get their approval for a
train.  Which would mean, of course, you'd ride in a stagecoach, unlessduri
ng the Assyrian era there had been an OSHA which had said, "wheels?  "you
want people to ride on wheels?  People should walk.  God wanted them to
walk."
<P>
Now, you may think I'm exaggerating.  I can find you books that literally
outline that kind of attitude.  So bureaucratism, the idea that filling out
the paperwork is more important.  Can you imagine filling out 50,000 failed
inventions, I mean, failed tests with Edison?  Can you imagine the
paperwork the modern government would want?
<P>
The third big problem is taxation.  Now, why is taxation a problem?
Because if the central government takes away from you the resources, if
Henry  Ford had to work so hard and had no money left after he got done
working, he couldn't have invented -- he couldn't have built his first car.
You have to have after-tax income in order to have the freedom to try to
do the things you want to do.  And if a government takes the tax money away
from you to give it to a bureaucrat, you've taken it away from the inventor
and the discoverer, and so you've actually lowered the amount of resources
available.
<P>
Litigation.  You know, we were kidding earlier, and several of you
spontaneously said, when I talked about Henry  Ford running over this guy
in the first week, you know, "where's the trial lawyer?"  But litigation's
a major problem.  Hi-tech companies will tell you that high taxes, raising
the cost of capital to build the next factory, and litigation, particularly
strike law firms that automatically sue them if their stock goes up or
down, automatically sues them, that those are two major impediments to
hi-tech companies in America today and that --
<PRE>
>> I'm sorry, you look at the current aviation industry, Terry and I both
>>can agree to that.  The current aviation industry is so saturated with
>>litigation --

>> yep.

>> -- about incompetent pilots getting killed because they flew an airplane
>>they shouldn't have been flying anyway.

>> aviation is just about extinct now.

>> That's right.  Litigation has driven the production of light aircraft
>>out of this country, to take an example.  So litigation's a major killer
>>of invention and discovery.
</PRE>
Centralization.  Because what happens in centralization? Remember I drew
earlier, it's a very important psychological model for you to think about.
The more centralized you are, the more decisions will be political and
obsolete.  In other words, the bigger the centralized system, if you have a
great idea out here but the decisions are made right here, and this is the
decision point, it's inside this huge bureaucracy, you've got to somehow
convince all of these layers of people that your nutty new idea is
workable.
<P>
Now, can you imagine going to a modern bureaucrat in a big-government,
centralized system?  This is also true, by the way, of big corporations.
It's why IBM didn't invent Microsoft, nor did it invent Apple.  It's why
General Motors for a while was too slow to understand what was happening
with Japanese cars, because when you're a big enough system, you can
protect yourself by staying inside the system, even if you're wrong.
<P>
Remember we talked about this last week.  Well, if you're -- what you're
trying to do, imagine the year the iron lung industry and Jones Salk shows
up and says, "I have this great new idea.  "let's eliminate iron lungs.
"we'll just have a vaccine, and nobody will get Polio."  Is that a good
idea or a bad idea? Do you want to encourage the end of your industry, or
are you really busy working on project 12, which is right here, which is
the better, more portable iron lung, the aluminum lung?  Which one are you
going to invest in?  So what you want is a society with many, many small
institutions.
<P>
Now, another big problem is the anti-progress cultural attitude.  You were
laughing about when I said the modern TV would report Edison's invention as
a negative, but isn't that exactly what happens?  The O.J.. Simpson trial
is big news.  The breakthroughs in genetic biology liberating the age of
molecular medicine and saving people with fundamental genetic defects
doesn't get page one very often, and -- you know, and the news media can
say, "well, that's because they don't read it."
<P>
Part of the reason they don't read it is because we don't report it.
Remember, supply leads to demand, and that's part of why:  what's the
public reaction?  You get Internet, you get talk radio, you get efforts.
But because we've had such a deep anti-progress cultural attitude, I mean,
"progress" was not even a word you were allowed to use for a while.  It was
-- you know, it was like, you know, you must be some kind of romantic, you
know, highly self-deceptive person if you actually think human beings can
have progress.  And there was a period there when everything was terrible.
<P>

We talked about nihilism.  I mean, you listen to some of the rock music in
periods when there's a sense that there is no future, that it's not going
to be any better.  Meanwhile, all around us there's scientists and
engineers and naturalists who are discovering and inventing a lot of
things.
<P>
The final one, though, is just plain ignorance.  The fact is, if you don't
teach how to think scientifically and you don't think how to be a creator
-- I mean, you don't teach how to be a creator and you don't teach how to
discover, you don't teach how to explore, it shouldn't shock you that
people can't do it.
<P>
It's a very major problem that we tend to consistently score 14th or worse
in science and math.  Because it means we don't have a basic -- we don't
have the alphabet.  We don't have the basic principles of being able to
operate in a world in which science is important and which learning is
important.
<P>
And in the 19th century, people like Edison, Carnegie, the Wright brothers,
Henry  Ford, all got a basic education, some of them by the 8th grade.  It
was sufficiently powerful that it carried them the rest of their lives.  We
now have some people who get through two years of college and are still
illiterate.  I mean, just a totally different attitude towards what real
learning means, what you have to master in order to be effective.
<P>
Now, this does not mean, by the way, that I'm against government.  I would
say just the opposite.  That government can play a powerful role in basic
research and development, as long as it's willing to get -- get it out of
the bureaucracy.  If you go back and look at Powell's great trip down the
grand canyon on the Colorado, which is one of the great journeys of
discovery in American history, it was a government expedition.  It was the
U.S. Geological survey.  If you go look at Lewis and Clark reaching the
pacific, that was a government expedition.  If you look at the Apollo
program, the fact is, much of the progress on the airplane and the computer
chip are financed by the government.
<P>
But the trick is to get it out of this big system over here as a
freestanding, small project.  You cannot successfully make big
breakthroughs.  You can have resources leave here, the big central system,
and go to a point where somebody's doing something interesting, but if you
keep the resources in here, if you tie them up in bureaucracy, you will
guarantee that you'll get very, very minimal progress at very big expense.
Now, government can do selected big projects well, again, if they're off to
one side.
<P>
So let me draw two distinctions here.  Government can do basic research and
development, or government can come out here and set up the Apollo project.
Remember, NASA was brand new.  They built it up, they did it, and if they
disbanded it at that point, I think they'd have been better off.  And said,
"okay, now what's our next project?"  So you build a project team, you get
the job done, and you close it down and start a new project team.
<P>
Because if you keep the people there, they become obsolescent and they
become bureaucratic.  And what you're looking for, remember, is not
incremental change.  You're not looking for a slow, gradual change.  You're
looking for the breakthroughs.  How do we manage -- what is it that's worth
doing that's big?  Now, big projects must be focused, lean, and tightly
managed.
<P>
We're going to look at the Skunk Works at Lockheed as an example, but it's
a very important concept that they have to be focused, you have to know --
you know, in other words, why are we setting up this agency?  To accomplish
"x."  Not to do 12 things.  To do one thing.  It's got to be lean, and
you'll see what I mean by "lean" in just a minute.  Very few people.  And
you've got to have very tight management.  The fewest people possible
working as well as they can, getting it done, and then getting it over
with.
<P>
Now, I want you to look at Kelly Johnson, who's the father of the Skunk
Works, who is, in a sense, to aviation sort of the Thomas Edison of modern
aviation.  Let's take a look at Kelly Johnson.
<P>
Lockheed was already swamped in terms of manpower, tooling, and facilities
with wartime contracts.  But this was a blessing in disguise, an
opportunity to implement an idea he'd been pestering Robert Gross about for
years.  Let him round up a small group of talented people, designers,
engineers, and shopmen, put them under one roof where they could all work
closely together, and give him complete authority over everything from
procurement to flight test.  With no other options, Gross said, "go ahead."
Stealing people from around the plant, just 28 engineers including himself
and 105 shopmen, he also built a small facility out of discarded shipping
crates, using a circus tent for a roof.
<P>
On June 19th, he laid down the principles under which the project would
operate.  In one and a half pages now preserved on old photostats, it
formed the basis for how he'd try to operate for the next 30 years.  He'd
be responsible for all decisions. Paperwork and red tape would be cut to
the minimum.  Each engineer would be designer, shop contact, parts chaser,
and mechanic, and each would remain within a stone's throw of the shop at
all times.
<P>
There'd be but one object:  to get a good airplane built on time.  He'd
promised the airplane in 180 days. As would become his custom, he gave his
men 150.  The clock started ticking on June 23rd.  Remarkably, the
completed aircraft arrived at Muroc on November 14th, just 143 days after
start-up. When he retired in 1975, Kelly Johnson had been on the cutting
edge of an advance from 200 to more than 2,000 miles per hour. He'd been
involved in the design of 44 different airplanes, many of them among the
classics of aviation history.
<P>
And at the time, he was still looking very much into the future.  He'd
gotten the Skunk Works into a project which would bear fruit in the
F-117-A, the world's first true stealth aircraft.  What was his secret?
Well, he had a remarkable capacity to take a complex problem, reduce it to
its simplest components, and then take the most direct and sensible
approach to its solution.  Always a maverick, he was smart enough and tough
enough not to follow the committee rule of conventional wisdom.  This gave
him remarkable freedom. With that freedom came a tremendous burden of
responsibility.
<P>
Finally, and most important, he understood himself well enough to realize
that with a few good people, you can do remarkable things.  Kelly Johnson's
greatest legacy wasn't just what he did, but the way he did it.
<P>
Let me give you a couple of quick examples of the Skunk Work rules, because
this is what we ought to apply across the whole culture, I mean, to the
federal government, to state governments, to private business, to
universities.  "first, the Skunk Works manager must be delegated
practically complete control of his program in all aspects, complete
control.  "second, strong but small project offices must be provided by
both the military and industry.  "third, the number of people having any
connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner.
Use a small number of good people, 10% to 25%, compared to the so-called
normal system."
<P>
Now, I just want you to think about that.  This guy's saying:  you take
whatever a normal college administration is, cut it by -- cut it to 10 to
25%.  Take a normal government bureaucracy, cut it tono more than 10 to
25%. "a very simple drawing and release system with great flexibility for
making changes must be provided.  "there must be a minimum number of
reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.  "there
must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and
committed, but also projected cost to the conclusion of the program.
"don't have the books 90 days late, and don't surprise the customers with
sudden overruns. "the contractor must be delegated and must assume more
than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids or subcontract on the
project.  "commercial bid procedures are very often better than military
ones".
<P>
We could save, I believe, 20 to 40% of the Pentagon just by applying the
Skunk Work rules to military procurement across the board.  20 to 40% on
big projects.  "the inspection system:  push more basic inspection
responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors.  "don't duplicate so
much inspection.  "the contractor must be delegated the authority to test
his final product in flight.  "he can and must test it in the initial
stages.  "if he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other
vehicles."  Johnson required that he fly the aircraft so that he would have
the feeling.  You go through the whole thing.  "funding a program must be
timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to
support government projects.  "there must be mutual trust between the
military project organization and the contractor, with very close
cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis.  "this cuts down
misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum. "access by
outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled, and
because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas,
ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay, not based on the
number of personnel supervised."
<P>
So there's not an incentive to have more people under you so you get a
higher salary.  You get a higher salary for doing the job.  Very different
model from most modern bureaucracies.  This is what Tom Peters in "the
Heart and Soul of Excellence" said about Kelly Johnson:  "Kelly Johnson was
responsible for about one-third of what flies in the sky today. "right
after World War II, he developed the first of the military jets, the f-80.
"subsequently he developed the F-104, the C-130, the U-2, the SR-71, to
name only a few.  "at one time, Kelly took an ailing satellite program,
which was behind schedule by three years and was 700% over budget.  "it
had, in just one part of the
Program, 1271 inspectors.  "for all this, its successful launch rate was 12
and a half percent.  "Johnson reduced the number of inspectors from 1271 to
35.  "getting the project back on schedule" -- "got the project back on
schedule, began operating below budget, and increased the successful launch
rate from 12 and a half percent to 98%.
<P>
"At one point, the Air Force sent a team to consult with Kelly as they were
working on a project which was equal in magnitude and complexity to a
project he was working on.  "the Air Force was four years behind schedule,
700% above budget, and had 3750 people working on it.  "Kelly Johnson's
project was on schedule, slightly under budget, and had 126 people working
on it."
<P>
Just think about that number, 3750 to 126.  The name "Skunk Works" was
taken from the Li'l Abner comic strip and refers to a half-licit,
half-illicit innovative activity operating on the periphery of an
organization.  I think the Skunk Works was actually a still, wasn't it, in
Li'l Abner?
<P>
The point is that there is a style here.  There's a way -- it's not just
that Johnson's an individual genius.  It's a way of cutting through the
baloney, eliminating the layers of bureaucracy, focusing responsibility,
hiring a very few people who are very good and letting them do the job, and
then holding them accountable for how they function so that they invest
themselves in getting the job done.
<P>
This is part of why I think you can really think about a dramatically
smaller system, is because when you look at what really works, it's very
small. It's not some huge, complicated bureaucracy.  It's a very flat
hierarchy, with relatively few people.
<P>
Now, what you have to ask yourself about the future is:  how much has
changed and how much will change?  And this is part of the point of
Toffler's concept of the Third Wave of change, because the truth is, if you
look at how much has changed in the 20th century, it's amazing.  I mean, if
you could go back to 1900 and show them a hologram and a videotape in color
of everything that will happen in the 20th century, they'd be astonished.
Well, guess what?  More's going to happen in the next century.  Change is
accelerating.  It's not even staying level.  It is accelerating.  There's
no question change is accelerating.  I mean, whether or not  it accelerates
in the U.S. Is -- I mean, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Germans, the
Brazilians, the Indians, the second largest center of software in the world
is Madras, India.  Change is coming.  The only question is whether or not
America is going to be part of it, but the changes are coming.
<P>
Now, in that framework, I would suggest to you that every citizen must know
the basics of science and technology.  And one of the things we have to
have, I think, in our generation is both a re-establishment, a reassertion,
of what the minimums are that you need to know about science and technology
to be functional, and I think we need to say that we are committed to going
back and, in a sense, retrofitting adults.
<P>
I mean, how do we make it possible for adults to learn the basics if they
didn't get it during school?  This idea that we'll now teach this
generation of second graders and 40 years from now we'll get there is
nonsense.  We've got to find a way to make it relatively easy and
relatively accessible for every citizen to learn things.  In addition,
we've got to change the game so that every citizen learns to be problem
solving, solution oriented, persistent, and strategically optimistic.
<P>
Now, I say strategically optimistic for a second, because I don't think you
get up in the morning and go, "wow, everything will work well." But you get
up in the morning and you say, "if the tire's flat, I'll fix it."  "if the
car is not working, I'll fix it."  "if I haven't quite solved, you know" --
"if I'm losing hearing, I'll learn how to adjust or I'll get a hearing
aid."
<P>
I mean, the whole notion that when you're faced with a problem, your first
reaction is to start hunting for the solution is very different than the
current system, where your first reaction is to relax and feel like you're
a victim.  It's a very different model.  And I talked about specific skills
here: problem solving, you've got to start -- these are habits.  You
practice solving problems, you learn how to do it.  Automatically being
solution oriented, which, by the way, means you have to be persistent,
because the truth is, it's hard.
<P>
I mean, every time we say to people, "we can give you an easy solution," we
actually weaken them.  Which is why persistence matters.  If you teach
people to be persistent -- and again, Edison has probably -- I mean, we
don't expect people to try 50,000 times.  But how about five?  I mean, this
is a society where one is seen as an imposition.  "you really want me to do
that?"  I mean, "I should actually do my homework?"  "I should actually
study?"  "you want me to save?"
<P>
Now, in that framework, I think we've also got to recognize that we are now
faced in a way no other society ever has been with lifetime learning.  And
I think lifetime learning is very, very important.
<P>
Every citizen must know how to learn new things as requirements and reality
change.  And we may -- and again, this doesn't require going back to
school.  It requires saying in the mass media over and over and over again:
you ought to plan to learn all of your life.  And there are lots of ways
to learn.  You can go to seminars, you can go to school, you can get audio
tapes, you can get videotapes, you can check out books, you can play with
the Internet, but if you aren't learning something every day, you don't get
it, and this has to become almost a requirement of citizenship in our
culture.
<P>
That we expect every American to learn every day, and so you ought to just
relax and accept it.  This is part of what being an American in the 21st
century will mean.  We also need, I think, to recognize what we mean by the
spirit of invention and discovery.  That is, a learning, attitude,
perseverance, hard work and enthusiasm, that they are the keys to invention
and discovery.
<P>
That's why we talk about the spirit of invention and discovery.  You've got
to have these attitudes in your head.  You've got to be willing to get up
and do it.  Again, I mean, can you imagine saying to the typical teenager
today:  you want to be as famous as Henry  Ford?  Well, so what did you do
after your job?  You have all summer long.
<P>
I mean, it's part of why I'm somewhat resistant at times to midnight
basketball.  Not because I'm opposed to midnight basketball as something to
do if you've already done everything else, but because I'm opposed to the
idea that as a culture we would send a signal that instead of working hard,
instead of studying hard, instead of, you know, going out and inventing
your generation's version of the car, that recreation somehow is, in and of
itself, a replacement for these other things.  It keeps them busy.
<P>
And again, we're going to get to this when we talk about replacing the
culture of poverty, but remember, the original midnight basketball was set
up by the Salvation Army to attract people there doing what they currently
do in order to save them and change their lives so they would do something
different.  It wasn't a maintenance program.
<P>
Now, I mean, if you say, "we're going to have this great midnight
basketball league, and by the way, we're also going to read books and look
at useful educational films and do other things,"  then I'd say:  okay, now
I get it.  You're using their current behavior to draw them in to change
their behavior.  Yeah, if it's a stepping stone, it's good.  If it's a
stopping place, it is exactly the wrong signal. And again, I'm not talking
about the people who already work, you know, 12 hours a day and they want
to go play midnight basketball because they need physical recreation and
they need mentally to re-create.  That's what "recreation" means.  But in
order to need to re-create, you need to do something first.
<P><PRE>
>> you can't re-create unless you've created.

>> Right.  So, I mean, I'm as interested in:  what are you doing to create,
>>and how do we get you to that point?  I also think that it's very
>>important to have the old Reagan line:  you ain't seen nothing yet, or
>>the notion that the adventure is only beginning.  And I think this is,
>>frankly, one of the reasons that the "Star Trek" series has been
>>successful.
</pre>
And the "Star Trek" series, I think, was a great shock because it didn't
fit any of the elite culture's views when it first came out.  It only ran,
you know, for four years, and then -- but it wouldn't die.  I mean, it just
kept hanging around.  I think part of the reason is that in American
society, there is this innate sense of:  the adventure's just beginning.
What's going to happen next?  Where are we going to go next?  And that's a
very deep part of how we operate and of what we look for.  At a vision
level, what I'm suggesting is that we want to have a pro-spirit of
invention and discovery America creating a better future through better
ideas.
<P>
And we want this to be an active, positive commitment, where our attitude
is, when we bounce into a problem, "wow, an opportunity to have better
ideas.  "I wonder what we should do to solve this one?"  Which, if you
think about the tone, is a totally different tone and is an energy-creating
tone.  I mean, if being hungry is an excuse to bake a cake, that's a
totally different thing than being hungry being an excuse to sit and whine.
One depresses the energy level, the other increases the energy level.
<P>
Now, there's a book on it called "Learned Optimism" which argues that
leaders consciously know how to increase the energy level by deliberately
being optimistic.  In addition, let me suggest to you that we ought to have
a vision that the goal of a free society is not an American dream.  It is
to have 260 million Americans dreaming.  I mean, the whole neat thing about
being an American is that each of us gets to pursue happiness.  Each of us
gets to go out and define who we are and what our future is.
<P>
There's not "the American dream."  Rather, there are 260 million Americans,
and the truth is, how many of you've had several dreams already in your
life, where you thought you were going one way and now you've gone a
different way?  Seriously, raise your hand.  How many of you found -- okay,
so the 260 million Americans dreaming, that's why we didn't say there are
260 million American dreams, because any individual American might have
multiple dreams, right?
<P>
I mean, I want to be a dinosaur collector, I want to be a zookeeper, you
know.  I have five or 10 other things I won't bore you with right now, at
least three of which my wife will shoot me if I say in public.  But the
whole point is that people are allowed to -- and particularly if we're
going to live to be 90 or 100.  I mean, why not go for it?  Have three or
four or five dreams in your lifetime?
<P>
Now, if that's our vision level, it seems to me our strategies ought to be
to have big goals, to have a cultural change in attitude and understanding,
to rethink government so it encourages the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And to have changes in learning, a pro-invention, pro-discovery
tax code, set up prizes, set up x-projects, have a common-sense legal
system, encourage small business, and encourage genius.
<P>
Now, this is a lot, so let me just walk you through some examples, but
you'll see how some of them fit together.  First of all, we ought to set
big goals for our generation.  I mean, I think we ought to certainly have a
permanent base on the moon in the next few years.  We ought to reduce the
cost of space travel to a point where it becomes a reasonable alternative
to a honeymoon at Disneyworld.  I think that we ought to certainly be on
Mars within 15 years, maybe less.
<P>
I think that we ought to design an information system in such that every
person who gets ill, if it's a serious illness, you can access through the
Internet all the current data on your disease so you can learn about your
problem, because you're going to study it a lot more than your doctor is.
I mean, just -- we ought to have a whole series.
<P>
We ought to have a lifetime learning system so that it's easy access for
every citizen, probably through the libraries rather than the schools.  So
we have -- so we don't have a teacher-dominated, bureaucratic, credentialed
model.  But where you can say, "I need to learn 'x.'  "I think I'll go
check it out."
<P>
We ought to have huge goals.  We ought to eliminate poverty in America by
being serious about reaching out to help the poor instead of just sending
them a check, and we ought to say: here's what it takes to eliminate
poverty in America.  You've got to be persistent, you've got to work hard,
you have a sense of the future.  I mean, these are -now, there will always
be a willful minority who say, "I don't want to."  Fine.  Those -- I mean,
you are in a free society allowed to not be part of the common culture.
But then we're going to say:  okay, that's your choice.  Now you have
consequences.  It's a very different model than the current model.
<P>
Now, so let's think about big projects.  You know, what if one of our big
goals was to find five Edisons in the next generation?  Think about what he
contributed.  If you had five in parallel each in their own zone playing
their own game?  Think of the -- in a sense, Bill Gates is like that, but
smaller than Edison.  I mean, Edison truly was a historic phenomenon, but
what would a society be like that encouraged that rather than discouraged
it?
<P>
Look at just the scale of change at the DNA revolution in health.  We're
entering the age of molecular medicine, but it's combined with an explosive
capacity to share the information through the computer system.  So
literally, it's conceivable in the next 10 or 15 years, if every citizen
could have access, it is conceivable that you'd have just a remarkably
different environment.  And that as each breakthrough is occurring, you
could be applying it in a very different style than we've ever thought
about in the modern age.  But there's no reason for doctors to have a
monopoly of knowledge.  It's just a question of how you want to organize
it.  Yes, sir.
<P><PRE>
>> although I have not read the article in this morning's
>>"Journal-Constitution," the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, is now on
>>the Internet, and one can access CDC research.

>> Which is good.  It's the beginning of the new way of doing things.  And
>>you can design expert systems where you literally enter it and it will
>>ask you questions and it walks you through a lot of self-diagnosis that
>>helps you begin to think about:  what do I want to do?  I'm just
>>suggesting it's a very -- I have several friends who are pretty
>>sophisticated whose children have very, very rare diseases.  They found
>>the right doctor somewhere on the planet because they went through all
>>the various libraries that are on line.  It's a totally different way of
>>thinking about what you are doing.  Now, and also, by the way, the
>>molecular -the age of molecular medicine is going to be as different
>>from what we do as what we do is from the 18th century use of leeches.
</pre>
I mean, you are not going to recognize medicine 30 years from now.  It's
going to be that big a change.  Now, notice also the DNA revolution in
agriculture.  Huge breakthroughs in productivity, in how long you can keep
things, in how you design things.  Consider the next phase of the
information revolution. Rising power, declining costs, worldwide networks,
and real-time information.
<P>
Nobody yet -- and this has been -- it's been fascinating to me, and people
like George Gilder come close, and Alvin and Heidi Toffler come close, but
nobody's yet quite been able to figure out how to describe the scale of
this revolution and how it will change us.  This is going to literally
bring to you -- remember what Gilder said.  You're going to carry a
cellular telephone, which is also your computer.  It may also be your
portable television.  It may also be your Walkman.  May also be your
checkbook.  I mean, you'll have all sorts of conveniences, many of which
did not exist 25, 30 years ago, in one hand-held device, and you'll be able
to -- you know, you'll access all your friends' telephone numbers, and you
can also then call them.
<P>
And in that kind of setting, have any of you noticed, there's one -- I
can't remember now which of the computer companies has a commercial on now
where the person is sitting at their computer console watching the
television and talking on the phone while typing simultaneously, and she
changes the price on the menu because she gets a good review in the local
TV, you know -- I mean, it's a great example.  Well, that's the beginning,
and it's going to be available to everybody.  And we don't have a clue yet
how that world's going to work.
<P>
But let me give you some examples, because it will change your life as
profoundly as the automobile liberated North Georgia.  Remember, back when
you had to use a horse and buggy, the reason county seats aren't very far
away is it took you all day to get there.  Now, in the length of time it
took your great-grandparents to ride in a buggy to the county seat, you can
drive across three states or you can fly across the whole country.  Well,
this is about to happen to information in a big way.
<P>
Some examples:  self-learning and distance learning.  Nobody's really
thought through yet.  We can liberate the smallest, most rural school in
America.  We can liberate the poorest child, and we can liberate the
busiest person.  I mean, people say, you know, welfare mothers have to stay
home and take care of the kids.  Fine.  Then let's build a learning module
so while the kids are asleep at 3:00 in the afternoon, the mother's
learning, but let's set standards of behavior.
<P>
Let's do something, but let's not say to people:  why don't you waste 20
years of your life?  Why don't you sit around and do nothing all day?  Soap
operas are fine.  I mean, why do we have so many people who watch soap
operas?  Partly because we've set a cultural standard that says:  killing
time's fine.  You're probably bored.  Why don't you watch soap operas.  If
instead we said:  why don't you take at least three hours a day to learn,
if we're going to pay you full-time to do nothing?
<P>
I feel the same way about unemployment compensation.  If you can't find a
job and we're going to give you money so you're being paid to not do
anything, then why don't you learn something 40 hours a week, and why don't
we make it freestanding and easy so it is self-learning, and if you want to
interface with somebody, why don't you just pick up your phone, turn on
your TV, you know, turn to cable channel 65, dial them up and you talk to
them direct then, and so you don't have to schedule:  when do I drive to
the campus to see the advisor?
<P>
None of this stuff's very far away, and some of it's actually happening all
across the country in pilot projects.  But it requires rethinking
institutionally how we function, and rethinking how we score things and how
we measure things.  It means you don't measure how many people are at
average daily -- average daily attendance, which is how schools get money.
You measure:  how much did your students learn this year?  I mean, right
now, if you have a big average daily attendance, even if nobody in the room
learned a thing, you get the cash.  Now, that's got to be about as dumb a
way to measure as you can get, and if you taught all them calculus in three
weeks, think of how much money you'd lose?  I mean, what's the incentive
plan for the school?  Keep them.  Don't let them get out.  You'll lose the
money.
<P><PRE>
>> in classes, like, in some schools, if you go to class all day, you can
>>exempt your final exams.

>> Uh-huh.  Because they made the money.  Think about it.  I mean, think
>>what the incentive systems work.  And what we ought to be doing is saying
>>to people:  you want to go to Panama city, Florida, and relax for five
>>days, but you're willing to guarantee you pass your chemistry exam?
>>Here's the material.  Now, you don't pass the chemistry exam, you're in
>>big trouble.  But it's a totally different way of organizing.  And it
>>also means you're 40 years old, you never did chemistry, you decided now
>>you need to know chemistry, here's the material.  And if you can only
>>study it on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings, fine, we don't care.
</pRE>
I mean, I was looking at some of Dr. Minnix's lectures, which I thought
were marvelous, on World War II.  I learned a bunch of stuff last night
just looking.  You know, we're at the point now where we can produce
materials that is freestanding sitting there, you pick it up, you don't
have to drive 55 miles to be at point "a" at 10:05 for 55 minutes.  We
could mail it to you or Fed Ex it or UPS or whatever.  It's a different way
of thinking. And then test:  did you learn it or not?  Which is a different
question than:  did you sit through it?  Similarly, self-health and
distance medical care.  Why shouldn't you be able to diagnose a lot of
things?  Why shouldn't you be able to simply, if you're in a rural area and
you need the best doctor in the  country -you know, the army's now working
on this.
<P>
They have a system which they call Jumping Echelons, where the field
hospital with the person with the unique injury skips every hospital in
between and goes back to Walter Reed or goes to the best brain surgeon in
America, and they in real-time look at the materials electronically, and
the field hospital is getting the best advice from the right specialist to
save the life of this young person. Why can't that be true everywhere in
America?
<P>
Now, it's a totally different model, it's a totally different way of
thinking about things.  But I'll give you the parallel example: how many of
you now pump gasoline for your own car?  Go back sometime -virtually all
of you raised your hand.  Go back sometime and read the arguments in the
late 1970s about why we could not allow self-service gasoline.  People
wouldn't be able to do it.  They'd spill gas all over.  There'd be a fire
hazard.  I mean, go back and read them sometime.  Trusting in people,
sharing information, broadening out the base of everybody having a chance
to play is very, very important.  Now, really radical idea, probably get in
trouble again, but I can't help --
<P><PRE>
>> sounds like it.

>> self-law.  If you and your spouse decide to get divorced, why do you
>>need a lawyer if you both agree?

>> because the state defines the marriage.

>> the state is, but why is the lawyer?

>> because you need a lawyer to discern what the legalese says.

>> why?  But that's because the way they write the legalese.

>> and because most people don't have access to that kind of information or
>>know how to find it.

>> you need a lawyer to fill out the paperwork.

>> right, but what if we organized a system that said:  here is your
>>self-enhanced guide to getting a divorce?

>> so what is their possible incentive to let go of that kind of control?

>> I didn't say the lawyers would like it.  I mean, you think the gas
>>station owners in the late '70s liked giving up full-service gasoline?

>> no.

>> right.  They lost.

>> right.

>> well, that's what life's about.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you
>>lose.  Imagine blacksmiths the first time a car came through.  I mean,
>>blacksmiths took it on the head.  Buggy whip manufacturers hated it.  Do
>>you know how seldom you ever see anybody using a buggy whip on a car?

>> I hate it when that happens.

>> I mean, just think about it.  My point is if we're talking about
>>self-learning, if we're talking about self-health, how many things that
>>are currently part of our legal system could, in fact, be done if you
>>built expert systems and you made it available and knowing adults read it
>>and said, "I am willing to sign a bond that I accept this.  "I don't want
>>to worry about a lawyer.  "I'll just bond that this is okay."  And how
>>many things could you do that on?  Simple wills?

>> courts don't allow that.

>> you can do that on your computer.

>> I do that myself anyway.

>> see?

>> I've done it several times, and it's not that hard.

>> yeah, but speaking of court actions, there have been time and time
>>again, and you can research this, where couples go in and they tell a
>>judge, "we've already got it worked out.  "just sign it.  It's written."
>>"no, you can't have it this way because the law says that you need to do
>>this and you need to do that."

>> no, no, no, you're talking about the world as it is today.
I'm talking about the world as it can be in the information age.

>> so how do you step from where we're at now to  where --

>> you do it over time.  You do it politically, you do it culturally.  You
>>teach courses.  Stay controversial.  You know, really, this is how you go
>>through an age of change.  I mean, you just -- first of all, you talk
>>about it.  Remember, supply leads to demand.  People suddenly go, "oh,
>>yeah, why can't I do that?" And you begin to say to people:  why
>>shouldn't you be allowed to have conflict resolution without a lawyer?
>>People start to go: oh, yeah.  Particularly since a lot of lawyers
>>actually make their living by increasing the conflict level.

>> we're already working with the helicopter, though.  We're taking a
>>television camera out, and our field medics can actually televise a
>>patient condition and a doctor doesn't have to --

>> right.  See, the real time and media capability in the field -- I mean,
>>you are a living example because of what you do with rescue medicine.
>>You're a living example of what I'm talking about.  That we're seeing
>>breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough.  Now, let me carry it
>>a stage further.  Public safety in the information age.  You have a
>>particularly dangerous store, you put a camera in it.  You have a
>>particularly dangerous street, you put a camera on it.  You release a
>>felon on parole, you put an ankle bracelet on them that is exactly the
>>way you used to track elk and bear and other things in biological
>>surveys.  You track them by computer, and if it turns out they happen to
>>be at the 7-eleven exactly at the time there was a -that there's a
>>robbery, you have a theory.

>> aren't we getting then towards Orwell's "1984"?

>> You are if you're a felon.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you are, in that sense,
>>in Orwell's -- you're always potentially in Orwell's "1984," because you
>>always have the potential power of the state to do that if you let them.
>>The question is -- I mean, the other option you can say to the felon is:
>>you don't want an ankle bracelet?  Fine.  Stay in jail.  But if we're
>>putting you out on parole and we know that 65% of the people we put out
>>on parole who were convicted of this particular kind of crime are likely
>>to do it again, why can't we protect ourselves?
</pre>
And the other option is just not let him out, which I'm equally willing to
do. Which, by the way, if you think about distance work as one reason
prisons ought to be made to pay for themselves.  I mean, prisoners ought to
work 48 hours a week and study 12 hours a week, and you'd have a different
world.  You'd also have a different prison, because they'd be busy 60 hours
a week.  Just a different system.
<P>
Okay.  Let me talk about another one where -and this is one, if I can
slightly cross the bridge to my other job, this is one where we first
started talking about three years ago, and I am really excited about this
particular one.  We have the potential in this information age with the
spirit of invention and discovery of fully enhancing the potential of every
challenged American.  Now, this one, to me, is really exciting. And we just
agreed at a meeting yesterday to set up a task force to do this.
<P>
I believe if you talk about the severely challenged, people who have
genetic problems, who have been in a wreck, people who are in wheelchairs,
people who are maybe born with down's syndrome or born with a variety of
problems, I believe we're on the edge of a revolution.  And part of what
we're going to do, and this is part of why I teach the course, and this is
one where I can actually tell you, we've now gone from idea to
conceptualizing it in more detail to beginning to move it into the
legislative process.
<P>
What we want to do is take this body of people and talk to the best
rehabilitation people in the country and the best technical people in the
country and say:  if we bring to bear all the computer revolution, all the
information revolution, all the DNA revolution, how can we improve their
lives?  And my theory is this, that when you talk about welfare, that there
are very different populations engaged.  And that for most Americans, this
goes back to Deming's notion that you have to start with a theory.
<P>
For most Americans, when they talk about wanting welfare reform, what
they're talking about is three groups:  those who are able but not willing,
those who are able but don't know how, and those who are truly challenged.
People with severe disabilities.  Now, I think for most Americans, you can
draw a very sharp line right here, and you can say:  for those who are able
but don't know how, we're going to massively invest in helping them get
across the line.  Most of that investment is spiritual.  This is where
we'll talk about later on when we get to this section of the course, Marvin
Olasky's great work "the Tragedy of American Compassion."
<P>
For folks who are able but genuinely not willing, this is what the
Victorians called "the Undeserving Poor."  In the 19th century in America,
if you were homeless, you could get lunch, but in order -- or a meal, but
in order to get a meal, you had to chop wood.  You chopped wood both for
yourself and for a widow.  That both gave you dignity and it proved that
you were willing.  If you weren't willing, they would resolutely refuse to
give you food.  They'd say:  no, we're not going to give you food.  Because
they had a profound sense that to give people who were not willing was to
subsidize their self-destruction.
<P>
Yeah, so think of this as subsidized self-destruction.  And, in fact, I had
a man the other day -- and we'll talk about this more  later -- who said
when -he had a friend -- he was at a press conference.  He had a friend
who was -- who got his first supplemental security income check just at
Christmas and was able to shift from drinking cheap wine to bourbon and had
a heart attack on the second bottle.  He said:  You and the government
killed him.  He said:  let me tell  you -he said let me tell you:  you
should not give money to people who are not able to govern their own lives,
because they destroy themselves.
<P>
This group, we want to reach out and say:  here's how you work, here's how
you learn, because they're really willing to, but they've had no
background, no cultural framework.
They've grown up in a culture of poverty and violence where they literally
don't know what to do.  But they're willing to do it if somehow it's not
200 families to one caseworker, it is one to one, or one to two, and we're
helping them learn these new habits.  This is actually very solvable.  But
this one's different.  Here what you want to do, I think, is you want to
invest in technology, in rehabilitation, and in maximizing opportunities.
And you want to say -- and this is almost case by case.  You want to say to
somebody who's going to spend their whole life in a wheelchair or somebody
who's born blind or somebody who has a particular problem of great
difficulty:  how do we maximize your chance to pursue happiness?
<P>
And I believe most Americans would, in fact, want to increase the resources
applied here, because all of us recognize that this is through no fault of
their own and that this could happen to any of us.  Any of us could have a
child that has a problem.  Any of us could have a relative.  Any of us
could have, you know, the Charles Krauthammer effect of diving into a
swimming pool and breaking your neck or being in a car wreck.  So here I
think we should actually increase resources, but in a very focused, very
spirit of invention and discovery kind of model.
<PRE>
>> and also, you never know what one might have to offer.

>> Yeah.  There's some very great creative people who come out of this

>>people will just stay at home and work.
</pre>
You'll see actually a substantial drop in the number of people who go to
work.  Not that they're not working, it's just that they get up and they go
into their office, which is in their house, or they go into a room in the
basement or they go across the street, but it's a totally different model,
and we have not thought very much.  If you had to spend the next billion
dollars on highways or on telecommuting, which would be better?  And, in
fact, the IRS has adopted exactly the wrong rule, because it has made it
harder to have a home office, not easier, okay?
<PRE>
>> but you can file your tax return electronically.

>> right.  Well, you can, but I met with them the other day. It's still not
>>as easy as it should be, and actually, we ought to let you have half the

>>within five years.  Today there's no value, yet you are saving the
>>government a lot of money, and it's more accurate, according to the
>>government.
</pre>
All right, as we look at the spirit of invention and discovery, remember,
we want to think through applying what's our vision of getting there, what
are our strategies for getting the culture to move in that direction, what
are the projects we want to use, and what are the tactics we want to use?
<P>
Now, as you go through that planning, remember that the next phase then is
you think you've gotten the breakthrough, you go out and you do what we're
going to do with disabilities, you start listening to people who are in the
situation, you try to learn from them, so they're telling you about their
world.  If you listen to them and learn from them, you can begin to help
them, and in a rational, healthy society, people who know that you'll
listen to them, learn from them, and help them want you to lead them.
<P>
I believe if we can  apply -- if we can begin to shift the entire culture
into a spirit of invention and discovery, we'll be shocked how big the
impact will be, we'll be shocked how much we invent, at how much we
discover, how much more dynamic we are, and how much progress we've made by
about 2020.  And so it has to be a culture-wide basic shift in attitude and
in approach.
<P>
Now, next week we're going to pick up pillar five, Quality, Customer
Orientation, Team Work, Continuous Improvement, Systems Analysis, and the
spirit of Edwards Deming, the man who taught the Japanese the concept of
quality.  I think you'll find it very useful.  Next week's reading, Kenneth
Delavigne and J. Daniel Robertson, "Deming's Profound Changes," Chapter 3.
And this is all being given out to you here.  Lloyd Dobyns and Clare Craw
Ford-Mason, "Thinking About Quality," Chapter 3.  And Peter Senge,

Participation," March 1992.

<h2>
The Telecommunications Act of 1996: Intent, Impact and Implications  
</h2>
by Dennis R. Patrick 



<p>

It is refreshing for me to be able to say exactly what I think, unconstrained

as I am by the burdens of chairing the FCC, the context in which I last

addressed some of these issues with some of you. I can remember only too well

my frustration at having to sit through the presentation of some blatantly

anti-competitive presentation calculated to promote the proponents business

interest over that of all competitors, and having to respond with something

like:  "You've raised some very important issues; Ill have the bureau look

at them carefully."

<p>

You should expect my responses these days to be slightly more pointed.

<p>

But before I get any more candid, let me add a quick disclaimer.  I speak

today as a former Chairman, as an individual and as an entrepreneur in this

industry.  As such, my comments reflect my own views only, and not those of

any other individual, institution, or company.  


<p>
Enough said, on to the assignment.  The intention of the Congress, viewing

the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as a whole, seems quite obvious:

<p>
<ul>
<li> To move as quickly as possible toward an open, competitive and largely

unregulated communications marketplace;


<li> replace the regulatory model with a competitive model as the lehead

mechanism for defining and protecting the public interest;

 
<li>To rid ourselves finally from all vestiges of the "public utility" or

"natural monopoly" concept as an intellectual model for thinking about the

industry; and,



<li> To unleash technology and entrepreneurialism so as to maximize consumer

lfare in ways we regulators (ex and otherwise) could never even imagine.<p>

</ul>

To be sure, the Congress has included within the legislation all the relevant

caveats and footnotes, some of which I will address later in my remarks.  But

even with those caveats, I read the bill as reflecting the broad intention I

just described.

<p>

<b>Implications for the Industry<p></b>



It has become almost a clich, certainly predictable, for speaker after

speaker in our industry to stand up and talk about the scope of the magnitude

of change, peppering his or her remarks with hackneyed phrases like

"Information Superhighway" and "Communications Revolution."

<p>

I'd love to take a contrarian position and tell you that nothing much is

going to happen.

<p>

But that would be wrong, so I can't.

<p>

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 represents a significant milestone.  It

announces that the Federal government is finally, largely, out of the way, or

at least headed in that direction.  It will usher in an era of radical

transformation in the industry the scope and import of which will make

divestiture  look like a footnote in history.

<p>

Make no mistake, this piece of legislation, while I cannot say that I agree

with every line, is a solid and positive step forward.  (Or should I say a

step back to the future.  You do recall that all aspects of the nascent

telecommunications industry were competitive between 1894 and 1907, including

local.)
<p>


Precisely because this Act is much overdue, I predict it will unleash a vast

restructuring of the industry.  It is as if we have removed two bricks from

the edifice of Hoover Dam.  Today, we see a trickle of change; tomorrow we

will see a collapse and reformation of the entire structure.

<p>

Let me comment more specifically on some of the changes that I would predict.

 They can be broken down as between the primary and secondary effects of the

legislation.


<p>
The primary impact is reasonably straight forward: new competitive entry,

intensifying cross industry competition.


<p>
In my view, it is the secondary or "ripple effects" which are of greater

interest.  They include:

<p>
<ul>

<li> Fragmentation in industry structure.  This view is a bit contrarian.

 Especially as we see regional bell operating companies merging, one may be

tempted to leap to the conclusion that removing regulatory barriers may lead

to greater consolidation.  Certainly there will be some consolidation.  But

in the longer term, I suspect that the opportunity for new entry, for the

birth and growth of new technologies and approaches, for the evolution of new

networks... these phenomena will predominate in the longer term, resulting in

a more complex, competitively porous and yes, fragmented industry structure.

 I use the term fragmented not in any pejorative sense but so as to

communicate the opportunity for, and my prediction of, a lot of new entry.



<li> With new entry will come the principal benefits to consumers: intensifying

price and service competition.  The competition will shift away from

Washington and even away from technology, to a very singular focus on

competing for "account control" or consumer loyalty (which is where the focus

should be).  Competitors will compete not only with price, but with bundling

options, with greater convenience and with pure hype.  It will be a

wonderful thing to behold.



<li> Next on my list of secondary effects is a matter of a general recalibration

of pricing and cost recovery in telephony.  Let me explain briefly for those

of you of who are less familiar with the arcane economics of an industry

distorted by countless years of regulatory interference.



<li> The telephone industry today is characterized by an elaborate web of

non-cost based cross subsidies.  These cross subsidies have been driven by

politics not economics.  The best example, of course, is the funding of

something called "universal service" through a tax which is imposed, in the

initial instance, on long distance carriers and, in the second instance, on

long distance users.  I discuss the matter of funding universal service in

greater detail later.  It suffices to say here that technology and open entry

will find a way to deliver services at their true cost, to the great

detriment of any player forced by regulation to support a non-cost based

subsidy.  Thus my original point: competition will drive prices to costs and

force a recalibration of pricing, subsidies, etc.
<p>
</ul>

Let me close my comments on industry implications by reflecting for a moment

on what drives these changes.  As good a piece of legislation as it is, the

Telecommunications Act of 1996 merely affirms marketplace realities.  That

reality is driven by technology and consumer demand, by entrepreneurs looking

for profit, and by consumer looking for savings and convenience  not by

regulators, not by amateur policy wonks like me or even professional policy

wonks like some of you.

<p>

In my view, we took a left turn, and an incorrect turn, shortly after the

turn of the century when we bought in to a whole set of assumptions which

surround the notion of a "natural monopoly."  These assumptions led in turn,

to a single supplier marketplace, a prohibition on new entry, and -- ipso

facto -- price and service regulation of the monopoly.  

<p>

In the decades which followed, there was no way for us to test the assumption

that there existed a natural monopoly as entry was proscribed.  Well never

really know when the technology actually altered the cost characteristics of

the industry such that competitive entry would result in lower, not higher

prices, as the natural monopoly model would assume.

<p>

This model also led to rate base rate of return regulation, hence gold

plating. 
<p>


There also ensued predictably, that perverse relationship that develops

between regulators and the ostensibly regulated industry, especially where

the industry in question has a singular identity.  In that environment,

regulators often become guardians of the status quo, rather than proponents

of pro-consumer change.
<p>


The intellectual log jam Ive just described was not broken by regulators; it

was broken by entrepreneurs and by technology.  People like Harry Tuttle who

in 1951 had to sue AT&T to allow consumers to attach his Hush-a-Phone to a

telephone mouthpiece; by people like Jack Goeken who in 1967 had to fight a

monumental battle to allow his tiny microwave-based communications company to

carry long distance traffic for 35 users.  Even then, AT&T was arguing that

any diminution in traffic carried by its own network would have the

detrimental effect of raising prices, not lowering them.  It wasnt true then

and it probably hadnt been true for decades before.

<p>

In summary, the process of change in our industry has been driven by

entrepreneurship and technology.  In the early period, the drivers were

changing economics of equipment, CPE and private PBXs as well as microwave

radio networks.  

<p>

Today, changes are driven more on the network side: compression and

digitalization have moved towards commoditizing capacity, denying the big

players the market power they once enjoyed.  In addition, the declining cost

and increasing processing power of computers have altered the economies of

scale, making small competitors more effective.

<p>

This commentary about what actually drives change in our industry provides me

with a natural segue to my final subject, the impact and implications for the

FCC or more generally, for the role of government in this industry.
<p>


<b>Implications for FCC/Government Regulation</b>

<p>

Upon implementing the Act, the FCC should be, and I trust will be, a much

smaller agency with substantially reduced regulatory responsibilities.  Much

of the FCCs current responsibility should be eliminated by transferring such

responsibilities to (a) the market place; (b) the states; or, (c) other

Federal agencies.  

<p>

I see the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as a clarion call to the Commission

to heed the lessons of history and to fundamentally redefine its role and

relationship to this industry.

<p>

My belief that the scope and nature of the Commissions responsibilities and

authority should be altered is derived not from any lack of respect for the

Commission, or for the important role it has played to date.  Rather, my

beliefs follow from the following observations:

<p>
<ol>
<li>  Generally, and most fundamentally, free markets serve the interest of

consumers far more efficiently and effectively than government regulation 

in lowering prices, directing resource allocation and in developing

technologies.  



<li> One reason for the comparative superiority of markets involves the

regulators inherent lack of adequate information, a phenomenon I observed

up-close and personal for six years at the Commission.  Despite best efforts,

it is impossible for any Federal agency to have access to the hundreds of

millions of pieces of information relevant to technology, consumer demand and

cost benefit trade-offs necessary to make efficient resource allocation

decisions.



One need look no further than the area of spectrum allocation.  Today we have

UHF broadcast stations literally going dark in some cases, while standing

adjacent on the radio spectrum band to 800 MHz cellular telephone licenses

are commanding hundreds of millions of dollars in market value because

consumers value the cellular service.  That disjoint, that dysfunction in

resource allocation, is a direct result of an attempt to engage in central

planning by the U.S. Federal government.



<li>  A third failing of the regulatory process involves its manipulation by

competitors for purposes which ill-serve the interests of consumers.  A

regulation which requires one competitor to justify a products price, its

underlying cost, or its availability to all similarly situated is an

invitation to competitors to file a piece of paper contesting "all of the

above."  And its a no lose proposition for the intervenor.  At a minimum,

the competitive offering is delayed and, simultaneously, the public interest

is injured.  Thousands of man hours a year at the Commission are spent

inadvertently acting as the pawn of various competitors attempting to

manipulate the process to serve their interest, not the publics.



<li>  The fourth, and final basis, for my conclusion that we must radically

restructure and reduce the scope of the Commissions responsibilities

involves the rather obvious expeditious pace of technological change.  If it

ever could, it certainly begs credulity to assume that the Commission can

today keep pace with this change.  For example, the advent of compressed

digital technology literally renders irrelevant the distinction between

voice, video and data, a now purely semantic distinction upon which the

Commission has based a ton of regulatory structure.  In my mind, the only

valuable lines which remain are those which divide competitive from

non-competitive markets.  Technology has rendered not merely inefficacious,

but counter productive, the Commissions historic penchant to micro-manage

spectrum use.
</ol>

<p>
Let me now address several specific areas in which the FCC can, and in my

opinion should, reduce or eliminate its regulatory intervention.
<p>


<b>Public Utility Regulation</b>

<p>

The Commissions regulation of price, profit, and the structure of product

offerings (e.g. are they discriminatory?) finds its historical roots in the

so-called "public utility" model.  The public utility model supposes in turn

an absence of competition and, in fact, is driven by an implicit assumption

that the market is not even potentially competitive (i.e., that it is a

natural monopoly).  Obviously this model is completely at odds with the

reality of the modern communications market and its application is

dramatically injurious to our public policy goals.
<p>


All "public utility" regulation should be eliminated unless the market

segment in question is demonstrably non-competitive.  In fact, the Commission

has made significant progress in this direction; Chairman Hundt, and his

colleagues, are to be commended for those efforts.  In particular, the recent

reclassification of AT&T as non-dominant is highly appropriate (and long over

due).

<p>

But, additional deregulation is appropriate.  Some examples follow:

<p>

Private Carriage Contracts.  In the highly competitive market for large

customer contracts, there is no continuing need to require AT&T, MCI, Sprint

or other long distance firms to file single customer filings (e.g. tariff of

12 filings).  These single customer offerings are directed toward the largest

communications customers, companies with sophisticated in-house communication

staff.  As such, FCC tariff filing requirements serve little of the customer

protection purpose traditionally associated with tariff filings.  At best,

they are an unnecessary expense, and at worst, a means of price signaling and

coordination.  They also provide an excuse for competitors to make mischief

by challenging the cost basis or structure of the offering in an attempt to

delay and impede competition.  The effect of these efforts is generally to

slow downward price reductions in a competitive market.  Like the question of

price, the question of whether a product offering is unduly "discriminative"

is inappropriately posed in a competitive market.  Product offerings

customized for particular large buyers, where the market is competitive, are

not likely to be "unreasonable" (i.e., injurious to the public).

<p>

Computer Inquiry Rules.  In the 1980s, in a series of decisions with which I

was intimately involved, the Commission distinguished regulated basic

telecommunications services from unregulated enhanced services in the

so-called "computer inquiry" cases.  In a well intended effort to deregulate

competitive sectors of the telecommunications market, a series of regulations

were enunciated intended to preclude carriers from leveraging the

noncompetitive side of their business into comparative strength on the

competitive side.  Hence, a series of rules prohibiting bundling and

requiring certain accounting procedures and the like were enunciated.  For

example, long distance companies were prohibited from bundling basic

telephone services with customer equipment or enhanced services.  In

addition, the same companies were required to receive FCC approval of an

affiliates offering of enhanced services and to follow precise guidelines

with the respect to the allocation of joint and common costs in the provision

of basic and enhanced services.  In all of these cases, where the basic

service (such as the long distance market today) is effectively competitive,

these regulations are no longer necessary or productive.

<p>

Local Exchange Services.  Regulation of local exchange facilities should be

devolved to the states, except as necessary to assure that interstate users

of local exchange facilities have nondiscriminatory access, and that there

are no barriers to new competitive entrance pursuant to the

Telecommunications Act of 1996.  

<p>

I would emphasize at this point that there is an important transitional role

for the FCC to play in ensuring that the Congress intention to provide for

new competitive entry on fair terms is fulfilled.  I am personally aware of

the difficulties cable companies have had gaining fair access to Local

Telephone Exchange facilities in an effort to provide local competitive

alternatives.  Thus, wherever there remain pockets of market power in a

provision of telecommunications services or access facilities, there remains

an important role for the FCC.
<p>


Universal Service.  An important policy goal of the Congress is the

maintenance of universal telephone service.  Generally speaking, the goal of

our universal service policy is to maximize the availability of a defined

level of communication services to all Americans.
<p>


As I mentioned earlier, and as both the Congress and Commission have

recognized, however, the manner in which we support our universal service

goals is in need of radical reform.  Thus, there is currently pending a Joint

Board proceeding to address and revise our policies in this important area,

in particular the subsidy mechanism used to support these goals.

<p>

Without belaboring issues now the subject of a broad inquiry, let me make

several simple points:

<p>

(a) Our current methodology of raising funds in substantial part with usage

sensitive access charges, paid initially by long distance carriers and

ultimately by consumers, distorts the competitive landscape and unfairly

taxes long distance consumers.  Worse, because the support payments are, in

turn, paid to high cost telephone companies, rather than telephone users in

need of financial support to sustain their access to the telephone network,

the current system is unduly expensive (i.e., we raise more money than we

need) and not focused on those truly in need.  The fact is, wealthy residents

in many rural areas are subsidized in their access to local phone service and

the poor in, for example, South Central Los Angeles are not.

<p>

(b) Id submit that we can substantially reduce the overall amount or cost of

the subsidy and more effectively help the truly needy with a plan guided by

these simple principles:

<p>
<ol>
<li> target individuals, not telephone systems for assistance;



<li> clearly define "universal service" as to the type and level of telephone

services to which "universal" access is thought desirable;



<li> using a defined "means test," identify and make explicit a sum certain

necessary to achieve the universal service objective ("universal service

subsidy target");



<li> raise the subsidy target by requiring all telephone users to contribute a

fixed sum to the subsidy pool; and, 



<li> allow the states to "administer" the subsidy by provision to those

meeting the "means test". 

</ol><p>

The universal service proceeding is one which I would urge the Congress to

monitor closely, as it is one rife with the potential for political

compromise, and much in need of radical restructuring instead.
<p>


<b>Management of the Electro-Magnetic Radio Spectrum</b>

<p>

The current Commission, and indeed, Chairman Hundt, are to be commended for

their strong support of spectrum auctions.  It is ironic that an idea widely

and loudly dismissed by a Democratically controlled Congress when I argued

for it has become such a universally accepted and applauded idea of the

current Administration.  But then, as President Reagan used to say, "Theres

no telling how far we can go if we dont worry about who gets the credit."

<p>

Spectrum auctions aside, much work remains.  Tremendous new applications in

wireless communications technology today await permission to access spectrum.

 Access to that spectrum by the private sector provides the key to unlocking

a plethora of exciting, innovative, and ever-cheaper services for the public.

 Yet, many parts of the radio band go under-utilized in applications little

valued by the public, while demand exceeds spectrum supply for other

applications.  Indeed, much radio spectrum lies fallow as the Commission

seeks to divine its ultimate use.


<p>
This paradox is a result of a government run, centrally planned allocation of

radio spectrum, a regulatory structure which is increasingly costly in our

dynamic world.  I hasten to add that these inefficient results follow from

the system itself, not from any lack of expertise, competence, or diligence

on the part of the FCC.  The key defect, of course, is an attempt to use a

government funded central planning mechanism to allocate spectrum when even

the most resource-rich players in the private sector cannot keep pace with

the rate of change.  

<p>

It is one of the most profound ironies of our time that, when literally the

entire world has rejected central planning, the United States continues to

use it to allocate that very resource which could, unleashed, confirm and

compound our dominance in the "infotech" global marketplace.


<p>
So whats the answer?  In the area of radio spectrum management, the

Commission should: (1) auction off remaining radio spectrum as expeditiously

as possible; and, (2) reform its approach to regulating the use of radio

spectrum by focusing almost exclusively on "output" parameters (e.g. rule to

prohibit co-channel and adjacent channel interference) and limit involvement

in what might be denominated "input parameters" (e.g. rules that dictate what

business a licensee pursues).  Stated less esoterically, future "spectrum

licensees" need service, business and technical flexibility as well as the

freedom to transfer their license or sub-lease channels freely.
<p>


I would urge an approach to spectrum management regime in which

entrepreneurs, responding to market incentives, define how spectrum is used,

when and how networks are built, and when the spectrum is better put to an

alternative use.  This would be a regime in which the publics interest in

more services at lower prices would be best served.


<p>
I hasten to add that this mode, while a significant departure from our

current approach, falls short of calling for a complete "privatization" of

radio spectrum.  The "spectrum license" I envision would provide for a

greater measure of flexibility and partake of more of the characteristics of

"private property," while remaining the property of the United States

government, ultimately in its control.  Reasonable minds continue to differ

with respect to what obligations, if any, ought to attach to certain uses of

spectrum.  Under the scenario I have described, Congress could reserve

spectrum for certain applications thought critical and/or impose service

obligations on certain bands.  Such "reservations" should be narrowly defined

and made as "explicit" as possible so as to minimize distortions in the

spectrum marketplace.
<p>


<b>How Do We Get There From Here?</b>

<p>

Fortunately, and importantly, the Congress has provided the Commission with

the tools to re-invent itself substantially along the lines outlined above.

 Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 provide the Commission with

broad authority to defer to market forces.  Two of the most important of

these provisions provide the Commission with authority to forebear from

applying any regulation no longer thought to be in the public interest and an

affirmative requirement to periodically review all regulations to ascertain

whether they are still necessary or appropriate.
<p>


The Commission should utilize the tools now within its power to re-invent

itself.  Specifically, the Commission should:

<p>
<ol>
<li> forebear from enforcement of any regulation or statutory requirement no

longer necessary as a result of competitive market forces;



<li> defer areas of concurrent responsibility to sister agencies in order to

eliminate redundancy and consequent ambiguity in standards;



<li> devolve to the states as much responsibility as possible in the areas of

local exchange regulation and Universal Service as outlined above; and,



<li> privatize as many functions as possible.  Again, the current Commission

deserves credit for moves in this direction, most notably for its use of

private resources to conduct spectrum auctions.
</ol><p>


It is important that the size, structure and remaining regulatory authority

of the Commission reflect the philosophy and goals of the Telecommunications

Act of 1996 as soon as practically possible.  Specifically, the agency should

be much reduced in size and, more importantly, much reduced in the scope of

its regulatory activities.  To be sure, important functions will remain:

management of "spectrum licenses" especially as to those "output perimeters"

discussed above; retention of price and "access regulation" in those aspects

of the interstate telephone market not subject to effective competition; and,

administration of any revamped Federal subsidies supporting our universal

service telephone policy objectives.

<p>

If the commission, working with the Congress, can achieve these organization

and substantive changes, I am confident that objectives of the

Telecommunications Act of 1996 will be fully realized and, more importantly,

the public interest will be advanced dramatically.

Plummer </A><BR>&amp; Charles C. Mann</I></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P>Many of the battles to come, as a Democratic Administrations faces aRepublican Congress, will be the sort of meanspirited partisan scufflesthat Americans love to deride. But sometimes the smoke and dust of the fraywill conceal a matter of principle, even philosophy-as in the case of thereauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>Like many laws, the act must periodically be reauthorized, which is to saythat the federal government must occasionally renew its own authority tofund the act's enforcement and administration. Reauthorization was scheduledfor 1992, but Congress postponed action indefinitely-its members did notwant to touch the issue in an election year. In the meantime, frustrationwith the law has been building. The inevitable debate will probably takeplace this year, perhaps within the next few months. It will be bloody,as they say inside the Beltway. At issue will be the nation's biologicalheritage, more or less, and a vision of its economic future. Conflict willbe engaged by the usual operatives: lobbyists representing some of the nation'smost powerful interest groups. <BR><BR><BR>Opponents call for narrowing the scope of the law, claiming that societyis spending billions to protect the Penland beardtongue, the fat pocketbookmussel, the giant kangaroo rat, and a cavalcade of other creatures withabsurd-sounding names. The Endangered Species Act, in their view, threatensto usurp so much private property and capsize so many jobs that it may wreckour very economy. Proponents declare the law inadequately enforced and demandthat its protections be extended to more species at a faster rate; otherwise,they claim, we risk trashing our biological life-support system. Weakenor fortify?-that is the tenor of the debate. One question is rarely addressed:Can the law be more responsive to the concerns of both sides? <H2><CENTER><BR><BR>*****************</CENTER></H2><BR>The Endangered Species Act orders the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, abranch of the Department of the Interior, to protect species recognizedas endangered, without regard to cost. The goal is to banish extinctionfrom the United States. Unfortunately, the present system has failed utterlyto do this. Species are going extinct anyway, and the threats are multiplying.For every species that Fish and Wildlife has successful removed from theendangered list in the past tow decades, it has added more than one hundredothers. <BR><BR><BR>This outcome would have surprised the members of Congress who passed thelaw, in 1973. Implicit in the debate over the act was the assumption, stillheld by many conservationists today, that endangered species could be savedwithout sacrifice: if development affects a species here, we can just movethe development or the species someplace else. since then it has becomeclear that the reasons species become endangered are not always trivial,and that saving them is not so simple. <BR><BR><BR>Anyone who has walked in the western parts of Albany, New York, can seethe problem. A hundred years ago the area hosted one of the world's largestpopulations of the Karner Blue butterfly, a lovely little bug that appearedon the endangered list at the end of 1992. The former haunts of the butterflyhave been taken over by an interstate highway, a power substation, a campusof the State University of New York, and several hundred middle-class homes.In other words, the butterfly was endangered by the satisfaction of ordinaryhuman desires to drive around, switch on lamps at night, learn about interestingthings, and live in a nice home. <BR><BR><BR>Because human interests cannot be ignored, not al species can be saved.yet the current system demands the unattainable: all species must be saved,and human interests must be ignored. Amplifying this dissonance has beenan unwillingness in Congress to award the Fish and Wildlife Service morethan a paltry budget to enforce and administer the law. As a result, theagency has been driven to impose conservation tasks on those private-propertyowners who are unlucky enough to have land that sustains endangered species.To be safe from possible prosecution, they must verify that using theirproperty will cause the creatures no harm. Endangered species thus becomea liability that encourages otherwise responsible citizens to call in thebulldozers at the first glimpse of an endangered bird or lizard. <BR><BR><BR>Both sides of the debate recognize these flaws, but they disagree on howto remedy them. Supporters of the law cling to its impossible goal, callingfor increased budgets and stricter enforcement. This would turn Fish andWildlife Service biologists into ecological mandarins, making choices forentire regions which must favor the interests of other species and not people.Such overbearing regulation would increase the incentives for landownersto destroy pristine land, with predictably disastrous environmental consequences.<BR><BR><BR>Not that opponents have a better answer. Many call for compensating landownersfor any decrease in the value of their property brought on by species protection.But this amount to little more than replacing ecological mandarins witheconomic mandarins, whose decisions would be equally predictable and equallydisastrous. <H2><CENTER>********************** </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>What will it take to do a better job of saving our natural heritage? Theforemost change must be to recognize that our values are manifold. If wevalued only trees and streams, we wouldn't hesitate to save them, no materwhat the cost. If we wanted only cement and steel, any part of nature beyondthe minimum necessary to sustain life would become expendable. If the pastis any guide, the debaters in Washington will blindly favor one side orthe other. Progress will be possible only if the unrealistic demands ofthe Endangered Species Act are scaled back and supplemented with a way ofsatisfying some of the needs of affected landowners. <BR><BR><BR>The demands of the current law should not be eliminated entirely, though.Even if a species fails a strict cost-benefit test, few people would supportits extinction without pausing to reflect. Protecting species is a taskthat deserves a place in the political life of our country, alongside otherbasic values such as protecting health, maintaining the nation's defense,and fostering education. <BR><BR><BR>In other words, a balance must be struck. Part of that balance should befor landowners to concede that our ecological inheritance is important enoughto justify some regulation of their land. Another, equally important partof the balance should be for conservationists to concede that developmentplans that threaten species are reflections of the human desire to havestores, roads, schools, homes, and the like. The two concessions point inthe same direction: neither species nor developers should win all the time.The question is when and where each should prevail. <BR><BR><BR>Moneyed interests, of course, will always threaten species and other environmentalassets that cannot pay their way. The most appropriate counterweight isnot to outlaw human nature but to award some money to environmental protection.merely throwing money at the current system, however, will only exacerbatethe problems inherent in the endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>One solution would be to create an Endangered Species Trust fund, to promoteconservation in ways more compatible with American values and culture. Thefund could underwrite a variety of programs, from ecological research toeducational advertising to conservation assistance to outright land purchase.It could encourage landowners to share their land with species in trouble.The state of Wisconsin, for example, already has such a program, which coversseven species on the federal endangered list. Landowners agree to a nonbindingprotection plan, and are rewarded with a picture of the species, a certificateof appreciation, ongoing species-management help, and, most important, thebelief that they are voluntarily doing to right thing. According to thestate, most landowners happily go along, although the program is unlikelyto deter big development plans. <BR><BR><BR>Not all species can be protected by voluntary programs, of course, and wherenecessary the trust fund could help subsidize conservation efforts by landowners.One possible model is a program sponsored by the Defenders of Wildlife,a Washington-based conservation group, which offers a $5,000 &quot;bounty&quot;to each landowner who has an established wolf den on his or her property.The trust could also promote commercial practices that are environmentallyfriendlier but costlier than current practices. As the Soil ConservationService does for farmers and soil conservation, a Biological ConservationService, funded by the trust, could encourage foresters, ranchers, and minersto modify their activities, thus reducing-though not eliminating-harm toendangered species. <BR><BR><BR>In critical cases the trust fund would have the tools to restrict land usegreatly, albeit in a noncoercive manner. It could take a lesson from Thenature Conservancy, which protects some biologically valuable land by payingfor a conservation easement-a legal contract that forbids developing a pieceof property but allows the landowner to earn income through ecologicallybenign activities, such as certain types of agriculture. As a final resort,in places where almost any human activity threatens the other inhabitants,the trust fund could buy land and protect it as a biological preserve. <BR><BR><BR>Such an effort would be expensive, but it could go a long way toward removingour natural heritage from the mire of partisan bickering. Indeed, the ideaof a trust fund has quietly attracted interest from environmental organizationsand from advocates of property rights. Combined with a scaled-back EndangeredSpecies Act, the fund could help the nation provide environmental protectionwith less social conflict. Isn't that what it means to make the law responsiveto the people and the causes it serves? <BR><BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Mark L.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Wildlife Corridors</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><I>From Science, December 1, 1995</I></H3><H1><CENTER><BR>Are Wildlife Corridors the Right Path?</CENTER></H1><H4><CENTER><BR><BR><BR>By </CENTER></H4><H3><CENTER><I><A HREF="plummer.html">Mark L. Plummer </A></I><BR>&amp; Charles C. Mann<BR><HR></CENTER></H3><BR>	<B>Not </B>far from La Jolla, California, lies some of the vast undevelopedland left along the coast of fast-growing San Diego County.  Pardee Construction,the Weyerhaeuser subsidiary that owns the central portion of the land, plansto turn it into a suburban neighborhood.  But local environmental activistsbelieve it should serve a more valuable purpose:  The area forms a corridorconnecting the Los Penasquitos Canyon to the Torrey Pines nature preserves,a link that they believe would let some of the area's threatened speciestravel between the preserves.  Wanting to keep the corridor open, the activistshave been campaigning to block Pardee's plans.<BR>	Their efforts, however, have run into two big problems.  The cost of stoppingPardee could be as high as $40 million - the lands value, according to thecompany.  And the ecological value of such corridors is disputed by someof the discipline's leading researchers.  Indeed, wildlife corridors havequietly become one of the most important battlegrounds in conservation,with major development projects and the future of valuable nature preservesat stake.  <BR>	Many ecologists and conservation activists argue that corridors are criticalfor maintaining biodiversity.  &quot;Connectivity is absolutely crucial,&quot;say Reed Noss, editor of Conservation Biology , &quot;especially when you'retalking about a species that  doesn't have enough habitat in one place tomaintain a viable population.&quot;  As a result, big habitat-managementefforts in ecological hot spots such as Florida, southern California, andthe Pacific Northwest have focused on establishing links between blocksof habitat.  Corridors, Keith Hay of the Conservation Fund told Defendersmagazine (May-June 1990, pp. 19-30), &quot;hold more promise for the managementof the diversity of life than any other management factor except stabilizationof the human population.&quot;<BR><BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>&quot;Given what we know about the dispersal  of species and the persistenceof populations, &quot; he says, &quot;I think the burden of proof shouldfall on those who would deny corridors to a reserve system, not on thosewho lobby for them.&quot;</H4></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><HR><BR>	But other ecologists worry that efforts to preserve linking areas likethe one in La Jolla may be a shot in the dark.  &quot;People are encouragedto think there's a quick, easy answer - a technological fix - when there'sno evidence that quick, easy answers are forthcoming,&quot; says ecologistDaniel Simberloff of Florida State University.  Dennis Murphy, a conservationbiologist at Stanford University who advocates careful use of corridors,agrees with this assessment, pointing to the inherent difficulty of studyingcomplex ecological interactions in the field.  <BR>	One reason for the popularity of corridors, according to Hartmuth Walter,an ecologist at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles, is thatthey seem to provide a &quot;scientific&quot; rationale for activists topreserve locally favored parcels of land: &quot;It can always be describedas a unique link that must be used to preserve connectivity, which soundsbetter to them than 'just preserve this land because we don't want it developed.'&quot; But the result of this well-meaning application of science, he fears, mayin the long run not be good for either conservation of science.<BR>	Although the notion of ecological connectivity has a long history, it didnot appear in modern form until 1970, when Richard Levins, an ecologistat the Harvard School of Public Health, created the first mathematical modelof what he called a &quot;metapopulation&quot;: a set of linked local populationsof a species, each in its own separate patch of habitat.  <BR>	In Levin's formulation, the population of any given patch rises and fallsover time, there is always a small chance that the population on any individualpatch can vanish.  But the empty habitats can be repopulated if the membersof populations are able to disperse from patch to patch - if, that is, themetapopulation has sufficient &quot;connectivity,&quot; a term coined in1984 by ecologist Gray Merriam of Carleton University in Ontario.  In Levin'stheory, metapopulations can persist through time if the rate of recolonizationmatches the extinction rate.  <BR>	A widely cited example is the pool frog Rana lessonae, which lives in pondsalong the Baltic coast of Sweden.  According to Per Sjoren-Gulve of theGenetics Centre in Uppsala, the pools sometimes dry up, wiping out individualpopulations; when the pools refill, they are recolonized.  The species staysin equilibrium, as long as it has enough pools and frogs can migrate amongthem.  In a classic demonstration of the threat posed to biodiversity byhuman activity, Sjoren reported last year that the frog is threatened becauseforesters are draining and ditching these ponds [Ecology 75: 1357-67 (1994)]. <BR><H4>Theory becomes policy</H4>The intuitive clarity of such scenarios has produced a rapid flourishingof metapopulation theory.  In the 1980's modeling metapopulations becamewhat Simberloff calls a &quot;cottage industry - there must be hundredsof papers by now.&quot;  One reason for the appeal of this work, he says,is that &quot;the models are mathematically interesting.  You get thesefascinating theoretical results, like multiple stable equilibria.&quot; In such situations, the range of possible states for the metapopulationis mathematically similar to the range of possible locations for a marbleon a dented sheet of metal - it can rest in many locations, but cannot shifteasily among them.  <BR>	Theory has produced policy.  As ecologist Susan Harrison of UC Davis, putsit, many habitat managers now believe that a &quot;successful [biodiversity]strategy requires conserving numerous habitat patches and the potentialfor dispersal between them.&quot;  Corridors thus fill conservation plansin many of America's biodiversity backgrounds.  Florida has spent millionsof dollars to create them, including the construction of costly tunnelsunder interstate highways in an effort to link tracts of land suitable forthe endangered Florida panther.  In Riverside County, California, the protectionof corridors linking patches of habitat for the endangered Stephens' kangaroorat was a &quot;very important&quot; guideline in setting up the proposed17,400 hectares of reserves, according to the official habitat-conservationplan.  In the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approveda plan offered by the timber firm Murray-Pacific covering a 22,250-hectaretract of land that houses the endangered northern spotted owl.  The companygained the right to cut trees even if an owl is harmed, as long as the landitself is maintained as &quot;dispersal habitat.&quot;  On the grandestscale, the Wildlands Project - an attempt to map out a network of corridorsamong all of the nation's remaining undeveloped areas backed by Noss, MichaelSoule of UC Santa Cruz, and other influential conservation biologists -is intended to maintain connectivity across huge areas (Science, 25 June1993, p. 1868).<BR><H4>Gaps in corridor research</H4>But skeptics like Harrison and Simberloff argue that many plans to preservecorridors need closer examination.  In the first place, not all speciesexist as metapopulations.  &quot;The phenomenon  is a lot less ubiquitousthan it seems,&quot; says Harrison.  &quot;Just because you see patchy habitatsand blinking populations doesn't mean you have a situation where you havethis balance between extinction and recolonization.&quot;  And even if thereare good theoretical reasons for believing the metapopulation model applies,empirical research on connectivity is extraordinarily difficult.  &quot;Youhave to look at an entire set of populations over the landscape over a longperiod of time,&quot; she says.  &quot;The amount of energy you have tohave to collect the data running from patch to patch is incredible.  Theimportant processes - extinction and recolonization - are so rare that theyare virtually impossible to observe.&quot;<BR>	The difficulties are illustrated in research by Ilkka Hanski and threecollaborators at the University of Finland, who have conducted one of thefew large-scale studies of metapopulation dynamics.  The study, which tookplace in the Aland islands off the coast of southwest Finland, focused onthe Glanville fritillary (spotted) butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, which breedsin small dry meadows at the end of summer.  During that period, the researchteam repeatedly surveyed 1530 suitable butterfly meadows - some as smallas 12 square meters - in an area of 3500 square kilometers.  They foundthat neighboring populations tended to rise and fall in synchrony, suggestingthat the whole area indeed held a metapopulation with many possible states(Nature, 19 October, pp. 618-621).  Yet because the Finnish team has only2 years worth of data, Harrison cautions, the results of this &quot;veryambitious and very exciting&quot; study remain &quot;compatible with otherexplanations&quot; than metapopulation dynamics.  The populations couldbe independent and the synchrony only coincidence.<BR>	Even if a metapopulation exhibits connectivity, corridors may not be neededto provide it.  &quot;When you look at populations that are naturally fragmentedthey often aren't connected by corridors,&quot; says R. J. (Rocky) Gutierrezof Humboldt University in California, a wildlife biologist who has studiedbird populations in the western United States.  &quot;Yet there are populationsof these species on habitat islands.  That's an indications that  they canreach these islands independent of corridors.&quot;  He points to Manhattan'sCentral Park as an example.  &quot;You have a good complement of [northeastern]migratory birds there,&quot; he says, &quot;and there's not corridor connectingit&quot; to anyplace else.<BR>	Large mammals' need for corridors is intuitively easy to understand, becausethey often have large home ranges or use migratory pathways.  Indeed, PaulBeier, a biologist at Northern Arizona University, tracked cougars withradio collars and found that the animals always follow the same paths betweenpatches of habitat, even paths that are kilometers long and pass throughgolf courses and highway underpasses.  &quot;These animals will really usecorridors if they're available - even surprisingly poor corridors,&quot;say Beier.  And he has some evidence that such paths are needed: &quot;Thecats will not walk through a mile of tract homes.  None of the radio-taggedanimals ever did that.&quot;<BR>	But even this evidence isn't conclusive.  The best way to prove that organismsuse corridors, Simberloff says, is to cut them off and see what happens. But in a real landscape, this is a rather difficult proposition.  Beieracknowledges, for example, that he couldn't cut off all the cougars' possiblecorridors to see if they could still find their way across the landscapebecause the corridors wind through private property and under freeways. Moreover, because corridors are not always self-evident, it would be hardto know what to cut.  Ted Case, an ecologist at UC San Diego, says thatecologists usually define corridors by vegetation types - strips of forestland between the lawns of suburban developments, for instance - but speciessuch as salamanders may follow different trails.  &quot;I'm not as surethey are responding to vegetation types, rather than microbes in the soilor fungus or ants,&quot; Case says.<BR>	Finally, Simberloff also points out that corridors can have down sides. They can allow disease, predators, and exotic species to spread througha metapopulation.  And corridors, which are sometimes touted as ways toincrease genetic diversity among populations, may also function to decreaseit, because the migration among individual populations may end up geneticallyhomogenizing the metapopulation as a whole.  Like the evidence in favorof corridors, Simberloff admits, these possibilities are largely theoretical. But, he adds, &quot;there are examples of predators,&quot; such as easterndiamondback rattlesnakes, that use corridors for &quot;trap-lining&quot;- that is, lying in wait for their prey along a corridor.  He also citesa 1987 study that found corridors facilitating the spread of exotic feralpigs through forest fragments in New Zealand, menacing a genus of tree snail(in D. A. Saunders et al., Nature Conservation: The Role of Remnants ofNative Vegetation, Chipping Norton, N.S.W.  Surrey Beatty, 1987.).<BR>	<H4>Making trade-offs</H4>The land between the Los Penasquitos Canyon and Torrey Pines nature preserveexemplifies many of these issues.  The area is hardly pristine wilderness. Laced with roads and suburban neighborhoods, it is bordered on the westby the eight lanes of Interstate 5, one of the most heavily traveled roadsin the country.  But in the middle is a relatively undisturbed mesa coveredwith scrub and chaparral.<BR>	Pardee's plans call for creating a development of almost 1000 homes on160 hectares of this mesa.  In exchange, the company would set aside a numberof other parcels - including a wildlife corridor that snakes around thedeveloped areas and past I-5 by way of a tunnel an a proposed bridge, forminga 3-kilometer route between the two reserves.  This corridor will keep thetwo reserves connected, Pardee believes, and allow large predators likecoyotes, bobcats, and cougars to maintain a presence in Torrey Pines, whichin turn may help prevent it from being overrun by squirrels and smallerpredators like feral cats and raccoons.  <BR>	But corridor advocates like Soule and Michael Beck of the Endangered HabitatsLeague, a southern California environmental group that is spearheading thefight to protect the mesa, argue that this skinny, winding path is not enoughto ensure connectivity and safeguard Torrey Pines from isolation.  Theywant to see the development on the mesa moved to the southern portion, creatinga much wider corridor through the northern part and preserving much of themesa's scrub and chaparral.  And they have vowed to fight Pardee. <BR>	This is, advocates say, the only cautious and prudent course.  Noss arguesthat in the absence of hard evidence, it is always a good idea to maintainexisting connections whenever possible.  And Beck, who admits there is nodefinitive evidence to support the mesa's use as a corridor, agrees thatthe best course is to be conservative.  Pardee's development proposal, inhis words, &quot;is not biologically conservative at all.  It takes theheart out of the mesa.&quot;  He believe Pardee's needs are sufficientlyflexible to allow a wider corridor.<BR>	Skeptics think corridor boosters are going to give up a guaranteed dealthat will create open space in favor of an unproven scientific concept. Studies similar to Beier's UCLA's Walter points out, suggest large mammalsneed no more than the narrow path called for in Pardee's plans.  Moreover,he says, the &quot;caution&quot; of corridor advocates actually disguisesother risks.  Money does not grow on trees, the ecologist says, and tappingpublic coffers to buy the mesa almost certainly precludes spending fundson other conservation efforts.  Noting that exotic plants and other formsof degradation plague the Torrey Pines reserve - an observation that hasbroad scientific support - Walter asks if the area's limited conservationresources might be better spent on restoring the reserve's ecological health.<BR>	Beck worries, however, that without the biggest possible link, the degradationin Torrey Pines will only continue.  &quot;If we write off wildlife dispersalto Torrey Pines,&quot; he says, &quot;it won't have the dynamic mechanismsthat balance wildlife activity.&quot;<BR>	The debate over the corridor through the mesa, like may others around thecountry, must be resolved without the evidence scientists usually rely uponto settle such disputes.  To Walter, it is risky for scientists to comeout strongly for a concept with such uncertain empirical backing.  &quot;Howare we going to get Congress to listen to biology if they think it is beingused solely as an excuse to stop development?&quot; he asks.  And he worriesthat the result could be a discrediting of science.<BR>	Others argue that development pressure is too intense to allow researchersto work with perfect data, no matter what they do.  But they disagree aboutwhat to do  in the absence of evidence.  &quot;Corridors are not bad perse,&quot; says Harrison, &quot;but there's a range of [possible conservationstrategies], and you should at least consider them before blindly rushinginto things.&quot;  Murphy doesn't disagree, but feels that corridors shouldbe given the benefit of the doubt.  &quot;Given what we know about the dispersal of species and the persistence of populations, &quot; he says, &quot;Ithink the burden of proof should fall on those who would deny corridorsto a reserve system, not on those who lobby for them.&quot;<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Charles C.

<P>Ray Chambers, Fellow of Discovery Institute, advocates and promotes the
practicality of bringing high speed rail to America with a practical emphasis
on privatizing all or part of the passenger rail system. His work also examines
<A HREF="chmbrinq.html">the need for a National High Speed Rail Plan</A>.
Chambers, who is Chairman of Chambers, Conlon &amp; Hartwell, Inc., in Washington
D.C., is a <B>former Director of Congressional Relations for the U.S. Department
of Transportation</B>. He is also former Deputy and Acting Assistant Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare. He served for eight years as an Administrative
Assistant in the U.S. House of Representatives. <BR>
<BR>
While with the U.S. DOT Mr. Chambers was responsible for all legislative
strategy associated with the passage of the <B>Regional Rail Reorganization
Act of 1973 </B>and the<B> Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform
Act of 1976</B>. These laws were responsible for restructuring the major
bankrupt freight railroads in the United States, including the creation
of Conrail. <BR>
<BR>
On behalf of transportation clients, he has been heavily involved with all
major railroad legislation since leaving the U.S. DOT in 1976. He holds
a B.A. degree from the Redlands University and an M.A. from Rutgers University.

<IMG SRC="goldline.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="8" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=

<P>At the recent Internet Law Symposium 95, sponsored by the Seattle-based
Discovery Institute, noted technology author and pundit George Gilder stated
that &quot;[i]n the twenty-first century, all law will be Internet law.&quot;
The proof of this statement is the debate already taking place among lawyers,
scholars, technologists, and Netizens about security, privilege, and confidentiality
in cyberspace. It is common currency in the popular press that nothing is
secure or private on the Internet. Whether true or not, whether an exagger-
ation or understatement, these sentiments breed doubt that any attomey-client
privilege can be maintained in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the law is not as muddled as conventional punditry suggests.
That is not to say that there are not real business risks associated with
use of digital communications today, just as there are risks associated
with use of fax machines, voice mail, and ordinary &quot;snail&quot; mail
(physical mail), but privilege waiver probably is not one of them. To understand
the issue, we do not start with the rules of professional conduct on maintaining
the confidences and secrets of clientsl or with the technology or medium
of exchange. Rather, we look to criminal law. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Title 18 prohibits the interception of any aural, wire, or electronic communications
by any person. It also prohibits the use or disclosure of unlawfully intercepted
communications. Electronic communications mean any transfer of signs, signals,
writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted
in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo-electronic,
or photo-optical system. Wire communications mean any aural transfer (i.e.,
transfer containing a human voice) made in whole or in part through wire,
cable, or other like connection between the point of origin or point of
receptions Thus, for example, cellular phone communications, though wireless
in origin, are wire communications because they connect to land lines to
complete the call. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short, no one can lawfully intercept communications made over phone lines
or wireless communications. The same is true for information or communications
made over the Internet, including e-mail. For the uninitiated, it may seem
surprising that the Wiretap Act is the source of prohibition for interceptions
on the Internet. But the fact is that the Net is a series of interconnected
networks of computers connected by and accessed through the telecommunications
infrastructure--that is, the phone lines and exchanges throughout the world
connect the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To intercept an Internet communication (limited voice communications are
now available in addition to e-mail) requires a wiretap. Thus, there is
no greater insecurity when the Internet communication is in transit over
the phone lines than there is with an ordinary phone call.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The greater concern arises once the communication is passed through computers
on the network or when it is stored electronically. Internet communications
may pass through dozens of computers on the way to the fmal receiver. Each
computer is a potential source of exposure. Communications stored electronically
in a computer share the same vulnerability as voice-mail and other data
fides.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hacking or &quot;cracking&quot; networks has become easier today, in part
due to the Internet. Hackers routinely exchange information over the Net
about systems' vulnerabilities. Any network connected to the Internet has
the potential to be cracked absent security measures.<BR>
Congress recognized the vulnerability of networks and amended the Wiretap
Act in 1986 to address the problem, enacting the Electronic Communication
Privacy Act (ECPA). ECPA makes it unlawful to access without authorization
a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided.
It is also unlawful to exceed an authorization to access a facility and
thereby alter, obtain, or prevent authorized access to a wire or electronic
communication while it is an electronic storage. In other words, hacking
is illegal, just as altering or obtaining stored data without proper authority
is. In short, it is unlawful to intercept an e-mail at point from transmission,
while in transit, when stored or after receipt.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If new technologies are to succeed, users must have confidence in the security
of the system. Making hacking and eavesdropping felonies goes a long way
to achieving that goal, but mere prohibitions on interception of communications
do not preserve privilege. Congress did, however, provide the answer. Section
2517(4) of Title 18 provides that &quot;[n]o otherwise privileged wire,
oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in
violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, interception of communications over the Internet or over the phone
should not result in waiver of the attomey-client privilege. There is no
similar provision (and none is needed) for electronically stored data, however,
because there is no waiver of privilege when a thief steals a document out
of a file cabinet, and likewise no waiver when the file is in digital form
and the breakin occurs through the phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Some have argued that any communication &quot;readily capable of interception&quot;
should not be protected if, indeed, it is intercepted. The Association of
the Bar of the City of New York has admonished its members to , exercise
caution when engaging in conversations containing client confidences by
cellular or cordless phones readily capable of interception and [to] consider
taking steps such as encryption or scrambling of signals sufficient to ensure
the security of such conversations &quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rulings as to cordless phones are correct. Inadvertent interceptions
have occurred frequently with cordI ss phones, which transmit on a normal
FM frequency within radio range. Using a cordless phone is like operating
a radio station and broadcasting your message. Anyone within range could
receive the communication. Thus, it would not be uncommon to hear a conversation
on an FM car radio or even a baby monitor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same is not true for cellular phones, however. While they use part of
the spectrum for transmission, they do not transmit within a range or frequency
capable of inadvertent interception by commercial users of the airwaves
or listeners. Rather, scanners are required to intercept cellular communications
and that is an illegal act. From a privilege standpoint, this is the difference
between using the PA system to deliver your message in a crowded shopping
mall and whispering a secret in a private room. California has amended its
evidence code to make clear that attomey-client communications do not lose
their privilege character when conducted by cellular phone. This is the
right approach and is timely because wireless data exchange is becoming
more costeffective every day, so wireless e-mail and other packetswitched
data services by wireless means are not far off.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We can look at the problem another way-from the user's expectations. The
same people who argue that the Internet or cellular phones are too insecure
to use without encryption would be aghast at the suggestion that the government
should be free to eavesdrop on those same calls or communications. Yet the
rule is that if a citizen has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the
communication, then there is no &quot;search&quot; under the Fourth Amendment.
Congress, here again, has answered the question (and the Association of
the Bar of the City of New York as well) by making clear that essentially
any communication carried over a communication system provided by a telecommunications
carrier is deemed to be not &quot;readily accessible to the general public.&quot;
In other words, the person making the communication has a reasonable expectation
of privacy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed ' there is no question but that the government needs a court order
or warrant based on probable cause that a felony is being conunitted to
conduct electronic surveillances To obtain the contents of communications
in electronic storage for less than 180 days, the government also must obtain
a warrant based on probable cause. If the communications have been stored
for over 180 days, a warrant is still necessary unless the government gives
advance notice to the user. With notice, the government can use other legal
process such as a subpoena to obtain the contents, but then the user can
always challenge the process and move to quash. The same procedures apply
to communications stored in remote computing services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Wiretap Act and ECPA are the statutory floor; states may enact more,
but not less, strict laws. These laws reflect society's view that citizens
have every right to expect their private connnunications to be free from
unwarranted intrusion, whether such communications be by wire, electronic
means, or by old-fashioned voiceto-voice over a desk in a lawyer's office.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But shouldn't the attorney and client use encryption out of prudence? (Encryption
is an electronic lockand-key technology based on algorithms that makes messages
and stored data unreadable to anyone except the sender and intended recipient.)
Encryption presents a host of policy challenges that have yet to be resolved.
Strong encryption is banned from export as a &quot;munition.&quot; There
are questions about who should have access to the keys. Some nations, such
as France, ban encryption entirely. Yet some form of encryption may become
the foundation of electronic commerce, not because of privilege or the need
to maintain it, but because of the need for a secure payment systems. (Criminals
also enjoy the idea of ubiquitous and strong encryption as a means of thwarting
legitimate law enforcement surveillance.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the degree of privacy necessary for communications should be
a business decision, not one based on fear of losing the privilege umbrella
for the entire transaction. Nor should the decision to use encryption be
based on fear that someone could otherwise use readily available and easily
modified technology to unlawfully intercept the communication. If that were
the criteria, all business would have to be conducted under the &quot;cone
of silence&quot; and cellular phones would be as rare as Maxwell Smart's
shoe phone. <BR>

<PRE>

<B>NETIZENS</B> - the community of Internet users - bear a strong resemblance to Americans of the 
Wild West.  They are fiercely independent, value their privacy and have a strong distrust of laws 
made in Washington, D.C. Nonetheless, even the Wild West was tamed as the rule of law replaced 
frontier Justice.


The Internet already is home to some 40 million users and growing exponentially as networks 
join networks.  With a &quot;point and click,&quot; data and opinions move over the world.  In such a wired 
world, bringing law to the Internet will not be easy.  In fact, it will not be possible at all if nations 
act unilaterally, piecemealing the Internet into jurisdictions with conflicting laws and liabilities.  We 
need what some have called a <B><I>Magna Carta for the Information Age</I></B>.


First, it must be understood that anything as massive as the Internet cannot be &quot;regulated&quot; in any 
meaningful manner.  It was designed to be a self-healing network of diverse platforms capable of 
operating under the most adverse of conditions - nuclear holocaust.  The Internet evolved from 
military use to link the world's leading universities and research facilities together; and ultimately, 
it passed into private hands where its commercial growth has been astonishing.


Today, anyone can set up a &quot;home page&quot; on the World Wide Web and bring ideas to the 
marketplace free of media filters or goverrunent censorship in this or other countries.  In the 
greatest of American traditions, the Internet has unleashed an army of pamphleteers&quot; who are 
'udged, no doubt harshly sometimes, on the merit of their ideas in the marketplace.  Increasingly, 
people also will get news from the Internet, a revolutionary change that will affect politics, culture 
and commerce forever.  In short, the Internet has come too far to be constrained by any one 
government.  For the putative regulator, the message is simple: Law will never keep up with the 
Internet.


For example, China could massacre students in Tiananmen Square but could not &quot;ban&quot; the 
Internet from carrying the news of its infamy.  Now the Chinese government itself is getting into 
the Internet through deals with multinational telecommunications giants.  But if China believes that 
it can control the Internet this way, it may find that the genie is already out of the bottle.  The 
Internet is bigger than China and it crosses all borders free of customs.
Then what is all of the talk about bringing law to Internet? As the Net has become more popular, 
the public - or perhaps more correctly, the politicians - have discovered that there are some dark 
back alleys on the Internet where pornographers and fraudsters lie in wait for the next Internet 
tourist.  But to listen to the politicians and the media outlets, one would think that the Internet was 
dominated by virtual voyeurs, techno-pedophiles and purveyors of electronic smut.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth, as anyone who has visited the popular Louvre or the Smithsonian Web 
sites can attest.


Yet, as the Telecommunications Act of 1995 heads into a conference between the U.S. Senate 
and House, one would think that the only important issue regarding the Internet is regulation of 
pornography.  There is a glaring absence of debate or discussion about the Internet overall, and 
what exists is uninformed.


Some may prefer it that way, but there are a host of important legal issues raised by the Internet 
that should occupy the minds of Congress.  If commerce is to succeed on the Internet, certainty 
and security are prerequisites.  Here there is a need for bringing law to the Internet, and for care in 
doing so.  Too much law may stifle the use of the Net for business purposes; too little law and the 
uncertainty associated with risks and liability of using these new technologies may dissuade some 
that would otherwise embrace such an open network for trade.
If security is to be achieved, we need to come to grips with the use and export of strong 
encryption. (Encryption is a software lock and key that prevents others from viewing or altering 
the content of communications without authorization key.) Recent stories about Netscape 
Communications' encryption standard being cracked in Europe carried the wrong headline.  The 
story should have decried the ban on export of software with stronger encryption, which Netscape 
makes and markets in the United States and which has not been compromised.  Although the fact 
that some U.S. companies are put at a competitive disadvantage in the growing Internet 
applications market is important, there are strong privacy concerns associated with encryption and 
cryptography.


It was only a year ago that the government sought to hold the keys to every encrypted message 
through a required &quot;Clipper Chip.&quot; The firestorm of opposition was great and the idea was 
dropped.  Now the Clinton administration proposes a system of public key encryption where a 
trusted third party would hold the keys to the communication and the government would have 
access only on the same basis as it would for a wiretap.  It remains to be seen whether this 
proposal will meet with the same opposition from Netizens concerned about their privacy in 
cyberspace and the intrusion of government into the Net.


One thing is for sure, however, as the encryption debate progresses: There must be a careful 
balance between legitimate privacy expectations and legitimate law-enforcement requirements.  
Marry strong encryption to a secure network and the first subscriber will be the Cali drug cartel and 
an army of money launderers.  How will the government fight them without the capability to surf 
the Net in pursuit of any criminal? Allow the government too much latitude on the Net and the 
amount of information about our personal lives that can be gathered from monitoring our use of the 
Internet is enormous, raising Big Brotherlike concerns.  The public certainly deserves adequate 
safeguards in the law against government intrusion as well as third-party misuse.


The same balance is needed in coping with credit-card misuse on the Net and by the coming use 
of digital cash.  The rule of law must be to punish the fraudster in the same way, whether his 
medium of exchange is the Internet or a cold call over the telephone.


Indeed, this should be the standard for every aspect of law and regulation related to the Internet.  
Where there is a legitimate regulatory concern - health, safety or welfare - there is room for a law 
that proscribes the offending conduct.  But the resulting law should be medium-neutral; that is, 
fraud should be no more or less illegal because it occurs over the Internet.


We cannot leave it to distant or uninfon-ned politicians to devise the rules of the road, nor can we 
rely exclusively on Internet frontier justice and custom and usage to achieve the certainty business 
demands in today's world of electronic commerce.</PRE>

<Title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Nine -- PFF</title>
<h3>Renewing American Civilization</h3>

Class Nine Replacing A Culture Of Poverty And Violence With A Culture Of
Productivity And Safety<P>
March 4, 1995<P>
Reinhardt College<P>
<PRE>
>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia.

>From Reinhardt College in Waleska, Georgia, this is "Renewing American
Civilization." In this, the ninth of 10 class presentations, Congressman
Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at Reinhardt College, will continue his
course, which presents the foundational principles necessary to the renewal
of American Civilization.  This week's lesson, Replacing the Culture of
Poverty and Violence, focuses on replacing the culture of poverty and
violence with a culture of productivity and safety.

>>Let me welcome everyone this morning, and in particular, welcome the
>>students of Mind Extension University who are joining us by television.
>>Let me remind them that you can mail your comments to: Renewing American
>>Civilization, post office box 6008, in Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or you
>>can fax your comments to 404- 528-9806.  Or you can e-mail your comments
>>to America Online, renewam@aol. com.  You can get class transcripts and
>>other class materials on the Internet web page http://www.pff.org.  And
>>you can order "American Civilization," the newspaper, and video and audio
>>tapes and course readings by calling 1-800-to-renew.
</pre>
And I'd remind everybody that the last would seem so obvious, would have
been impossible 50 years ago, and probably our grandchildren will regard
all those except the computer on line as sort of irrelevant.
<p>
The five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the Historic Lessons
of American Civilization.  Second, Personal Strength.  Third,
Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise.  Fourth, the Spirit of Invention and
Discovery.  And, fifth, Quality as described by Edwards Deming.
<p>
And we are applying these five pillars to four areas: the Third Wave and
American Civilization.  How will the information age affect us?  Second,
creating jobs, American jobs, in the world market.  Third, replacing the
culture of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.
And, fourth, citizenship and community in 21st century America.
<p>
Now, today's topic is actually the third of those four topical areas,
Replacing The Culture Of Poverty And Violence With A Culture Of
Productivity And Safety.  And if you'll notice, we've described this in a
very specific way, which I'll come back to.  But that is a replacement of a
culture with another culture.  So it's not just helping the poor or
focusing on the inner cities or anything narrow.
<p>
But this is literally a discussion about two cultures.  We start this
analysis with a belief that the current welfare system has failed.  And
this is at the heart of it.  That the system we're currently paying tax
money to pay for has simply not achieved the results we want.  In fact, I
would assert that no civilization can survive with 12-year-olds having
babies, 15-year- olds killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of aids, and
18-year- olds getting diplomas they can't read.
<p>
And these are not just apocryphal sort of things, but if you watch your
local evening news, you know that every one of these tragedies is happening
in America today.  This particular session is based on the premise that
efforts to repair or improve the current welfare system are doomed to fail
because they misunderstand the holistic nature of the problem.
<p>
Now, holistic's an important word for -I'm going to take just a second.  In
a holistic model, everything inside the model has to be taken into account.
Whereas in a reductionist model, you can break it down into a series of
building blocks, and you can say, okay, which of these do we want to deal
with first? It's a very big difference between the two.
<p>
In this model, the holistic model, every piece depends on the other pieces.
And so if you don't deal with the totality, it doesn't work.  In this
model, the pieces can be fixed independently of each other.
<p>
Now, we're going to come back to this in a minute, but I want to start with
the notion that the very first problem is that it is the system and the
culture which are the problems.  And that piecemeal efforts to repair the
system and its culture of poverty and violence are, therefore, irrelevant
and doomed to fail.  So that every time we say, "well, let's do a specific
small piece, because at least we will make progress," no, the answer is
you'll have no impact at all, or virtually no impact.
<p>
Because let's say we'll go in and we'll say, okay, "we're going to really
work on 4-year-olds in Headstart." That's fine.  When they are 8-year-olds
in the same culture of poverty and violence that they were in back when
they were 4-year-olds, but now they're outside of the environment of
Headstart, they start to revert very rapidly.  Not because Headstart wears
off, which is what people said at one time.  But because the power of a
culture to attract you, to say, this is - what cultures do is they tell
you, this is the right behavior.
<p>
This is the thing you'll be rewarded for.  This is the thing people will
praise you for.  And so what happens is the culture of poverty and violence
is so powerful that if all you do is try to change one piece of it, the
whole rest of it will come back in.  We say, why don't you go to work? And
you say, "fine," and so we create up here the work program.
<p>
What we don't do is check and find out that if you go to work, you lose
Medicaid.  So the minute you go to work, you lose Medicaid.  One of your
children gets sick, you promptly lose all the money you just worked for,
all of your neighbors then laugh at you.  You got -- you were a sucker.
Why did you go do that?
<p>
If you just sat -- you know, if you just stay at home, don't worry about
it, why do you keep listening to all these people who try to improve you?
So what you have is an interlocking system in which both the structure of
rewards and by the system, part of this is, what is it that actually
happens when you engage in behavior?  You go tell the police something.
Are you better off, or are you more likely then to be shot or beaten up or
killed for having squealed?  Are the police capable of protecting of your
house, or are the police incapable of protecting it?  Are you better off to
keep your mouth shut and not be a target?
<p>
We had a girl in Washington, D. C. , who dropped out of school because she
witnessed a stabbing.  And the girls who participated in the stabbing were
saying they would kill her if she talked to the police, so she's
cross-pressured between the police and her parents saying, "gee, why don't
you do the honest thing," and her immediate peers saying, "why don't we
just kill you if you do the honest thing"?
<p>
Now, to change any one piece of this without thinking through the change of
the whole piece doesn't get you anywhere.  So we have to start, I think, by
looking at four key realities which define any solution to the problems of
violence and poverty.  Reality one is that when individuals are caught
within a dysfunctional culture, they must transfer their loyalties,
beliefs, and behaviors to another culture to truly change their behavior.
This is why if you look at Al-Anon or Alcoholics Anonymous or any of those
programs, they are a conversion experience.  They say, yesterday I was an
active alcoholic.  Today I am a recovering alcoholic.  Yesterday when I
felt anxiety-ridden, I took a drink.  Today when I feel anxiety- ridden, I
go to my AA's meeting and talk to my friends, or I pray or I -- but there's
a conscious effort to rebuild the entire person and to recognize that the
transition from this system to another system is a decisive moment.
<p>
And if you don't have a support structure, if you don't have something
which helps you when you start to slide back, you're going to break down.
The folks at Covenant House, which is the leading Catholic program for
girls who have run away or who are pregnant, teenagers who need help, they
have arule that you have to work from day one.
<p>
They also talk about the inevitable Tuesday Syndrome, and they say what
happens to every person is there comes the Tuesday morning they don't want
to go to work.  Either they got in an argument with their boss or they
don't feel very good or they're just depressed or whatever.  That they
really need a hand that reaches out at that point and talks to them and
nurtures them and carries them across their depression.  Or they break down
and they leave.  And that that's the crisis.  They say that it's absolutely
inevitable, and almost always occurs on Tuesdays.  That they make it
through Monday on willpower, they've had the weekend off, but then Tuesday
morning, they just say, "I can't do it."
<p>
So what you're trying to do -- and I'll use this as -- the symbols mean
nothing.  I'm using a circle here.  I'll use a square here.  Okay -- is you
are literally saying to people, we want you to go from this holistic model
to this one.  Different culture and system in the two models.  In this one,
working is dumb.  In this one, working is good.  In this one, going to work
means you lose economically.  In this one, going to work means you win
economically.  Different culture, a different system.
<p>
To show you an example of that culture, Samuel Golden wrote a book about
growing up on the East Side.  And I just want to -- in terms of everything
you've heard about poor neighbors, poor problems, people who have
difficulties, this is his description of the turn of the century in New
York city in the poorest neighborhood.  Quote -- now, I want you to just
listen to the optimistic, positive tone of his description of exactly the
same neighborhood.  These both can occur at exactly the same income level.
Not a change in money.  Being without money and being poor are two
different things.  This is the core problem we're faced with because we
don't -- we have messed up these two distinctions.  This is what Samuel
Golden wrote about his childhood, "where else on earth among the poorest
people did you see in every home a blue and white box where you were
supposed to drop your pennies?  "once a week, an old woman would come
around and empty it, and off it would go somewhere overseas.  "the poorest
of the poor helping still poorer ones across the Atlantic somewhere.
"hundreds of sweat shop employees, men and women who sat at machines for
nine and 10 hours a day, came home, washed up, had supper, and went to the
lodge hall or settlement houses to learn English or to listen to a fellow
read poetry to them.  "paid readers of poetry.  "I saw it.  "I saw
gangsters and bums, but I also saw poets, settlement workers, welfare
workers, scribes, teachers, philosophers, all hoping and striving for one
goal, to break away.  "and they did too.  "America gave them all hope in
life, and they repaid America.  "there has never been a more even trade."
<p>
Now, he was talking about the same level of despair, the same level of
poverty, the same level of hopelessness, the same level of confusion, but
because it was optimistically oriented towards a better future, it changed.
He's talking about people who worked all day and then took a couple of
pennies, maybe an hour's work, to go and pay the poet reader to the
community center to take -- to give them part of their soul as well as
food.
<p>
This was the real world.  This is not mythical.  This is not some theory.
This was America at the turn of the century.  And I want to thank Kathleen
Minnix for finding that, because I really think it begins to make vivid the
healthy world of being without money which led to two generations of
strength, versus the unhealthy world of being without money which has led
to two generations of disaster.
<p>
But part of the reason I think that it's hard for us to really change
things is that we underestimate the second reality, cultural change is very
hard.  It requires tremendous persistence over time, and can often only be
achieved one person at a time.  I think part of what happens to us is we
say, "okay, I'm willing to do this for, like, up to a year and a half."
Well, at a year -- it's a little bit like a farmer who says, "I'll grow
corn as long as it makes it in three weeks.  "doesn't make it in three
weeks, I'm throwing that sucker out and replanting."
<p>
You know, the fact is, breaking through in a culture and getting people to
start dramatically changing their behavior and then getting to enough
individuals, because first what happens is you find one, and then two and
then three, and then they find one, and then gradually you begin to peel
away the whole culture.
<p>
The greatest study of this is the rise of the Wesleyan movement in Britain
in the 18th century, which changed the entire habit of the industrial poor.
And probably is the major reason Britain did not have a political
revolution in the 18th century.
<p>
But if you go back and look at the chapel movement of John Wesley and how
Methodism, as it was called, impacted on the English working poor, it is
astonishing, but it starts small, it's very frustrating, and it doesn't fit
either the news media or the government's need for instant gratification.
It's just very hard, very difficult work.
<p>
The third reality is that this kind of cultural change is best done outside
government.  And I would argue that with the exception of the military's
ability to have boot camp, there is virtually no government program that
gets the level of cultural change you need inside government for the very
reason that governments are very bad agencies of acculturation.
<p>
I mean, all of you would be furious if you had some bureaucrat trying to
acculturate you.  You'd say, wait a second, I pay taxes.  Who are you to
tell me whether I ought to be in the circle or the square?  Are you nuts?
You work for me.  I don't work for you.  And so you'd have a very hard time
ever getting an agreement for this kind of cultural change delivered by
government, and this kind of change requires missionaries.
<p>
This requires the person who sits there at 3:00 o'clock in the morning
holding the hand of the person who is about to commit suicide.  By
definition, I mean, you find wonderful government employees.  You find
people who are individually fabulous, but you can't recruit to a
bureaucracy on the premise you'll stay there as long as they need you.  You
can recruit to a volunteer organization on that premise.  Very different
models.
<p>
And so we sometimes get mad at the bureaucracy, because we ask it to do
things it can't do, instead of being more careful about what government can
do and what other sections can do.  I would argue that government and
politicians have found the first three realities unacceptable.  They have,
therefore, tried to find piecemeal short-term improvements that at least
meet their political needs and the public's desire to get something done.
<p>
So what you've had is, for 30 years now, a series of underfinanced,
short-sighted, small efforts to get one thing or another to work, when, in
fact, this requires a big effort.  You know, if you think back to our --
looking at the Normandy Invasion, 74 small invasions would not have added
up to Normandy.  Normandy required that you consolidate all the effort into
one massive, all-out effort.  This is the same way.  Having 74 different
tiny programs just means you've thrown the money away.  Doesn't mean you
can break through.  And what you have to have -- you can have a tiny
program, but the tiny program's goal has to be changing the whole thing.
It has to be to move people out of this culture and system into this one.
<p>
Which is the fourth reality, that the cultural change must be from one way
of life to another.  Individual changes within the old culture are often
overwhelmed by other aspects of the culture.  Now, this also means we're
saying something that would have been vehemently rejected 20 years ago.
We're saying, basically, that the culture of poverty and violence isn't
acceptable.  There are millions of Americans who live in that culture right
now, and what we're saying to them is, look, it is better to work than to
be dependent.  It is better to be safe than to be in danger.
<p>
Now, the word "better" is very argumentative.  I mean, who are we to start
imposing these what would once have been called middle class, bourgeois
virtues?  And the only good answer is, we have tried a technique of
allowing this to grow, and we can't stand what we see on television.  We
can't stand the pain we're inflicting on the children.  We can't stand the
4-year-old being thrown off the tenement house balcony.  And we just know
that's not right.  And so we have to reluctantly come back to finding some
way of saying, looking, there has to be an improvement.
<p>
Now, the encouraging thing, and this is -- this will surprise people who
are very tired of this, including people, frankly, who have what I would
call compassion exhaustion.  You know, people who have spent 20 years
trying to help, it's never quite worked, they're terribly disappointed.
They ought to be optimistic, and the reason is in America, very powerful
reform movements can emerge very quickly and have very powerful impact.
<p>
You can go from the Montgomery boycott of buses in 1955 to the civil rights
acts of 1964 and 1965 in 10 years and you get to a catalytic moment, you
suddenly begin to have real change real fast.  And you see this by looking
just back at the American history.  Great American reform movements
starting with the great awakening of the 1730s, which was a religious
revival, the revolutionary generation, the Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians,
the abolitionists and the founding of the Republican Party, the progressive
movement, almost every one of those was a 5- to 10- year cycle of beginning
to speed up and consolidate.
<p>
In the more modern era, you had the New Deal, which did most of its best
work in about five years.  The civil rights movement, the Goldwater- Reagan
conservatism, and now, we would argue, Renewing American Civilization.
That each of these are belief systems that emerge, they codify, people say,
"yeah, that's right," and with amazing speed, the country changes itself.
<p>
If you look at the rise of the Abolitionist movement and the Republican
Party, it literally goes from being a sort of fringe idea in the late 1840s
to a major idea by the early 1850s to this best-selling novel of the 19th
century, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," in the 1850s, which also then becomes a
widely seen play to the breakdown of the Whig Party, the creation of the
Republican Party, and the election of the first Republican president in a
six-year period.
<p>
That's how fast things can change when, in fact, you have people beginning
to make their minds up.  The way that has to happen, I think, at an
intellectual level, is you've got to go back to the model we've used before
of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics in order to replace the
culture of poverty and violence with a culture of productivity and safety.
<p>

Now, that is, you've got to think through, what's our vision of
replacement, what are our strategies for replacement, what are the projects
we think will work for replacement, and then what do we do every day to
make that happen.  However, when you think you know what you're doing and
you think you have thought this through, then you have to go out and
practice listen, learn, help, and lead in order to check out the ideas.
<p>
I mean, just because you think it's smart doesn't mean it's smart.  It
means you think it's smart.  Now, you've got to go test it out with lots of
other human beings.  And in particular, I would argue we should listen to
experts, experienced practitioners, and the poor themselves in order to
test out the ideas of replacement.  And I would argue this process should
be ongoing and should lead to Deming's concept of continuous improvement.
That every day we ought to be trying to do slightly better.
<p>
Now, notice the three groups I listed, experts, that is, people who study
it; experienced practitioners, that is, people who are living it.  So at
one level, you say, who are the best five college professors in America who
study missionary efforts among the poor?  But then it's pretty useful to go
out and findfive or 10 people who are missionary efforts among the poor.
Because it may well be as you listen to the actual practitioner, that their
experience is more complicated and more human and has a different quality
to it.
<p>
It's like talking to a football quarterback versus reading the "Sports
Illustrated" version.  Or talking to a gourmet chef and reading a good
cookbook.  Then, frankly, you need to sit down and listen to the poor for a
while.  Now, the poor are not definitive by definition, because the poor
are trapped in this culture.  And you're trying to describe a culture they,
by definition, don't -aren't in.  So they can't by themselves tell you
that's right or wrong, but they can raise a ton of questions and they can
tell you what doesn't seem right about it.  And they can force you to keep
thinking through your model.
<p>
Because remember, you're outside this world by definition.  Now, one or two
of you may have grown up in it and may well have grown out of it, in which
case you have a very useful ability to help, although even there you've got
to be very cautious, because sometimes the person who had the unique
personal strength to rise doesn't quite understand why their brothers and
sisters and cousins didn't make it.
<p>
So there's no -- this is not a simple thing.  I'm going back to what I said
a while ago, this is very hard.  We have failed at it because we keep
trying to reduce it to a level of simplicity that will make it easy.  It
isn't, and it won't be.
<p><PRE>
>>and on that note, how come the former poor aren't listed in that list of
>>people that we should listen to, people that have actually climbed out of
>>the system?

>>For the very reason I was giving, because unless they are in some way

>>So they're useful to listen to.

>>I would argue that the unique experience is that of the person who broke

>>Maybe.  I'm just saying to you that person may be helpful.  I'm not

>>wouldn't automatically accept their view, because they may have such
>>unique personal strengths.  It's worth listening to them and it's worth
>>saying, now, how did it happen to you?  And what did you do?
</pre>
And I'm all -- I'm for that.  I work with a lot of people who fit that
category, but I wouldn't just accept them, because they very often are very
strong personalities.  They're very smart.  They have a lot -- they may
have had the one unique relative who helped them, okay?  What you're trying
to also figure out is, what about the ones who aren't as smart or they
don't have strong habits or they didn't have an aunt who raised them?
<p><PRE>
>>I think Arnold Schwarzenegger can literally do anything in the world that
>>he -- that he -- I mean, he has an amazing power of concentration.  That

>>-- it doesn't take anything --

>>No, no.  Okay, I can't argue with you for very long, but individuals can

>>country where this happens every morning.  And by the way, it also goes
>>the reverse.  I mean, one of the things that's fascinating to study in
>>America is people slide out of success into having no money on a regular
>>basis.
</pre>
I mean, this is a country where people go bankrupt routinely, so you have
people - in any generation, you have some people who rise and some people
who fall and so forth.  That's -- what you're trying to do here, though, is
walk into a community and take 20,000 people in downtown Atlanta and figure
out, under what circumstances will we help them one by one move?
<p>
Now, it's useful to talk to people who have done it, and I think it's also
particularly useful to bring them back here.  I mean, one of the great
tragedies, frankly, is that when very successful people leave the inner
city, they won't go back.  It's a very real problem of getting them to come
back in and having them be witnesses who say, look, I made it.  You can
make it, too.  That's helpful.  But they may not fully understand the
complexity of helping a person who is weaker than they are, has less will
power than they do, and isn't just purely as intelligent.
<p>
In terms of making -- it wouldn't hurt to add them in here, but don't
overstate the ability of somebody like that in and of themselves to do it.
They're very helpful as witnesses more than they are, I think,
automatically as analysts.  Let me also suggest to you that the vision that
we want to establish is that every American is endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.  So it will seem obvious to you until you take
seriously every American.
<p>
But if we actually mean that sentence as our vision, it then has a second
sentence, we owe it to every American citizen to involve in a culture and a
system which ensures their god-given rights and responsibilities as full
citizens.
<p>
Now, again, the key here is "every American." We all sort of say it, well,
of course that's true.  Ah, but are we determined to -- are we really
determined to live it out?  Are we really determined to say every child
born in 1995 should absolutely grow up in that kind of framework?  That's a
big order.
<p>
Now, I think it leads you to three really simple principles that are the
visionary principles, every citizen is an American, every neighborhood is
part of America, and every child is an American child.  But the minute you
accept that, then you have to say to yourself, wow, this is a big
challenge.  And you can't avoid it.  Because every time a child dies for
lack of prenatal care or a child gets killed in a drive-by shooting or a
child ends up in a room where they're not going to learn anything, we have
failed in our vision-level commitment that every American has the right to
pursue happiness.
<p><PRE>
>>so what you're saying, in essence, the difference between one culture --
>>I mean, one culture together is more responsibilities.  Over here you're
>>giving them their rights to have those, but over here --

>>No, not just responsibility.  What we have done is we have basically cut
>>a deal with the poor.  We said, starting in the late 1960s, we'll
>>maintain you.  We'll send you money.  Now, being selfish middle-class
>>people, we never sent enough money, but the theory was, we'll send money.
>>We won't demand you change your behavior.  You want to have your kids
>>born in total ignorance?  Hey, it would be inappropriate for us to
>>interfere.  You want to go to a local school that doesn't work?  Well, at
>>least it's not a school we send our kids to.
</pre>
So we'll give lip service to changing it, but the truth is, we won't change
it.  We'll just have study commissions that will say, yes, they should do
better.  And the result is what you have allowed to happen over a 30 --
what we have all allowed to happen over a 30-year period, is these people
don't have -- they do not have what the declaration of independence
guarantees them.
<p>
Now, to do that, you've got to, for example, reestablish safety.  Any
American who's physically threatened is being cheated of the constitutional
provision to provide for the common security.  Because danger can be
domestic as well as foreign.  I mean, I swear to uphold the constitution
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Well, if it's a person walking
into your room to kill you, whether that person's wearing a foreign uniform
or blue jeans, your rights as an American are about to be exterminated.
<p>
So you have to start with the idea, are we prepared to protect you
physically?  How much are we prepared to protect you physically?  When
you're born, do we want to encourage a system where you actually have --
where your mother has a sense of responsibility?  There you're right; there
you start getting into responsibility.  But do we also want to figure out
some way to make sure that health care is nearby if your mother's willing
to be responsible?  When you show up for school the first time, should it
actually be a room where you might learn?  Does that matter?
<p>
I mean, these are -- by the time you start thinking through how the system
works and how today we coerce people into monopolies that fail, you will
live in public housing, you will go to the public school, you will be on
streets that are unsafe.  Gee we're really sorry, but after all, life's
hard.  You know, there's a huge, huge change from here to here.
<p>
This is, again, one of the things we keep kidding ourselves about.  If you
truly want healthy inner cities, if you truly want healthy Indian
reservations and you truly want healthy West Virginia Appalachian poor
neighborhoods, you're talking about a big change.  This is not a small
change.  This is one of the largest changes in American history.  And we
just don't take it seriously.  We pay lip service to it, and then we say
-then we walk off and then the kid gets killed and then we say, "gee,
that's sad."
<p>
And what I'm suggesting is, if we take that child seriously as an American
and we take the declaration seriously as a document and the constitution
and then we decide in our generation we're fed up with it and we're going
to actually shoulder the responsibility as a country, all of us, including
the poor, of making the transition, we're taking on a big challenge.  Maybe
in some ways as big as the Cold War.  It's not going to be a small thing
and it's not going to happen overnight.
<p>
Now, I think that to understand our strategies of replacement, we must
revisit the five pillars of American Civilization.  We have to look at the
historic lessons of American Civilization.  We have to look at personal
strength, at entrepreneurial free enterprise, at the spirit of invention
and discovery, and at quality as defined by Edwards Deming.
<p>
Now, I can give this lecture this time totally different, or not --
dramatically different.  I won't say totally, I'll say 60% different than a
year ago because of the help of several people, and the first one I want to
thank is Marvin Olasky.  This is "the Tragedy of American Compassion." It
is the book which, frankly, for me, unlocked the key to how to do this, and
I think it is one of the most extraordinary books written in our
generation.  Olasky went back, and you'll understand my bias in a second, I
mean -- and by the way, I want to thank Marvin Olasky, because he helped
write this -- today's session and was very generous in giving his time and
outlining how he would approach it.  What he did -- and this fits my bias
as a history teacher -- he went back and looked at 350 years of how
Americans dealt with poverty, tragedy, and addiction with much greater
success than the current welfare state.
<p>
When you begin to read his book, those of you who are not used to reading
lots of history, you're going, why does he have me in the founding of the
colonies?  And why does he start here at the very beginning with Jamestown
and with the early American model of compassion?  Now, when he says early
American model on page 6, he's talking about Plymouth in 1620.  I mean,
he's really gone back and you're kind of going, why am I reading this?  He
talks about Fairfield, Connecticut, in 1673.  But what he shows you chapter
by chapter is a consistency about how Americans thought about poverty and
how they thought about helping the poor that is astonishing.  What the
traditional reformers warned against is precisely what the welfare state
did, and when you read Olasky, you realize that based on American history,
the welfare state is virtually a design for guaranteed failure.
<p>
I mean, I found -- I read this over Christmas at my mother-in-law's, and I
found myself so startled by the warnings.  Let me give you an example,
"Mary Richmond of the Baltimore charity organizing society summed up in
1897 the wisdom of a century of work, quote - - and I want you to think
about this in terms of the system your taxes pay for today.  Quote, relief
given without reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral
loss.  Poor neighborhoods are doomed to grow poorer whenever the natural
ties of neighborliness are weakened by well meant, but unintelligent
interference.  Let me go back to the key sentence, "relief given without
reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral loss."
<p>
Now, what is the very definition of AFDC, food stamps, et cetera?  An
anonymous person walks into an anonymous office to deal with an anonymous
bureaucrat to have an anonymous transaction.
<p><PRE>
>>faceless bureaucratic --

>>right?  You have the faceless poor and the faceless bureaucrat engaged in
>>a faceless interaction.  By con --

>>there's also a lack of accountability on their part, because --

>>Right, totally.  But it also leads to a depersonalization that's

>>about how one man was sunk into dependency, but a volunteer, quote, with

</pre>
I mean, imagine the average caseworker with 200 families on their caseload
trying to deal in this kind of intense relationship.  It states further,
quote, intelligent giving -- this is the New Orleans charity organization
society of 1899 -intelligent giving and intelligent withholding are alike
true charity.  Now, imagine saying to your local welfare office,
intelligent giving and intelligent withholding are alike true charity.  Or
saying at the same time, quote, if drink has made a man poor, money will
feed not him, but his drunkenness.  We send supplemental security -- just
think about it.  We send supplemental security insurance checks to
alcoholics and addicts.  Let me repeat the quote from the new Orleans
charity organization, 18 -- if drunk -- if drink has made a man poor, money
will feed not him but his drunkenness.  Poverty fighters a century ago
trained volunteers to leave behind, quote, a conventional attitude toward
the poor, seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions.
<P>
I mean, one of the things that comes through the Olasky book again and
again is there are many poor people who will game the system.  When you let
them game the system, you are helping them destroy themselves.  You have an
obligation to love them enough to be firm with them, not just to love them
enough to give.
<P>
Barriers against fraud were important not only to prevent waste, but to
preserve morale among those who were working hard to remain independent.
And I want you to think about this quote and what happened to poor
Americans in the last 30 years.  Quote, nothing is more demoralizing to the
struggling poor than the successes of the indolent.  In other words, if
you're a working poor and you get up every day and you go to a job that
isn't all that much fun and you're out there trying very hard to make a
decent living and your cousin is sitting at home doing nothing, drinking
every night, and getting as much money as you are, the moral devastation as
you try to teach your children to follow your path of sobriety and hard
work while your cousin makes fun of you every day for being stupid, when you
could be gaming the system.
<P>
Okay?  Saying -- it was an important quote, and I want you to listen to
this.  This is a very harsh quote, and I want you to think about all the
nice people you know who have automatically given money to the homeless.
It was important to, quote, reform those mild, well-meaning,
tender-hearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in
indiscriminate charity.
<P>
This was a reformer of the late 19th century.  New York charity leader
Josephine Lowell said, quote, the problem before those who would be
charitable is not how to deal with a given number of the poor.  It is how
to help those who are poor without adding to their numbers and constantly
increasing the evils they seek to cure.  And what the modern welfare said
is, we're not going to worry about that.  Anybody who shows up, take care
of them, here's the money, and the result was a system which has been, in
human terms, devastating.
<P>
And again, Olasky's "he Tragedy of American Compassion" is far and away the
best single statement of this I've read and is -- I think a work of epoch.
I mean, it will change the whole way we think about this.  Now, for 350
years, reformers had a remarkably similar set of requirements and judgments
about how to help the poor and the addicted and what would actually hurt
rather than help, and it's very important to look at the lessons they set
up and the codification, which we'll come back to, which Olasky made of
them.
<P>
The lessons of American history are, one, we should expect the welfare
state to fail.  Two, there is an historically proven model of American
success with which we can replace the current failure.
<P>
Now, let's move then -begin to look at that, and if you'd look at pillar
two, which is personal strength, we're going to come right back to Olasky.
There are three key aspects of personal strength in replacing the culture
of poverty and violence.  One, there are seven characteristics of personal
strength the traditional reformers understood and applied.  This is the
Olasky model.  Two, personal strength is ultimately spiritual, and
therefore private rather than governmental.  And, three, compassion
requires your personal strength more than your money.  And I'm going to
come back to that one, because it will put a little burden on all of us.
<P>
Interestingly, Olasky said that the seven characteristics the 19th century
reformers put together were from "a" to "g," and that they codified them
that way.  They said that you can literally set up a list of steps from "a"
to "g" in how you think about helping the poor.  "a" is for affiliation.
Who is there out there who knows something about this person?  Who can you
-- do they have a friend?  Do they have a family?  Do they have a neighbor?
Who can rebond with them as a human being, which is what "b" is.
<P>
"b" is for bonding.  That if you decide you have to help this person
because nobody they're affiliated with is helping them, then you need to
have one person who truly gets to know them.  And according to Olasky, in
the 19th century, we averaged one volunteer for every two poor people.  We
didn't just take your tax money and say, "stay home, the welfare worker
will take care of them." We said -- and I'm going to come back to this --
"if you truly care, find somebody and help them," and the result was the
average poor person knew a middle-class person.  There was a relationship.
We broke down the barriers.
<P>
"c" is for categorization, things like using work tests and background
checks to distinguish.  For example, they routinely required everybody to
work before they got fed.  If you were homeless and you showed up at the
door, you had to cut wood, and you usually cut wood both for yourself and
you cut wood for a widow woman, because you ought to have dignity.  If you
were a woman and you showed up, they often had a sewing room very often
next to a nursery area so there was a place where you could watch your
children while you did work.  But their principle was if you're not
prepared to do some work, you're a bum.  Why are we feeding you?
<P>
Now, a bum, I realize, is a politically incorrect term that will soon rival
giraffe and other things, but I want you to think about it.  I mean, you go
through Olasky's book and over and over, they're prepared to categorize
people, and they say to them, you want to help yourself, we'll be partners.
You don't want to help yourself, I owe you nothing.  And again, I mean,
try sometime walking through a major city and every homeless person that
walks up to them and say, "I will give you $20 if you'll work for me for
one hour" and just see what their reaction is.  Say, "I'm glad your here.
"I have a job right this minute.  "let's go.  "I'll pay you 20 bucks." Now,
if they won't do it, why are you giving them a penny?  What is your
obligation to subsidize their addiction?  And in fact, isn't that the least
caring thing you could do?  Let me get you off my mind.  I'll feel better,
you'll get -- you'll get whatever drug you use.  The fact that you may die
isn't my problem.  I did my thing.  I gave you money.  I'm a good person.
<P>
And the reformers of the 19th century drove at that attitude very hard and
said, that is false charity.  That makes you feel good.  It does not help
the person.  It's what Morris schechtman describes in "working without a
net" as caretaking rather than caring.  The caretakers feel kind, fine
about themselves.  I did a good thing.  The person they supposedly cared
for may die.  It's not my fault.
<P><PRE>
>>but you may die in the process, too, because, I mean, there's been so
>>many incidents of taking poor people, knocking on your door, asking for
>>work, and then the next thing they do is kill you and rob you.

>>they have some instances of that, but I would argue for most of us, we
>>could find ways to help the poor that don't run that risk. I didn't
>>suggest you take them home necessarily.

>>well, no, they knock on your door all the time, but, you know, you're
>>hesitant to let them in because of personal safety and the safety of your
>>family.

>>yeah.  There's some of that.

>>that's not the only element that we see in the inner city, and the
>>question is this, because what we're talking about's great in theory, but
>>because we're an incentive, motivated civilization --

>>why don't you let me finish?

>>I'm sorry.

>>Yeah, that's right.  "d" is for discernment, and discernment is learning
>>how to say "no" in the short run so as to produce better results.  It's
>>literally saying there are times you deliberately turn people down
>>because you're trying to get a lesson across, you're trying to show them
>>a different way of thinking.
</pre>
"e" is for employment.  They required work from every able-bodied person,
period.  They thought it was inherent in being a human being.
<p>
"f" is for freedom.  In their mind, once you got into government programs,
you were enslaved.  And so they worked very, very hard to help people
remain free in a way that was powerful and effective.
<p>
And finally, "g" is for God.  That all of these -- all of the systems
emphasized the spiritual, not just the material and said, you know, I mean,
if you have no relationship -- if you have no spiritual -- they didn't
necessarily emphasize a particular sect, but they said, if you don't pray,
you have no spiritual life, you have no sense of a larger being than
yourself, why shouldn't you be an addict?
<p>
I mean, look how bleak your world is.  And so there was a constant -- so if
you take those seven, and let me just reread them for one second, because I
do think they're useful just as a set, affiliation, bonding,
categorization, discernment, employment, freedom, and god were the core of
this.  Now, compare the Olasky seven with the principles of the welfare
state: affiliation versus isolated individualism.  Bonding versus
impersonal bureaucracy.  Categorization versus automatic maintenance.  Just
look at those to start with.  In the 19th century, we said, who are you
related to?  In the 20th century, you say, oh, that would be an
inappropriate question.  After all, it's not the bureaucracy's business.
Do you need a check or not?  In the 19th century, we would have said, we
are going to have a personal relationship, and we are going to try to help
you and we're going to get to know each other.  In the 20th century, the
bureaucrat has 200 families.  They can't possibly get to know people
individually.  In the 19th century, there was a very deliberate
categorization, are you really capable of working?  Should you really be
helped?  What kind of help should you get?  How can we get you back on your
feet?  In the 20th century, you deserve AFDC, you deserve food stamps.  Who
are we to interfere?  And again, the government can't interfere at this
level, because you'd have to be setting up virtually a dictatorship.
<p>
There are other standards.  Look at discernment versus automatic sympathy,
or employment versus no work requirement.  Freedom versus dependence, or
god versus indifference at best, or hostility at worst, to religion and
spirituality.  I mean, this gets so bad, Olasky tells a story of spending
some time in Washington as a homeless person and ending up in a church
basement at a breakfast looking like a homeless person; he'd spent three or
four days on the street.  And he mumbled to the young lady who was serving
breakfast could he have a bible?  And she said, "do you want a bagel?  "we
have a bagel." He said, "no, no." He said, "I want a bible." And she said,
"we don't have any bibles here." This was in the basement of a church.
<p>
But he said in the entire time he was homeless in Washington, there were
plenty of places to sleep, plenty of places to eat, plenty of clothing.  He
did not once have a person talk to him about his spiritual life, about the
need to somehow be saved from what he was going through, or about the
notion that god mattered.  Even though a great deal of the time he was in
religious institutions, but they thought -- they had broken down so far
from their traditional mission that they thought as long as they fed you,
it didn't matter.
<p>
Now, just take those differences and then -- and then recognize that we're
talking about two very different systems.  The one system says, you're an
isolated individual.  We will pay for an impersonal bureaucracy.  It will
automatically maintain you.  If you have a good sob story, we'll
automatically sympathize with you.  We would never dream of requiring you
to work.  We expect you to become dependent.  And your spiritual life is
your own problem, and of course, we're not going to talk to you about it.
<p>
The other model says, we believe you're part of some kind of extended
affiliation with other human beings.  We want to bond with you as a human
being.  We want to understand your problems enough to help you solve your
unique problems.  We're prepared to be very tough-minded with you, because
we actually like you enough to say "no" to you.  We're going to require
that you work so you have a sense of dignity.  We're going to emphasize the
importance of your remaining free and not becoming dependent.  And we
believe that your spiritual life is as important as your physical life.
<p>
Now, it's -- what I said earlier about holistic, it's pretty hard to get a
broader gap in the two models at the core of the two cultures.  And then,
of course, you start building a system that reflects the cultural values.
So we've built a government structure that punishes work, that gives away
money automatically in an anonymous manner.
<p>
But if you're going to change the values, then you've got to shift the
whole structure.  Because one of the arguments of the reformers is if you
create an anonymous way for people to maintain themselves as they decay, a
significant number of people will do just that.  Because to be changed is
hard.  And again, I can't overstate this.  None of the reformers believed
this was easy.  And they all said, if you create in here a center of public
support that makes it easy to avoid change, people will simply destroy
themselves.  They won't automatically change.  People only change when, in
fact, they have very few choices.  And so you've got to decide whether or
not you're willing to toleratethe cost of allowing people to continue to
decay.
<p>
The essence of the Olasky model is that personal strength is inherently
spiritual and explains why private charities rather than governments must
be the primary helpers of the poor.  That if, in fact, you're really going
to have the level of personal involvement we're talking about, first of
all, you could never hire enough bureaucrats to do it.  You have to have
volunteers.  Second, you have to have a voluntary relationship, because the
government represents power on such a scale that if you gave the government
this kind of power, you'd be creating a potential dictatorship.
<p>
So you can't afford to have a government that can interfere in your private
life on this scale.  It would be intolerable.  So if you're going to have
people who are actually out here being that detailed in their interest in
your life, it had better be private sector and you'd better have the option
to say "no." Now, when you say "no," there's a consequence.  They don't
have to give you food.  They don't have to nurture you.  You'd better go
find somebody else to play your game with.  But it's a very, very different
model.
<p>
Lastly, what it says in terms of you as a healthy person with a pretty good
life, your personal strength is more important than your money.  That what
the system really needs is not another $100 billion, it needs about 50
million Americans who are willing to do something as a human being.  But
that enough -- enough Americans who are healthy, who are work-oriented, who
do have pretty good habits, enough Americans willing to reach out and just
help one person.
<p>
Don't try to save Atlanta or don't try to save Washington or don't try to
save Waleska.  Try to save one person.  That the difference you can make in
that process is enormous.  Now, if you save one person, then hopefully,
you'll go on to another person, and you'll challenge the one you saved when
they're on their feet that they'll help somebody, too.  Because what you
began to build was an extended chain of goodwill, where people felt, look,
people helped me when I was young.  I'd better help somebody else.  I will
repay.
<p>
Remember the way Golden described it.  He said, "America gave them all hope
and life, and they repaid America.  "there has never been a more even
trade." And so in a sense, if everybody who is well -- doing well would
then say, "I'll help somebody, but then when I help you, you help
somebody," you create a gradually -- a pretty rapidly expanding cavalcade
of people helping each other.  Okay?  Comments, questions.
<PRE>
>>okay, well, let's go back to this one.  If we are incentive- based, what
>>is the possible incentive for these inner city kids to lay down their
>>guns and their drugs for the money that they're making?  I mean, here
>>we're going to go and offer them an eight- hour-a-day job where they can
>>make three times as much --

>> sure.

>>-- selling horse on the concord.

>>a, they won't die.  B, shame beats cash.

>>we don't --

>>No, but that's the point.  That's why you make the transition.  I mean,
>>read the life of Malcolm X.  I mean, it's -- one morning people say -- I
>>mean, this is what Adam Smith meant when he talked about the man in the
>>mirror in the theory of moral sentiments.  Inside all of us, except the
>>most psychotic -- I mean, there are some people who are psychotics.
>>Those people you frankly just lock up for life.  That's the lesson of
>>"the Silence of the Lambs," is that the doctor who ate people should not
>>have been let out.  It was a bad decision.  Okay?  Hannibal Lechter,
>>right?  And, yes, it is true, I am for the death penalty for Hannibal
>>Lechter, if they ever capture him.
</pre>
The point here is, one, most human beings have an internal compass.  What
Smith said was the man in the mirror, the woman in the mirror.  When you
look in the mirror, are you really happy being that person?  Two, you want
to raise the disincentive for illegal behavior.  You want to make it
dramatically harder to sell drugs and to get away with those kind of
things.  But, three, most -- I mean, mostgirls don't turn to prostitution
even though it pays.  Most kids -- most young men don't turn to
drug-running even though it pays.
<P>
Even in the poorest neighborhoods in America, there is a minority doing bad
things.  In the poorest neighborhood, the vast majority of people are
decent people, who want a chance to earn a living, who want self-respect,
and who want to live as a neighborhood, and so what you've got to do is
reestablish the legitimacy and the authenticity.  And what somebody said
the other day is "reestablishing shame." I mean, you can turn to somebody
who is staggering down the street as a drunk and say, that is shameful.
You shouldn't let your children see you like that.  You've begun to make
the transition from this to this, and in a sense, at one level, I
deliberately used a square, because, of course, this was a joke in the '50s
and early '60s to be square, and what turned out to not be square may mean
doing other things that hurt.  But we'll be back in about 10 minutes, I
reckon.  I'm told we have to take a break or they'll yell at us.
<P><PRE>
>>We're going to pick back up now with how you replace the culture of
>>poverty and violence with a culture of prosperity and safety.  And
>>working our way through the five pillars that are at the heart of
>>American Civilization, we're on pillar three, which is entrepreneurial
>>free enterprise.
</pre>
And again, if you think about everything we talked about when we spent two
hours on entrepreneurial free enterprise, it won't surprise you that almost
by definition, a decentralized, entrepreneurial system will be inherently
more effective than a centralized government bureaucracy.  Now, on the
surface, people will read that and they'll say, "well, yeah, we know that's
true."  That if you have lots of small units each operating on their own,
if they have entrepreneurial incentives and if they have entrepreneurial
leaders who are out there trying to get the job done, it will do better
than a large bureaucratic structure managed by 9:00 to 5:00 bureaucrats.
<P>
People say, "yeah, that's true," and then you say, "okay, so what are we
going to do now? " And the answer is, well, build a bigger bureaucracy, and
there is a huge -- it's called cognitive dissonance.  There is a breakdown
where everything says we ought to go over and do this, but we find
ourselves going over here, and so it's a major problem in, how do you break
down.
<P>
And it's very -- I find it -- if it weren't so tragic and if it wasn't
costing human beings their lives and if it wasn't allowing people literally
to be betrayed and left behind unnecessarily, I think it would be
hysterically funny.
<P>
Now, again, the example I'm going to give you is one we've talked about for
two years.  It absolutely works.  We all know it works.  It actually
changes peoples lives, it actually saves the taxpayer money, and it is
almost impossible to get the government to be willing to use it, because it
eliminates one of the government's functions.  And this is a
private-sector, entrepreneurial model of helping the poor developed by two
former social workers who decided that the social work system they were
engaged in was doomed to fail, and they wanted to design a model to
actually transform people.  This is not a theory.  This is a real program.
It's in New York.  Its called "America Works," and I want you to take a
couple minutes and just take a look at "America Works."

</pre>
Notice also who takes the risk.  They keep the person on their payroll the
first four months.  So they're going to a business and saying, you get to
try this person out for four months.  You pay us.  You don't have to fire
this person.  You don't get any lawsuit.  This is designed to get around
lawsuits.  If you don't like this person on Thursday afternoon, they will
not show up on Friday morning, because they stay on our payroll.  So they
can go to the business.  They have lowered the risk of hiring the
marginally unemployed.  They're now walking in and saying, "hi."  Remember
the ladies you're talking about here.  15 years on welfare.  Now she's
going to go for first time and show up and work?  You're the average
employer?  This person has not been at work in 15 years, in fact, since
ninth grade, so she may never have been at work.  She's now showing up at,
you know, 32, 33 years of age saying, "hi, I'm ready"?
<P>
Well, what "America Works" does is they internalize to them the risk of
putting this lady at work.  So the business has a much lower threshold of
risk so it can gamble bigger, but they've thought through an entire system,
which fits this model.
<P>
And the thing I've been fascinated by is, it has not led 50 states and the
district of Columbia to automatically set up a similar incentive program.
They just don't get it.  I mean, they say, "well, I understand all that,
but here's how we operate."  It's just astonishing to me.  And that's why I
say generically, incentives work in America.  And if you don't -- if you
see a program that doesn't have an incentive, you ought to ask yourself why
it thinks it's working, and then you ought to check to see if it is.  And
what you'll find is it's usually very inefficient, it usually achieves far
below what it claims, because this is a society drawn forward by
incentives.
<P>
One of the projects we developed in order to test out this theory was a
program called Earning by Learning.  It's a project we designed to
implement a strategy to fulfill a vision.  Our vision is that every child
should know about free enterprise, should have a chance to earn a living,
and should know about reading and writing.  We wanted to set up a strategy
of saying, let's move towards an inventive-based model that combines free
enterprise and education in the same model, and the specific project we
designed was what's called Earning by Learning.
<P>
Earning by Learning is a model where we go into public housing projects or
public schools and we say to second and third graders who are likely not to
learn how to read, "we'll pay you $2. 00 a book for every book you read in
the summertime."  We just announced it, in fact, this week at Moten Middle
School in Washington, D. C. , where we're going to be doing it.  We use
adult volunteers, so there's no bureaucracy.  We use public library books
or public school books, so there's no capital investment.  The only money
that goes in is to the kids.  We use a room which is made free either by
the school or by the housing project.
<P>
And one of the reasons I became, frankly, a revolutionary was we went into
Douglas county and we went to a public housing project, and 8-year- old
kids said to us, "you're going to cheat us."  And we said, "what? " Just
regular old kids.  They said, "you're going to get us to read all summer,
and then you won't pay us."  Now, two things happened.  The first was I
decided if we're losing them at 8, if they're already so cynical at 8 they
just assume we're lying to them, we're in big trouble.  This is a huge
cultural crisis and requires a revolutionary response.  It requires a
replacement response, not, let's have a smaller circle or a slightly
different circle.  Let's get rid of this culture of poverty and violence
and get to one you can trust and that is decent.
<P>
But second, in Douglas county, we said, "fine.  "we won't ask you to trust
us.  "we'll pay you every week."  And what happened was every week, they
increased the number of kids who were reading.  Because when the ice cream
truck arrived, the kids who had money to buy ice cream were standing there,
their friends would come over and say, "how come you have money? " They go,
"well, I read, you know."
<P>
Now, I want you to think about the health of a notion that says, you should
be proud of yourself and you have some little cash in your pocket because
you're a reader, versus this system where there's no incentive, no sense of
dignity, no sense of resources, no chance to become a customer.
<P>
We also found, a little bit to our surprise, that these are actually pretty
smart kids.  When they'd earn 30 or $40, they'd mostly buy clothing.  The
number one expenditure was back-to-school clothing.
<P><PRE>
>>on the other hand, how did you confirm that they were reading to teach them --
>>You had adult volunteers who went in who made them answer questions about
>>their books.  Now, Moten middle school has gone a stage beyond me.
>>They're tied into a program from Indianapolis which is a computer reading
>>program where the computer asks you the questions and you actually take a
>>computerized test, and the computer's programmed to ask questions about
>>7,000 different titles.  It's pretty amazing.
</PRE>
I watched a couple kids taking the test.  And so the kid gets this sense
of, hey, they're just like all those fancy middle-class kids because
they're sitting right here at their computer in their school and they're
working on a computer, and you have to be able to read to use the computer.
And the computer's asking them whether or not they took the -- whether or
not they read the book, so they've got to get five questions right about
the book in order to pass the test.
<P>
<pre>
>>they're getting several layers of lessons there.

>>Right, and they're being taught free enterprise.  It's okay to work.
>>It's okay to make money.  It's okay to do it honestly.  You actually
>>improve yourself while you're working.  Because you can become more
>>literate.  And we give them a big incentive.  I mean, if you read at $2.
>>00 a book, our top reader read 83 books and earned $166.  She was an
>>8-year-old girl in villa Rica, Georgia.  Her dad took a day off of work
>>just to protect her, because we paid her on graduation day, and, I mean,
>>she got $166 in cash as an 8-year-old.
</pre>
It's just -- but I'm trying to give you just a sense of a different -- a
totally different model.  The principles of Earning by Learning are, first,
that incentives work.  Second, that poor children are smart in practical
ways.  You've got to let them grow.  You've got to give them a chance.
And, third, that money is a powerful incentive.  Now, this, by the way -- I
get in amazing arguments with people who are more traditional folks who
say, "oh, gee, isn't it sad you have to give them an incentive."  And then
I say, "well, now, if you're middle class, did your child have any
incentive if they got straight A's?  "did you reward them in any way if
they did really well? " "oh, yeah, of course I did, yeah."
<P>
What's the difference?  It's okay -- but they don't get the idea that if
you -- that if you have in this model of the welfare state no incentives,
why would you expect people to behave in positive ways?  In addition, the
principles of Earning by Learning include that a social good, learning, can
be reinforced by a personal good, earning, and that people given a good
idea will voluntarily follow up on their own, but can be held by a
supportive rather than controlling structure.
<P>
In other words, that you can get into an approach where you help people
learn how to do it, you give them good tips, you encourage them, but you
don't have a bureaucracy that micromanages and has reports and tries to
look over their shoulder.  The central theory is that efficiency in a
democracy is very hard, but effectiveness is pretty easy.  And I'm going to
draw that distinction for a second.  And, frankly, persistence,
persistence, persistence.
<P>
Let me draw a distinction between efficiency and effectiveness.  I don't
know an efficient way to arouse 35 million volunteers.  But I know if we
could inefficiently get 35 million volunteers helping the poor, we'd begin
to mop up the problem.  Because even though they would individually be
inefficient, the collective weight of that many people helping on the
weekend, helping in the evenings, talking about it in their church or
synagogue, talking about it over lunch at work, the sheer human energy
involved would mop up the problem, even though it would be very
inefficient.
<P>
And I would argue that's how democracies work.  They're not necessarily
efficient.  Dictatorships are more efficient.  They're just not very
effective.  But what democracies do, they mobilize so much energy, they
arouse so much excitement, that they are able to overcome their
inefficiency by their enthusiasm.  And again, that it takes tremendous
persistence.  None of this is going to happen without a level of
persistence that it's hard to normally get, and that's why when you --
remember I listed the reform movements?
<P>
What happens is in a period of a reform movement, you have an explosion of
energy, a sense that you've got to change things, a tremendous commitment
to do something, the invention of a whole new series of structures and
systems and habits.  They change things dramatically, and then they leave
behind at the end of the decade systems that are new and more effective
than the ones that they replaced.  You see this happen again and again in
American society over the last 300 years.
<P>
Earning by Learning, for example, just out of our speeches and things, is
now in 17 states.  It originally started with Dr.  Mel Steely at West
Georgia college and myself, and we ran the entire project, with Mel getting
a very tiny amount of money, working part-time out of his home, and I'd
wander around the country and make speeches, and people would call them and
he'd then send them a package of material, and they would then say "well,
this is all exciting," and it works.  It's a remarkable system.
<P>
Now, we have a foundation, and Don Jones of Wisconsin is organizing it,
working with the Library of Congress.  It's the Earning by Learning
foundation, and it's easy to call.  People can call 1-800-214-earn.
<P>
And for example, Governor Roehmer's wife in Denver is now going to be
actively leading an Earning by Learning program this summer.  He's a
Democratic governor of Colorado.  In Cabrini Green, one of the biggest
housing projects in America in Chicago, they're going to have an Earning by
Learning program this summer.  As I said, at Moten Middle school in
Washington, they're going to have Earning by Learning, so this is an idea
that we're continuing to push, to evolve, to grow.
<P>
Take a look at, for a minute, at "earn to learn," which is one of the
particular TV coverages of this concept
<P><PRE>
>>the earn to learn program provides students with an incentive to read.
>>Second and third graders read a book and write star reports.  Then give
>>an oral report to dealership employees.  Students and volunteers discuss
>>the book title, author, central theme, characters, and favorite passages.
>>The volunteer then signs the student's reading record, entitling second
>>graders to earn 25 cents per book and third graders, 50 cents per book.
</pre>
Texas Commerce Bank provided, free of charge, savings accounts for all
students participating in the earn to learn program.  Account books are
kept at school, and each child is responsible for recording deposits and
maintaining their account balance.  The result is a program that teaches
the students a connection between learning and earning, a tangible reality
in our adult world.
<pre>
>>and so far, I have read about between 20 and 30 books for the earn to
>>learn program.

>>Mike Smith and C.  W.  Kahn of Kahn's appliances, the school's business
>>in education partner, presented the program to Betty Cooper, Lucas
>>Elementary School principal.

>>Betty Cooper: and it sound like a good idea, but we didn't know it was so
>>much work involved, getting the bank statements set up and all the things
>>that we had to do.  We got permission from our school district, and
>>everything went well.  And I guess the best part about all of this was
>>when Mr..  Smith said that he would, in turn, give us the tools for the
>>program so that we wouldn't have to take any of the teachers or
>>volunteers from any other program to do this.

>>Mike Smith committed to the earn to learn program even before he had a
>>chance to talk to his employees about it, but the worthiness of the
>>program was plain to see, and since October, more than 80% of the
>>employees at Mike Smith auto plaza have volunteered to participate in
>>earn to learn.

>>Betty Cooper: we have approximately eight to nine tutors per Tuesday to
>>come out and listen to the children read, and the kids have really
>>enjoyed it.

>>well, I think they do it because they love children and they want us to
>>learn.

>>I leave here every time I come with such a peaceful feeling, and can't
>>wait to come back the next time.

>>George Mulkey: when we first started this program, Mike set it up where
>>we come mainly every six to seven weeks, and I find myself coming every
>>week now because I've gotten so close to the children.  I see the
>>benefits in the future of the children by watching them grow week in and
>>week out as they learn to read better and write better.  I see children
>>going farther in life.

>>what I like about this earn to learn thing mostly is that I get to read
>>more books than I usually do.

>>why do you say that?

>>because I like to read a lot, and I like to read all kinds of books.

>>Betty Cooper: academically, these kids have just improved tremendously.
>>The math has gone up, the reading skills, the writing skills.  They're
>>communicating better.  Their vocabulary has broadened, and we must
>>remember, these are at-risk kids, and the big picture is that these kids
>>later will be productive, contributing citizens to our community.

>>I'm going to be a good student whenever I grow up.  Because I'm going to
>>try to be the best that I can be.

>>Now, notice over here in this model if you read, you may get beaten up.
>>In this model if your choice is to read or practice basketball, there's
>>no question which is the higher value.  In this model, not only is it
>>good to read, not only do you get prestige out of reading, but in the
>>Earning by Learning version, you get money.
</pre>
So you take the number of hours you want to go and read, and you suddenly
-- and part of what we do, by impacting on a particular housing project, is
you suddenly have 60 or 70 or 80% of the second and third graders carrying
books around, so it suddenly becomes okay to carry a book.  And why are you
carrying a book?  Because you're going to be able to be part of what works
in the free enterprise system.
<P>
And so suddenly, the kids who are the smartest kids aren't the kids who can
beat each other up, they aren't the kids who might belong to a local youth
gang.  They're the kids who are going to have the most money at the end of
the summer, and you begin to change the whole psychology.  But it's got to
be seen as an entire system.
<P>
Now let's look at another area which has been just tragically not used
effectively, and that's pillar four, the spirit of invention and discovery.
I happened yesterday to meet with the Federal Aviation Administration, and
you remember last week I think I showed you, this is the M. I. T card, the
little dot that's dark, actually has 70 electric engines on it.  The sign
of micro- miniaturization.
<P>
Now, as an example of why governments find it very hard to use new
technologies, we are the largest purchaser of vacuum tubes left in the
world.  This is a vacuum tube currently used when you fly in an airplane.
This is part of the air traffic control system you're flying in.  In fact,
I think a large number of them are now made in Poland, because we're
running out of places to make vacuum tubes in the united states.  Now, this
is a vacuum tube, and again, I want you to think about the notion, these
are 70 electric motors.
<P>
Well, the same mind set which has made our -- and this is not the fault of
the FAA.  This is the fault of a federal government procurement policy of
incredible density and lack of rationality.  But the same pattern that
makes us obsolescent here also means we don't think about how to help the
poor.
<P>
I -- you see revolutions around you.  The fact is, if you look at Terry
Terrell, who's a student in this class, all of you now, I think, have your
copy of the student guide for the class which he put together.  This is
laptop publishing.  This is an entrepreneurial -- but the point is, we live
in an age where there's no reason every public housing project in America
can't have its own newspaper, can't have its own way of communicating with
itself for almost no money, but we don't think about how to create
technological breakthroughs.
<P>
I got laughed at a few weeks ago because I went to the Ways and Means
Committee and I said, "at least at the vision level, we ought to be
thinking about how do we get a laptop computer to every poor child in
America."  People said, "well, they don't need laptops."  Well, you're
right.  If they're in this model, they don't need laptops.  But if you're
in this model and you want them to participate in the 21st century, they
need laptops as much as anybody does, because you want to think about
wiring the poor neighborhoods.
<P>
You can't just have a country where the only people who get wired are upper
middle class, and then we say, "now, time to go look for a job.  "everybody
who gets to go look for a job "has to be able to use a computer.  "raise
your hand."  Nobody in this group has a clue.  Furthermore, if they know
they don't have a clue, they have a lower incentive in learning how to
read.  Because we're asking them to go back to a Second Wave industrial
model of learning, and we're saying to them, all the really clever people
who are going to be successful in America, they're down here now.
<P>
They're already doing Third Wave information-age stuff, but, of course, we
don't expect anybody who's poor to participate.  But you ought to work as
hard as these people, because you ought to at least pretend you're going to
participate.  And then you'll have self-esteem.
<P>
And so I would argue just the opposite.  That part of going to this new
culture of productivity and safety has to include wiring the poor and
thinking it through in a very specific way.  What do we want to do to
ensure that fiber optic is available?  What do we want to ensure that dish
satellites -- I talked to a corporation which is probably going to announce
in the near future that they're going to take a public housing project in
Washington and they're going to put a dish receiver in every house -- in
every apartment.  And they're going to do it as a pilot project to bring
500 channels to the poor, including educational channels, job seeking
channels, learning channels, just to say, all right, I mean, let's have an
explosion of knowledge.  It doesn't cost much.  And if in the process 24
hours a day, seven days a week, the poorest child in America has access in
their living room to the world and they begin to think, "wow, I can be
somebody, because I have the same access as anybody else does," you change
things.
<P>
But it's deeper than that.  We need to be thinking about safety in the
information age.  And about health care in poor neighborhoods in the
information age.  I'll give you just two quick -- two or three quick
examples.  If you know there are some neighborhoods that are very, very
unsafe, one of the things you do is you put cameras up.  You find ways to
have the kind of surveillance you need to provide real protection.  Another
step you do is you begin to provide some kind of call device, and you get
volunteers and you get lots of volunteers.  And you see something
suspicious, call the cops.  It's better to have the police arrive early,
it's better to have the police arrive early and see what's going on than it
is to have them arrive after the crime.
<P>
Most of the time today, police are crime reaction rather than crime
prevention units, because you have to integrate them into the neighborhood
and have anonymous people who can just call and say, "I think there's a
teen gang at the corner and I think somebody's going to get hurt in the
next half hour."  The police then drive by.
<P>
That -- again, you could literally give away devices to call in to create a
network of information.  It ain't that hard to computerize databases.  It
should be relatively easy to track who are the teen gangs to simply know
who's who.  To go to thumbprints for a whole range of things, including
food stamps and other things.
<P>
And I'm totally in favor of instant identity for buying guns.  I mean, we
ought to know if somebody who has been in a mental institution or is a
convicted felon shows up and they want to buy a gun, I'd like to know that
while they're standing there, and I'd like to have policemen visit with
them while they're still in the store and say, "hi, you know, we probably
want to take you away for a long time."
<P>
And I would say it ought to be illegal for a felon to try to buy a gun.  I
mean, I put a very high stake -- I mean, we're told 70,000 felons showed up
and got -- you know, were trying to buy guns.  Why are they trying to buy
guns?  Why don't we drum into their heads it is illegal.  We will not
tolerate you buying guns.
<P><PRE>
>>isn't it already illegal?

>>It's illegal to have bought it, but we just warn them away without saying
>>to ourselves, let's make a note here.  This is the third time Freebie's
>>tried to buy a gun.  I mean, at some point you begin to think there might
>>be a pattern here.  Maybe if something happens in Freddie's neighborhood.
>>
</pre>
And again, when you're out on parole, we could easily have you wearing an
ankle bracelet that was connected by satellite that tracked you precisely
the way we track, for example, large mammals in endangered species.  And
while you're on parole, if you happen to be at the local 7-eleven at the
exact second it's being robbed, we might say to ourselves -- we know that
up to 84% in some of the cases are going to be recidivists, and yet we do
nothing to track them.  I mean, these things are all -- the technology
exists today for a revolution in public safety.
<P>
Similarly, you can set up very inexpensive neighborhood clinics connected
electronically to the best hospitals, the best doctors in the world.  And
you can have very inexpensive people who are trained to screen up to a
point where we then call in the doctor.  What we have today is a model that
says, if you can't afford to set up a full clinic with full standing
doctors, meeting every possible requirement of a nice upper-middle-class
neighborhood, we really shouldn't provide any health care at all.
<P>
And it's not that hard to build a series of things.  We're doing it in the
military now, where we're going to be able to go from a field unit that has
a person who has just been wounded directly by satellite to the best doctor
for that kind of wound in the world and get them help immediately.  You
could do the same thing for the poor at not much money, and you could
actually guarantee screening for things and you could guarantee prenatal
care and you could do things dramatically less expensive than the current
model.
<P>
Beyond the information age, pillar five is Deming and Quality.  And the
first point I'd make, if you look at the Deming model and you think at a
systems level, the first point I'd make is, we are looking at a system of
failure.  Very important principle.  That it is the system which has
failed, not just individual cases.  That's why I talk about a replacement
of a culture and replacement of a system.
What we want to do is build a system of success with continuous
improvement, teamwork, customer orientation, and continuous measurement.
<P>
So we're constantly finding out are, in fact -- when we're told, well, this
school didn't succeed very well, and so 70% of the kids aren't learning how
to read, so we'll now have a study plan, and maybe a year from now we'll
have a new proposal.  In the intervening year, of course, 70% of the kids
won't learn how to read, and then maybe we'll start seeing whether or not
there's some improvement, that's crazy.  If you have a school that you find
out this morning you know has 70% of the kids not learning how to read, the
crisis meeting ought to be at lunch.  The first new plan ought to be
Monday.  You ought to be measuring whether or not you're changing behavior
by Friday.  You ought to be working every day to change things.
<P>
And yet you've got unionized work rules, you've got tenure, you've got all
the impediments to rational behavior, and again, it fits the difference in
these two cultures.  In this culture, you change every day, where you have
the red bead experiment every day.  You work very hard at finding how to do
things better.  And you're very flexible and creative.
<P>
In this culture, you fill out the paperwork and it ain't your fault.  You
did what the bureaucracy told you.  Why should they blame you?  Why pick on
you?  Totally different models.  In this culture, you have only one
ultimate test, are the kids taken care of?  Are they safe?  Are they
learning?  Do we have a community doing the right things?  In this model,
you have only one test, did I fill out the paperwork so they can't fire me?
Totally different models.
<P>
And if you take Deming's vision of how quality works and you apply it to
the current bureaucracies, it just makes you want to cry, and that's why I
don't think you can reinvent them.  I think you've got to basically
transform the system to a dramatically more decentralized, less government
system.  In a sense, I guess I would suggest that we really do have two
visions.  The welfare state versus what I would call an opportunity
society.
<P>
Now, if you accept the systemic difference, what I would like to suggest to
you is that there are seven strategies for implementing the opportunity
society.  First, holism.  And I'm going to walk through all these.  Second,
individual and community responsibility and involvement.  Third,
productivity and safety.  Fourth, putting children first.  Fifth, creating
diverse communities, de-ghetto-izing poverty.  Sixth, real compassion and
volunteerism.  And, seventh, an effective and appropriate role for
government.
<P>
And again, you have to think of these as seven integrated strategies.  All
seven of them have to fit together into a coherent whole.  Doesn't do you
good to do four of them.  You need to do all seven.  Strategy one is
holism.  And this essentially goes back to my earlier point, that we have
to approach the total change of the culture and system.  But if you're not
looking at the totality of it, if you're not taking a person from here all
the way down to here, you're not getting anything.
<P>
Having an indolent drunk who no longer drinks but hasn't changed any other
behavior, a, means that within a year, they're probably going to start
drinking again, and, b, you still haven't solved the rest of their
problems.  They still are illiterate, they still don't go to work, they
still don't know how to be independent.  So to change them from who they
are today to the person we hope they'll be in a year is a holistic, it is a
total, a transformational change.
<P>
It's like going from water to ice, which is the best example I can give you
of a holistic transformation.  You know, water is liquid, ice is solid.
They are different.  And you want to make that big a change in the way
people live and in the way they spend their lives.
<P><PRE>
>>that was the thawing portion that we were talking about a couple of weeks
>>ago.

>>yeah, yeah.  So if you think about it, what we're saying is we want these
>>people to take -- to thaw out from this version and then to refreeze into
>>this version.  The transformation is the thawing phase, but they're
>>literally different shapes.

>>morphing.

>>Yeah, in a sense, I mean, morphing, to use the modern computer term,
>>would be an example.  But you do become different.  An antelope is not
>>just a short-necked giraffe.  You know, and a lion isn't just a giraffe
>>that eats meat.  They're different.  Well, a productive citizen in a
>>healthy family living in a safe neighborhood with their children going to
>>schools that work and with all of them having an expectation of having a
>>better future through having good jobs is totally different from being
>>trapped in a neighborhood of violence with a system that won't let you go
>>to work, being dependent on a bureaucrat who doesn't have a clue what
>>your name is or who your family is, and having to send your kids to a
>>monopoly that will destroy them.  I mean, they're different structures,
>>different behaviors.
</pre>
Strategy number two is that to get to here, you have to have individual and
community responsibility and involvement.  This cannot just be imposed from
the out.  People who are in here have to be recruited, attracted, drawn to
wanting to do this.  They have to have both involvement and responsibility.
They are changing their lives.
<P>
We're not magically intervening and giving them good citizen shots.  I
mean, they're full- grown -- you know, a lot of them are full- grown human
beings.  They've got to reach the decision inside themselves that the time
has come to change their lives.  The time has come to do something
different.
<P>
I should say in terms of developing these new ideas, I want to mention that
Jane Fortson, who's here today, is a senior fellow at the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, and that she and Marvin Olasky, who's also a senior
fellow there, have been enormously helpful, and that Victoria
Durant-Gonzalez, who's with the Atlanta project, has been an advisor and
critic and debater, and in many, many different ways has helped us think
about all these things over the last two weeks, and the Atlanta Project is
a good example of what we're talking about.
<P>
The Atlanta Project is an effort which I think is halfway between these
two.  I think it's the largest effort in a comprehensive way heavily using
volunteers to try to impact on helping the poor transform themselves.  And
I think to the degree it will succeed, it's going to succeed because it has
some of this in it.  To the degree it's not succeeding right now, it's
because it's not radical enough.  It's got to go one more layer of being
clear with itself about how big the change is.
<P>
But the Atlanta project is a very heroic effort which was launched by
president Carter, when, frankly, he could very easily have done nothing.
And I have often said I think he has been the most influential of our
former presidents in modern times, because he has stayed active, he's
stayed involved, and he's done things.  And I'd like you to take just a
minute and look at the Atlanta project and what it's trying to accomplish.
<P><PRE>

>>Jimmy Carter: we felt that somewhere in god's world, there needed to be
>>some proof that in a major metropolitan area, something could be done
>>about human deprivation and suffering.

>>Maynard Jackson: so lo and behold, here comes the most active
>>ex-president in the history of America, who says that he's going to bring
>>his vast resources to bear on the problem of fighting poverty in this
>>city, in Atlanta.

>>Johnetta B.  Cole: this notion that each of us has the ability to make
>>life better not only for ourselves but for others is, I think, at the
>>base of the Atlanta Project.  I think we are going to see an absolutely
>>amazing outpour of volunteers, folk who honest to goodness believe that
>>they can create a better Atlanta.

>>Ted Renner: when Bill and Richard Marriott were approached by President
>>Carter, it didn't take much of anything to get them really turned on and
>>committed to this particular endeavor.

>> Dan Sweat: the C. E. O.  Said, we not only will give you half a million
>>dollars or a million dollars, but we want to be personally involved, and
>>we want our corporations involved and our employees involved in a real
>>meaningful way.

>>Ken Lewis: we believe as our communities thrive, we thrive.  We also
>>believe that we're only as strong as our weakest link.  So as we
>>strengthen that link, we all benefit.

>>Jane Fortson: Jimmy Carter has brought a dream and a vision not only to
>>Atlanta, but I believe ultimately to the country.  It's, to me, his
>>greatest quality, is his ability to dream and his ability to articulate a
>>vision and to gather people around that vision.

>> Andrew Young: I think what the Carter project does is give us a time and
>>say, wait a minute.  We've gone as far as we can go alone.  We've got to
>>reach down and take the rest of god's children with us.

>>Joe Martin: if the Atlanta Project can help to take these huge problems
>>and break them down into pieces so that individuals can say, well, if I
>>work on this piece, I'll have some confidence that somebody else will be
>>working on that piece, and together, we can make a difference.

>>Jane Fortson: we'll make a difference, because people are going to deal
>>with people.  Regular people, black and white, rich and poor, young and
>>old, will come together to solve the problems.

>>Johnetta B.  Cole: you know, you can't help but remember, when we won the
>>Olympics, folk really didn't shout and scream, "I am an African-American,
>>and I am proud that we have the Olympics."  Folk didn't say, "I am from
>>the poor of Atlanta, and we got the Olympics."  People said, "I am from
>>Atlanta, and this is what we won."  My hope is that something called the
>>Atlanta Project will, in fact, as best as any action can do, erase those
>>lines, sometimes terribly deep, between and among our communities.

>>The Atlanta Project, by trying to bring together government, business,
>>private volunteerism in a collaborative effort with the community, I
>>think is a very, very important experiment in the right direction.  And
>>we do a number of things to try to work with them, and I think that to
>>the degree it's got a problem, it's because it's only a piece of this.
</pre>
Jane Fortson really developed the seven strategies, and as you go through
all of them, you begin to realize, okay, community and individual
responsibility and participation is important, but there are a bunch more,
and you've got to have all seven working simultaneously in order for us to
have even a chance at winning.  Strategy number three, in that sense, is
productivity and safety.  We listed them together for this reason, they're
about reality.  The reality is you either have a way of making businesses
that are profitable and that survive, or you don't.  The reality is you're
either physically safe or you're not.  Now, if you're not safe, it's a lot
harder to create businesses.  If you can't create businesses, it's a lot
harder to convince people that they ought to follow a path of non-crime.
<P>
So they're linked together, but they're about genuinely having to solve
problems in this system that you can't just kid yourself about.  Doesn't do
you a lot of good to put money in here if when the money's gone, there's no
business there.  So you've got to start asking yourself, under what
circumstances can we make businesses succeed?  How -- what changes in tax
law do you need?  What changes in the regulation do you need?  How can we
make it profitable to have a business that is permanently in the inner city
because it makes money being there?
<P>
Which, by the way, means at least intellectually, if you want to help the
poor, you have to worry about helping the businesses that help the poor.
And you cannot love those who get -- create jobs, but hate those who create
jobs.  You've got to decide -- we have a schizophrenia in America today,
and we've got to say, "okay, I want 100,000 jobs for poor people, and if I
could find 100 people each of whom would create a thousand jobs, that would
be a good thing."  Well, then, you may have to change the law to encourage
those hundred people to do it.  But if you do that, then you get into the
whole question of, but what if they get more money out of getting more
money?
<P>
Because it just -- should the fact of creating a thousand jobs be a good
thing or a bad thing?  Should we reward it, back to incentives, or should
we punish it?  Similarly, you can't tolerate violence, because if you have
violence, when you start creating the jobs, they'll leave.
<P>
Jobs will -- it's very hard to create an economic incentive worth getting
killed over.  And so people will be very risk averse, so you have to make a
neighborhood safe, you have to make it desirable in tax and regulatory
terms for jobs to go in there, and then you have to go back and reach out a
helping hand so that the local person in that neighborhood can get the job,
because otherwise, what you'll do is you'll just crowd out the poor.
<P>
They'll sit across the street from the employment office, but they won't be
employable, and therefore, even though you now brought a thousand jobs into
the community, you still haven't solved it.
<P>
Now, the person who is really doing pioneering work on the question of how
do we create a productive inner city is Michael Porter at Harvard Business
School, the author of "the Competitive Advantage of Nations."  He says the
following, I quote, "we believe a sustainable economic base in inner cities
will only come about through private, for-profit initiatives and investment
based on economic self-interest and true competitive advantage, not through
artificial inducements, charity, or government mandates.  "the central
task, then, is to identify the unique existing and potential competitive
advantages of inner cities, which can translate into genuinely profitable
businesses that have the potential not only to serve the local community,
but also to export outside it.  "the inner city must become an integral
part of the regional and national economy, rather than an island surrounded
by it.  "unless we start with the premise that inner city businesses should
be genuinely profitable in position to compete on a regional, national, and
even international scale, they will forever be relegated to second-class
economic citizenship.  "economic development policies and programs must not
fall into the trap of only redistributing wealth, but focus instead on how
to create it."
<P>
Very important distinction.  Here the focus is, let's take the existing
wealth and redistribute it.  Let's take from the rich and give to the poor.
Here the focus is, let's make everybody richer.  Totally different models.
<P>

This, by the way, was the dominant model of the united states until 1965.
I mean, there was no question about it.  I mean, even Franklin Roosevelt or
John F. Kennedy would have argued this.  It's John F.  Kennedy who said, "a
rising tide lifts all boats," because he argued for a giant tax cut so that
everybody had a better chance.  But these are very different psychological
and family models.
<P>
Strategy four is to put children first.  Partially for the reason that you
see in the beginning of "Boys Town," where Father Flanagan goes into his
settlement house and realizes that he can't -- that he can't save
40-year-old alcoholics.  But he has an obligation to try to save 9-year-old
kids.  And if we simply had a very effective program of measuring backward
from the children safety, learning, jobs, income, making sure that their
lives have a chance to work.
<P>
Now, to do that, you've got to help their parents.  Remember, it's not
reductionist, we'll take care of the kids.  Tough luck, mom.  Can't just
be, we'll take care of the children in their box.  But it has to be in
order to re -- to transform this into this, the children are the perfect
bridge where you can focus your energy and focus your test.
<P>
Obviously, for the children to be in a better housing project, you have to
have a better housing project for everybody else.  For the children to be
in a safer neighborhood, it's going to be a safer neighborhood for
everybody else.  But by starting the focus on the children, I think we can
have a very powerful model.  It's also, quite frankly, the place we have
the greatest moral imperative.
<P>
I don't believe any American can be comfortable with what happens to the
poorest children in America today.  I just don't think anybody's
comfortable.  So I think if you start with the moral imperative, "yes,
we're going to organize ourselves as a country and we're going to make this
change happen, and if we fail to do so, here is what it means for the
children," gives us, frankly, the greatest moral power to make the change.
<P>

Strategy number five is to create diverse communities, in a sense, to
de-ghetto-ize poverty.  This, by the way, also applies to the American
Indian reservations and to Appalachia, and is one of the ways in which some
of it could be done electronically.  I mean, there's no reason you can't
have telephone friends.  You don't have to physically drive somewhere.
There's no reason you can't do a lot of things that work for everybody else
in America.
<P>
But again, I mean, how many of you call your best friend more often than
you see them face to face?  Raise your hand.  Okay.  Over half of you.  I
mean, so you can have a big brother-big sister program that has a lot of
impact, you know, that has a lot of continuity, that's not just getting
together on Saturday morning, but it's also chatting in the evenings, it's
also doing a lot of things that are electronic hand-holding and electronic
reinforcement and electronic communications.
<P>
But it's more than that.  One of the tragedies of this model is that we've
basically ended up tying the poor up in big centers of poverty so that they
don't see anybody go to work.  One of the virtues of Earning by Learning is
you begin to get healthy adults coming out of this society sitting down
with a child so that the child begins to relate to somebody who's orderly,
disciplined, has a sense of values that are appropriate to an information
age, and you want to do everything you can to begin to break down the
isolation of the poor and to begin to link them in with people who are in
the habit of having and leading healthy lives.
<P>
It's an enormous difference, and one where, frankly, I think the policy of
concentrating the poor ultimately has been tragic for the poor.  Strategy
six has to be real compassion and volunteerism.  And again, real compassion
includes the willingness to say "no," it includes tough love, it includes a
kind of volunteerism which tries to bond you directly to the people you're
trying to help, and which emphasizes the principles that Olasky outlined
earlier, that we used earlier today.
<P>
But I don't think you can succeed without that.  I think if all you do is
the government stuff and if all you do is the private business stuff and
you have not made the transition here with volunteers holding hands,
remember what I said earlier about covenant house on Tuesday mornings?  You
have to have somebody you know who talks to you who you trust, who carries
you across there.
<P>
I mean, how many of you at some point in your life learned something where
if you did not have another human being holding your hand and helping you,
you would just not have done it?  Okay.  Most of -- overwhelming, right?
And so it's that process of volunteerism which I think is an integral
building block.
<P>
Finally, strategy seven is an effective and appropriate role for government.
 We are not ever in this course talking about weak government.  We're
talking about limited, effective government.  I mean, if government,
frankly, could just provide public safety and have a tax code that
encouraged job creation and minimized the bureaucratic destruction of jobs
and be in a position to ensure that public learning took place whether it
was in a public bureaucracy or not, government would have done all it needs
to do in the inner city.   If then that was interfaced with the private
sector creating jobs and that was interfaced with voluntary associations
helping make the transition, you'd begin to have a team, if you will.
<P>
Think of it as a -- a box, which we'll talk about next week, where you have
up here the basic values of your civilization that have to be repeated over
and over again, because that's how values are transmitted.  You send them
over and over again.  Then you have to have the voluntary associations,
what we think of as freedom, what de Tocqueville described, whether it's
Kiwanis or business and professional women or Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts or
churches and synagogues.
<P>
Then you have private business.  In this model, which Gordon Woods helped
me understand and is derived from Jefferson, here you have limited,
effective government.  But it is the last and least of -- in a free
society.  It's very important in wartime.  And it has to be effective.  But
notice the way it's only a piece of the whole pattern.
<P>
Now, if we could get this to all work, I think within a decade, we can have
made a dramatic reduction, maybe as much as 70%, in poverty in America.
But I can't overstate, this is very hard work and will take a tremendous
effort.
<P>
Next week we're going to keep picking up on this, because we're going to
talk next week about citizenship and community in 21st century America, and
that will give us a chance to come right back at these same topics and how
we organize ourselves as a free people.  Next week's reading is Don
Eberly's "Building a Community of Citizens," the introduction, and then
chapters 1, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.  And at that time, we will take up
further on how we get America to work.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Lecture One  -- PFF</title>

Renewing American Civilization <br>
Class One -- American Civilization January 7, 1995 Adjunct Professor Newt 
Gingrich Reinhardt College  <br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the first of 
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor 
at Reinhardt College, will begin his course, which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson gives an introduction and overview of 
the course and lays the building blocks for a solid understanding of how 
to rejuvenate and strengthen the fabric of America.  
<P>
Good morning. Let me welcome you to Reinhardt College for the very first 
session of "Renewing American Civilization." Let me start by introducing 
two people who are absolutely invaluable and without whom this course 
simply wouldn't exist. First of all, a man of great courage who stepped 
in and who gave us the opportunity to teach and to continue developing 
ideas, President Floyd Falany of Reinhardt College. And, Floyd, I just 
want to say thank you for allowing us to be here. And then my co-teacher 
here on campus, a fellow historian, Dr. Kathleen Minnix. And, Kathleen, 
again, she'll be teaching -- for those who watch this later on videotape 
or those who might be seeing it through Mind Extension University, Dr. 
Minnix actually teaches the second half of this course in terms of the 
Reinhardt College students and experience here. I also do want to take a 
moment to welcome the students of mind extension university, which is a 
satellite system that's available on many campuses across the country, 
and which is now offering "Renewing American Civilization." And I want to 
let everybody who sees this who's not in the classroom know that you can 
mail your comments to: Renewing American Civilization at post office box 
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. And, frankly, we want to get your 
comments, because that's how we improve the course. That's how we learn 
what to change and what needs to be done. And if you're too excited to 
mail it, you can fax the comments to: 404- 528-9806. 
<P>
And nowadays, we frankly get an awful lot of comments that are faxed to 
us. One of the interesting comments about the modern world is we'll have 
somebody, particularly in rural America, who will be on a dish receiver 
picking it up by satellite, then using their fax to send it to us. 
However, there's another generation coming along, so if you'd rather 
e-mail your comments, they have that. It's America on-line. It's 
renewam@aol.com. And I'll let those of you who go into that stuff know. 
I'm sure that for every one of those folks, that was a very obvious 
address. And then for those who are really at the cutting edge, the class 
transcripts and other class materials are available on our Internet web 
page. Just for the fun of it: http://www.pff.org. And that's effective as 
of January 13th, so don't get frustrated trying -- if you're watching 
live trying to do that today. Finally, for people who are into a much 
simpler world, to order American Civilization, the video and the audio 
tapes and the course readings, you can call 1-800-to-renew. 
<P>
Let me stop for a second, because I think as we go through that, here's 
the first place I can make a key point about why we teach this course the 
way we're teaching it. We now live in a world where the most advanced of 
us understand computers at the Internet level. But almost all of us 
understand calling an 800 number to get the audio tapes and the 
videotapes. Now, when you realize that 800 numbers didn't exist, audio 
tapes didn't exist, and videotapes didn't exist about 50 years ago, and 
now we take those as sort of the basic building blocks of civilization -- 
"well, of course you can do those, but what about this new stuff" -- it 
gives you the sense of pacing, of part of what we're going to come back 
to again and again, why we talk about entering a third wave of 
civilization and why we talk about the information age. And we'll get 
back to that. 
<P>
But what we're doing here today where we are both live on videotape, on 
audio tape, connected by computer, by fax, and by e-mail, as well as by 
U.S.. mail and the telephone, gives you some sense of the sophisticated 
world of the 21st century that we're just beginning to invent. Now, today 
we're going to talk about American Civilization, and we're going to lay 
out the premise of this entire course. And what I want to talk about, I 
have to give credit, frankly, to Dr. Everett Carl Ladd at the University 
of Connecticut, who's one of the leading students of what he calls 
"American Exceptionalism." And he uses the term "American 
Exceptionalism." I think it's a very helpful term, because it gives you a 
sense of where we're going. 
<P>
And so we're going to today spend our time on the introduction, the 
overview, and the outline of the entire course. So I'm going to introduce 
the course, give you an overview of what we're going to try to do in the 
course, and then give you an outline of what will actually happen in the 
course. And what I want to suggest as a starting point is that the 
concept of American Exceptionalism which Dr. Ladd developed, in essence, 
that there is a unique American Civilization. Now, on a lot of college 
campuses, we could have some terrific debates -- and I'd be willing to 
debate this topic -- a lot of people will say to you: first of all, are 
we really a civilization? Well, there's a wonderful book by Max Lerner 
called "America as a Civilization." Lerner was an anti-communist liberal 
writing in the 1950s, and it's his arguments. It's a massive book. I'm 
sure you could go look at it. It's about 1500 pages. But his whole 
argument is that there's a way of being that is called "American." That 
you learn to be an American. 
<P>
Now, the key to this is to understand -- and I think this is the 
distinction. This is what confuses those of our friends who are into 
multi-culturalism. American Civilization is multi-ethnic, but it is one 
civilization. Now, this is the central assertion of the course and 
something you'll have to think about. In other words, you may be 
Korean-American. I serve with a Congressman Jay Kim from Southern 
California who's a first-generation Korean-American, born in Korea and 
now lives here. You may be European-American. I obviously am. You may be 
African-American. I serve with J.C.. watts of Oklahoma. You may, in fact, 
be blended from a lot of different racial stocks. You may be Hispanic. I 
serve with henry Bonilla from San Antonio, Texas. And yet each of them 
would describe themselves as an American. They know what they are 
descended from, they know their background. And of course, if their 
children met at a congressional social event and married, then you'd 
start having to say, "well, I'm a European-Korean-American 
African-American-Hispanic." It's easier to just say, "I'm an American." 
<P>
It's a very core question, because what I'm suggesting to you is: we are 
multi- ethnic. We are the first world civilization in that sense. Because 
everybody on the planet can show up here, and did Tuesday. I mean, go to 
Disney world and stand for a half hour. Or go to any -- frankly, north 
Atlanta. Go to any one of our major malls and just stand for an hour. 
This would be -- I'm not recommending it for this course, but if 
somebody's trying to teach the course and drive this home or if this was 
being taught at a high school level, just send students out to stand 
somewhere at a busy mall and write down the number of nationalities that 
walk by in a half hour. 
<P>
And it's astonishing. Or walk -- go to the Atlanta airport and watch who 
goes through the airport. So we -- now, we have to focus on: why is it 
worth studying American Civilization, other than the fact that we're 
Americans who want to know about our past? I have an argument, and the 
argument is that American Civilization, when you compare it to other 
civilizations, it has certain very positive characteristics. It has 
empowered more people from more backgrounds to pursue happiness. In the 
process, our people created greater opportunities to pursue happiness. If 
I were to summarize it into one phrase, it would be that America is a 
great country with good people. And I would argue that American history 
has more people getting more rights and more opportunities. We started 
out with only wealthy white males who could pay a poll tax being allowed 
to participate, and we've added layer by layer until we now reach out to 
virtually every person with a disability, every person of every ethnic 
background, every person of every racial background, every person, you 
know, males and females. 
<P>
You think about the degree to which we now reach out to try to be an 
inclusive system. That that has been a hallmark of 300 years of American 
government. In addition, American history has led to more prosperity and 
property for more and more people. Now, what I want to do, let me just 
take a minute, because I really think it's important to drive this home, 
because it's one of the basic building blocks of why I'm teaching the 
course and where I think you've got to decide for yourself whether you 
intellectually agree. Part of the argument here is that for most of 
American history, from the -- and I am -- when I talk about American, I'm 
not talking about the north American continent, because you could argue 
that the history of the north American continent begins when Asians 
crossed the Bering strait about 11 to 15,000 years ago, and you could -- 
there's some wonderful books. Peter Farb's "man's rise to civilization as 
shown by the Indians of north America" is a good example, because he 
tries to go into that very long history of the geographic site. 
<P>
When I talk about American Civilization, it essentially begins with the 
arrival of the English-speaking peoples in Virginia in 1607 and in 
Massachusetts around 1620, and then spreads across the continent. Now, 
it's a very important distinction. We can talk about it later. But I'm 
not arguing about a geographic term. I'm arguing about the rise of a 
civilizational pattern of behavior which became multiethnic over time. 
What I'm suggesting to you is you can go back and you can take from 1607 
till 1965 and you have certain long sweeps that are more and more 
positive. We go from slavery to segregation to integration. We go from 
empowering wealthy white males to giving women the vote to eliminating 
the poll tax and then giving women the vote, then making sure everybody 
can vote. We go from the -- right from almost the very beginning to 
acquire property. Free blacks as early as the 1740s and 50s could acquire 
property not only in the north, but in new Orleans. And you actually had 
an entire class of people in new Orleans who were of African-American 
descent but who were free and owned property and businesses and could buy 
and sell and were part of the commercial environment. 
<P>
Racism is not only anti- black. You not only have anti-catholic racism 
and anti-Mediterranean. That is, people who were Italian or Spanish or 
Greek had more hostility than people who might be catholic but were 
German or Irish. You then had very bitter anti-Asian hostility, 
particularly in California, but in many ways across the country. If you 
go to Augusta, Georgia, today you see a Chinese community that is now, I 
think, seven generations old that originally came to build railroads in 
the Augusta, Georgia, area. That is, their great, great, great, great, 
great grandparents did. And yet what happens over time is -- and this is 
a very important question. It was part of, I think, a big debate in this 
country in the last 25 years. Dr. Ladd would argue, and I think that 
people who believe in American Exceptionalism would argue, that America 
essentially -- and I used the phrase a while ago -- is essentially a 
great country with good people. That on any given day, most Americans are 
decent. Most Americans care. Most Americans want to raise their children. 
Most Americans would like to be good neighbors. It's part of how you can 
have this very free society with all the different things that go on 
where you get to go out and choose what you want, how you want to live 
your life, what kind of clothing you want to wear, what you want to 
learn, how you want to earn a living, how you want to spend your money. 
That there's an enormous level of trust in each other and that what's 
been happening, we would argue, is that from 1965 to 1994, that America 
went off on the wrong track. 
<P>
Now, that's a very important distinction. There's a large block of 
intellectual thought that would argue America was really a sexist, 
racist, repressive, vicious society, and we need government to correct 
the bad habits of the American people. Those people basically took power 
around 1965 and increasingly tried to redesign America. And my argument 
in this course is going to be that after 1965, the government and elite 
culture adopted ideas that are dramatically different from the traditions 
and principles of American Civilization. That if you look at the first 
300 years of American history, we're going in one direction, and then all 
of a sudden around 1965, with the rise of the great society, the 
counterculture, et cetera, you suddenly have a tremendous burst in a 
direction which is different from every other period of American history, 
and that there's one core critique, and this is a very -- you're going to 
see me come back to this concept a number of times in the course, because 
this is at the heart of being American. The critique is not ideological. 
It's not, "I'm a conservative, they're a liberal." The critique is: these 
ideas don't work. That it's pragmatic. 
<P>
Do you think the inner city's better than it was? Do you think American 
Indian reservations are better than they were? Do you think being poor in 
west Virginia works more? Do you think our schools produce more people 
who know calculus and can speak Latin? Or do you think, as measured in 
the real world, things don't work? Now, it's a very important question, 
because intellectually, you can get into terrific course about: what does 
the word "work" mean and why is Gingrich being judgmental? And I want you 
to understand up front in this course that I am arguing that there are 
obvious objective judgments. If you turn on a water spigot and no water 
comes out, it doesn't work. If you turn on a water spigot and the water 
comes out, you can't drink it, it doesn't work. If you have a school and 
the people who leave it can't read, it doesn't work. If you have a public 
project, housing project, and the people in there are likely to be 
killed, it doesn't work. 
<P>
Now, you have -- this is a very important test question in your own head; 
not in the course, in your own head. Can you objectively measure 
something very simple in result but very sophisticated in measurement? Is 
it working or not? Of course, this means judgments, rights and wrongs, 
yeses and nos. It's not situation ethics. I mean, who are we to say that 
if you never studied in your whole life and you haven't learned a single 
thing and you're totally illiterate, that you're somehow less than those 
of us who read and studied and learned? That's judgmental, to which my 
answer is yes, and you can't have a civilization without judgment. You're 
just talking about chaos. To have a civilization is to judge. You can't 
avoid judgment. Because that's how civilization tells you what you should 
do. I would argue, and Dr. Minnix will later on cheerfully argue, knowing 
history is better than not knowing history. Now, that's a really -- 
that's a very core question. Knowing math is better than not knowing 
math. If you don't know math, you are at the prey of every person you buy 
something from the rest of your life, because you can't check whether or 
not they cheated you. So let's just start at the basics. 
<P>
That's what should be said to every first grader: if you don't learn 
math, you will be cheated the rest of your life. If you refuse to learn 
math and you're cheated, it's your fault. You are not a victim. Zebras 
that run up to lions and beg to be eaten are not victims. They're dumb. 
Okay? So that's a very important concept. Now, why do I say the elite 
ideas have failed? Well, let's go through it. The elite ideas of the last 
generation have failed, and in failing, have left America with more 
poverty, more violence, more red tape, more bureaucrats, more litigation, 
more power in Washington. And ironically, after all those mores, with 
less ability to actually get problems solved and less ability to get 
opportunities developed. 
<P>
Now, those are all measurable. Are there more lawsuits or less? Is there 
more violence or less? I mean, these are not random observations by 
somebody who has an ax to grind. Go out and measure them and you tell me. 
Are more families broken down? Are more one-year-olds likely to suffer 
child abuse? These are measurable, documentable facts. And yet I think 
the system has had a hard time dealing with it. And one of the reasons I 
really wanted to teach this as a course is that moving from the wrong 
track to the right track is largely a cultural and an intellectual 
problem. I want to take a minute and explain what I mean. The problem in 
America today is not money. We have plenty of money. The problem in 
America today isn't even courage. People will say, "oh, politicians are 
gutless." That's nonsense. You've just had the courage to run for office 
and take the beating you take from the press corps. The person I disagree 
most in public life, who I will not name, but would say something to the 
congress I would disagree with, I respect the fact that they have the 
courage to run for public office. It's not absence of courage. It's 
absence of sound ideas. We don't know what to spend the money on. We 
don't know how to structure the spending. We don't know what rules to set 
up. And I spent years trying to sort this out. Why are we having such a 
hard time helping people get off poverty? Why are we having such a hard 
time establishing safety? Why is it so difficult to get schools where 
kids are learning? And we came up with for what was for me one of the 
great breakthroughs. 
<P>
I was spending part of an afternoon actually at a hotel near the Atlanta 
airport with Dr. Jeff Eisenach of the progress and freedom foundation and 
Dr. Steve Hanser, who's a historian and good friend of mine. Eisenach is 
an economist, but we still talk to him even though he's not a historian. 
And we were trying to wrestle with why is it -- and this was back during 
the bush administration. We were trying to figure out: why is it that 
American governmental bureaucracy doesn't work? I mean, you can make a 
good argument that outside of elite groups like the FBI and the national 
park service, and outside of the military, where failure means you die, 
so you have a very high incentive to change, that if you take those away, 
that American bureaucracy has an astonishing pattern of decay that is 
almost universal. You build a big bureaucracy of Americans and it fails. 
And this is what we came up. I'm going to walk you through a challenge 
you can take back home and check with people. In fact, if you would this 
week, this will just be a fun thing for you to do just to see what 
happens when you tell your friends. 
<P>
We're going to talk for a minute about the cultural challenge of speed 
limits and Americans. This is the heart of the course in terms of the 
core ideas. Have any of you ever been to Germany? You have, you have, you 
have. About a third of you. In Germany, there is no speed limit on the 
autobahn outside of congested areas, right? You get on the autobahn, you 
rent a car, you're doing 100 miles an hour, you think you're really 
something, and a Mercedes goes by at 160. You want to pull over and cry. 
You know you don't have the guts to do 160 miles an hour, so you just 
think, you know, "I'm just ruined here." But you know that tomorrow, if 
the Bundestag adopted 100 kilometers, or 62 miles an hour, as the speed 
limit, that virtually every German would obey it until the next election. 
They would then massacre the current generation of politicians and they 
would adopt -- elect the "no speed limit" party. Now, I want you to walk 
through this with me for a second, because it's going to sound silly, but 
it's very, very profound. I want to suggest to you that the American 
challenge to the cultural concept of speed limits is remarkably different 
from the German response. 
<P>
For most Americans, a speed limit is a benchmark of opportunity. Let me 
just give you the test here for a second. Remember, we're not going to 
learn anything if you lie, okay? So you've got to be honest here for a 
second. How many of you will routinely look at the speed limit sign so 
you can add either 5 or 10? Come on, raise your hands now. Be honest. 
Okay? Two-thirds of the course, three-fourths of the course? Now, what 
does this tell you? By the way, I have done this everywhere. After we 
came up with this idea I began testing it, and what I'm teaching you 
today and what I'm sharing with you in this 10 weeks are ideas that have 
evolved over a long period of time, in some cases 36 years, where we've 
actually gone out and talked to them and I talk to enough different 
groups, I've really tested this. I once asked this question, and this is 
-- enough of you live on campus, this would not have been as effective, 
but I'll try it out. How many of you might have gone over the posted 
number to get to this class this morning? Okay. 
<P>
You now know who drives to campus. I did that one time in South Carolina 
with Carroll Campbell, the governor, sitting at the head table. He raised 
his hand. The governor had broken the speed limit to get to the meeting. 
He said well, he was on the golf course, it ran long. The place went 
nuts. Now, why? Because America is not -- and this is at the absolute 
core of the critique of where we are today -- America is not as a 
civilization rule dominated. America is incentive dominated. If you want 
Americans to change, change the incentives. If we said: we'll pay $1,000 
to every first grader who can read the day they walk into school, you 
would be at 95 or 98% literacy within two years like that. Instead, 
because we have this European, bureaucratic, top-down government 
mentality in charge, we'll spend $50,000 on the child trying to get an 
adult in a bureaucracy to coerce them through regulation to do something 
they're not going to do because there's no incentive for them. They're 
going: hey, I don't want in. Glad you got paid. I didn't get paid. And 
people -- I've had teachers say to me, "this is horrible." Now, in the 
middle of a baseball strike. These are little kids, right? They watch 
television. They say to themselves: why is there no baseball? Because 
guys who are getting $7 million a year are out on strike. Okay, I 
shouldn't get paid anything as a little kid because that would be bad. 
<P>
I'm not arguing for the payment here.  I'm arguing for the concept. I'm 
not saying -- I'm not here today as speaker of the house saying we ought 
to have this proposal. I'm trying to get you to think -- this is -- 
because I want you to think about this conceptually. You give Americans 
-- think about your own life and think about middle-class families. "you 
get straight A's, we'll go to Disney world." "you do really well, we'll 
get a bicycle." I mean, how many of you had at some point in your career 
when you were growing up your parents give you an incentive to do 
something? Okay. Three-quarters of the class? Punishment is an incentive, 
but if you're a very poor child in a neighborhood where nobody cares 
about learning, getting an "f" is not a punishment. It's an irrelevancy. 
Being spanked as has an impact, although today you'd better do it 
carefully or you'll be taken into court. 
<P>
But I'm just trying to suggest to you here: very core distinction, which 
doesn't start with government. It starts with civilization. If you're a 
civilization where rules matter and people obey the rules, having a 
government designed around rules works. If you're a civilization of 
freedom where incentives work, you better have a system designed around 
incentives. And so we have a totally misdesigned European-style effort to 
impose into America a government designed to change people and designed 
antithetically to the American Civilization. To design the system for 
Americans, you have to study American Civilization. Now, my point here 
would be that American Civilization is a historically based fact, not 
intellectual theory. And let me explain, and I'll come back to this 
later. I'm a historian in part because I believe history teaches you 
things you don't learn in the abstract. 
<P>
That is, if you really want to understand America, read about American 
history. Don't read a contemporary theoretician's 10-page outline. How do 
Americans behave? How has America functioned? "Renewing American 
Civilization" in that sense is a course designed to explore what works in 
America and why it works. And at the heart of that, I want to suggest to 
you, is the very core American concept which you'll see us come back to, 
and that is that pragmatism is the American philosophy. Remember, 
pragmatism goes back to that question I asked earlier: does it work? If 
you read William James -- and I will be quite honest, I've read 20 pages 
of William James in my life, because it's fairly hard to read -- but if 
you read William James' original work on pragmatism, his whole argument 
is that Americans have a unique philosophical test in the real world: 
does it work? Not: is it theoretically right? Not: has some great person 
said it? Not: is it established wisdom? But: does it work? I'm also going 
to suggest to you that being American is a learned set of principles. 
It's a very important concept. It's not like being French. And it's part 
of what confuses many of our intellectual friends, because a lot of our 
intellectual friends don't quite get it. 
<P>
They keep thinking: well, you were born here. Therefore you're an 
American. No, you're born here. Therefore, you have the legal status of 
being a citizen of the united states. I don't know whether you're an 
American or not till I find out how you function. Because, after all, Jay 
Kim was born in Korea. He is clearly an American. Iliana rose-Letinen was 
born in Cuba. She is clearly an American. Now, how did she become -- and 
they're both, by the way, American in a way that neither could have been 
Japanese or neither could have been French. The reason is found, I think, 
in G.K.. Chesterton. Chesterton was an Englishman who traveled the U.S.. 
and he said: America's the only nation in the world founded on a creed. 
Let me read the exact quote from Chesterton. He says, "America is founded 
on a creed. America is the only nation in the world that is founded on a 
creed. That creed is set forth with dogmatic and even theological 
lucidity in the declaration of independence." 
<P>
I want you to listen carefully to this. "perhaps the only piece of 
practical politics that is also theoretical politics and also great 
literature. It enunciates that all men are equal in their claim to 
justice. That government exists to give them that justice, and that their 
authority is, for that reason, just." Now, Chesterton is saying 
literally, if you don't -- how many of you spent serious time reading the 
declaration of independence in high school? Okay, about half of you. 
Chesterton's argument is that you start with the declaration of 
independence and it begins to define being American, and we'll come back 
to it. Similarly, Margaret Thatcher said, "no other nation has been built 
upon an idea, the idea of liberty." And let me quote from Prime Minister 
Thatcher. She said, "Americans and Europeans alike sometimes forget how 
unique the united states of America is. No other nation has been created 
so swiftly and successfully. No other nation has been built upon an idea, 
the idea of liberty. No other nation has so successfully combined people 
of different races and nations within a single culture. Both the founding 
fathers of the united states and successive waves of immigrants to your 
country were determined to create a new entity. The European nations are 
not and can never be like this. They are the products of history and not 
of philosophy. You can construct a nation on an idea, but you cannot 
reconstruct a nation on the basis of an idea." 
<P>
Her point is -- what she's saying is: why are you French? You're French 
because you are descended from the franks. Why are you American? You're 
American because you start with the declaration of independence, the 
constitution, you learn how to be an American. Radically different ways. 
Now, we're not talking here about lawyer talk. We're not talking about: 
do you have a certificate of citizenship in a polity? We're not talking 
here about geography. I object, for example, to the term "native 
American." We're all native Americans if you're born here. In fact, 
native Americans as used by the counterculture really refers to Asians, 
who happened to come over earlier and mostly walked rather than took 
boats. But we're all native Americans if you were born here. 
<P>
The question is: you can be a United States citizen without knowing much 
about America, but to be an American, I would argue, is a way of being. 
It's a way of thinking. It's a way of approaching it. Now, it's a very 
broad, complex, and some people would say crazy way of being. I mean, 
it's very diverse. I'm not arguing that we all wear little uniforms and 
we're stamped, you know, "made in Disney world." But I am arguing that 
you can tell -- if you go around the planet and you watch people in the 
marketplace, you can pick out the Americans. It's a very different way of 
thinking. Now, George Santayana said it when he said, "to be an American 
is of itself almost a moral condition, an education, and a career." I 
want you to think about this, because what I'm suggesting to you here is 
that you as a citizen have a real obligation. I mean, think about the 
words Santayana used: moral condition, an education, and a career. That 
you live out the process of being an American. 
<P>
Now, what we're going to talk about in large part in the early phase of 
the course is becoming "we," learning American Civilization. I found it 
fascinating when I first began talking about this in public audiences 
about three years ago, the people who responded the most were 
first-generation immigrants. The other day -- and this was a fascinating 
sign of how the world's changed. The other day I was at a speech for 
freshman state legislators, and an Indian-American from India, a woman, 
brown-skinned, about this tall, wearing a sari, who, by the way, had won 
a seat in Wyoming, where she was probably one of the 12 Indian- American 
families in her entire district, she came up to me and she said, "for 30 
years I've been afraid that we were ceasing to be the reason I came here. 
But," she said, "I now have new courage." And her point was she didn't 
come to America to bring Indian civilization with her. She's proud of 
being Indian, she thinks it's a wonderful civilization, but she came to 
America because she wanted herself and her children to be Americans. 
<P>
So this concept of becoming "we." And what really struck me was that each 
generation has two waves of immigrants: geographic, called foreigners, 
and temporal, called children. And that both waves of immigrants have to 
be taught. So "Renewing American Civilization" will be an intellectual 
outline for students, and a practical guide for citizens. And it's 
designed to say: here is how American Civilizations worked. Here are the 
principles of American Civilization. Here's what's worth knowing if you 
want to be an American. And if you want to design solutions for American 
problems or you want to gather up the energy for American opportunities, 
here is a way of doing it based on how Americans work. The course will 
occur in 10 sessions and is based on five books and two documents. This 
is the syllabus: "learning how to prepare for the future." And it 
includes in it the constitution and the declaration of independence, 
which we'll use fairly extensively at key points in the course. In 
addition, we have five books. I think by the way, I assigned a number of 
these to members of congress, and so I'm interested to see how many of 
them read them. 
<P>
First of all, "the Federalist Papers." It comes out in many different 
editions. This particular edition is the penguin classics, but there are 
a lot of different edition. This is actually political pamphlets. 
Remember, "Federalist Papers" were written by John Jay and Alexander 
Hamilton and James Madison as political pamphlets to explain why you 
should vote "yes" on the constitution. Now, for those of you who think of 
the age of 30-second TV ads and nine-second sound bites, educated people 
all over America read this. I mean, everybody can read this, by the way. 
This myth about how the founding fathers were all these geniuses, about 
60 of them were out of three and a half million people. There were also 
probably at least a million people in rural America who could barely 
read. 
<P>
And I'm not suggesting to you that the average person said, "oh, I think 
I'm going to go vote on the Constitution Tuesday. Can I have a copy of 
'the Federalist' to read over the weekend?" But for those people who were 
opinion leaders, these were real publications, and they came out in 
serial form in newspapers, and people sat around the coffee houses and 
argued about them. In addition, we're going to look at the book -- the 
founding fathers tried to create a roman republic. They are very 
conscious of the roman concepts. They wanted what they called an 
aristocracy of virtue, and you'll hear us talk about that. But underneath 
this roman republic, this aristocracy of virtue, classic market-oriented 
democratic America emerged. 
<P>
And as it began to emerge and change -- and I would suggest to you that 
Gordon wood has written the two best books. They're both pretty heavy 
reading. One is on the origins of the American revolution. The other is 
on the radicalism of the American revolution. We're not going to use 
those as reading books, but he gives you the sense that the America that 
Washington and Franklin and Jefferson envisioned was a republican 
aristocracy of virtue by 1830 that had been replaced by the America we 
are, which is a very wide-open, individualistic, democratic society. 
<P>
And in 1831 and 1832, in order to explain the future, a French aristocrat 
visited America and wrote the preeminent book explaining how America 
works, which captured precisely American Civilization as it existed up to 
1965, and it's called, "democracy in America" by Alexis de Tocqueville. 
There are three or four different versions. Again, it's been in print 
ever since. But de Tocqueville, because he was literally going around as 
a tourist simply recording what he was seeing, which was so different 
from Europe, and I quoted from de Tocqueville on Wednesday in my speech 
accepting the Speakership because it was so wonderful. He talked about 
how we were vulgar people. But remember, the word "vulgar" back then 
meant "not aristocratic." And, of course, he was right. Anyone in America 
can rise. So we want you to use "Democracy in America." 
<P>
In addition, we want you to use "Creating A New Civilization: The 
Politics Of The Third Wave," by Alvin and Heidi Toffler. They are very, 
very important folks who have really thought through where they're at. In 
fact, they've thought about we're now at the beginning of what they call 
a third wave. The first wave -- we'll talk about this later. The first 
wave is agriculture. The second wave is industry. The third wave is 
information. It's a fairly short book, but it's very, very helpful. 
Fourth, we're going to use "the effective executive," paperback edition, 
by Peter Drucker. This book is the most effective book ever written on 
how to be effective. And an effective book on being effective is worth 
your reading. And I'll talk at great length about that later. 

Finally, a new work by Don Eberly, the editor, "building a community of 
citizens: civil society in the 21st century." This book goes back in a 
series of readings and reestablishes the connection to how America really 
worked in its healthiest periods and what the principles are of a 
successful America. Now, we're going to take those books and we're going 
to apply them in a series of 10 classes, and the 10 class topics start 
with American Civilization, which is what we're working on today, the 
concept of: what are we trying to deal with? What is American 
Civilization? Then we're going to go -- the second class will be actually 
pillar one. We use the term "pillar" to elicit the idea that there are 
five pillars of American Civilization. And pillar one is the historic 
lessons of American Civilization. And again, Dr. Minnix and I have a bias 
which we share with Dr. Hanser in designing this that to know history, to 
understand history, to study history, is helpful. We'll spend a lot of 
time next week on that concept. 
<P>
Pillar number two, which will be the third course, is personal strength. 
And we'll argue there that you cannot have a free society without a 
tremendous emphasis on personal strength, because in the end, freedom 
comes down to the individual. And so if you don't have the personal 
strength to be free, you, by definition, can't remain free very long. 
<P>
Pillar three is entrepreneurial free enterprise, the spirit of going out 
and getting it done. Now, this does not just mean marketplace. But 
whether it's somebody founding the red cross or it's somebody founding 
Wal-mart or it's somebody inventing a new breakthrough in medicine, the 
spirit of getting the job done, of taking on the responsibility of being 
creative, pillar four, which is the fifth class, is the spirit of 
invention and discovery. Not science, not technology. I started out that 
way, and Jay Keyworth, President Reagan's former science advisor, said to 
me, "you know, that isn't right. This is not about science and 
technology. This is about a way of thinking." 
<P>
The sixth course is going to be pillar number five, quality as defined by 
Edwards Deming. Edwards Deming is the man who taught the Japanese the 
concept of quality. Point at this stage that I want you to just stop and 
think about is that you now have five pillars. When we get through those 
five classes -- this opening class lays out the whole course. We then 
spend five classes, one on each pillar, and what we're trying to 
understand: why does America work? What is there about America that is 
American? Why has it been successful? Then we're going to go to courses 
of application, to the lessons on application. 
<P>
Number seven is going to be: looking at the third wave and American 
Civilization. If you're entering an information age, if this is a change 
as big as the shift from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or the shift 
from agriculture to industry, then what does that mean for American 
Civilization? How do we Americans do it, and what will America be like? 
<P>
Class eight is: creating American jobs in the world market. If we truly 
have entered a revolution in economics, if we are no longer primarily a 
national economy, but instead, every job is related to the world market, 
and both in imports and exports, our life is tied to the fabric and the 
rhythm of the world, then as Americans, how do we make sure that we are 
at the top end of that world market? How do we have the best jobs? How do 
we have the most creativity? How do we have the best take-home pay? How 
do we have the greatest range of choices so we can take the best 
vacations? Very important questions if, in fact, we've entered a brand 
new era. Lesson nine is going to be on replacing the culture of violence 
and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. 
<P>
Now, notice here what -- how we focused that. We're talking about 
cultures. To live in poverty and violence is a cultural behavior. It's a 
set of learned habits and skills. It's a way of being. But to live in an 
area which is productive and safe is also a cultural behavior. It's a set 
of attitudes and habits. It's a way of being. And part of our argument in 
the course is going to be that starting in the mid '60s, we allowed a 
culture -- we actually paid for a culture -- I'll give you, again, an 
example I just happened to learn two days ago. 
<P>
I testified at the ways and means committee at the opening session of 
this year, and I said, you know, I'd been told that under the earned 
income tax credit, if you earn $11,000 a year and you marry somebody who 
earns $11,000 a year -- this is an interesting minor test for you for a 
second. I want you to just think about this, okay? Two people, think of 
it as yourself, you're earning 11 grand. That's your total income. You 
run into somebody you really like earning 11 grand. You get married. 
Anyway, that's $22,000 a year joint income, right? They confirmed in the 
hearing -- this is so -- what I'm about to tell you is so dumb, I can't 
believe it's true, even though I've now been told in public at the ways 
and means committee this is true. $22,000 total income, what would you 
guess is the financial cost annually in the change -- the earned income 
tax credit says if you're below a certain income level, that we will, in 
effect, rebate a tax credit to you to bring your income -- your take-home 
pay up. You all with me so far? You all understand the concept? What 
would you guess the united states government charges you for the act of 
marriage per year at $22,000? Very close. $4,600 a year. Yes. It's real 
money. And then you have of course politicians who say, "gee, we have too 
many births out of wedlock."  And your government wants to encourage you 
to get married by taking from you 25% of your income. 
<P>
>> if you don't get married, they get you the other way with the child 
support guidelines. If you don't get married, they take 21% of your 
income. And if you do stay married and remarry somebody else, they take 
the 25% right off the top, then another 22%. >> are you meaning to 
suggest that the system is rigged so that it doesn't work? >> yes. >> are 
you beginning to understand the underlying concept of this course? >> 
yeah. >> notice what I'm saying here again. I want to go back to this 
concept we use. Pragmatism: does it work? Don't tell me theory. Don't 
tell me abstract intellectuality. Tell me history. In the real world, is 
it working? And you go up to a real-world person -- and you'll see us get 
into this in the second hour -- and you say to them, "tell me why you 
aren't married." And they say, "because I'm not stupid." And you say to 
them, "what do you mean?" And they say, "it would cost me $4,600." You 
know, from my perspective, my girlfriend and I, from your perspective, my 
boyfriend and I, but we're doing okay. We're both getting all the money. 
We don't mind paying $50 for a wedding license, but $4,600 every year? 10 
years is $46,000. Maybe you'd like to test yourself in terms of your 
moral strength here. At what point is it enough? You say, "hey, what's 
the big deal?" My society's signal to me isn't: get married. My society's 
signal to me is: don't be dumb. How do you measure being dumb? In the 
real world. 
<P>
Now, the last one we're going to do is then say: all right, if America is 
changing but it is still at its heart a great country with good people, 
if America has a tradition and a set of patterns that work, if we're 
entering the world market, if we're entering the third wave information 
age, then what should citizenship and community be like in the 21st 
century? And that's a very important question. Because, you see, we have 
gradually shrunk citizenship to mean: do you vote? And you'll discover as 
you read the materials in this course that that is explicitly wrong. That 
in a free society, citizenship is 365 days a year, except for leap year 
when it's 366, and it's much richer and deeper than: do you vote? And 
it's not just the citizen and the state. This is one of the key points I 
want to make that you'll see really does change things. What you've had 
in America has been a debate that says: here is the private sector. 
<P>
And we've often talked about this as the right. I think I'm actually 
putting these on wrong in terms of where they are on the board. Here is 
government, by which we normally mean Washington. Okay? In de 
Tocqueville's description of America, there is this vast, rich middle 
section which is community. I mean, the boy scouts aren't really private 
sector. The boy scouts or the girl scouts or the YMCA or the salvation 
army or Bnai Brith or a thousand different groups are efforts -- you 
know, I'm a big -- I'm a nut about zoos, as you'll learn over the course 
of the next 10 weeks, and zoo Atlanta is a privatized community 
institution. It's not really a profit-making business, but it's no longer 
-- it's actually under lease from the city of Atlanta, but it is run by a 
private corporation, and as a result, is, in fact, a dramatically better 
zoo than if it was run by the government. 
<P>
Disney world, of course, which is the largest single site of 
entertainment in the world, is a -- it's private sector. It's a 
profit-making institution. Callaway gardens is a community institution. 
It's a nonprofit foundation established by the Callaway family. Kennesaw 
mountain battlefield park is a government institution. And what we're 
going to argue in part in this course is that as this has grown bigger 
and bigger, it's crowded out more and more of what works in America and 
replaced it with bureaucracies that fail. And so what we're going to try 
to do in this course is take you back to the very beginning, walk you 
through the principles of American Civilization, lay out how they apply 
in the real world, measure them pragmatically. Does it work? 
<P>
And then talk about reinventing an America, renewing an American 
Civilization by reestablishing the legitimate relationships, shrinking 
the failed bureaucracies of the systems that objectively don't work. I 
mean, this is not right or left. This is not ideological. This is 
pragmatic. You're paying "x" number of dollars. Are you getting the 
result you want? We found out -- last year we had hearings, and we found 
out that the supplemental security income program was sending checks to 
alcoholics to liquor stores. There was one store in Denver that had 40 
alcoholics on the roll. The liquor stores would cash the checks for them. 
Now, I would argue that a great nation with a good people doesn't send 
checks to the alcoholics at liquor stores. They can drink themselves to 
death. We may be extraordinarily generous helping them get off their 
alcoholism. We may want to do many things to help them improve their 
lives. But giving them the monthly opportunity for a drinking binge to 
get killed is wrong. And so we need to think through this scale of 
change. 
<P>
And what makes the -- what makes this course, I think, unique is not only 
do we assert that America is multiethnic, but one civilization. Not only 
do we assert that it's basically good, which in many camps is to be 
considered a radical and probably an idea so heretical you could have a 
riot. But we're asserting that it is a learned set of principles, and 
that the best way to learn the principles is historic, not theoretical. 
It's by actually going out and saying, "all right, how did they do it?" 
You know, when you talk about "let's invent government," if you immerse 
yourself in the founding fathers, you are studying people who, by the 
way, weren't all that brilliant automatically. 
<P>
And let me give you just one last example so you can understand this 
pattern of thinking and learning and over time seeing how things evolve. 
Well, you might someday want to figure out a way, again, to privatize it 
in the sense of private sector, not to find a way to make it a community 
function rather than a government function. The question's legitimate. 
You do it for anything. I would argue that virtually everything should be 
on the table to at least think about. Thinking about something can be 
very bold and daring. Doing it ought to be cautious and careful. But for 
the purpose of a course, we ought to be allowed to think about almost 
anything. But remember, we tend to look backwards. 1789, they did good. 
They swear in Washington. Big deal. Founded a system which is the longest 
standing free society in the history of the world. Remember, the debate 
begins around 1760. The first continental congress is 1774. I'm doing all 
of this off my head, so, Dr. Minnix, if I get it wrong, just feel free to 
yell at me. Because I'm -- I've not looked at these numbers, but I think 
this is a helpful thing if we look at. By 1776, we've declared 
independence. We go through waves down here of writing state 
constitutions. Sometimes as many, I believe, as five or six. This will be 
a useful paper for somebody just to look at. But you'll find that a lot 
of the founding fathers had written two or three or four state 
constitutions. Finally -- and they write the articles of confederation, 
which, remember, failed. So by the time they come around to writing the 
constitution, which is 1787, I believe -- as I say, this was off the top 
of my head -- what you have by here is a group of very experienced people.
<P>
 And by the way, we talk about professional politicians, these guys were 
all professional politicians. Washington won elections from the 1760s on. 
Jefferson was governor of Virginia. He was a consistent elected 
politician. Madison was an elected politician. Franklin had been active 
in Pennsylvania politics for 50 years. But they were other things. They 
were also businessmen. They were also farmers. They were also generals. 
They were also writers. They weren't narrowly professional. It wasn't the 
only thing they did, and they fairly often left office and came back. It 
was a different world. There's nothing wrong with studying the profession 
of how free people govern themselves. There's everything wrong with 
selling out your values because you want an office. But my point, to give 
you heart, is: we're probably around here. So there's no reason to say to 
ourselves, "we have to have a higher standard than they had. Let's do the 
constitution by 1775 or, boy, are we failures." Life occurs organically, 
and we'll come back to this.  Over time, you can accomplish many things 
you can't accomplish in the matter of a day or two. 
<P>
I think we have a minute or two before we have to take a quick break. Any 
questions or -- I've thrown a fair amount at you to start though. 
>> you say for the answers you go back and you look at history. But 
there's so many people who have different perspectives on what really 
happened in history. You have to read all of them. Being free -- I'm 
going to come back to you again and again with two concepts: life is 
hard. Freedom is frustrating. And if you don't start out every morning 
and understand that, that's part of why I'm so cheerful. The worst that 
-- I mean, the worst thing, I get up in the morning, I figure life's 
going to be hard, so when life is hard, I go, "see? Proved I was right." 
And I get up in the morning I say, "to be free is to be frustrated," so I 
go into meetings, I get frustrated. I go, "see?" I'm very serious. 
<P>
I had a meeting yesterday morning with all the senior staff of the house 
republican party, including all of the committee staff directors, and I 
said to them, "the next eight months are going to be really hard. So when 
it's really hard, say to yourself, 'ain't it great being in the 
majority?' don't whine. Just relax, go home, take a break, come in the 
next morning and go, 'wow, this is neat. It's going to be really hard all 
day.'" and so -- because you're coming to the core of this, and we're 
about to run out of time, but this is really the core of the course. We 
can have a partnership in America. Partnership means we both have to do 
it. We can't have a system where people say, "I've got this great idea: 
I'll vote for you, I'll do nothing, you take care of me." It won't 
survive. It will die. 

So a free society, I really am allowed to say to you, "maybe you haven't 
read enough," and then you've just got to go read more. Now, you can read 
more in lots of ways. Or maybe you ought to go find a good historian like 
Dr. Minnix and say, "which two books would you read?" But I'll also tell 
you, just as in life, you can walk around this room a week from now and 
get different opinions from different people about each other, same 
thing's true in history, because history is just a reflection of life. 
Now, let me ask very quickly: how long are we taking a break for? We have 
a 10-minute break. This is all brand new to me. It's very exciting. And 
after 10 minutes, we've got to be back in here, because we're live on 
mind extension university, so we can't just hang out. Thank you very, 
very much. See you in a couple minutes. 
<P>
(10-minute break) 
<P>
Let me tell you again a very key principle here that makes this very 
different from a lot of what you're going to see. I'm going to share with 
you over the course of the ten weeks, very specific things that in my 
experience work. I'm going to talk to you later on today by what I mean 
by work. What I want you to think about for a second -- my credentials 
for being here are several. I'm a Ph.D..... in history. I've taught for 
years, I'm a national leader. I've been working on the question of 
self-government for 36 years, and I think you can make an objective 
argument better than we could the first time we taught the course, that 
there's some evidence that I actually know some things that work based on 
the fact that it's worked. But the principles I'm going to tell you about 
and share with you are designed for you, because the core of my belief 
here, the reason I'm teaching it as a course, is that a free society 
operates based on each free person.  So that if we're entering an 
information age -- the reason I'm sharing Drucker with you which is "the 
Effective Executive," is Drucker's argument that in the information age, 
every citizen is an executive, every person -- you can literally figure 
this out. 
<P>
Two examples: it has been estimated that as late as 17th century Britain 
if you lived in a small village and you were a peasant the total amount 
of new information you got in a lifetime was less than the Sunday "New 
York Times." That in your lifetime, the total amount of new ideas, new 
information, you know, what happened to King John -- who's King John? I 
mean, people had very limited oral traditions of varying local 
information. You're now in a totally different world, the number of 
situations you could make. Well, it's time once again to plow, it's time 
once again to harvest. I guess once we invented canning, which is 
actually a product of the French revolution, I guess it's time to can. 
Okay? Now what happens? You wake up in the morning. Which of the 60 
channels would you like to watch if you want to go to your cable or your 
satellite receiver as opposed to putting in a VCR or listening to a CD or 
putting on your record -- or your radio. Or what would you rather do? 
None of those, because you are now going to work on your computer 
terminal. Or do you want to do none of that because you are going to go 
over to your exercise club, or you don't really do that because you golf. 
I mean, it's very interesting. You could easily take a day and just make 
a list of all of the option choices. 
<P>
This is why Toffler's first great book was called "future shock," because 
Alvin and Heidi argued, what's going to happen to people is you are used 
to making five decisions a day, now you're going to make 3,000. Okay. 
Furthermore, the argument we're going to make is if truly we're a great 
country with a great people, then in order to solve problems you don't 
want to hire the smartest person to be President, the smartest person to 
be secretary of health and human services, you want to figure out what's 
smart and you want to communicate it to every one of you. By the way, 
this is why we beat nazi Germany. I mean, go back and see the movie 
"sergeant York" with Gary cooper. Go back and look at any world war ii 
movie made before 1965. What you had was, you picked up people off the 
streets, they were normal Americans. But of course they knew how to use a 
telephone, they knew how to drive a vehicle, they knew how to take 
orders, they knew how to give orders, they organized -- they are 
self-organizing systems, so guess what? 
<P>
The finest tactical army in the world the Wermacht lost, lost to a bunch 
of people who were not professional soldiers, who it knew couldn't beat. 
Our theory was you just get good Americans and they go out and do good 
things; and they don't do it all that good the first day, but they keep 
learning. And after a while, no matter how smart the other team is, if we 
keep learning and they don't learn, we will beat them eventually. Now, so 
I'm going to start with -- I'm going to share with you two essential 
systems for leadership, remembering that when I say leadership, I mean 
you. Every citizen is a leader in a free society. So I'm talking about 
every citizen. You could call it citizenship. Since you wouldn't be near 
as excited if I called it citizenship, I decided to call it leadership. 
<P>
Since I'm now speaker of the house you probably think I actually know 
something. I'm going to show you an essential system for planning an 
essential system for leading. There are two different behaviors: planning 
is in the end done inside you. Planning, in the end, is done inside you. 
You can have a planning committee but sooner or later it comes to let's 
put something on the board and that's inside. It can be inside the 
committee. Or it can literally be you listen to the whole committee then 
everybody else takes a break and you write the first draft. But leading 
is by definition outside you, for a very practical reason. If I lead and 
you don't follow, I ain't leading. So if I'm going to lead and you're 
going to follow -- in other words, I can plan inside me for me, but if 
I'm going to lead you to follow me, I've got to find some connection 
between us, that gives you a reason to want to come with me. You all with 
me so far? 
<P>
So the first thing I am going to teach you is inside. The second thing is 
by definition outside. Now, the model for planning is four layers and 
it's four words: vision, strategies, projects and tactics. I absolutely 
unequivocally want you to learn these four words in this order. It is a 
hierarchy. That means the top one dominates the other three. The second 
one dominates the other two. Now what do I mean by that? First of all, 
I'll use a very simple couple of examples. What is your vision of dinner? 
Okay? We say, what's your vision of dinner? We are going to do dinner 
tonight. Dinner is a our project, we're now planning, I don't care what 
you make. What's your vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> fried chicken and potatoes. >> 
<P>
fried chicken and potatoes. There's a good southern answer. What's your 
vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> roast and carrots and potatoes. >> 
<P>
roast and carrots and potatoes. Big on potatoes this year. What's your 
vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> pizza. >> 
<P>
pizza. Okay. Now, my writing is fairly bad, but I'm a doctor after all. 
This is the vision level answer, all right. If we do this long enough, 
you'll start to get hungry. Now, what are some strategies we could use in 
order to achieve our vision? Ah, see, the word "strategies" stopped you. 
Strategies, a planned technique for achieving a result. >> shopping. >> 
<P>
shopping. What do you mean by shopping? 
<P>
>> pick up the ingredients. >> 
<P>
now grocery shopping, grocery store, right. We're going to build a matrix 
here, any of these answers could go under any of these three solutions. 
You follow me? So put this across, we're not saying you have to go 
grocery shopping for fried chicken, because of course there are other 
techniques, right. But you could use the grocery store. What else could 
you do? 
<P>
>> reservations. >> 
<P>
he stole my answer. 
<P>
>> this is a non-sexist course, I'm not automatically going to favor you 
just because you are a woman, it was a tie. What does reservations mean? 
<P>
>> call a restaurant. >> 
<P>
telling you are coming. 
<P>
>> you go to the kind of restaurants that take reservations. Oh, okay. 
We'll put down restaurant. We'll have two alternative strategies here, 
fancy and normal. Am I right here? Are we -- okay. How many of you would 
not have said reservations? I just want to find out rapidly we can get 
into class warfare here. Now, what's another technique? Take out. Is this 
late 20th century America or what? 
<P>
Notice -- by the way we're in Waleska, Georgia, at Reinhardt College in a 
region which was historically what? Rural, rural and -- 
<P>
>> farming. >> 
<P>
how come they didn't go out and get their own chicken, huh? 
<P>
>> notice none of you even said it? It didn't occur to you. We're in the 
second or third largest chicken producing area in the united states. 
Let's go out in the backyard, right, lots of luck. I used to teach 
students who thought chickens came in plastic. They had no idea there was 
actually a bird attached to it. Actually at West Georgia I had a 
professor who had a class, it was a psychology class that actually killed 
chickens, it was very strange. You begin to see how you begin to build a 
pattern here. So you now have your vision, but if we take vision number 
one, fried chicken, and we don't teach the vision and we simply say, 
let's go out, and we end up, -- who had the pizza -- we end up at Pizza 
Hut, we're not going to get your vision. You all with me? You see how it 
begins to relate? Okay. 
<P>
Now, projects. And this is a key concept. This is the essence of 
management, which is management, by the way, is different than 
leadership. Management is the effective use of resources already created. 
Leadership is the creation of leadership and is the creation of resources 
and using them the right way. There is a big difference between the two, 
okay. So management is using something right, leadership is making sure 
it's being used for the right reason. Very big difference. Projects are a 
definable, delegatable achievement. Achievement, defining the achievement 
so you can delegate, not the process. So you don't say at this level, go 
shopping. Because after all you could go shopping and come back with a 
dress. You say, I would like you to go to Kentucky fried chicken and get 
dinner for six people. That's a definable, delegatable achievement. 
<P>
Or I would like you to call Domino's and have them deliver by 6:00 this 
evening. You see how you define it, and you are defining the end state, 
what is it that has occurred if I've successfully done my job? So this is 
a definable, delegatable achievement. Then at the bottom you have 
tactics. Now, tactics are daily behavior. What do you do at the actual 
point of contact? For example, we're going to go to pizza hut, you put on 
blue jeans, you're going to Nikolai's roof in Atlanta, you probably don't 
put on blue jeans because they won't let you in. So you have to figure 
out what is tactically acceptable. You are on a very limited budget, you 
are closer to here. You're on an unlimited budget, we're here and we're 
at a big fancy gourmet restaurant. 
<P>
But, I mean, think about it: you want to run McDonald's, you don't hire 
people to wear tuxes. You want to run Nikolai's roof so it looks like a 
late 19th century, early 20th century czarist restaurant. You don't hire 
people to dress like they do at McDonald's. So there is a very important 
relationship between this and this. I mean I have a permanent problem. I 
have a vision of myself as a thinner person. I have two tactics, I eat 
ice cream and I drink beer. Even at 51, I am not mature enough to 
reconcile these two problems. Okay? You all understand the concept now of 
vision, strategies, projects and tactics? This is very central as an 
intellectual tool for everything else we're going to do, because it 
allows you to figure out which of these layers are you talking about when 
you read a newspaper. Or you discuss an issue and when you try to solve a 
problem. And it gives you the ability now to do planning in a very 
powerful way. Now the second part of this, you've got a plan here, you 
think you know what you want to do. 
<P>
Now I'm going to teach you the second part. Can I just get you to do this 
while I'm talking to save some time. The second thing I want to do is 
walk you through the leading part of this now. We have our plan and I 
want to make a real point here. People who've never led, teach leading as 
though it this autonomous -- I'm up here, I'm the leader, look at me. 
That's nonsense. That's the opposite of real leadership. What I'm going 
to teach you absolutely works. And again, I think I have visible proof 
this week that I'm talking from a background of experience. But it is the 
opposite of the stupid way we currently teach leadership and it is 
opposite of the elite culture's depiction of how you lead. Effective 
leadership is four words: they are a process, they are not a hierarchy, 
that is the first word comes first, but it's equally as important to the 
other three: they are listen, learn, help and lead. 
<P>
Now ideally, we have them on the Chyron because it doesn't fit the TV 
screen right. I normally write them so they are across like this. I would 
normally say: listen, learn, help and lead. By the way, when I give my 
speeches, those of you who watch me speak, I speak from notes. The way I 
normally represent it, I do this to remind me it's a hierarchy, and then 
I'l do this. First you listen to people. Notice how I started, what do 
you want for dinner? When you listen to people you genuinely listen and 
this is, by the way, a very hard thing to learn. Lots of people listen 
transactionally. All of you have been to a cocktail party parties or to 
events where you listen transactionally, right. You're standing there, 
pretending to listen while thinking how do I get away from this idiot? 
That doesn't count. That's not listening. 
<P>
I mean, you try to understand, why do they say what they're saying? What 
do they mean? If they said pizza then they really don't mean fettucini. 
You have to actually listen, which means you got to stop yourself. You 
got to discipline yourself to truly listen and if you don't understand 
them, the trick is to then say, gee, I didn't quite get that. So you have 
to get them, draw them out, ask them questions. As a general principle, 
we're a lone enough society if you want to listen to people and learn 
from them, they love talking to you. If you listen to them and learn from 
them you can almost always help them. You help them, first of all, 
transactionally, they listen, they must think I'm okay. You learn second 
because you just have a different viewpoint. You can actually share with 
them. Here's the feedback on what I heard. You may know something with 
them they don't know. Oh, you want pizza? There is a place right down the 
street. 
<P>
Now in a rational society if people know that you're willing to listen to 
them, you're willing to learn from them, you actively are trying to help 
them, then they want you to lead. Notice how backwards that is from the 
way people normally think it works? Leadership is not "I have this great 
vision, follow me." Leadership is, "I think I've got a vision, but before 
I tell you mine, what's yours?" If I were trying to lead this room I'd 
start by spending over an hour listening to you telling me your vision 
and I would list all your visions up here, then I would summarize and try 
to bring together the best of the visions. And then I'd say, "now that we 
have all invested in our vision, how do you think we could implement it?" 
By the time that process was over you would want me to be your leader 
because you'd know I was willing to put in the time and energy and the 
patience to make sure then you were part of what you're being led to. 
Yes. 
<P>
>> what's the -- >> depends on the circumstances. 
<P>
>> you find out what direction the group is getting it from, that old 
joke about leadership. >> 
<P>
I almost never do that. I think that's nonsense, I think that's 
counterfeit. It also depends on how important it is. If the group says we 
don't like the fact Gingrich drinks beer, we're into diet coke this week, 
I don't care. I mean, we'll do diet coke. But if it was, let's go into 
cannibalism, I mean, you got to draw lines. Again, a leader who imposes 
the detail is stupid. What you ought to be is generous in sharing with 
people as much as you can so that everybody has ownership. So if you 
really want to help the poor, part of it has to be listening. I'm going 
to get into this a lot when we get to that session. You cannot offer a 
solution that people can't apply in their lives. Back to pragmatism. Will 
it work? Well, you don't know cause it ain't you. I mean, you may have 
the neatest idea in the world but is it neat for the real person in the 
real world doing the real thing? So it really is constant, all right. 
<P>
Now this next section I thought I'd toss in given all the coverage of 
recent weeks, I thought -- for two reasons, one is I figure this is the 
best way to get it all out in the open. But the second is, I think one of 
the things we undervalue in the modern world is just sheer experience. I 
was turned on to this by Gary will in his book "the declaration of 
independence." He describes George Washington, and he says no modern 
political scientist or historian can fully appreciate Washington because 
the most important fact of Washington doesn't count in the modern 
academic world. It was his character. This was the man you could build a 
country on. And since character doesn't exist in the modern world, you 
can't count it. So you can't value it. So you can't understand him. So he 
becomes this funny guy with wooden teeth. And it's very interesting, 
Flexner in the paperback edition of his one volume biography of 
Washington talks bitterly about how Washington has been degraded by 
modern cynicism. Says this was a man so noble, so incredible, so 
unbelievable in ways we can't measure and therefore we make fun of him 
which tells you about the pathologies of our society, not George 
Washington. 
<P>
So I thought I would start with this notion -- I'm going to make a couple 
of assertions that are unacademic. I am the speaker of the house. I have 
won and lost elections for a long time. I have studied history for a long 
time. I actually know a fair amount. I have raised two children. And so I 
want to do two things here: I want to tell you my biases. Because a lot 
of people say how can you have somebody who's a national figure teach? 
After all, they have biases. I'm going to argue that not only should you 
know the biases of professor Gingrich, but I want to argue that all 
professors have biases. So it's good to share with you the biases. I also 
want to give you at the beginning of this course the sense that this is a 
unique course, that far from what the university system did when the 
board of regents said we should let no elected officials teach, which has 
got to be the dumbest single rule I've seen. We should be going in the 
opposite direction. 
<P>
I mean, if you want to have a business program and a local millionaire 
who made it in one generation is willing to share with your students the 
fact that this is how you get to be a millionaire, maybe even if they 
don't have a Ph.d.  It's a good course. You know, Bill Gates would like 
to do a course on inventing companies, it would be okay. Even though -- 
he is a drop out, didn't get his college degree, just made $7 billion or 
$30 billion, whatever the number is, okay. Now, here's some of my biases. 
First of all, you have to understand my biases are largely created 
through 51 years of living, experience and reflecting. I really value 
pragmatism. If you really want to understand my ideology, it is that I'm 
an American pragmatist. The "American" is the important modifier. I am 
pragmatic within the American experience. I was born in central 
Pennsylvania, which is a very work- oriented Amish Pennsylvania Dutch 
region. If you saw the movie "witness" it gave you a really good flavor. 
These are people who work very hard. 
<P>
So I come out of a work ethic that's very intense. I worked in my 
childhood. We believed in work. My family believed in work. They thought 
it was noble. They thought any job is a good job. When you hear somebody 
say, well, that's a pan -- that's a hamburger flipping job. You know, 
that's somebody that doesn't understand American. Any job is noble in 
America. Any job is better than welfare. Any job is better than doing 
nothing, and it's better to work when you're young. A recent "wall street 
journal" paper that interviewed a first generation millionaires, the 
average, the average started work before they were ten. They ran -- 
delivered newspapers, they ran lemonade stands, they learned how to have 
a market. They learned to deal with customers. They learned to discipline 
themselves to show up very early. 
<P>
My aunt Loma, my aunt Louise and my grandma Dougherty had a lot to do 
with training me. I am a product in many ways of very strong women. My 
grandma Dougherty had been a teacher and because of the modern 
certification techniques, she only had two years of college. When they 
said you had to have four years of teaching, she quit teaching. I showed 
up and I was her only class, so I got 30 students' worth of attention and 
she beat into me how to read by the time I was 4. My aunt Louise and 
uncle Bruce -- my uncle Bruce was the garage attendant for in the state 
of Pennsylvania. He's the guy who checked the cars out. That meant he had 
access to the Pennsylvania state library which was the largest library in 
central Pennsylvania. So at 13 years of age I had a library card and 
stack permit and I would spend my summers wondering through this giant 
library, which is a reminder, it doesn't matter who you are, it matters 
what you care about. It cares what you're willing to do. You could've 
said uncle Bruce was only a garage attendant. No, he was a very loving 
uncle who did what it was he could do. My uncle Cal Troutman, who was 
aunt Loma's husband, was a very partisan Republican and had been a 
precinct worker since the 1920's. 
<P>
And I grew up in a Theodore Roosevelt-Gifford Pinchot Republicanism which 
ironically was the conservation republicans. I used to teach in a studies 
program. My family's -- I have a broad extended family, my families 
generally were without money, but they were not poor. They would never 
have occurred to them to think they were poor. They just didn't have 
money. They were middle class except there wasn't much cash at the end of 
the week. Very important psychological distinction. We had a very strong 
extended family. A lot of my education was sitting around the kitchen 
table listening to all my older relatives talk to each other in a very 
rich oral tradition. For example, I had a grandfather, great grandfather 
Triester -- Triester valley, which is below state college, in a poker 
game in 1903 when he was drunk, which led my grandmother to hate alcohol. 
I mean, you learn these things. You learn these stories, again in 
history. You learn how did we get here, who are we, what are the lessons 
of life. It was a very sustaining family. Now, both my fathers were 
basically foster children. My mother was divorced and remarried. I'm 
adopted. I was born a McPherson, my stepfather is Gingrich, but he was 
adopted.  He lived as a foster child till he was 16. 
<P>
When I talk about strengthening the family, it's not because I'm some 
upper middle class country club guy from a perfect family with a perfect 
background, I'm divorced and remarried. But it's because I lived through 
these societies. I mean, I understand we're talking about human beings, 
we're talking about trying to find ways to be human. I think probably the 
most important formative moment in my life when I was about 3 or 4 years 
of age, I saw my great grandfather as he was in the process of dying. I 
didn't see him actually die, but he was very, very sick. I watched him 
being cared for and for some reason it got through to me that that's the 
way it is. I mean, sooner or later, you end. So at a very young age I 
became a very sober child, and I concluded life is hard. But to quote 
Faulkner's Nobel prize winning speech "mankind will endure and prevail," 
that is, yes, it's hard, but you can make it work for you. If you're 
prepared to start accepting it's hard, you can do it. 
<P>
Charles Krauthheimer, who is a great national correspondent -- you may 
have seen him on television -- one of the smartest guys around, dove the 
into a swimming pool at 19 and became a paraplegic, he's in a wheelchair. 
Yet Krauthheimer today, you'll see him on national television, you'll see 
him doing things. It's a reminder to me when I see Krauthheimer and how 
hard he has worked to have a full life and I run into somebody who is 
able-bodied, has no problems and cannot walk from their apartment we have 
given them to their public library a block away to borrow a free book, I 
try to figure out how do I get Krautheimer's psychological zest and 
commitment for life in every American, because that's what I grew up with 
the sense of you get knocked on your back, get up. You get knocked on 
your front, get up. You fall down, get up. What do you mean, you wouldn't 
get back up. It may go back again to this work ethic concept. That 
established my prejudices about work and struggle. I'm very tough-minded 
about what you have to do to be a free person. 
<P>
I think that character matters. I think this whole debate over the bell 
curve is silly, it's nonsense, it's a bunch of academics. And right wing 
academics are as dumb as left wing academics. And the fact is what 
matters in life is your character not your i. Q. And group IQ's are 
irrelevant. I don't want to know how well whites score. I want to know 
how well you work. Are you willing to show up? And I don't want to know 
that you could in theory learn very fast except you are a drug addict and 
you are unwilling to do anything while the person next to you learns much 
slower but, by the way, they put in nine hours a day and they are totally 
reliable. So guess which one I want to hire? 
<P>
So all this stuff about IQ is I think nonsense. Tell me about your 
character. Tell me whether or not you are willing to learn. Tell me 
whether or not you are willing to do things. In addition, I was taught 
very early that persistence defeats all other characteristics in 
politics. A wonderful newspaper man named Paul walker, who adopted me and 
he was my mentor when I was young, gave me one time an article about 
Lincoln's five defeats, and I carried it in my wallet for years, because 
I couldn't guarantee I was smarter. I couldn't guarantee I was prettier. 
I couldn't guarantee I was more articulate. I could guarantee I'd get up 
earlier. I'd work longer and I'd never stop. I got defeated twice. I ran 
for five years and there were long days when it was very lonely and I was 
very scared. And I'd pull out that article and I think it's okay, just 
keep going. 
<P>
And so I have a very high value of persistence. I really do believe 
freedom is frustrating. I also believe it's very, very dangerous to 
protect a free society. My dad served in Korea and I went as an army 
brat, I went to see "the sands of Iwo Jima" four times in one day. If you 
ever see the movie, it's john Wayne as a marine drill sergeant. He is a 
very lonely and he's very tough because he's having to do to these young 
people what they have to do learn to survive on the battlefield and at 
the end of the movie he gets killed. And I think it absolutely imprinted 
on me the idea that you've got to be prepared to sacrifice everything for 
your country if your country's going to survive. And part of what I see 
public life is about is the survival of your country. We then lived in 
fort Riley and I didn't even think about it until I was preparing this 
class, but the people who taught me, I was nine or ten years of age and I 
was hanging around with my dad and his friends, the people who taught me 
about life had served in World War II in Korea, they believe there's a 
term hard training, easy mission; easy training hard mission. I would 
argue that's what's wrong with modern schools for the poor. Schools need 
to be tough so life gets easy, when schools are easy, life is tough. 
<P>
And these guys, I didn't realize until I was thinking this through last 
week, these guys were all tough because they'd all been through real 
combat and they'd all been real problems and they knew if you didn't 
train right and you didn't care enough for your men to be tough on them, 
they were going to die. I just acquired that when I was nine or ten years 
of age by hanging out with them, listening to my dad talking, going out 
in the field with these guys occasionally and watching what they did. 
Then we moved to France and lived there during the Algerian civil war. 
There was 100% inflation. 1957 and 1958. They paid us in script. They 
didn't give us u. S. Dollars because it would have destroyed the French 
currency. So I was a young kid by this stage, I'm 13-14 years old, I'm 
being paid in this funny money. We're living on the French economy. I'm 
playing with kids who's parents who were killed in World War II. We went 
to school past World War II bomb damage. And then in the decisive moment 
probably of my live, we went to the battlefield of Verdun, which was the 
largest battlefield of World War I. I saw damage done in 1916 that had 
not been repaired. 42 years later. 
<P>
And I began to think about, you see Bosnia, you see Rwanda, I began to 
think about my hometown. What would it be like in America? What's it 
worth to not have it happen? I was once asked by Edward teller, the 
father of the hydrogen bomb, how hard would I work for my family to 
survive after a nuclear war? It's a good question to ask yourself. A 
nuclear war occurs. How hard would you work to survive? And I said, "you 
do everything." He said, "fine." "doesn't it make more sense to do it now 
so it doesn't occur?" And for some reason it got -- it penetrated me 
totally because it was the only morally correct answer. In the same way 
we faced, I think in the spring of 1958, the concept of the death of 
civilization. That summer we moved from Orleans, France, to Stuttgart 
Germany. Literally, the day we arrived in Stuttgart, we walked in, 
ordered breakfast, we were changing stations, my dad picked up the 
morning "stars and stripes," the United States army and marines had 
landed in Lebanon. He said, "I'll be back when I can." And he went and 
reported in and came back four days later. To me this was all real and 
you better have people who care enough about their country that they're 
prepared to do this or you don't keep your country. In that context, we 
really worked very, very hard in trying to put all of this together. 
<P>
And I can tell my staff for a second we're missing three pages of my copy 
of the Chyron, so you may want to figure out how I got three missing 
pages here. I also want to talk, though, about as that went through, I 
came to the conclusion after a while that I wanted to be in public life. 
I came to the conclusion that it was very, very important that we reach 
out and that you learn constantly. I mean -- just walk over here. You 
make mistakes, you just accept them -- actually the reason I told you 
that, john, it goes from page 18 to page 21. Either you and I are both 
missing -- it goes from Chyron 56d to Chyron 62a. You may want to have 
somebody walk in here for a second. The point I'm trying to make is that 
when I started out I found myself growing based on my understanding of my 
mission in life, I mean I was not a natural politician. I'm basically a 
book worm and my basic attitude is to run and hide. I'm looking forward 
this afternoon to watching the Pittsburgh game. 
<P>
I'm going to take a break for two hours and go do a town hall meeting but 
I'll get to see the first half of the Pittsburgh game. But I had to learn 
the skills and the habits necessary to do the things that were required, 
because I really believe the country's at stake, not in a 
republican-democrat sense, but in an historic sense and that 
civilizations die and that every generation has to arouse some people who 
try to make sure that they understand what it takes to not die. So what 
I'm going to share with you in these ten sessions is literally 36 years 
of work at this question. Now, in that context, I think that you also 
should know that I have raised two children, Kathy and Jackie sue. There 
are a lot of lessons of life of raising children. I stayed home with my 
older daughter for a while and my wife worked. And then I went to night 
school and we had -- so I had a fair amount of intimate relationship with 
my oldest daughter when she was very young. 
<P>
And that's -- it is an interesting experience looking back. It means we 
are both very bonded and males always react different than females. At 
one point my oldest daughter was spitting her pea back out. You put it 
in, she dribble it out. I got frustrated so I just put it on top of her 
head. She sat there and stared at me. This created a certain trauma which 
we still lived through. I also -- I have to say I learned a lot and I 
changed a lot about being female in the modern world for both my two 
daughters and for Marianne. And because I had grown up in an army 
environment that was male dominated and was very different, so that was 
for me very different. We also part of what I mean by life was hard. Both 
Marianne and I each have lost our best friend. She lost her best friend 
about five years ago to liver cancer and I lost my best friend two years 
ago, a man Jim Tilton who I'd known since high school, to pancreatic 
cancer. So I think we have been through part of this and we speak from 
some background. 
<P>
Now in that context, given those biases, I want to work a lot at 
empowering you as an individual. I think this is a very, very important 
part of where we're going and what we're doing. And one of the things I 
want to empower you with -- okay, that's fine. -- is the notion of 
thinking of life over time, this is by the way, I think, the greatest 
problem of having a generationally driven education system. The notion of 
-- because the fact, is life occurs over time. If you are 12, you don't 
know that because you haven't lived very long. If you are 51, you know 
that but you don't know how to say it in a way that people who are 12 
learn it. If you say to me what can I get done by tomorrow, my answer is 
not much. If you say to me what can I get done in a decade, my answer is 
a lot. If you say what can I get done in 30 years, the answer is an 
enormous amount, and you'll do different things at different points. 
<P>
Now what happens is people all to often in the modern era say, okay, I'm 
good for a week. My answer is so why would I pay any attention to it? We 
used to have a rule in the house that if you hadn't been there at least 
six years, the older guys didn't even learn your name because they 
weren't sure you were going to stay around to be worth the effort. So 
it's very important to think through that what happens over time. That's 
why there are no hamburger flipping jobs, there are first jobs. Any first 
job is good because it teaches you to go to work. That only makes sense 
if you're thinking about it in a continuum. Makes no sense, if all of 
life -- it's the difference between a Polaroid and a movie. The Polaroid 
you're caught right here. Well, if I'm caught right here, I don't want to 
be there. Well, but what if it's a movie, and this is act 1 of a 20 act 
play? Well, then act 1 may be cool, that's all right. In addition, I want 
you to think of learning as a form of power. This is a very, very 
important core concept that I don't think we teach enough. Every time I 
start to do something, my first step is to learn. It's not to go do it. 
It's to stop and learn. Now, how do you learn? 
<P>
And this, by the way, violates all of the academic disciplines, almost 
all of which by definition I think are inadequate. I would argue you want 
to follow knowledge as it is needed to solve problems. One of the great 
moments of my life is -- I was at Emory, I was a history major, actually 
I was originally a political science major and then I switched to 
history. I was at a liberal arts college and I knew I didn't understand 
computers. And a friend of mine who was a state senator said, "you ought 
to go over to Georgia tech and meet a guy named Pete Jensen at the rich 
computer center," this is 1965. And I walked in to see Jensen, and Jensen 
said, "don't learn how to program a computer." He said, "by the time 
you're going to want to use them, programming is going to be obsolete and 
you're hire somebody to program them.". He said, "that would be like 
teaching you how to drive by becoming a mechanic." He said, "learn how to 
think about computers." And he said, "now the first thing I want you to 
do I want you to go read Drucker and I want you to learn to think about 
what's called project evaluation and review technique or a pert chart," 
which is a way of thinking about doing a job I'll show you later on. And 
I never took a course under Jensen, I just read about 50 books and talked 
to him for hundreds of hours because I wanted to learn. I wanted to 
follow the knowledge. 
<P>
Don't associate credentialing and learning. Learning occurs by learning 
what you need to know and going to whatever discipline you need for the 
next building block of learning. Credentialing occurs by sitting long 
enough somebody stamps you with approval. They are not related. 
Similarly, I think there is a cycle that's involved which I have 
literally lived through. You study, you apply, you get immersed and then 
you reflect. So first of all, you study, you think through, what are the 
principles, then you apply it to your planning. Then you are immersed in 
doing, then you reflect on doing. For example, on Wednesday when I got 
sworn in, I was purely in the immersion phase. I didn't have any time on 
Wednesday to do either studying or reflecting. We began reflecting late 
Wednesday night. 
<P>
But if you think of this cycle, you want to do something, first you study 
it then you apply what you've studied to your particular project, then 
you immerse yourself in trying to get it done, nd then you reflect on 
what knew you learned based on the cycle. Then you go back and start over 
again by deciding what you want to do next in studying again. I also 
believe passionately in apprenticeship, friendships and the importance of 
permanent learning and permanent growth. I believe that you need to reach 
out. You will hear it again and again during the course. Find people who 
have already done what you want to do and learn from them. People love to 
teach. You go to somebody, say teach me what you know. And the trick is 
simple, what do you want to do, who's done it, go find them. I believe in 
real professionalism, which is the application of systems that work 
rather than either bureaucratism or disciplinism. The bureaucratism is 
purely the idea that the bureaucracy says do x even if it's stupid, so 
you got your hole punched, at least you did what they told you to even if 
it was dumb. Credentialism is, you may not be able to speak German but 
you have a credit that says you can speak German so you can teach German 
even though you can't speak it. You may be able to speak German but don't 
have the credentials, so you can't teach it even though you can speak it. 
<P>
So we're now going to put the kids in a German class with a non- German 
speaker with the right credentials. We do that every day in this country 
today and it's stupid. We should abolish it tomorrow morning. And I want 
you to understand the difference between the two models. I also 
understand that this is the moral purpose of this course. This course is 
essentially a moral course. It is essentially arguing there is an 
America, America is good, that that's it's worth doing but there's 
citizenship and citizenship is your responsibility. That it's a 
partnership, which means you have to meet your half of the partnership. 
In that sense this is, well, that's a history course, Dr. Minnix has a 
history degree and I have a history degree and I think we can reasonably 
match our standards in the amount we've read with most historians and we 
can match the course preparation. The truth is this is in the best sense 
of the old-fashioned word a liberal arts course. This is a course of 
trying to think through life and trying to think through society and 
trying to think through culture and whichever discipline we need to 
borrow from for the purpose of the course, we'll just borrow it. They can 
sue us later. 
<P>
The essence is -- the essence of the course is applying American 
Civilization's principles to problem solving. So first you got to figure 
out what are the principles of American Civilization and now how do we 
apply them to solve problems? Example: list five rules, I want you to try 
to do this for a second. List five rules you would tell an immigrant the 
first day they arrived in America. How would you teach them the children? 
Just think about it. Somebody walks up to you says, "hi, I landed today, 
I got off the airplane in Atlanta." "I came from country x." "I want to 
be an American." Give me an example. What's one example you can give me? 
<P>
>> learn the language. >> 
<P>
learning. See, you are already in -- you already made a very key point. 
Should they really learn English? Isn't that sort of discriminating 
against their own language? 
<P>
>> yeah, they should. >> 
<P>
yeah, they should. There's a very practical reason they should. There is 
a very pragmatic reason they should. If you are going to be in this 
commercial economy, you better speak the language of the people who have 
the money. 
<P>
>> learn the social customs. >> 
<P>
learn the social customs. Give me an example of the social customs. 
<P>
>> well, modes of dress, things that we eat, times that we eat. >>
<P>
okay. Of course when you say things that we eat, this is the most diverse 
world civilization on the planet about things we eat, but there are 
limits. We don't, for example, practice cannibalism. So if you were from 
new guinea or from the Brazilian rain forest, that might be an important 
point. I mean, you may laugh about it. As late as the 1840's, the British 
sent an officer to the Nash country in India to convince them to stop 
eating people. They had a habit of getting an annual slave, they fattened 
the slave, and then killed the slave and someone ate them. And this young 
British officer was sent there. This is referenced in Drucker's book, 
"the Effective Executive." Young officer sent there 24 years old, sits 
down with the tribal chief, the tribal chieftain says, this is very 
important about what I mean by civilization, the tribal chieftain says, 
"of course you respect our customs." He said, "of course, I do." He said, 
"our custom is to eat people." "I respect that." He said, "of course you 
old chief will respect our customs." And he said, "but of course I do." 
"our custom is to shoot people who eat people." They had a big tribal 
meeting. Gave it up. They didn't -- do you see how it weaves together? 
<P>
So what I want you to do, what I want you to be thinking about and 
practicing is list the five values, or habits or principles of American 
Civilization that you think might really happen. Once I would like to do 
next week, and I hope Dr. Minnix will help me remember because, again I'm 
pretty busy in between classes -- is I would like to very early next week 
come back to you and say, okay, let's spend ten minutes, as we get into 
American history, what's your list? Just come in with five. Any five. I 
don't care what they are. Five principles or habits you would tell an 
immigrant on their first day are useful. And then as we go through 
American history, let's see if we can find examples of your habits. I 
will give you one, by the way, that's truly radically American, that if 
all of you are going to be honest, you'll admit to, shopping. To be 
American is to learn to shop. It's literally true. This is the most 
mall-oriented, not necessarily to buy, but just to shop. More Americans 
spend more hours wandering around stores going, "wow, I'd like that." 
Goes back to incentive. Why are Americans so driven? Because they're 
pursuing happiness. What's one of their versions of happiness? A big 
mall. Yeah. 
<P>
Now, we're going to take key problems. One of the ones we're going to 
really focus on is solving poverty and violence. This cannot be a healthy 
country until we have found a core cultural solution to the challenge of 
poverty and violence. The way we're going to do this is we're going to 
apply vision, strategies, projects and tactics. And then we're going to 
apply listen, learn, help and lead, so that people can truly learn. And 
then what we're going to do with every challenge, challenge of the world 
market, the challenge of the information age, third wave society, the 
challenge of citizenship, the challenge of the culture poverty and 
violence, for every challenge, we're going to use the five pillars. So 
we're going to go down through and say, all right, what can we learn from 
American history? What can we learn from personal strength? What can we 
learn from entrepreneurial free enterprise? What can we learn from the 
spirit of invention and discovery? And what can we learn from quality as 
defined by Deming. And then we'll apply those pillars to the problem. So 
as you look at the last four sessions of the course, as you're thinking 
through where we're going, you look at the last four sessions of the 
course you can say to yourself, okay, when I get to the information age, 
third wave society, and American Civilization, I'm going to want to go 
back and think through my vision of it, my strategies for getting there, 
my projects to implement my strategies, my tactics, and then I'm going to 
want to turn to other people say, "what do you think." 
<P>
And I'm going to go through listen, learn, help and lead. And as I'm 
thinking through the implementation for that third wave information age, 
I'm going to be saying, well, what did we learn in American history? When 
we went from an agricultural to an industrial society, what was the 
transition like? What are the lessons out of that period? How does 
personal strength relate to being able to use a computer? I mean, we know 
personal strength meant in the, you carried a big club and you had a 
rock. What does personal strength mean in the age of the laptop? Which, 
by the way, is a major reason for the rise of power for women. If upper 
body strength matters, men win. They are both biologically stronger and 
they don't get pregnant. Pregnancy is a period of male domination in 
traditional society. On the other hand, if what matters is the speed with 
which you can move the laptop, women are at least as fast, and in some 
ways better. So you have a radical revolution based on technological 
change and you've got to think that through. If you talk about being in 
combat. 
<P>
What does combat mean? If combat means living in a ditch, females have 
biological problems staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get 
infections, and they don't have upper body strength. I mean, some do, but 
they're relatively rare. On the other hand, men are basically little 
piglets, you drop them in the ditch, they roll around in it, doesn't 
matter, you know. These things are very real. On the other hand, if 
combat means being on an aegis class cruiser managing the computer 
controls for 12 ships and their rockets, a female may be again 
dramatically better than a male who gets very, very frustrated sitting in 
a chair all the time because males are biologically driven to go out and 
hunt giraffes. So you got to look at these kind of background, what do 
these transitions mean, how do they apply, what does it mean for personal 
strength. 
<P>
Entrepreneurial free enterprise, isn't it interesting that at the end of 
the industrial era when large systems dominated that the explosive growth 
of the last 20 years is, guess what, tiny companies, start-ups in 
garages, people in back rooms. That's people who drop out of college and 
go create Microsoft or go create apple computing. It's Spielberg's 
invention of "Jurassic park." But it's people just do their thing. It 
very entrepreneurial. Talk about the whole concept of the spirit of 
invention and discovery. Well, obviously if you're entering the 
information age, inventing and discovery, but it may not be inventing and 
discovering the way that's obvious. We did -- one time we had post-its, 
those little yellow things you stick on things. That's an invention. 
Somebody got fairly rich off that. Invention doesn't have to mean you are 
a Ph.d.., you advance math and you are sitting in a lab some day. 
<P>
Invention can just be an egg McMuffin which was invented by a particular 
franchise operator who wanted to find a way to use McDonald's in the 
morning. So he literally invented egg McMuffin, which is a social 
invention. And then finally, we look at the whole co ncept of quality and 
how do things pull together, how do we make it -- what did Deming teach 
the Japanese, and how do we work as a team to learn every day to improve 
our productivity. So I think these things are very, very important and 
you'll see us go through in the next nine weeks that kind of systematic 
effort to understand America, understand ourselves, apply our vision of 
the future, and see if we can come up with solutions when we get to the 
last four. 
<P>
But to get to the last four we've got to spend the next five weeks really 
reimmersing ourselves in America. And the reason is, for the last quarter 
century we haven't talked much about America. We have all these modern 
counterculture myths about America. We have politically correct 
interpretations of America. That's not the way America works. I mean, 
just -- one of the things you can do as a test of this. Is look at the 
work ethic which I would argue is at the very center of being American, 
and then read your newspapers for the next week and see how often you 
find things referred to as work as good rather than as bad. I'll give you 
one example, because one of the last stands -- I'm going to be male for a 
second because I'm going to talk about sports which is much more a male 
kind of thing -- but think about football, the end of the football 
season, which coaches do we study on the sports page? The winners, right? 
Who would we study on the front page about politics? The losers. 
<P>
You have an interview with the most losing coach in America, the 
psychological trauma I felt as my team lost its 70th consecutive game. I 
mean, why should Joe Paterno or Tom Osborne be allowed to win all the 
time? Shouldn't we have some kind of fairness here? You only get to win 
six out of ten. It wouldn't be nice if you won ten out of ten or 12 out 
of 12. Think about it. On the business page you still have a bias toward 
the winners but it's not total because we're gradually having the social 
creeping over of the biases of the editorial page. But historically, the 
business page is about who is breaking through. The greatest 
breakthroughs of modern times: computers, biotechnology, molecular 
medicine, it's very hard to get them covered, why, because they're just 
dull. They're about success. 
<P>
So it's much harder to get those on page one in a way that's readable and 
understandable, but those are going to break through your life. O.J. 
Simpson is now involved in a trial which is interesting enough and 
violent enough and sexy enough and has a big enough celebrity. You take 
the total number of inches printed about O.J. last year in any major 
newspaper then take the total number of inches about molecular medicine, 
that's a pathological society that runs around chasing bad news. You 
don't find that on the sports page. And it's very important because in 
classic America it was Lindbergh's getting to Paris that worked. It 
wasn't the guy who didn't make it. Now next week, we're going to start 
with pillar one, the lessons of American history and the use of history 
for analysis and problem solving. We'll again try to give you tools and 
give you ways of thinking. The next week's reading assignment is the 
declaration of independence, the constitution of the united states, the 
federalist papers nos. 10 and 51, building a community of citizens, from 
that book we're going to use chapter 6. Tocqueville's democratic 
prescription self-interest, rightly understood. 
<P>
So I would like -- the volume on community of citizens chapter 6, 
Tocqueville's democratic prescription self-interest. We're going to take 
those papers, which I would really like you to read. I would operate as 
though you have read them. That's what you ought to do, okay. Because in 
the long run this course is for you, it's not for me. Thank you. And I 
look forward very much to being with you next week.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Psychobabble Rising</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><I>Insight magazine December 18, 1995<BR></I></H3><H1><CENTER>Psychobabble Rising, but we <I>Feel the Pain</I> </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I><A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold </A></I></CENTER></H3><BR><HR>Bill and Hillary. The president who feels your pain. The presidentialpartner (n&eacute;e first lady) who informs you that you know your lifeis empty and touts the Politics of Meaning as therapy. The couple who consideropposition to their caring policies as mean-spirited, unfeeling and paranoid,and who take to the airwaves to instruct the republic on how to talk tothe kids about everything from cigarettes to the Oklahoma City bombing.<BR><BR><BR>Ever since the Clintons first entered our collective consciousness (andcollective unconscious?) both the pundits and the people have noted theirpenchant for psychologized discourse. Columnist Suzanne Fields recentlysuggested that Clinton seems to aspire to a role nowhere mentioned in theConstitution or other legislation: therapist-in-chief. Most Americans probablyhave not viewed this as anything to get paranoid, neurotic, obsessed orborderline-disordered about. After all, psychobabble is everywhere. <BR><BR><BR>And that's the problem. Psychobabble-the reduction of personal and politicaldiscourse to minimal psychologized vocabularies-is no passing fad. It is,instead, the culmination of a century-long process. And, in many ways, Clinton-aman who seems to have neither core nor anchor, and scant sensibility savefor his image of others' image of him-is an appropriate president for anation in the final stages of psychologized dysfunction. <BR><BR><HR><H3><CENTER>***Psychobabble-discourse in psychologized vocabularies-is nopassing fad.*** </CENTER></H3><HR>A little history tells a lot. <BR><BR><BR>A century or so ago, this country experienced a deep cultural crisis. Comfortableold spiritual verities were yielding to the domineering, irrefutable truthsof materialistic science. As the cities filled with the new middle classesof the corporate workforce and with millions of immigrants, once-stablesocial patterns and traditions deteriorated. America seemed destined tobecome a multicultural, amoral mess. Divorce rates were rising. Crime wasrampant. Not everybody read, or even worse, respected the same books. Allthe little issues seemed to combine into one big issue that no one couldquite define, let alone solve. <BR><BR><BR>Enter the shrinks. <BR><BR><BR>One of the salient characteristics of the so-called Progressive Era (roughlyTeddy Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson) was the bipartisan deification of expertiseand the professionalization of just about every human activity that couldbe professionalized. Psychiatry was a profession, albeit a poorly regardedand remunerated one. Psychiatrists worked at the margins of medicine andsocial relevance, mostly in state and charitable mental hospitals and asylums.Meanwhile, in the ruts and grooves of academe, psychology was strugglingto establish itself as a separate and independent branch of human knowledge,i.e., as university departments with their own budgets and as an organizedbody of practitioners with lots of dull journals to read and pompous conventionsto attend. <BR><BR><BR>Both groups decided that respectability and affluence could be attainedby expanding their purview. Psychiatry, with a nudge or two from Freud andhis claque, decided that the whole world was sick and in need of its ministrations,whether it knew it or not. Ditto psychology, and that strange amalgam, psychotherapy,was born. <BR><BR><BR>(Scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as psychotherapy, onlya melange of competing theories and practices. Imagine a chemistry thatcontained 50 different definitions of a molecule.)<BR><BR><BR><BR>The therapists also decided that they could be of inestimable value by insertingthemselves and their notions into the workings of every aspect of the stateand on behalf of causes that appealed to them personally. So these new expertson the human spirit began peddling their wares everywhere they could findcustomers. <BR><BR><BR>And find them they did-in social work, the juvenile- and criminal-justicesystems, in education and the other disciplines, among the clergy, the literati,the artistes. Some worked out of universities; other found employment withthe government or the private sector, teaching corporations how to manufacturedocile workers and ardent consumers, helping the government hype its warsand policies and generally convincing the populace that theirs was the kingdomand the truth. <BR><BR><BR>By the 1950s, few Americans could find a mate, raise their kids, confronttheir troubles or know what to feel without seeking, or being affected by,these experts. In the 1960s, politics itself became psychologized-protestbecame a form of growth and fulfillment and the issue protested matteredless than the protest. Jimmy Carter probably was the first president whosemajor attractiveness was his therapeutic value. Feminism devolved into the-personal-is-politicalschtick of consciousness-raising and if-I-feel-oppressed-I-must-be. Nukeshad to go because they upset the kids. Welfare is good because it's caringand compassionate. Ecological legislation will help restore our global consciousnessand that is the primary goal, regardless of the real-world effects. <BR><BR><BR>Then came the talk shows. And the recovery books. And the &quot;abuse excuse&quot;in law. And the Clintons, who, like so many of their generational and politicalconfreres, insist on judging policies by their intent and not their results,and who attack their opponents' emotions, not their ideas. Thomas Sowellsees this as the fundamental characteristic-and perhaps weakness-of theliberal self-anointed. <BR><BR><BR>Psychologized discourse has been around for a century. It has had a centuryto prove that it can't deliver. It's not just that if heart surgeons hadthe same success rate as psychotherapists, they'd all be in prison. It'sthat a civilization in thrall to the psychological can't work. It createspeople who can conceive of themselves only as isolated units with the outerworld important only as a source of frustration or gratification. It createsa politics in which emotions become the goal, not the fuel. It makes rationaldiscourse impossible. <BR><BR><BR>And Bill Clinton represents the final stage of this deterioration. It isreported that, in his latest incarnation, he intends to campaign in 1996by portraying the Republicans as &quot;heartless.&quot; <BR><BR><BR>Democrat or Republican-do you like this form of governance? <BR><BR><BR>In your politics? In your courts? In your culture? In your private lives?And in your souls? <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a lecturer at Georgetown University. </I></B></CENTER><P><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Homee</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."
<p>The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, 
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."        
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies Congress on
a wide array of legislative issues.

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Lecture Two -- PFF</title>

Foundation
<P>
Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class 2<br>
The historic lessons of American History January 14, 1995
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College 
television in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the second of 
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor 
at Reinhardt College, will continue his course which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the Renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson, pillar one: the historic lessons of 
American Civilization, focuses on the lessons of American history and the 
use of history for analysis and problem solving.
<p>
Good morning. Let me say that it's a little bit rainy here in Waleska 
this morning, but I want to welcome what I hope are the dry students of 
Mind Extension University all over the country and report to all of you 
that my sister-in-law found me by channel surfing last Saturday, ended up 
taking at least the television part of the course. And I want to remind 
everyone that they can mail their comments to "Renewing American 
Civilization," post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. They can 
fax their comments to 404-528-9806. They can e-mail their comments to: 
America Online. It's renewam@aol.com. And by the way, 42 people responded 
on America Online this week, and they also had 57 other people who 
downloaded transcripts from Compuserve and America Online, and they are 
available on our Internet web page, which is on the screen. 
http.//www.pff.org. And everybody who's watching who doesn't have a clue 
what that means, that's fine, don't worry about it. Sometime in the next 
decade, it will get to you. Also, there's an "American Civilization" 
newspaper. There are also video and audio tapes of the course and the 
course readings. Anybody who's watching who's interested in that can just 
call 1-800-to-renew.
<P>
Now, just as a very brief overview, remember, the assertion of the course 
is that there are five pillars of American Civilization. That they are 
the historic lessons of American Civilization, is the first pillar. 
Personal strength is the second pillar. Entrepreneurial free enterprise 
is the third pillar. The spirit of invention and discovery is the fourth 
pillar. And quality as defined by Deming is the fifth pillar. And we're 
going to take one class for each of these five, and then there are four 
areas to which we will apply these pillars. They are, first of all, 
looking at the third wave in American Civilization, so we'll spend two 
hours looking at the concept of the information revolution in American 
Civilization. Then creating American jobs in the world market. And then 
we will spend two hours looking at replacing the culture of violence and 
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. And finally, we will 
close the course with two hours on citizenship and community in 21st 
century America, which in a sense ought to be the final culmination of 
what we're trying to teach. 
<P>
Now, today's topic is the historic lessons of American Civilization. And 
I want to use this to accomplish three different things, if I can, just 
for a second, so you'll understand where I'm going and what my biases are 
and what I'm trying to accomplish. First of all, I want to get you to 
think about history. I am a historian as a vocational degree. Because I 
think if you want to understand human beings, you ought to study history, 
because history helps you. In other words, I didn't study history to 
become a historian. I studied history in order to understand how people 
function, how people do things. Because the most powerful predictor of 
possible future behaviors is history. So one thing I want you to do is 
learn a fair amount about how to use history, how to make it work for 
you. So you actually look at it and people say, "oh, that's history." And 
it's common in our current culture that that means it's irrelevant, it's 
past, it's gone. I would argue just the opposite. Every major figure, 
when you go back through the last 300 years, when you read Napoleon's 
quotes or you look at Washington, look at FDR, look at Harry Truman, 
again and again you find people who read history for a practical reason. 
<P>
So I want to -- part of the purpose of today's two hours is to try to 
begin to convince you that history can be the most practical of 
disciplines, because it is teaching you about what you want to do. So I 
don't really care what history you read. If you want to get rich, then 
read the history, the biographies of people who got rich. You want to be 
a famous entertainer, then read the biographies of people who became 
famous entertainers. You want to be a successful political leader, then 
read the biographies of successful political leaders. But studying how 
others have done things not only enriches you in the sense of, oh, you 
know a lot more and you sound a lot better at cocktail parties, it also 
gives you a wider menu of solutions than people have who don't read 
history. So I regard immersing yourself in history as the most practical 
of applications. 
<P>
The second point we want to make is that history is a great place to 
begin to really reemphasize American exceptionalism. And I want to talk a 
lot about that today, and it reinforces our argument that America is a 
civilization. That it's multi-ethnic, but one civilization. And you'll 
see that as we start talking about American history. 
<P>
The third thing I want to do with today's looking at history is to get 
you to realize how aberrational the current moment is.  And in a sense, 
the core argument of this course is that from the arrival of the 
English-speaking peoples, which is a period of around 1607 to 1620 in 
Virginia and in Massachusetts, that you had a culture which began to wash 
up on the North American continent. That culture, going all the way back 
to the Magna Carta, had a deep passion for liberty. That it had learned 
lessons in the English Civil War, and that it had, with John Locke and 
others, created an argument about how humans are free. And that that 
culture actually gradually emerges, becomes modern America, and that you 
can see from 1760 to 1789 a big argument about whether or not, in fact, 
being American is different than being British. 
<P>
There's a famous story of Franklin going to Britain sent by the colony of 
Pennsylvania as their representative, arriving in Britain as a loyal 
English subject and leaving Britain as an American, because in his 
exposure to the British political system, he had come to realize how far 
apart we were and that they were not us. And there are a number of 
quotes, and I remember the one who said -- somebody who said during this 
period, I think it was John Adams, who says that we entered this argument 
with Britain thinking we were British, and in our minds learned that we 
were American, and then decided we had to have a revolution. And then 
after the revolution, they have to invent a system.
<P>
And one of the things which liberated me and got me going was Gordon 
Wood's two great works on "the Origins of the American Revolution," which 
covers this period, and "the Radicalism of the American Revolution" in 
which Wood argues that a second great breakthrough occurs. This is our 
political breakthrough. We become America politically, we become a free 
country, we adopt the constitution. And that's why we have, as some of 
your assignments, "the Federalist Papers," the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution. They're out of this period. Then there's 
a second break point which is: now that we're no longer bound by a king 
and we're no longer bound by aristocracy, we become a remarkably 
democratic, capitalist, entrepreneurial society of enormous freedom. And 
that is codified in 1830, '30, and '31 by de Tocqueville. And by this 
point, we have become America.
<P>
Now, the central argument of this course intellectually is that this 
system, to a remarkable degree, survived to about 1965. And that you 
could have had a dialogue between American leaders, the American elite, 
normal, everyday Americans, you know, people have all kinds of 
backgrounds could have gotten together up to this point and there would 
have been a continuity from here to here, and you'll see it today. In 
fact, I was shocked last night preparing today's class. We're going to 
share with you something I have never -- did not hear till last night, 
which is Franklin Delano Roosevelt's radio address to the country. It's a 
real experiment -- I'll say to the people watching us on mind extension 
university, this is a real experiment, because we're going to ask you to 
listen to a radio speech for eight and a half minutes, which in the age 
of television is unthinkable. 
<P>
But when you listen to it and you think about it, this is -- and Drucker 
wrote a book on this called a discontinuity. It's called "the age of 
discontinuities," and his point is that every once in a while things 
break, and you know what is on this side of the discontinuity. You don't 
really know what's on the other side, by definition. That's why it's a 
discontinuity. It's discontinuous. When you listen to the Roosevelt radio 
speech, anyone from here back to here would have understood the speech. 
And I want to ask you when we get to it to take notes, because it is 
inconceivable that the elite would have accepted from here to the present.
<P>
I think this discontinuity ended in 1994. But it's inconceivable to 
anybody in the discontinuity that you could have had that speech. It 
would have been ridiculed and it would have been unthinkable, and you'll 
see what I'm talking about when you hear the speech. And yet my assertion 
is that because of -- see, America is a collection of solutions. American 
civilization is the conscious effort of human beings to collect solutions 
to the question: how do human beings live together and function? And 
because I believe it is the highest value collection of solutions in 
human history, I believe that having now gone through the discontinuity, 
what we're about to do is come out as America again. But that there was a 
very serious argument for a 30-year period over America was essentially a 
racist, sexist, repressive society of greedy people who rip off the rest 
of the nation and exploit the poor, and that if you engage in an act of 
violence, it was probably because you were psychologically dispossessed 
and a victim, and therefore you had an obligation to shoot up people 
because after all, this racist, sexist, exploitive capitalist culture had 
forced you to do that. 
<P>
Now, in a sense -- but I can find you the articles, the speeches, the 
analysis, the courses that make this argument. And that therefore -- and 
it's basically two simple arguments. The theory here is very simple. All 
of these people believed that America is a great country filled with good 
people. Now, they were not simplistic. Everybody in this period believed 
in the original sin. That is, all of them believed: of course you have 
evil occasionally. Smush it. And evil can be: you have to train your 
child. You have to have discipline. You have to learn all sorts of -- you 
have to learn habits that are good. You have to say, "don't do that." But 
everybody in this period believed it. Over here, you suddenly end up in a 
-- you end up in an argument: is, in fact, America a country where the 
people are so incorrect that you need to use the coercive power of 
government to reshape the people? And that the duty of government -- the 
argument here that was offered was that the government must intervene on 
behalf of the ideal and reorganize the average American because they are 
not thinking and doing the right things. Okay?  And that's part of what 
we're going to discuss as we go through this. 
<P>
Now, the first place I'm going to start is the use of history for 
analysis and problem solving. Remember back to my point that I believe 
history is the most practical of disciplines and the most -- and worth 
looking at, because it strengthens your ability to analyze and to solve 
problems. And I believe that there are five reasons for studying the 
lessons of American history. First of all, history is a collective 
memory. That is, history is how you think about and learn about yourself 
as a people. Second, American history is the history of our civilization, 
and I'm going to go back to each of these in a minute. Third, there is an 
American exceptionalism that can be best understood through history. 
Fourth, history is a resource to be learned from and used. And, fifth, 
there are techniques that can help you learn problem solving from 
historic experience. So we're going to walk through all five. 
<P>
Let me start off with this notion: history is a collective memory. I 
mean, how do you learn how to be an American? Part of it is you develop 
common language. I mean, why does the statue of the marines on MT. 
Suribachi raising the flag really matter? Because it is a collective 
reminder of the heroic cost of freedom. And it's useful to remember. I 
mean, if you don't know where Iwo Jima was, who fought in world war ii, 
who the marines are, or why it mattered, then having a picture of that is 
irrelevant. And one of the frightening things about the elimination of 
historic memory, the creation of cultural amnesia in the last 30 years, 
is that it's harder to know what it means to be an American if you don't 
know the history of the American people. And so it's very important in 
part to immerse people. 
<P>
Remember, my Ph.D.'s in European history. I'm not arguing against 
learning about the rest of the world. I'm arguing that first you immerse 
yourself in America. First you thoroughly understand how you came to be 
American. Then you learn about the rest of the world. And I think you 
should do both. I think you should learn about the rest of the world. But 
I think unless you ground yourself in an understanding -- and this is, by 
the way, a very multi-cultural history in the sense of who came here, but 
it's a history of one civilization. So you can't understand America 
without understanding the contribution of Chinese laborers in building 
the railroad. And, for that matter, Irish laborers. You can't understand 
the U.S. cavalry in the 1870s and '80s without understanding the influx 
of immigrants and the degree to which it was largely an immigrant service 
at the enlisted ranks. You can't understand the nature of our 
relationship with the north American Indian who was here first who were 
actually Asians. 
<P>
I mean, they're not native Americans. They're Asians. They came across 
the Bering strait. In that sense, everybody born here is a native 
American, but you can't understand their relationship unless you go back 
and look at them just before the arrival of the Europeans and you look at 
it in contextual terms. You know, why did the Apaches end up being driven 
out? They get driven out because the Comanches get guns first. There's a 
huge war fought in the 1750s over who's going to trade with the French 
traders. Who's going to have weapons?
<P>
And you have to look at this -- see, you need to understand all of this. 
What's the role of the Aztecs? What's the role of the Spanish, who are, 
after all, in the southern part of north America much, much earlier. It 
gives you a real sense of perspective, by the way, to look sometime at 
how long the Spanish were in and how brief a time we've been in as a 
United States, as an American Civilization. And then what does that say? 
And you go to a place like Santa Fe. What's the richness of Santa Fe and 
how early was Santa Fe a major city with major intellectual sources, 
compared, say, to Boston? And you begin to see a whole -- a much more 
complex history, but the totality of it is American Civilization. 
<P>
Second, it's the history of our civilization. And this is one of the 
assertions that I think is maybe most controversial in the course. We 
need to learn about us so we can renew our sense of us-ness. That is, 
American history is useful for everybody. It's particularly useful for 
us. And you need to learn how to be an American, because as George 
Santayana said, quote, to be an American is of itself almost a moral 
condition, an education, and a career. Notice how he's describing it. 
It's an education, it's a career.
<P>
What does he mean by "career"? He means that to live out being American 
is a full-time job. That it's a way of being. It's not an inheritance. 
It's not, "oh, I'm an American" -- you know, "I'm German." "why are you 
German?" "because my parents are German. We lived in Germany." Or, "I'm 
Japanese." "why are you Japanese?" "well, because I'm genetically 
Japanese." You're not genetically American. To be an American is 
literally an act of the mind. 
<P>
Third, there is an American exceptionalism that can best be understood 
through history. And this -- I'm going to come back later to Everett Carl 
Ladd's concept of American exceptionalism, but I want to make a 
particular point here that is again going to be very controversial with 
people who are overly rational. Much of life is lived and experienced. 
It's not neat lines on a chalkboard. It's not a monograph. It's not 
intellectual. All of you, I think, now know that. There are things you 
can experience that you can read about forever, but until you have 
experienced them, they don't exist. You sort of think you know. I mean, 
I'm living this now in terms of becoming speaker. I mean, whatever I 
thought it would be like, this is different. Well, being an American is 
best experienced by reading about people who have been American. Because 
American Civilization is too complex to reduce to a series of seven 
principles, three rules. It's a way of being. It's like Zen. 
<P>
Now, there's a great book for those of you who want to pursue it called 
"Zen and the art of archery" by Hergrove, who's a German, which gives you 
a sense of what I'm trying to talk about.  It's a way of -- you have to 
be an American. And one of the best ways to study being an American is to 
read the history of people who have been American. Because it's too 
dynamic and too complex to reduce to just a set of cookbook terms. 
<P>
Fourth, as I said earlier, we're going to look at history as a resource 
to be learned from and used. When -- and this is my challenge. When you 
run into a problem, the first thing you should ask is: who else has had 
this problem and how did they solve it? And then go study people who 
solved it, because it's cheaper to imitate than to invent. A basic rule, 
and it's one of the reasons I ended up as speaker of the house, is that 
every time I bounce into a problem, I try to stop and say: okay, now who 
already has solved this somewhere in history? I then go read their 
solution. I then ask: will that one work here? Does it have a good idea? 
Is it worth doing? 
<P>
Fifth, there are techniques that can help you learn problem solving from 
historic experience. There's a way of practicing immersing yourself in 
this. Now, one of them I just gave you. Every time you run into a new -- 
I mean, you don't do this for everything. But every time you run into a 
significant problem, stop and say: who solved this somewhere else? Go to 
the library and ask them: what books do you have on this topic? Who has 
already done it? And start from there. But you also realize history is 
not just written. Go find somebody you know personally who's already 
solved it, and ask them to teach you. I mean, a large part of my life 
beginning when I was very young, maybe 4 or 5 years old, is an 
instinctive, automatic search for people I can apprentice myself to. What 
are you doing when you apprentice yourself to somebody? You're getting 
them to give you the oral tradition of their history. You're successful. 
Why are you successful? 
<P>
And I'm trying to remember the great leader of coca-cola for many, many 
years, Woodruff. I saw Herman Cain, who's the head of godfather pizza, 
who lives in Omaha, Nebraska. He's an African-American, born in Atlanta. 
His father was Woodruff's chauffeur. So he has great lineage 
intellectually, because Woodruff talked around his father, and then 
Woodruff and his father talked around him. And so while his dad was -- we 
could say, "well, your dad's only a chauffeur." Yeah, he's a chauffeur in 
one of the most successful business leaders in American history. So guess 
what the quality of Herman Cain's education was before he was 18? Okay. 
And that's what I mean, is -- but you're learning the history of what 
Woodruff did. Why did Woodruff know it was right? Because he spent 50 
years of his life practicing. 
<P>
Now you get to learn either this is how he did it and you copy it down 
and you skip the 50 years, so history's not just written, it's also oral. 
Now, we want to focus on actively listening and reading. And you want to 
ask yourself -- by that, I mean, don't be passive. Ask yourself first: 
what are the hidden lessons in what I'm experiencing? Second, how does it 
apply to me? And, third, what additional questions does it lead to? Now, 
by hidden lessons -- and you'll see this. We're going to do an experiment 
in a minute. By hidden lessons, I mean the fact is that everybody has a 
tendency to be passive. You receive it, but you need to actively be in 
the TV when you watch it. You need to actively be in the book. You need 
to actively be in the conversation, probing, asking questions. Think 
about it. What does this mean? What can I learn here? But second, and 
this is the key to all real learning: how does it apply to me? 
<P>
Now, I'll just guarantee you, if you're learning for you, you will learn 
30 or 40 times more intensely than if you're learning for the teacher. 
And if you get in the habit of learning for you, you'll learn all your 
life. If you get in the habit of learning for teacher, you'll learn till 
the test. It's a totally different model of what learning's about. And 
then lastly, as soon as you learn this batch, you ought to say to 
yourself: now, what does that lead me to ask? What additional questions 
does it lead me to? 
<P>
Now, here's what I want you to do: I want you to actively watch, ask 
questions of yourself, make notes, as we watch two minutes on Gettysburg. 
Then we're going to stop and I'm going to ask you: what did you learn and 
what questions might this lead you to out of Gettysburg? Okay, so let's 
take a look, if we could, at Will Wright on Gettysburg, and I think you 
can watch it on the monitors.
<P>
On November 19th, Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg to dedicate the new 
union cemetery. The featured speaker was Edward Everett of Massachusetts, 
a diplomat, clergyman and celebrated orator. The president had been 
invited almost as an afterthought to offer a few appropriate remarks. 
Everett spoke for not quite two hours, then Lincoln rose. The local 
photographer took his time focusing. Presumably the president could be 
counted on to go on for a while. But he spoke just 269 words. He started 
off by reminding his audience that just 87 years had passed since the 
founding of the nation, and then he went on to embolden the union cause 
with some of the most stirring words ever spoken. Lincoln was heading 
back to his seat before the photographer could open the shutter. 
<P>
>> he felt that he had failed, that it was a poor speech, that the people 
didn't like it, it was so brief, less than two minutes. He felt that he 
had failed. Lehman, his friend Ward Lehman, was sitting next to him on 
the stand, and when he sat down, there was just a sprinkling of applause, 
and he said, "Lehman, that speech won't scour." That's what you say about 
a plow in the prairies when the mud doesn't come off it. 
<P>
>> the cheek of every American was tingled with shame as he reads the 
silly, flat, dish-watery utterances of the man who has to be pointed out 
to intelligent foreigners as the president of the united states. Chicago 
times. 
<P>
>> dear Mr.. President: I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I 
came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did 
in two minutes. Edward everett. >>
<P>
Okay. So what do you think? What do you get out of that? What lessons, if 
any, can you pull out of that, or what questions? 
<P>
>> doesn't take a long time to say a lot. 
<P>
>> okay. I'm going to shorten it. Say a lot briefly. What else? 
<P>
>> sometimes initial response by witnesses or media witnesses is not 
really relevant. 
<P>
>> initial response can be misleading. I'm going to take the teacher's 
prerogative a second and pull a second thing out of what you said. The 
media can be wrong. 
<P>
>> this, by the way -- you want to understand how important history is, 
at least to me? Nothing which has ever been said about me is comparable 
to what was said about Lincoln or what Jefferson and Hamilton said about 
each other through papers that they subsidized. This is a tough business. 
And it has always in America -- that's why American history is useful. 
This isn't Russia, this isn't china, this isn't a controlled press. This 
country is the most rough and tumble, brutal political system in the 
world. Except we don't kill each other. So we don't have secret police. 
You don't get assassinated. You don't have the knight of the long knives 
in which Hitler wiped out hundreds of people. But verbally we sublimate 
our violence by just being unbelievable to each other. 
<P>
And there's a long tradition -- I mean, you can actually do a paper on 
what Lincoln -- what was said about Lincoln after the speech, and it's 
just -- about half the newspapers were just devastated. What else? What 
else did you pick up? 
<P>
>> even if you think that you've failed, you might have been succeeding 
the whole time. 
<P>
>> that's right. This is very important, by the way. Because a lot of 
time people get very insecure. What does it tell you, by the way, that he 
commented on his speech to his friend as soon as he made it? But what 
does it tell you about Lincoln? 
<P>
>> that he's humble. 
<P>
>> genuine. 
<P>
>> insecure. 
<P>
Not genuine, he's insecure. All politicians are insecure. At least all 
the ones I've ever known except people who are just out of touch with 
reality, I mean, because you're in a very public environment and you're 
trying do something very public, and you want to do it well. There's a 
wonderful scene in "the Wind and the Llion," which I really recommend to 
all of you. It's a magnificent movie about Theodore Roosevelt and a great 
way to learn about that era. And there's a wonderful scene. He's 
campaigning for re-election in 1904. He's on the back of a train and he 
has a huge crowd, and the band is playing and people are screaming and a 
cowboy on a horse for the rough riders is firing a pistol in the air, and 
there's just a -- it's a mob scene. And as it's pulling out of the 
station with these people running after the train, he turns to the 
secretary of state, who's next to him, and he says, "they do like it, 
John, don't you think? They do like it?" 
<P>
And I thought it was such a wonderful capturing of the core insecurity 
that, I mean, he's surrounded by a mob which has gone crazy, and he's 
still not quite believing it, because at this level -- I mean, Lincoln, 
after all, other than Washington, Lincoln has the hardest problem: how do 
you hold together the union? And if you want to, by the way -- and it's 
interesting, if you want to read a really interesting novel about 
Lincoln, it's gore Vidal's "Lincoln." I was astonished he could write it, 
I mean, because I'm not a great fan of Vidal's, although I like some of 
his stuff. But it is tremendous and well worth looking at. 
<P>
Okay, one or two last comments. What questions might -- now that you've 
seen two minutes, what questions might it lead you to? 
<P>
>>well, the timing, or how it was brought across at the time, how the two 
minutes was brought across, for me it's so effective, I think. I mean, if 
he may have said it a month from then, it probably would have been 
totally devastating because of the deaths at the time. 
<P>
>> that's right, but the context changes things. I mean, I think -- and 
again, this goes back to why history matters. If you don't know what 
Gettysburg was, if you don't realize how many people died, if you don't 
understand it's the middle of a Civil War, the Gettysburg Address loses 
its meaning. This is a speech given by the President over the graves 
dedicating the cemetery, and heard in that context, it is a very 
different thing than heard in the abstract. Now, let's go back now, and I 
want you to watch this again, having raised some questions and having 
thought about it, watch the same two minutes and see if you can put into 
it as you begin to think about what you're seeing. Again, this is 
something people need to do. If you're not really good at this yet, do it 
three or four times. Take the same thing and practice on it until you see 
that there are many things occurring, many things being said in a short 
two minutes. Let's roll that, if we could.

<P>
Now, did you get any more on the second round? 
<P>
>> I watched him again, and length means more than -- I mean, length 
doesn't mean as much as presentation does. That you can learn a lot from 
a short message than you can remember from a longer one. 
<P>
>> let's test it for a second, okay? Let me just ask: how many of you 
found new things the second time around, just out of curiosity? About 
half of you, all right. Let's now look at the 269 words. See if we can 
actually play the Gettysburg address for you.
<P>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this 
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great 
civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived, and 
so dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a great battlefield of 
that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting 
place for those who here gave their lives that their nation might live. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a 
larger sense we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot 
hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, 
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world 
will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but can never 
forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be 
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they have, thus far, so nobly 
carried on. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task 
remaining before us --that from these honored dead we take increased 
devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of 
devotion --that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have 
died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth.
<P>
Did you notice what the pictures were of? Who were they? 
<P>
>> civil war veterans. 
<P>
>> civil war veterans gathered at Gettysburg after 40 years after, I 
think, which should remind you of what recent event you've seen?
<P>
>> d-day. 
<P>
>> it's almost exactly the same time frame. Actually, it's 10 years 
longer now. Let's also remind you that countries are saved by the young 
and reminded by the old. And that that's just the nature of the way life 
occurs. Now, he talks about a new nation conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. And in his 
-- and clearly in a time when there were still kings and czars and 
emperors, in Lincoln's mind, the core value of the civil war is the test 
for the human race of whether or not this kind of government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people, can survive. This is literally 
a test of whether or not it's possible. This was still a radical 
experiment in the 1860s. Probably the person who has best captured all of 
this is everett Carl Ladd. He has a new little book out called "The 
American Ideology: An Exploration Of The Origins, Meaning And Roles Of 
American Political Ideas." It's from the Roper Center in Connecticut, and 
it only runs to about 80 pages, but the essence of what he says is that 
the underlying core values for most Americans are still remarkably what 
they have been for 300 years. That despite the best efforts of the elite, 
it is astonishing -- and we'll come back to this -- it is astonishing how 
much classic America has survived. 
<P>
Now, Ladd argues that there is an American Exceptionalism. That it is a 
uniquely insistent and far-reaching individualism. That it's a view of 
the individual person which gives unprecedented weight to his or her 
choices, interests, and claims. That in America, more than any other 
society in history, you matter. Who you are, what you want to do, what 
your rights are, what your claims are on each other and on the society at 
large. And Ladd breaks it down into a series of key values. He talks 
about private property in the economic sphere. Democracy and freedom from 
government control in the political sphere. Advancement on one's merits, 
the absence of rank, and moral equality in the larger society. Let me 
just very briefly walk you through each of these. 
<P>
First of all, private property in the economic sphere. They originally 
wrote, "we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, 
among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of property." The reason 
was if you don't have the sanctity of property, the state can expropriate 
you. If the state can expropriate you, your only means of survival is the 
state. If you have to depend on the state for your survival, you have no 
freedom. So in their minds, the old term "your home is your castle" was 
very deeply felt, and it went back to the English civil war and to 
experiences they'd had with monarchical government. These were not idle 
consents. That's why, for example, the right to bear arms is a much more 
complex issue than people think it is in 9-second sound bites. These guys 
wrote the stuff in for very deliberate historic reasons, and they valued 
property rights as a core of freedom. 
<P>
Second, they wanted democracy and freedom from government control in the 
political sphere. That didn't mean that they didn't think government 
should be able to do things. I mean, they're very tough about government. 
They want a constitution that is a strong but limited government. They 
didn't want a weak government. They wanted a strong but limited 
government. But in the political sphere, they wanted you to be free to do 
virtually anything, and they thought it was essential. That's why the 
freedom of speech is so important. That's why secret elections are so 
important. That's why it's so important to have the rule of law, where 
the laws matter, not the personalities. A very deliberate pattern. They 
wanted advancement on merit. 
<P>
This is going to be, I think, an enormous issue in the next decade. Do 
you do better because you were born and therefore deserve it? You were 
entitled to it? Or do you do better because you earn it? And the founding 
fathers had zero doubts about this. Zero. You had every right to advance. 
But to advance is an active status. You had very few rights to demand 
that others made you entitled. This is going to be an enormous debate and 
is at the core of American society. There was a total absence of rank. 
<P>
I said in my speech accepting the Speakership, I quoted de Tocqueville 
about the house being made up of vulgar people. Remember, the word 
"vulgar" in that period meant "not of aristocratic class." It didn't mean 
you could wear four-letter words on your t-shirt. I mean, we have, in a 
sense, vulgarized the word "vulgar." And think about this in terms of the 
breaking down of American culture. In the 19th century, being vulgar as 
opposed to being an aristocrat made Americans proud. Americans were proud 
to be commoners. They were proud to have a house of representatives that 
was the people's house. Their great joy was that they're not aristocrats. 
But that didn't mean that they wallowed in the mud and tolerated 
alcoholism and thought that it was all right to be a low life. It meant 
that being a middle-class, working person, being a person who did the 
best you could, being without money but not being poor, very important 
psychological concept. 
<P>
Because Americans historically always figured they'd have money soon. A 
country of tremendous striving in the sense of: of course I have every 
right to be here. I'm an American. I don't have to be a king or a duchess 
or a duke. I am an American. To be an American is all the rank I need. 
They also sought moral equality in the larger society. Every American was 
the moral equal of every other American. Every American had the same 
standing to go to court. Every American had the same standing to be 
treated fairly. So a great -- there's a John Wayne quote about -- from 
one of his movies where he says, "I give every person respect, and I 
expect them to do the same for me." The second part of that was he then 
shot them if they didn't. But it's really a remarkably American concept, 
that we are all equals. That the only person, for example, that you need 
to call by title is the President. That's why I'm "Newt." I'm not "Mr.. 
Speaker." Because we're all equals. And it's core to being American. 
<P>
Ladd's argument -- and everett Carl Ladd really has educated me a great 
deal on this, and I just think he's done remarkable work. I think he 
understands the core of America. Ladd's argument is that  the -- that 
you've got to look at these values, and that the essential distinguishing 
American values all reflect a pervasive underlying individualism. That 
this is just a remarkably free society. But part of this comes down, and 
this is a -- this, for me, has been a work in progress. A society of 
individuals, if it's going to have a limited government, has to have a 
strong culture. If there's enormous freedom and no police state, then one 
of the ways we make sure we don't attack each other is we imprint in the 
culture tremendous respect for each other. If there's enormous freedom 
and we're not going to have a huge government circuses and bread process 
of taking care of the poor, then you have to imprint a work ethic of 
tremendous proportions, where people say: well, of course I work. I'm an 
American. And it becomes an identity. So that in a very real sense, if 
you want a society which is very free from government and bureaucracy, 
you have to have a society which has -- which is very strong in what it 
teaches itself and it teaches its children and it teaches immigrants who 
become American. And so we have to rethink: what is this -- what's the 
context of those individuals? And I think it's ironic, in a sense, if you 
think about it, that the very -- here we are on the one hand saying: boy, 
are we really a free society. I can do my thing. And yet I would argue -- 
and this is a lot of evolution of my own thinking over the last 10 or 15 
years. 
<P>
One of my favorite movies is "the Last of the Mohicans," which I commend 
to all of you. It's a great film about the French and Indian war. 
Wonderful scene where the American who was the deerslayer is standing 
there and the British officer says, "aren't you going to Fort William 
Henry?" And he says, "no, I'm going to Kentucky." And he says, "how can 
you go to Kentucky in the middle of a war?" And he says, "you face north, 
turn left, and walk. It's west of here." It's a very American response. 
And the officer says, "but you're a British subject and you have to come 
and fight." And he says, "no, I am an American." 
<P>
Now, he ends up going to fight. Why? Because of the girl, which is also 
classically American. It's a very romantic country. It really, 
historically, is a very romantic country. You can't be American without 
having romance in your heart. I mean, if you grow up as a cynic, it's 
very hard to sustain the magic that's American. But part of the 
conclusion I reached, oh, maybe 22 years ago, reading Daniel Boorstin's 
work on the Americans, is that as important as the mountain man is -- and 
you remember "Jeremiah Johnson," which is a great film, and again, a very 
useful introduction to a real authentic American -- there were very few 
mountain men. There were very few people who went out on their own in the 
woods. The most common American pattern was the wagon train. Wagon trains 
are collective enterprises. They are us getting together. A wonderful 
scene in "Witness" where they have the barn-raising. The community comes 
together. America is about individualism, but it's about an individualism 
which then voluntarily creates communities, which is the thing de 
Tocqueville is stunned by, that here you have this enormous freedom. D
<P>
oes the freedom lead to anarchy? No. The freedom leads everybody to get 
together. But they get together voluntarily and they create the community 
they want, and now in the electronic age, you can live geographically 
next to 60 different people, not know many of them, and then you can 
reach out to the people you want to create an electronic community with 
by telephone, by fax, by computer, and you suddenly have an extended 
family of lots of people, some of whom you've never even met, but you 
were really excited knowing each other. So it's the individual then 
merging into community. And one of the characteristics of it is that 
idealism in the community draws the individuals together. It's not 
rampant individualism. It is individualism lived out idealistically 
within a community. 
<P>
And I'm now going to show you what I think is one of the most powerful 
things in the whole course where we have to thank, frankly, Ted turner 
for giving us the right to use this. We actually had this before it even 
-- it was available commercially. It is a speech, it's a true speech, 
given by a college professor who volunteers in the Civil War. And he is 
talking to a brigade which has rebelled. It has mutinied, and he is 
explaining to them why he needs their help. And I want you to watch this. 
You can take notes if you want to, but I don't think you're going to want 
to make notes. I think you're just going to want to absorb this and then 
I'm going to talk briefly. Think about the idealism, think about what you 
heard earlier about Gettysburg, and then watch this.
<P>
I've been talking with private Bucklin. He's told me about your problem. 
There's nothing I can do today. We're moving out in a few minutes. We'll 
be moving all day. I've been ordered to take you men with me. I'm told 
that -- that if you don't come, I can shoot you. Well, you know I won't 
do that. Maybe somebody else will, but I won't, so that here's the 
situation. The whole Reb army is up that road a ways waiting for us, so 
this is no time for an argument like this, I tell you. We could surely 
use you fellows. We're now well below half strength. Whether you fight or 
not, that's -- that's up to you. Whether you come along is -- is, well, 
you're coming. You know who we are, that we're dying here, but if you're 
going to fight along side us, there's a few things I want you to know. 
This regiment was formed last summer, in May. There were 1,000 of us 
then. There are less than 300 of us now. All of us volunteered to fight 
for the Union, just as you did. Some came mainly because we were bored at 
home, thought this looked like it might be fun. Some came because we were 
ashamed not to. Many of us came because it was the right thing to do. All 
of us have seen men die. This is a different kind of army. If you look 
back through history, you will see men fighting for pay, for women, for 
some other kind of loot. They fight for land, power, because a king leads 
them, or just because they like killing. But we are here for something 
new. This has not happened much in the history of the world. We are an 
army out to set other men free. America should be free ground, all of it. 
Not divided by a line between slave states and free. All the way from 
here to the pacific ocean. No man has to bow, no man born to royalty. 
Here we judge you by what you do, not by who your father was. Here you 
can be something. Here is the place to build a home. But it's not the 
land. There's always more land. It's the idea that we all have value, you 
and me. What we're fighting for in the end, we're fighting for each 
other. Sorry. I didn't mean to preach. You go ahead, you talk for a 
while. If you -- if you choose to join us, you want your muskets back, 
you can have them. Nothing more will be said by anybody anywhere. If you 
choose not to join us, well, you can come along under guard, and when 
this is all over, I will do what I can to see you get a fair treatment, 
but for now, we're moving out. Gentlemen, I think if we lose this fight, 
we lose the war. So if you choose to join us, I'll be personally very 
grateful.
<P>
Now, a couple quick things, because we only have two minutes till we 
break. One, if you want to read the background of this, it's a book 
called "Killer Angels," which was a brilliant novel which was used by the 
Army War College and which I recommend to you as maybe the finest novel 
about the Civil War, not counting "Gone With the Wind," which was a 
totally different -- in terms of military novels. Second, Chamberlain 
himself is a real person, college professor, volunteers, the most 
decorated officer in the Union army, accepts Kee's sword at Antietam, is 
picked by Grant to accept Lee's sword, goes back to Maine, president of 
Bowden college, Governor of Maine, writes his memoirs very late in life, 
but is a classic American, as you can see. I mean, this is not a guy -- 
he's not a Prussian military expert. He's just a wonderful human being. 
<P>
Three last points: this is a romantic war. There's another scene in the 
movie which I commend to you to go rent in which a Confederate general 
just before Pickett's charge makes a very similar speech, and it's, I 
think, one of the reasons that the Civil War grabs us, is that both sides 
felt passionately that they were idealistically right in their 
interpretation. Also notice he's asking people to risk everything.  And I 
want you in that context, with what we're going to see later on and 
everything you've seen here, thinking about the veterans you saw back at 
Gettysburg -- when I gave my speech as Speaker, I quoted from "the Battle 
Hymn of the Republic" which, of course, was the song of the Union Army, 
of the Grant Army of the Potomac. "as he died to make men holy, let us 
live to make men free." And my point to all of you is: we're not asking 
you to go to Gettysburg. We're not going to ask you to invade Normandy. 
We're just asking you to live your life in a way that Chamberlain would 
have understood so that Lincoln's efforts to make sure that this 
government and this model and this system survives, in fact, work out. 
<P>
And that that's the whole point of this, is that if we would simply live 
in peace at 20% of what we risk in war, this would be an amazingly better 
country. So we have a quick break, and then we'll come back, all right?
<P>
Let me make two corrections. I got so involved between my emotional 
reaction to that particular passage by Chamberlain and the fact that we 
were running out of time. Somebody pointed out to me, of course he 
accepted Lee's sword at the courthouse at Appomattox. I said Antietam, 
which was obviously wrong. And second, the Union Army at large was called 
the Grand Army of the Republic. It was not the Army of the Potomac. The 
third, somebody mentioned to me who'd seen last year, and I'll take just 
a minute to tell you this -- Chamberlain leads his unit to Gettysburg. He 
is put at the far left the Union line and is, in fact, holding the 
position that the confederate army decides they will turn, their theory 
being that if they can come up around here they can outflank and force 
the entire Union army to roll back. He's at the top of little round top. 
And he's there with Confederate forces attacking up the hill. They fight 
for hours. Unit after unit attacks his unit. And this is all in the 
movie, it's a remarkably done in the movie. Finally his officers come to 
him and say: we're down to one or two cartridges per man. We are 
literally about to run out of ammunition and we have to pull back, and he 
says but if we pull back, we're going to unhinge the entire Union army. 
We can't pull back. And they say we don't have any choice. We're 
literally about to run out of ammunition. And he stops and he says, we're 
really tired. We've been up here. They've been attacking uphill all day. 
So I want you to think about this in terms of people who think they have 
problems. He says, therefore if we're about to run out of ammunition, fix 
bayonets. We will charge downhill. And they do. And they break the morale 
of the units that have been fighting uphill all day who're suddenly 
coming uphill one more time, you know, we're totally exhausted but maybe 
this time they'll break. They're suddenly faced with a very loud, a very 
noisy Union regiment charging downhill. You can go out and practice this. 
It's hard to go uphill. Go to Kennesaw mountain and try it for a little 
while. And it breaks their morale. They run, the battle at this point in 
time is ended and saved. The amazing irony is this unit is transferred in 
order to rest -- because it's been in terrible shape, lots of casualties 
-- they are transferred to here, which is where Pickett's charge occurs. 
They're not, by the way, the most badly damaged. The first Minnesota 
volunteers is the most badly shot up unit in the battle other than 
Pickett's Virginians. 
<P>
But I tell you that so you understand: he was asking these men to 
voluntarily go and then, as history would have it, they end up at the 
critical point, all but three of the men volunteered. They -- the reason 
they mutinied, by the way, is they thought they had signed two year 
papers and they thought they were legally being Americans -- you can all 
remember the fights you've had with your professors or fights you've had 
with somebody -- they were legally entitled to go home. It was legally 
time for them to leave and the army had said no, you can't leave. So they 
thought they were legally entitled to not be there and they volunteered, 
all but three of them, and made a huge difference in the survival. 
<P>
Now, we're going to go back and pick up a part of American exceptionalism 
which is among the most controversial, the pervasive sense of religion 
and God. And what we're going to suggest to you is, first of all, again 
this goes back to why to understand American Civilization, you have to 
start by understanding American history, that the religious and social 
tenets of Puritanism are diffused throughout American values today. And 
again I'm drawing largely on Ladd's work, but it's important to 
understand this: the Puritans had a very highly developed sophisticated 
understanding of their relationship to God. They attempted to live that 
out in this life. Many of their strongest beliefs, the work ethic, for 
example, are driven into us. We're the most moralistic society on the 
planet. Doesn't mean that we don't break down in our morality, but that 
we have a sense of morality and think of it as breaking down. And it's a 
very intense reform idealism that is at the core of American Civilization 
and in part goes back to the puritans, then was revived by the great 
revival of the 1730's, then was revived again by the Wesleyan movement, 
then was revived in the 19th century by the revivalist movement, and I 
would argue that in a sense what you are seeing happen now is a 
reemergence. 
<P>
I think it's no accident that the Pope's book has been a best seller. I 
think that there is a tremendous resurgence of interest among all kinds 
of religious groups, whether Jewish or Islamic or Christian, whether 
among Christians, whether it's Protestants or Catholic or Orthodox, you 
see a very deep reassertion which is not uncommon in American history. 
That what you get in American history is these sort of wave effects, 
where you'll have a tremendous upsurge of reform religious conviction and 
that will lead to a lot of changes that will gradually taper off, and 
then two generations later it will come back again and it almost always 
leads to a follow on wave of political and social reform. 
<P>
Now in that context, the fascinating thing about America is that the 
United States is both highly developed and religious. As a general rule 
in the modern world, the more industrialized you are, the fewer people go 
to church, the fewer people who say they believe in god, the fewer people 
who pray, that it's a great anomaly that in fact we are, by a huge 
margin, the most explicitly religious society of any industrial nation. 
We are the aberration, we're not the norm. 
<P>
Now Steven Carter wrote a book called "the Culture Of Disbelief" which 
shook up some people the other year because their presumption was that 
Carter, who is a black professor at an Ivy League school, clearly should 
not believe what I'm about to read to you. The subtitle of the book, "The 
Culture Of Disbelief - How American Law And Politics Trivialize Religious 
Devotion." Very important concept: "How American Law And Politics 
Trivialize Religious Devotion." And this is what he wrote in the 
introduction, page 4 of his book: "better than nine out of ten Americans 
believe in God. "and some four out of five pray regularly. "politically 
and culturally, however, for those who do pray regularly, indeed those 
who believe in God are encouraged to keep it a secret and often a 
shameful one at that. "aside from the ritual appeals to God that are 
expected of our politicians, for Americans to take their religion 
seriously, to treat them as ordained rather than chosen, is to risk 
assignment to the lunatic fringe. "yet religion matters to people. "it 
matters a lot. 'Surveys' indicate that Americans are far more likely to 
believe in God and to attend worship services regularly than any other 
people in the western world. "true, nobody prays in prime time television 
unless religion is a part of the plot, but strong majorities of citizens 
tell pollsters that their religious beliefs are of great importance to 
them in their daily lives. "even though popular history -- some popular 
history wrongly assert to the contrary. "the best evidence is that this 
deep religiosity has always been a facet of the American character and 
that it has grown consistently through the nation's history and today, to 
the frustration of many opinion leaders in both the legal and political 
cultures, religion as a moral force and perhaps a political one too was 
surging. "unfortunately, in our public life, we prefer to pretend that it 
is not." 
<P>
Now take that as background from Steven Carter who is a widely respected 
professor, and it led to a lot of argument when his book came out. What 
you're now going to hear is Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his radio 
address to the nation on the day we invaded Europe. Let me set the stage 
for a minute: we're engaged in the third of our great conflicts for 
survival. The first was the American Revolution, the second was the Civil 
War. We believed that evil was on the march, and we believed that we had 
to defeat Nazi Germany. To do that, we had to launch an invasion of 
Europe which was the most complicated, single activity ever undertaken by 
human beings. Landing at Normandy successfully is more complex than 
anything else we've ever done. It was an enormous risk. The American 
people were worried. After all, their children were at stake. There were 
hundreds of thousands of lives involved. It was the great gamble, and we 
knew it was the great gamble. It is in this context that they turned on 
the radio to listen to the president of the United States. Now, given 
modern elite cultures, given the modern cynicism, given the modern 
anti-religious biases, just listen to this speech and ask yourself, would 
it be conceivable that a president of the United States could do what 
Roosevelt does in this speech?
<P>
Announcer: ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.  
>>President Roosevelt: my fellow Americans, last night when I spoke with 
you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of the 
United States and our allies were crossing the channel in another and 
greater operation. It has come to pass with success thus far. And so in 
this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in prayer: almighty God, 
our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, 
a struggle to preserve our public, our religion, and our civilization and 
to set free a suffering humanity. Lead them straight and true, give 
strength to their arms, starkness to their hearts, steadfastness in their 
faith. They will need thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard. 
For the enemy is strong, he may hurl back our forces. Success may not 
come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again, and we know 
that by thy grace, and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will 
triumph. They will be so tried by night and by day without rest until the 
victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls 
will be shaken with the violences of war. For these men are lately drawn 
from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They 
fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice 
arise, and tolerance, and good will among all thy people. They yearn but 
for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home. Some will 
never return. Embrace these, father, and receive them thy heroic servants 
into thy kingdom. And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, 
sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts and prayers 
are ever with them, help us, almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in 
renewed faith in thee, in this hour of great sacrifice. Many people have 
urged that I call the nation into a single day of special prayer, but 
because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people 
devote themselves in a continuance of prayer as we rise to each new day 
and again when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips 
invoking thy help to our efforts. Give us strength to strengthen our 
daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we make in the physical and 
the material support of our armed forces, and let our hearts be stout, to 
wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our 
courage unto our sons wheresoever they may be. And, oh, lord, give us 
faith, faith in thee, faith in our sons, faith in each other, faith in 
our united crusade. Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dull. Let 
not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters are but fleeting 
moments, let not these deter us in our uncomparable purpose. With thy 
blessing we shall prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to 
conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogances. Lead us to the 
saving of our country and with our sister nations into a world unity that 
will spell a sure peace, a peace invulnerable to the schemings of 
unworthy men, and a peace that will let all men live in freedom, reaping 
the just rewards of their honest toil. Thy will be done, almighty God. Amen.
<P>
Can you imagine yourself sitting at home listening to a radio? You can. 
How about the rest of you, what's your reaction to that? 
<P>
>> you don't hear Presidents pray anymore, not openly. We used the 
footage for two reasons. One is, we originally thought about just using a 
radio. You literally are so trained to see things, if we had just shown 
you 8 and a half minutes of a radio sitting there, we would have lost 
most of the audience, because people can't -- don't focus that way. 
That's not how they think. We also want to remind you, this is what was 
going on while he was speaking and everybody knew it. I mean, everybody 
understood that literally as he spoke, their brother or their father or 
their son was in risk of being killed. You can't imagine the intensity of 
the emotion of it all. And I talked with Sam Gibbens and Bob Dole and Bob 
Michael and other people who have fought in the European theater, you 
know there is a sense about -- you know, talking about George Bush being 
shot down in the Pacific and picked up, he crashed two airplanes, one was 
shot down, the other had mechanical -- and both times he just went back 
and flew the next airplane. And it's hard to imagine for us, because in 
one way it is vivid on our TV screens, it also deadens us. It 
desensitizes us. And, as you said, can you quite imagine what the 
reaction would be? Go ahead. 
<P>
>> the country with only one medium like that, and you are sitting in 
front of the radio and you know that almost everybody else in the entire 
country with electricity is doing the same thing. 
<P>
>> although probably if you had an event this size and it was on TV 
everybody would be tuned to TV. 
<P>
>> was anybody questioning his motivation? I mean, was this just a 
President who, he had been put through the ravages of war and he's 
turning to God, and if that was the case, then I ask where was he when 
the percentages agreement was being signed? He was back here campaigning. 
<P>
>> now you are acting like a modern American. There's nobody in that 
period who would have said -- if FDR. was somewhere in this box, we are 
at war, our children are being risked, our young men may die, this is the 
big crisis, the President comes on and prays, nobody in that period, that 
day, would have gotten down here or up here and said, oh, gee -- example, 
Tom Dewey is running against him for the Presidency. I mean, how do you 
run against a guy who goes on national radio and gives you an 8 and a 
half minute prayer uniting us as a country? But Tom Dewey would not have 
said, "this is a political gimmick." It would have been inconceivable. 
This was the great crisis of the Western World. Nobody would have said, 
"how dare the President pray in public like that." Because he was within 
the framework of the culture and the culture would have said, "what else 
should you do?" I mean, how could you not have a national prayer at a 
moment like this? 
<P>
>> what about George bush, because he asked for a day of prayer when we 
invaded Kuwait. 
<P>
>> let's think about it. He didn't ask for a day of prayer. He, first of 
all, led the entire nation for 8 and a half minutes. Then he said, I want 
you to pray when you get up and I want you to pray when you go to bed 
every day for the rest of the war. I'm just saying, look at the 
difference between that and where this would be -- if this is the 
cultural bounds of his era, then in terms of the discontinuity we're just 
coming out of, he would have been up here. It would have been weird, 
abnormal behavior. Yeah, that's right. I mean, he would have been closer 
to Buchanan than he would have been to the elite vision of reasonable 
behavior. Or for that matter closer to Farrakhan. Maybe closer to Jesse 
Jackson. But he would have been behaving in a way that was outside the 
current elite norms. And I wanted you to see, I wanted you to see that 
contextual framework to understand that for most of American history what 
he did was normal. That it's only starting around 1965 that this all 
begins to really breakdown in a serious kind of way and begins to change 
what are the elite norms. 
<P>
But it's much more -- let me also say, because I just can't -- notice the 
parallel between his explanation of why we fight and Chamberlain's? 
Notice the idealism in his prayer, we don't come to conquer, this is a 
crusade. Eisenhower's book is entitled "crusade in Europe." We saw 
ourselves as liberators, not conquerors. 
<P>
But in addition, I just want to take one second and thank Kathleen Minnix 
and bob head here at Reinhardt and John McDowell who's here from 
"Renewing American Civilization" and Jeff Eisenach from the progress and 
freedom foundation. We decided about ten o'clock last night that we were 
going to use this 8 and a half minutes, and they found the video, matched 
it all up, and got it to work between ten o'clock last night -- again 
it's an example of modern technology, and also the fact we have a great, 
great team that are making this all work. I just have to thank them 
because that was an extraordinary request to suddenly show up at ten 
o'clock at night and say, hey, tomorrow morning we'd like this to work. 
<P>
Let's talk about some other characteristics of American exceptionalism. 
Americans believe that opportunity is generally available to all citizens 
and as a result support of a private- property-based economy remains 
strong. I mean, most Americans believe that most Americans have access to 
opportunity and that, in fact, private property is the best way to have 
opportunity and that free enterprise works. That's a very deep cultural 
belief. Americans declare themselves prepared to countenance very 
substantial economic inequalities, while insisting on the importance of 
the ideal of equal opportunity. That is Ladd's language. But what he is 
saying here is very straightforward: Americans are prepared to accept 
winners and losers economically. Americans are prepared to accept the 
idea you can be a millionaire or you can go bankrupt. Americans are 
prepared to accept the idea that nobody's guaranteed being massively 
successful, but Americans are determined to find a way for everybody to 
get to the starting line. There's a huge difference between equality of 
opportunity, which virtually all Americans passionately believe in, and a 
quality of results which remarkably few Americans believe in. 
<P>
And it's interesting -- here's one of the places where I think elite is 
way out of touch with most Americans, because I think the vast majority 
of Americans think the idea that we should somehow "norm" things so that 
either for racial or other characteristics, you should somehow have 
advantages you don't have. It goes against the core of the grain. You'll 
see us talk about this more of this next week when we get to personal 
responsibility. Overwhelming numbers of Americans believe we should find 
ways to help people get to the starting line, but once the starting line 
starts, everyone should have to actually run the race. Nobody gets to 
start 15 yards ahead. Now that means you got to find ways to help 
everybody get to the starting line and that's hard. American policy of 
social welfare reflects national insistence on a large measure of 
individual rather than governmental responsibility. Getting very 
specific: in other words, you are responsible for your fate, the 
government is not responsible for your fate. It is a direct repudiation 
of the concept of entitlements. 
<P>
Southern blacks, when asked two years ago, "do you believe work should be 
required of welfare recipients including mothers with small children"? 
Answered -- this is in 11 states -- answered 82% yes, 11% no. It's a deep 
underlying cultural emphasis on work and on your responsibility to 
improve yourself. Much deeper than the elite structure and the government 
structure. In a sense America is about freedom and I think it's best 
captured by the Declaration of Independence: we are endowed by our 
creator with certain unalienable rights: among those are life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness. Notice that the creator comes back in. It's 
at the core, the sense that your powers come from god, they don't come 
from the government. God gives you rights which are unalienable. The 
government can usurp those rights. It can violate those rights. It can 
strip them from you by force, but it has no moral standings for your 
rights. Rights go from you to the government. They do not go from the 
government to you. 
<P>
And then notice the words: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
It's an active open sense of who we are. There's no sense of happiness 
stamps, happiness entitlements, the federal department of happiness. 
Sounds good. Think about it for a while. It is a very profound point of 
how the Founding Fathers saw life. Let me go back, because I want to set 
the stage again. We are using two events as the core examples of American 
Exceptionalism: the civil war in the first hour and D-Day in the second 
hour. You've heard the President's prayer. I want you to see the 
preparations leading up to the day he was praying.
<P>
Announcer: the fateful hours that lie beyond the darkness ahead belong to 
them to do with as they can while the world waits in wonder and hope. 
They may not see themselves as the sword bearers of a crusade, but they 
know well enough what depends on their effort and the ultimate 
preparation is for each man to make himself. One man must make the 
decision, general Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander. He makes it. 
The invasion will go as scheduled on the 6th. The men who will actually 
be the first into France are still back on English soil. Paratroopers of 
the U. S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th Airborne 
Division are to jump behind enemy lines to secure the flanks of the 
invasion area. On the eve of the invasion the Supreme Commander visits 
some of them. "I found them in fine fettle," general Eisenhower is to 
write later, admonishing me that I had nothing to worry about.
<P>
I am going to read you Eisenhower's message. Let me say I regard 
Eisenhower along with George Marshall and Franklin Roosevelt as one of 
the three greatest Americans of the 20th century. In some ways Ike is 
most unique. I keep a picture of him standing in front of a -- it's -- 
we're borrowing the painting, but it's a picture of a painting of him 
standing in front of a picture of Omaha beach, and I keep it for a lot of 
reasons. Here's a Kansas farm boy who gets to go to West Point almost by 
accident, graduates, does all right, rises in the system, and suddenly 
finds himself faced with the decision: do I launch all of the allied 
forces at Normandy or not? Sits on the end of a couch at five o'clock in 
the morning, they've already canceled it once, all the ships are out 
there, everybody is out there, they've got to go or no-go. They've 
canceled it for one day. The weatherman comes in, they practiced it for 
months, the weatherman comes in and says you have a three-day window. If 
you land in these three days, you have three days of good weather before 
another storm hits. He sits on the end of the couch, looks up and says 
"go." 
<P>
Two things: one, a month later when they would have tried to land, the 
worst storm -- the worst summer storm in 40 years hits the beaches, 
actually destroys one of the beaches. Two, he carries in his pocket, and 
you've seen pictures of him talking to the paratroopers, he carries in 
his pocket for two days a message saying that the landing has failed, and 
that despite the best efforts, we've been thrown off with tremendous 
casualties and that the responsibility is his. Now the idea you can take 
a Kansas farm boy, train him well enough that he can launch the largest 
most complex operation in history, and that he has the moral 
responsibility to bear that weight, and then later in life of course 
becomes the President of Columbia university and President of the united 
states, I think it's a remarkable story and well worth studying. 
<P>
Here is what was read to every unit, because back then because they 
didn't have -- this was all secret -- they literally would gather 
everybody on the ship together and they would read them this just before 
landing. This was Eisenhower's message: "you are about to embark upon the 
great crusade toward which we have striven these many months. "the eyes 
of the world are upon you. "the hopes and the prayers of liberty-loving 
people everywhere march with you. "in company with our brave allies and 
brothers in arms in other fronts will bring about the destruction of the 
German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed people 
of Europe, and security for ourselves in the free world. "I have full 
confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. "we 
will accept nothing less than full victory. "good luck and let all of us 
beseech the blessing of almighty God upon this great and noble 
undertaking. "before embarking on this operation, I have a personal 
message for you as to your own individual responsibility in relation to 
the inhabitants of our allied countries. "as a representative of this 
country, you'll be welcomed with deep gratitude by the liberated people, 
who for years have longed for this deliverance. "it is of the utmost 
importance that this feeling of friendliness and good will be in no way 
impaired by careless or indifferent behavior on your own part. "by a 
courteous and considerate demeanor, you can, on the other hand, do much 
to strengthen that feeling. "the rights of individuals as to their 
persons and property must be scrupulously respected as though in your own 
country. "you must remember always that these people are our friends and 
allies. "I urge each of you to bear constantly in mind, that by your 
actions, not only you as an individual, but your country as well will be 
judged. "by establishing a relationship with the liberated people based 
on mutual understanding and respect, we shall enlist their whole-hearted 
assistance in the defeat of our common enemy. "thus shall we lay the 
foundations for an everlasting peace without which our great effort will 
have been in vain." 
<P>
Now imagine you are soldier, you have been trained, you are about to risk 
getting killed, you are going into France. Your last instruction from 
your commander is to treat the as you would treat your own relatives, and 
this is the part of the basis of NATO and the whole modern world. Now in 
that context, again in the language of the time and the way they saw it, 
let's look for a minute at what actually happened.
<P>
Announcer: but for every man there the new world of Normandy is a world 
of private agony and chaos and no man can see the broad design beyond it. 
On a scale so epic that words written long ago by William Shakespeare 
could have been composed for the 6th of June 1944: "he that outlives this 
day and comes safe home will stand to tiptoe when this day is named." 
Three hours after the invasion begins, it is clear that the allies have 
their foothold however precarious. The news comes to America on this June 
day of 1944, bringing a swell of hope and pride and anxiety, too. For 
great victories in war must always be fought dearly. And the price paid 
this day for the allied hold on the beaches of Normandy is not cheap. But 
although the cost is steep, the results are incalculable to the plan of 
battle. The beachhead soon expands from foothold to lodgement. Men and 
weapons and equipment pour ashore. Within 12 days, almost 600,000 men and 
90,000 vehicles are on the beaches, masked for the drive inland. Many men 
yet will fall. Many reverses will be suffered. Many triumphs recorded. 
(artillery gunfire) but in the main, the progress of battle will follow 
the bold plan conceived in allied councils and brought to flaming life by 
the men who stormed the Normandy beaches on the day which will forever be 
known as D-Day, who unlocked the gates of fortress Europe so that a 
monstrous evil could be pursued and destroyed.
<P>
Again, just as with the Civil War, I think you have to see these things 
in context. Now that's part of why I advocate history, because when you 
see what was at risk, how hard it was, how many people were killed or 
hurt, then you see, and I think you hear in the Roosevelt speech, you 
begin to sense the fullness of what was going on and that's part of why I 
recommend that you look at it. Now, I also want to emphasize, while we 
used two wars to communicate part of this, that's because they are the 
most intense point of decision. Had we lost those two wars, we'd live in 
a different world.
<P>
And people need to understand this. It's not like you want to be 
war-like, although Washington said if you want peace, prepare for war. 
You want to be so strong, you don't need to do this, you want to be so 
capable that nobody challenges your capacity, but if you're challenged, 
you literally do at times face situations where you win or die. The New 
Hampshire state slogan is "live free or die." It's not "live free or 
complain," or "live free or whine." And I don't say that so people run 
around saying can I enlist tomorrow morning. I say that to say to you 
when you then measure what you are asked to do in peace time, and when 
you measure what we're requesting of Americans in peace time, it is 
trivial compared to what we've asked in order to be who we are and that 
our generation has to be prepared in peace to give at least some small 
measure of what they gave in war. Or it doesn't work. You can't have 
freedom on the cheap. You can't have freedom without courage, and as 
we'll discuss next week you can't have freedom without personal 
responsibility. Now in that context, the spirit is still potentially 
there. 
<P>
Let me -- one of the speeches which overwhelmed me was sitting -- I was 
just in my sophomore year in congress, rather my -- excuse me, my 
sophomore term, and I was sitting for my first inaugural as a member of 
congress, and this is from Reagan's first inaugural. In terms of American 
Exceptionalism, Everett Carl Ladd's comment, listen to this part of the 
inaugural in the context of American Exceptionalists. This is 1981, 
January. "we have every right to dream heroic dreams. "those who say 
we're in a time when they're no heroes, just don't know where to look. 
"you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. "others, 
a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the 
world beyond. "you meet heroes across a counter and they're on both sides 
of the counter. "there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and 
faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth, and opportunity. "there 
are individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose 
voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art and education. 
"their patriotism is quiet but deep. "their values sustain our national 
life. "I have used the words 'they' and 'their' when speaking of these 
heroes, I could say 'you' and 'yours' because I'm addressing those heroes 
of whom I speak, you the citizens of this blessed land. "your dreams, 
your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes and the 
goals of this administration, so help me god. "we shall reflect the 
compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. "how can we love our 
country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when 
they fall, heal them when they are sick, and provide opportunities to 
make them self-sufficient so they'll be equal in fact and not just in 
theory. "beyond these monuments to heroism is the Potomac river and on 
the far shore of the sloping hills of Arlington national cemetery with 
its row and row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of 
David. "they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been 
paid for our freedom. "each one of these markers is a monument to the 
kinds of hero that I spoke of earlier. "their lives ended in places 
called Belleau wood, the argon, Omaha beach, Solerno and half way around 
the world in Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop hill, the chosen reservoir, 
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles in a place called Vietnam. 
"under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow who left his job 
in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed 
rainbow division. "there, on the western front, he was killed trying to 
carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire. "we are 
told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf, under the 
heading 'my pledge,' he had written these words: quote, America must win 
this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will 
endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the 
whole struggle depended on me alone, close quote. "this crisis that we're 
facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that martin 
Treptow and so many thousands of others are called upon to make. "it does 
require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in 
ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds. "to 
believe that together with god's help we can and will resolve the 
problems which now confront us. "and after all, why shouldn't we believe 
that? "we are Americans. "God bless you and thank you." 

Now, a couple quick things, very same sense of exceptionalism. Very same 
sense of god's intervention, very same sense of freedom, very same sense 
of sacrifice and a commentary on the modern world. Some in the press 
found one fact about this more important than the idealism, the 
patriotism, the courage or the sacrifice. Reagan said, quote, under one 
such marker, close quote. Martin Treptow was buried in Wisconsin. He was 
not buried at Arlington cemetery. Which became proof that Reagan didn't 
have his facts right. It's worth your reading in Mike Deaver's memoirs. 
It's just a very interesting minor point and, in fact, Reagan knew that. 
But he consciously wanted to build the emotional bond, and while he 
technically covered himself, you can go back and pull it out, that became 
a story. Just an interesting aside on the current culture. 
<P>
Now, this -- and this is part of what makes this course I think different 
than it might have been 30 years ago, this course is not about a 
celebration of the fact that we're neat, that this is the best 
civilization in history, and that everything's fine. This course is an 
argument that we have to reassert and renew American Exceptionalism, that 
it is a struggle for our generation, that our Gettysburg and our Normandy 
may be inside us as a people and may be inside our own country and does 
not require warfare, but requires as much discipline, as much focus, as 
much courage as warfare, and that in order for us to reassert and renew 
American Civilization, that we have a big job to do. Nobody has said that 
better, nobody has explained that the challenge of American 
exceptionalism is not yet completed better than something you are going 
to see in just a minute and it's particularly appropriate on this weekend 
to see this. But the fact is, what I'm trying to wrestle with 
intellectually is that every American has a right to be American, that to 
be American is to have access to opportunity, to safety, to the chance to 
start at the starting line, to pursue happiness at levels that all of us 
know in our heart are not currently available to every American. And so 
there's an enormous job to do. And on the weekend when we celebrate his 
birthday nothing could be more appropriate as a way of refocusing of that 
job than to listen to what may be the single greatest passage of martin 
Luther king, jr.'s career in which he talks about the America that we 
could be.
<P>
Dr. King: we must conduct our struggle on the high plain of dignity and 
discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into 
physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights 
of meeting physical force with soul force, the marvelous new militancy 
which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of 
all white people, for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their 
presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is our 
destiny. (cheering and applause) so even though we face the difficulties 
of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted 
in the American dream. I have a dream that one day, this nation will rise 
up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "we hold these truths to 
be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one 
day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former 
slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of 
brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a 
state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of 
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I 
have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation 
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the 
content of their character. I have a dream today.
<P>
Notice the moral force, notice the use of the Declaration of 
Independence. Remember, I talked about that you have to be immersed in 
your own history. If you don't know that that is a shot of Lincoln, and 
you don't know who Lincoln is, where Lincoln relates back to the rest of 
this, it makes no sense. If you don't understand -- if I said to you some 
day remember Freedom Summer, which is actually a summer of civil rights 
activism in Mississippi, if you don't know anything about the context of 
what he just said, you can't quite understand where the Freedom Summer 
ride -- where it came from or how it started. You've got to put in -- and 
remember also the moral force of what he says, one of the points we're 
going to come to next week is using Shelby Steele's book, "the Content of 
Our Character" which comes directly out of this speech: "the world in 
which my children will be judged not by the color of their skin but by 
the content of their character," what does that mean? And how do we live 
it out? And how do we recognize that for everything, everyone, and this 
is particularly poignant for the baby Boomers -- for every idealistic 
hope we had in 1963, that the end of segregation would be the end of 
misery. What do we now have to do to reinvest ourselves, to reassert 
ourselves, to regain idealism, to come back and say, all right, Dr. King 
was right, we got a part of the way there, we ended segregation but we 
haven't solved it. Now what do we have to do in our generation? And 
that's part of what we'll be picking up with next week.
<P>
But let me carry you back again, at the vision level, America is 
exceptional in and its history teaches us how exceptional. That's the 
core message of this course in terms of this particular two hours. There 
are strategies for understanding it. Teaching American history is one. 
Every child should know it. Learning to find solutions in American 
history is another. Refocusing on the symbols and the reminders, and then 
studying successes. One of the great differences between the modern era 
and classic America is for that the last 30 years we've been fascinated 
by pathologists, and the last place left in American news media where we 
focus on success is the sports page. And sometime, as an experiment, read 
the sports page for three days and then read the rest of the paper. I 
mean, if the sports page resembled the rest of the paper, the worst coach 
in America would be the lead story. Victimization among football coaches, 
you know. The guy who recruited worst would be there talking about the 
psychological trauma of failing. Instead, the sports page is the last 
stand of classic American news. What's working, who's exciting, who's 
successful, what's worth learning? Totally different way of thinking 
about it. Among the projects I think the people that are worth looking 
at, how did people learn American Civilization in the past? Look at the 
McGuffey reader sometime and then look at the path that is used in 
schools today. How were the poor helped in the past? And there Marvin 
Olasky's book is fabulous. What American policies created rapid economic 
growth? And there were periods when we grew very fast. What incentives 
and controls have worked and what has failed in the past? 
<P>
We've been a very successful culture at shaping behavior. We've almost 
never done it successfully through bureaucracy. We've done it by shaping 
the incentives and the symbols, the way we reward people psychologically 
and financially, and we've had enormous impact doing that. Then on a 
tactical level when faced with a problem or opportunity or when beginning 
to plan, ask: how have others done the same thing? And as soon as you 
know what you want to do, if you ask yourself that question and you go 
study it, you will literally save years of time. Now, when you think you 
know what you're doing, remember to go back and practice: listen, learn, 
help and lead. And when you think you know what you're doing, go listen 
to everybody else for a while and see if it makes as much sense to them 
as it did to you. Okay. Now, remember I talked to you last week about 
your rules for immigrants? Somebody arrives in America, they walk up to 
you and say, so what should I do? 
<P>
We did have somebody who in fact -- this is interesting -- we had a 
letter or fax, I guess, from Scott angel over in Tallapoosa who's married 
to an immigrant. They each sent their set of rules over to us. He said -- 
this is his five rules: one, learn to speak English. Two, learn to drive 
and get a car. Three, learn the civil and criminal law that may apply to 
you and your family and abide by them. Four, societal standing in local 
communities still depend on your adherence to the work ethic, learn it 
and live it. Five, there is actually no free lunch. Every benefit offered 
by every program by any organization, be it government or private, 
requires that you relinquish part of the freedom and privacy which is the 
only true benefit of American civilization. Then this is what his wife 
said: the five rules I would like to tell an immigrant would be thus: if 
I am a self-sufficient, hard-working, honorable citizen I would advise, 
one, learn the language of the land. This will encompass reading, writing 
and speaking. Two, reading for the importance of being able to read an ad 
in the newspaper to find jobs. Being able to read and interpret symbols 
and signs in streets to navigate around a big or small city. Writing for 
the importance of being able to fill out job applications. Speaking for 
the importance of being able to communicate what skills you have to offer 
to a prospective employer. Two -- again this is his wife, the immigrant, 
who's writing this. Two, depending on the area and the availability of 
mass transportation, learn to drive a car. This is important because we 
are a car-driven society whether we need it or not. This is one of many 
expressions of privacy that we as Americans treasure, that is, to enjoy 
going places without the hassle of being stuck with strangers in a moving 
vehicle. This also gives us the feeling of self-security and control and 
that our fate is in our hands. Three, learn the economic system of the 
country. For example, learn how banks and lending institutions operate 
and how you can use them to your advantage without appearing naive and 
felt you were taken advantage of when payments for principal and interest 
are due. Learn not to be taken in with advertisements that seem all are 
free. Simple rule to remember is nothing is absolutely free. Four, learn 
what limitations and freedoms you can do with your native culture you are 
bringing in with you. Respect the prevailing customs here as you expect 
them to respect yours. Five, last, if desperate, know where you can get 
emergency help. She then wrote five nasty rules which is what she says 
the professionals teach that I'm not going to spend time on that are all 
destructive. 
<P>
Okay. Now, what were yours? We have a couple minutes real quickly. Who 
has some rules - what would you teach 
<P>
>>student: I had read the Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence. >> student: I said ask questions of elected officials and 
hold them accountable.  >> okay.  >> student: learn the history of the 
United States. >> learn the history. What else? At a practical level what 
would you do?  >>don't watch the evening news.  >> don't watch the news.  
>> student: but these are the first five things.  >> what are the first 
five things? I walk up. I can barely speak English. I just arrived in 
America, what are the first five the things I should do?  >> student: you 
know I changed mine, too. I threw religion in. I went back and changed 
mine and I threw religion in and I did because so much of what we have 
done and where we have come from is based on the belief that there is a 
god. A copy of the Ten Commandments hangs in the Supreme Ccourt.  >> so 
do they learn your religion or what?  >> I'm not talking about religious 
doctrine, I'm talking the stories.  >> faith, the belief.  >> the 
history.  >> you said you did too.  >>find out their affiliation.  >> so 
one of the things they should do as an immigrant is go to a place they -- 
that believes in what they believe in. Yes, sir.  >> be outgoing and 
don't isolate yourself.  >> okay. The Americans are to an amazing degree, 
sociable. Yes.  >> student: I said build up a network, in that I included 
religion; find out what other people from their country are doing, 
whether or not there is a civic group that they're involved with, where 
they might be worshipping and that sort of thing. I think to connect 
themselves with a network of like people -- and then learn from them 
would be an ideal first thing to do. >> okay. One last one. Yes, ma'am.  
>> student: learn about the money and monetary units here because 
everything is almost always driven by money. Quite a few things are, so 
-- >> student: one modification of speaking English. Learn to speak 
English on the telephone.
<P>
I am told we're about to run out of time, so let me just say next week's 
topic will be pillar two: personal strength. It's going to come right 
back to these ideas, the key pillar of American Civilization and we're 
going to use Drucker's "Effective Executive." I think this is the key as 
to how America operates is the concept of personal strength. And we're 
going to look at the next week, the reading assignment is to read "the 
effective executive" which is available on paperback -- I will say it to 
anybody who's watching us on TV -- and to look at chapter 8, read chapter 
8 of "building a community of citizens."

<H1><CENTER>The Apollo Covenant beyond the Oscars</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
by <A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold</A></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
     &quot;Apollo 13&quot; did well at the box-office last year. A few nights
ago, it garnered _______ Academy Awards, for ___________. (Or: A few nights
ago, it didn't do quite so well at the Academy Awards, going zero for seven.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The movie was a hit for three reasons. Two are obvious. The third pertains
to the national crisis of soul, although not in a comfortable manner. Because
of this discomfort (actually, more of an existential bad faith), the real
significance of the film remains only dimly and squirmily acknowledged.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Dramatically, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a natural: a fast-paced technothriller
about a business-as-usual moon mission that went terribly wrong, then heroically
right. It was also a natural because it happened to be true. Technothriller
fused with nostalgia, for those years of hope and aspiration before JFK
got his sex life deconstructed and the Cold War's end deprived us of the
folks who, alone of all the powers on earth, could determine whether we
were Ahead or Behind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     But in a larger sense, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is about civilization
itself, and what it takes to sustain it. Seen this way, the movie teaches
some lessons that this country and its politicians and pundits -- for all
the glib-and-gushy verbiage about &quot;restoring trust and civil society&quot;
-- still haven't taken to heart.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The U.S. space effort of those years was, in essence, a set of three
covenants. One was between the government and the people, in accordance
with the constitutional requirement to provide for the common defense and
promote the general welfare. The Apollo project went forward to acquire
knowledge and opportunities, and as part of the global confrontation with
the USSR. That the knowledge and opportunities never materialized, and that
the Cold War aspect now seems questionable, does not negate the constitutional
validity of the covenant. The state, on behalf the the people and with broad
popular support, did what was deemed necessary at the time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second covenant was between the state and the men and women of
the space program itself, to make possible and sustain their success. This
the government honored as long as convenient. In a sense, the space program
met the same fate as Vietnam: not defeat, but abandonment. Perhaps, had
the government honored its commitment to exploration more steadfastly, greater
benefits might have been derived.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      But the most important covenant here was between the men and women
in the civil society of the space program, mutually pledging, if not their
fortunes, certainly their lives and sacred honor in the common endeavor.
In the film, Tom Hanks (playing astronaut Jim Lovell) tells his wife about
the first moon landing: &quot;It wasn't a miracle. We just decided to go.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    But the Apollo Covenant would have been quixotic without three human
virtues, each developed to near-perfection by the covenantors.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
   The first is hard-earned competence. After astronaut Ken Mattingly aces
a surprise simulator emergency, he waves off the praise and asks to work
the problem again because his performance hadn't been perfect. Lovell's
response: &quot;Let's get it right.&quot; When Mattingly's last-minute replacement,
Jack Swigert, muffs a similar drill, crewmate Fred Haise exudes a contempt
that doesn't abate until Swigert's final-hours display of skill and endurance
in preparing the command module for re-entry. &quot;Way to go, Jack&quot;
-- followed by Swigert's stoic, silent, and eloquent acknowledgement of
a covenant kept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Perhaps those who teach that self-esteem derives from psychobabble,
or that respect need not be earned, should include this film in their curricula.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second virtue is trust. Not touchy-feely emotion, but confidence
based upon experience of each other's competence and character. When flight
director Gene Kranz receives the devastating recommendations that they must
shut down the fuel cells (thereby &quot;losing the moon&quot;) and later
must power down the lunar module-lifeboat, his resistance fades before his
reasoned trust. When Swigert doubts that Houston can concoct a re-entry
procedure, Lovell assures him that &quot;they've got half the Ph.Ds on the
planet working on it.&quot; But near the end, when the crew almost believes
they're doomed, Deke Slayton tells them that &quot;Ken Mattingly's in the
simulator.&quot; Lovell's face and voice radiate relief.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Ken's working on it . . .&quot; One man they know and trust, worth
more at that moment than half the Ph.Ds on the planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The third virtue is courage, in Plato's definition: &quot;endurance
of the soul,&quot; in the face of both hardship and expediency. When Kranz
learns that President Nixon &quot;wants odds,&quot; presumably to prepare
for political damage control, Kranz replies: &quot;We're not losing those
men.&quot; When the &quot;Grumman guy&quot; starts hedging that his company
&quot;can't make any guarantees&quot; about the lunar lander's performance
in space,  Kranz first tries to stiffen him. &quot;I'm not interested in
what anything was designed to do. I'm interested in what it can do.&quot;
Later, he writes the guy off as beneath contempt. When he tells his flight
controllers, &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; he knows they understand
what he means, and they know he means it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Marilyn Lovell displays similar endurance, her circumstantial passivity
spiked by unwillingess to tolerate anything less than honesty from NASA
and her abhorrence of media ghoulishness. Indeed, among the Apollo convenantors,
those on the ground displayed endurance of the soul equal to those in the
space craft. It was fitting, if no doubt unintentional, that the film's
two nominations for acting excellence went to Ed Harris, who played Gene
Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     In sum, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a morality play. Its moral: You can
have your civilization, your accomplishments, your greatness. But it isn't
free and it isn't safe and it isn't easy. And, unless you're committed to
doing what it takes, one day failure will become an option.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     And then a fact.<BR>

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Reinhardt college<br>
Class three<br>
"pillar two: personal strength, the key pillar of American Civilization 
and Drucker's Effective Executive" January 21, 1995 <br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt college 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt college in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is Renewing American Civilization. In this, the third of 10 
class presentations, congressman newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at 
Reinhardt college, will continue his course, which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson, pillar two, personal strength, focuses 
on personal strength as the key pillar of American Civilization and peter 
Drucker's "the Effective Executive" as a guide to empowering citizens in 
the third wave information age.
<P>
Let me first of all welcome everybody who's here this morning, and also I 
want to welcome the students of Mind Extension University available all 
over the country, and I understand that there are a growing number of 
cable systems who are just picking us up randomly. In fact, I think we 
start in Washington, DC., On cable on Saturday. And I want to remind you 
you can mail your comments to: Renewing American Civilization, PO. Box 
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. Or if you're more excited, you can fax 
your comments to 404-528-9806. And if you are on the cutting edge, you 
can either e-mail your comments to America Online at renewam@aol.com, or 
you can get involved with the class transcripts and other class materials 
which are available on our Internet web page http.//www.pff.org. And any 
of you who got all that, good luck. But it gives you a framework. You can 
also order "American Civilization" newspaper, video, and audio tapes and 
course readings by calling 1-800-to-renew, which is the easiest of all 
the instructions. So anybody who gets confused with all that other stuff, 
you can call 1-800-to-renew. Now, the course here at Reinhardt focuses on 
the five pillars of American Civilization, which are the historic lessons 
of American Civilization: personal strength, entrepreneurial free 
enterprise, the spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined 
by Deming. Each of those will take two hours, and we're dealing with 
building sort of a framework in which to think about American 
Civilization. Then we're going to apply the four -these five pillars to 
four areas towards the end of the quarter. First, to the concept of the 
third wave and American Civilization. Second, to creating American jobs 
in the world economy. Third, to replacing the culture of violence and 
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. And, fourth, how will 
citizenship and community in the 21st century America, how will it 
operate? And our goal in these last four sessions will be to take the 
five ideas inherent in the five pillars, and then to apply them in a 
problem-solving mode so that people can actually deal with and begin to 
see how you take the five pillars and apply them to a specific topic or a 
specific idea that is central to American Civilization. 
<P>
Now, today's topic is personal strength, which I believe is the keystone 
of everything else. That is, as we'll go through it in a little bit, if 
you can't come to grips with the requirement for personal strength, I 
think you really can't deal with the requirements of a free society. In 
order to talk about personal strength, though, remember we talked about a 
analytical planning model of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics. 
So we're going to lay out: what is our vision of personal strength, what 
are strategies to get personal strength, what are some projects that 
would implement those strategies, and then tactically, every day, what do 
you do? 
<P>
Now, I'm also going to draw a contrast between the vision of personal 
strength that grows out of American Civilization and what has happened in 
the last 35 years. Remember I made the point last week that you have from 
1607 at Jamestown and 16 -- 1920 in New England, you have, up until about 
1965, a continuum. We played Franklin Delano Roosevelt's radio address to 
the nation on D-Day where he prayed for eight and a half minutes with the 
American people in a way that you couldn't imagine in the modern age, 
because my argument, essentially, intellectually is that between 1965 and 
1994, there is a discontinuity, to use Alvin Toffler's -- I mean, to use 
peter Drucker's phrase, and that this discontinuity was an effort by a 
series of elite groups for a variety of reasons to replace American 
Civilization with an alternative model, which today is the multicultural 
political correctness left-wing sort of vision of reality.  And that this 
was a very serious -- it was not a conspiracy. It is a general attitude 
by a wide range of people that this civilization was bad and that it had 
to be replaced.
<P>
Now, what we're going to lay out here in part is that the model that grew 
up out of that, which is the model that you are surrounded by, has 
certain inherent values. I'm going to lay out what American 
Civilization's definition of personal strength is and contrast it with 
this discontinuity's alternative model, and then what we are doing here, 
in a sense, is we're talking about reasserting and renewing. And frankly, 
it's been in the course of teaching this three times that I began to 
realize that we are reasserting American Civilization as well as moving 
to renew it. 
<P>
Let me give you an example. At the vision level, we would argue, I think, 
in American Civilization that personal strength is vital. Whereas, the 
elite alternative would argue that most people are victims needing help. 
Now, if you were trying to teach this and we had an entire course just on 
this topic, you could take a week's newspapers, you could probably take 
this morning's newspaper, and you could go through and say: now, what 
happens?
<P>
When we run into a problem, do we say, "boy, you'd really better draw on 
your personal strength"? Or do we say that sadly -- remember the twinkies 
defense? The guy who killed the, I think it was -wasn't he -- didn't he 
kill the city council member in San Francisco? And his defense was he'd 
eaten too many twinkies, and therefore he was biologically unbalanced. 
This is not a joke. Or the Menendez brothers. They were so afraid of 
their parents that their only legitimate response was to kill their 
parents. I mean, don't ground your kids, they may kill you, because after 
all, look how you've scared them. I mean, think about the defenses that 
will be concocted on a regular basis in America today.  And then think 
about this text: is the key to your future personal strength, or is the 
key to your future recognizing your victimization, banding together with 
other victims and forcing somebody else, who must have personal strength, 
since you're now going to force them to take care of you? 
<P>
And William Raspberry wrote a column this week where he said he saw a 
documentary which said -- in which somebody said in the late 1960s, "I do 
not need to work. You need to give me money. And unless you give me 
enough money, you will not have -you will not have, you know, fairly 
compensated me for my victimization. Now, let me give you a second 
example. If personal strength is vital, American Civilization would argue 
that there are internal habits of strength to focus on. Whereas, the 
victimization theory would argue you need external compensation for 
weakness. Now, this may look like this is simple. This is at the core of 
what we're going to talk about. It's also at the core of a book you're 
going to hear me talk more and more about, which is Marvin Olasky's "the 
Tragedy of American Compassion," which I believe is one of the most 
important books written in the last 30 years.  Olasky's argument is that 
to help the poor, you have to have a transformational experience which 
strengthens their internal habits of strength. 
<P>
Whereas, the modern welfare state basically says to you: tell us what 
kind of a victim you are, and we'll tell you how big a check you get. 
Another example: in the American Civilization model, we study winners. In 
the elite culture model, we focus on losers. I'll give you -- again, if 
you wanted to have -- like, for a school room, if you were teaching the 
course and had the time to do it, go look at the sports page for any four 
days and then go look at the front page. Look at the extraordinary 
culture difference. Sports pages are about winning. Interview with the 
best coach, interview with the most successful player, interview with the 
Heisman trophy winner. What does it take to be a winner? You know, if the 
sports page was like the front page, interview with the worst coach in 
America. The trauma of never winning. The psychological sense of 
loneliness of the long-time -- of the long-time loser. The victimization 
of the weakest team in the league. I mean, literally take the two sets of 
articles, put them up side by side, and look at the code words and the 
analytical framework. The front page is about losing, and the focus is on 
victims. The sports page is about winning, and the focus is on success. 
And it's a radical difference. Now, the only difference -- the other 
difference, of course, is that the sports page is also about hometown 
teams, so you're loyal to them no matter what you're doing, but then it's 
the loyalty that's the reward. 
<P>
These are our guys or these are our girls, these are -these folks are out 
there, you know. Who cares, as long as it's our hometown high school 
team? We're rooting for them no matter. But that's good, too, because it 
teaches a different set of strengths, which is bonding and loyalty and a 
sense of togetherness. And then apply that to the way we treat city 
government. I talked this week with a guy in a major city who's a major 
manufacturer who'd been working to help his city and finally got so mad, 
he went to the local newspaper, saw the publisher, and said, "why are you 
doing more each morning to destroy the city than I'm able to do to 
rebuild it?" And he's now been asked to join the board of the newspaper, 
because they were so shaken as he took them through story after story 
which focused on the negative. Let me give you another example. The 
American Civilization strategy would review and encourage success, 
whereas the elite culture strategy restricts, undermines, and takes from 
success to give to losers. So when you hear me talk about class warfare, 
taxing the rich, just think about the psychological implications behind 
that kind of rhetoric. 
<P>
Now, to get one that's really controversial: the American Civilization 
model would award for merit. The elite culture will reward based on 
quotas. We want to know: what have you achieved? They want to know: who 
is your grandmother? That, by the way, is one of the most powerful 
cultural problems in American Civilization. Which matters? Do you matter, 
or does your group matter? Does your future matter and your effort 
matter, or does your past matter? Because, remember, if you reward 
somebody, you punish somebody else, so you're now using the state to pick 
winners and losers based on a particular formula, which has nothing to do 
with you as an individual. It's a very profound question about the nature 
of America, and very antithetical to American Civilization's core values. 
Another example. At the projects level. I want to talk briefly about 
earning by learning versus applying for a set-aside. We designed earning 
by learning about seven years ago at West Georgia college with Dr. Mel 
Steely. 
<P>
We go into public housing projects for second and third graders. We pay 
them $2.00 a book for every book they read in summertime, and we lay out 
a framework. We use adult volunteers and public libraries. Now, if I can 
here for a second, notice the model. We're talking here about a system 
which is remarkably thin and non-bureaucratic and is truly voluntary. 
That is, it's voluntary at two levels. It's voluntary, first of all, 
because the money is not coerced from you by the government. I used the 
term this week "Coercive Volunteerism," and my reference was to the fact 
that if you don't like a particular government program, you decide you 
won't volunteer, that is, the IRS calls and said, "hi, we'd like you to 
volunteer to pay for this program." You say, "well, I think I just won't 
volunteer this year." What happens to you? They take it anyway, right? I 
mean, first the IRS visits, then the US. Marshal visits, then we visit 
you. Is that not right? Part of what I'm trying to do -- I know it gets 
me in trouble sometimes with the elite media -- but part of what I'm 
trying to do here is cut down through all the baloney to get to the core 
underlying realities. Because we have so many layers of garbage words 
that have no meaning. You remember last year one of the phrases for tax 
increase was "contribution." 
<P>
Now, that can only make sense in a culture in which words -- and I'm a 
very big fan, if you've never read it, of George Orwell's work on 
"Politics and the English Language." It's a short essay, the essence of 
which: words have meaning. Now, when I read it, I was just -- I read it 
15 years ago -- I was just blown apart by it, because I suddenly realized 
if you're going to talk about volunteers, they should actually volunteer. 
If they're being paid, they're not volunteers, not in the classic sense. 
<P>
They're government employees. If you're being paid with a charitable 
contribution, it's a voluntary donation. If you're being paid with 
government money, it was coerced from someone. It's the nature of 
government. Government -- in fact, there's a quote from Washington that 
government is about power. And so you'd better think through the power 
you're giving somebody else to say to you, "you will give me this money." 
Now, what we do with earning by learning is very simple. And very 
different from the welfare state model. First of all, we use volunteer 
adults, no money. Second, we use public libraries. That's why they're 
there. No money. Third, we use free space in the public housing common 
room. So the overhead is totally volunteer, the entire structure is 
totally volunteer. The only money goes to the kids. So if you have 
$1,000, you can pay -- at $2.00 a book, you can pay for 500 books. 
Whereas, in the welfare state model, if you have $1,000, you pay $850 of 
it for the bureaucracy. 
<P>
Totally different model. There's a second part: it is incentive-driven. 
That is, if you read 20 books, you get $40. Why are you reading the 
books? Because you'll get a reward. And I have people that say to me, 
"oh, that's terrible you have to pay them." These are little kids who 
watch baseball players on strike, they watch rock stars make millions. 
They read about congressmen getting four and a half million dollar book 
advances. You can't take all this stuff too seriously. And then we turn 
to them and say, "oh, but you shouldn't really think about this." What 
nonsense. I mean, we live in a society where the only way they can make 
money right now is to be a pimp, prostitute, or a drug dealer. It's 
illegal to go to work. They want some cash, they live, by definition, in 
a public housing project. Nobody around them reads, they have a broken 
home, nobody's there nurturing them, and we walk in and we say, "hi, 
we'll actually give you the money if you'll earn it. Because now it's 
your money." Then they get to spend it. 
<P>
Most of them -- we've done it for seven years in 17 Different states by 
now -- most of them spend it on clothing. But the important thing is it's 
theirs by right, because they've earned it. So we're teaching them to 
earn. And we're teaching them that honest work leads to honest pay. And 
we're connecting them with an adult who cares, which may be the first 
adult they've ever seen who cares. We had one young child in Jonesboro, 
Georgia, who had very, very bad teeth deformation who was our best reader 
that year. He was in the fifth grade. We let him in because he was so 
lonely and so isolated that they made the local voluntary decision to let 
him in and break the rules. At the end of the summer, two orthodontists 
took him under their care and gave him two years of free care and changed 
his entire life. All of it done for free. Finally, the reason it got 
started, we teach literacy by doing. How do you teach reading? You read. 
If you'll read long enough, you can read. It's not about, you know, all 
of this fancy stuff, what do you do in class. It's simple. 
<P>
Get them to look at the book. Get them to look at the book. They hold 
enough books, they read enough books, they'll read. Now, compare that 
novel -- I mean, compare that model with the welfare state model, which 
is applying for a set-aside. "you owe me. I deserve." No, no. You earn 
it. It's a totally different system. Let's go a stage further, a project. 
Imagine a TV show on how to rise versus a TV show on pathological 
behavior. One of the real points of the Eberly book, which we're using in 
this course on community and citizenship -- and it's a really important 
point, the theme -- one of the underlying themes of the book is when you 
look at your common culture, what does it teach? If you were a martian 
anthropologist and you arrived on earth and you just turned on American 
evening television, what would the signals be sent? This would be a great 
paper by somebody someday. Again, I'm trying to give you an example of 
how you could take this very compacted course and suddenly explode into a 
range of interesting studies. 
<P>
Look at the five most popular sitcoms, and just watch them for two weeks 
and ask yourself: what were the values I would have learned in those 
sitcoms? They're mostly destructive, they're mostly trivial. They're just 
silly. So where would you turn in your common culture to say: I am a very 
poor 7-year-old, I really -- and I'm Black or Hispanic, and I'd really 
like to know how did 7-year-olds who were very poor and Black and 
Hispanic rise? Tell me a show that shows you. I'd like to know what the 
habits are of being successful. I'm sitting here in public housing, I've 
got a television set, I'd like to be able to tune on and see a show that 
is entertaining and shows me somebody being successful. Businessmen are 
mostly people who are conspiring to dump toxic waste in your back yard. 
Creatures are probably chasing the leader of the choir. Politicians are 
probably all accepting graft. Policemen are probably corrupt. I mean, 
have you looked at the common value systems of the culture on television? 
<P>
And have you looked at what Hollywood does to America by the -- and it's 
not that there's some evil set. It's just that if you're a normal -- if 
you're a normal child and you're trying to get signals, what are the 
signals being sent to you and the thing you're most likely to watch, and 
what is it you're not going to see? And it would be fascinating to see a 
show which actually had a healthy church or a healthy synagogue that 
truly cares about spirituality and actually was helping people.
<P>
It would be wonderful to see a show about a family working in a mission 
setting who were actually transforming a -- what if you saw a show that 
was positive? I mean, in a sense, "little house on the prairie" was in 
this tradition, and the show that he started when he died, what was the 
one about the angel of -- highway to heaven. There are occasional brief 
moments of hope in what is otherwise a wasteland of cynicism. But let me 
get to the area of tactics. One would be: read rather than getting -- 
going for a handout. Now, if we simply said to everybody who wanted a 
handout: the public library is seven blocks away -- and I'm not talking 
to people who are without food, but if you talk to people who have lived 
in the streets, they'll tell you food isn't the problem. There are lots 
of places in America that now serve as mission centers. The problem is: 
what do you do in between meals? I'd say read. If you're not willing to 
learn, you're not going to get there.
<P>
And we need to say that over and over. Another example: working harder 
versus feeling sorry for yourself. I lost two campaigns. If I'd spent 
much time moping about it, I would not be in congress today. Now, you 
open up a small business, it's really hard. The answer is: work harder. 
Learn more, think it through. You go bankrupt. The answer is: get back up 
and go do it again. It's amazing how many first-generation millionaires 
went bankrupt at least once. But their reaction was, "wow, what did I 
learn out of that one?" The reaction wasn't, "gee, I think I'll go quit 
now." Another example, learning from others versus complaining to others. 
You can't -- and this has been one of the keys to my life. 
<P>
I go around looking for teachers. I know I don't know something. Who 
knows it? "would you please teach me?" As opposed to complaining that I'm 
ignorant. If you'll try to learn, you'll be less ignorant tomorrow. It's 
a day-by-day experience. Another tactic, asking the question: what should 
I do? I mean, imagine that every poor person in America today had these 
two choices. We would say to them, ask yourself this morning, "what 
should I do?" What the welfare state says is, "go ahead and say you're 
helpless. We'll send a bureaucrat with a check." In fact, the welfare 
state's structured to punish you if you answer the question, "what should 
I do," "I think I'll go get a job." That's illegal. "I think I'll save 
for my daughter to go to school." That's illegal.
<P>
Let's go back to the vision level. I want to argue that personal strength 
is necessary both for freedom and for a free market. That, in fact, 
you're in a situation where you have to have a sense of being personally 
strong both to be politically free and to be effective in a free society. 
Now, let's look at this in a bigger context. A healthy, successful 
civilization provides at least six qualities of life. These are minimums: 
safety, family, work, health, learning, and spiritual meaning. That a 
civilization -- this is not a government, this is a civilization, the 
value structured, intellectual framework of your life, and that in 
America, the argument would be that the key to providing these qualities 
is all of us working together, with each of us doing our share. Now I'm 
going to walk you just for a second through these, but the argument I'm 
going to make to you is that personal strength is vital to each quality. 
<P>
That any answer which says, "how can I not bear my share of the 
responsibility and you take care of me" is an answer which probably won't 
work. Let's start with safety. A neighborhood that watches out for its 
neighbors is almost certainly a safe neighborhood. And there are studies 
of this. You can build a hallway entrance, and if you have I think it's 
up to four doors, it's a safe hallway. But if you build a common area 
that has too many doors, it becomes impersonal space, and the amount of 
predatory behavior goes up dramatically. But if you create bonding, if 
you create a neighborhood where people know each other, pay attention to 
each other, that's why cul de sacs are safer than thoroughfares. Because 
people tend to know each other and tend to watch out for each other. If 
you create habits of safety, again, those of you who -- I have two 
daughters. They're now grown. But something as simple as: always go out 
in a group. You know, that may strike you as, "gee, you shouldn't have to 
live like that." In virtually every urban society in history, women are 
safer in groups. Now, you can say, "well, you shouldn't have to do that." 
No, you shouldn't have to do that.
<P>
The question is: statistically, are you safer? Don't be in downtown 
Washington or downtown Atlanta at 3:00 o'clock in the morning by 
yourself, whether you're male or female. That's not because -- that's not 
because you have to live a frightened life. It's just because you ought 
to be rational about what the risks are. You know, there's an old rule: 
don't go in -- don't go into a sailor's bar in new Orleans at 3:00 
o'clock in the morning if you're not a sailor and think you can 
automatically handle yourself. You're out of your league. So you have to 
have some discipline to be safe. Now, I'm not saying that's good or bad. 
I'm not saying that's desirable or undesirable. I'm saying that it's 
real, that American Civilization's great hallmark is that it's real. 
Family. Any of you who have had a strong family know if you're going to 
keep a strong family, you have a lot of work you have to do. That you 
just -- you don't keep a family together unless you work at it. That 
takes personal strength. Work is another one. It's Monday morning, you 
don't feel like it. You go anyway. You're a salesman, you've been turned 
down four times, you make the next call. Takes personal strength. Health. 
One of our great problems in America is we're not straight about this. 
You drink a quart of liquor a day, you don't do any exercise, you're 65 
pounds overweight, don't complain to the doctor because he failed or she 
failed. There has to be some level of personal responsibility. People who 
get a disease who recover versus people who don't. Personal strength's a 
big factor in who bounces back. People who live to be 90 and they're 
healthy, like Edwards Deming or like peter Drucker, who's in his mid 
80's, you'll find a lot of discipline, a lot of constant thought. They 
don't -- it just doesn't happen genetically. They're not just lucky, 
although that's a factor, obviously. 
<P>
But it's amazing people -- Chamberlain, remember when you saw Chamberlain 
last week? I was told this story later by Bill fortune. Chamberlain, the 
year after Gettysburg, was shot leading a charge. Died at 84 with the 
wound never having fully healed, having spent every day of his life after 
the war in pain, having served twice as governor, President of Bowden 
college, professor and writer with 50 years of pain, or 40 years of pain. 
Now, somebody else could have easily said, "boy, that debilitates me so 
bad I can't do anything." Chamberlain lived a full life because he 
doesn't know when -- he said, "okay, I'm in pain. Now what am I going to 
do?" Learning. Learning is not easy, and it's not always fun. And when 
it's not easy, you've got to work harder at it, and when it's not fun, 
you've got to buckle down and do it, because otherwise you won't learn. 
<P>
A lot of our failure with modern schools is we don't tell kids the truth, 
which is if -- you know, you've got to work. You've got to do homework. 
You've got to study. And the person being cheated by the teacher who's 
nice is the student who won't get a job because they don't know anything. 
Being nice is not as important as being effective. And so you've got to 
say to people, "it takes personal strength to learn, because learning 
sometimes is really hard." Finally, spiritual meaning. It's not about 
brainwashing. It's about the quiet moment where you decide for you what 
you believe. And a healthy, safe society, it seems to me, has to have 
some concern that if we're endowed by our creator, that is, by 
definition, a spiritual phrase. So that Americans have -- and there's -- 
it's not an accident that this is the most religious of all the western 
industrial nations, because it is a nation that has a spiritual meaning 
at its core. Now, when I talk about personal strength, let me suggest to 
you seven key aspects. You might come up with others, but I think these 
are a pretty powerful base. The first is integrity, then courage, hard 
work, perseverance, discipline, responsibility, and respect for others. 
Let me -- we started with integrity. We argued about this a long time. 
<P>
We were looking for different words. Integrity is very important. It 
doesn't mean not lying. It means behaving with some exemplary honesty 
that it is the way you wished others would behave, and I believe it's at 
the core of a free society. A society without integrity is a society 
which has cancer at its heart. And it's one of the reasons that 
reestablishing a sense of trust is so powerful -- so important and so 
simple. This is not a peripheral issue. Integrity is at the heart of a 
free society. If we have a transaction, I have to believe that the check 
that you gave me is good, that credit card you gave me is honest, that 
the dollar you gave me is real. That your promise that a year from now 
you'll do "x" means our partnership can work. Integrity is at the core of 
freedom and at the core of a free society. I think that to be free, you 
have to have courage. 
<P>
I mentioned the other day that the New Hampshire state slogan is "Live 
Free or Die." I think that's a very powerful concept. It takes courage to 
be free. It takes courage to have integrity. Integrity means saying "no" 
when everybody in the group wants you to say "yes." It means disagreeing 
when everybody wants you to be agreeable. Not because you're obnoxious, 
but because you have to do what you believe in, and to do what you 
believe in takes great courage. To listen to yourself sometimes and do 
what you -- and do what your inner self tells you sometimes takes great 
courage. Third, I think there has to be hard work. I do not think it is 
possible to have a free society without hard work. I don't think it's 
possible to have personal strength without hard work. And I would suggest 
that because the first two are, in a sense, internal to you, I mean, you 
have to know whether or not you have integrity. You have to live out 
whether or not you have courage.
<P>
Hard work is easy to identify, and I would suggest that it is a building 
block we ought to reinsert into the entire culture. And if you're not 
working hard, you're somehow not getting it about American Civilization, 
and that doesn't necessarily mean working long. Doesn't necessarily have 
-- doesn't mean you've got to put in 90 hours a week to prove you're an 
American. But it does mean you've got to be prepared to be energetic and 
committed and enthusiastic. It's why if you look at the great work 
tradition in the midwest, that on the weekend when you had time off, 
people also -- they painted their house, they sewed, they cooked dinner. 
<P>
There's an energetic kind of constant activity that is at the core of 
American life. It also means perseverance. Things don't work. Things 
break down. You make mistakes. You just aren't that smart, and then you 
have to get up and do it again. I've always believed that for leadership, 
perseverance is the most important quality. Much more important than IQ. 
It's why I think this whole bell curve argument is sort of nonsense. I 
don't care -- I don't care what the IQ. Results are by racial stock. It's 
irrelevant, first of all, because you're an individual. I want to know 
how you're doing. And, second, because IQ. Is dramatically less important 
than character. If you have courage, integrity, you have hard work and 
you have perseverance, you'll beat a smart person every time. A lazy, 
indolent, dishonest, smart person will be wiped out in a free society by 
just a -- by just a competent, average, hard-working person with 
integrity and perseverance. And we don't teach the right values.
<P>
We focus on the wrong things. Perseverance, by the way, grows out of 
discipline. If you don't have discipline, you aren't going to get it. 
Now, discipline doesn't mean you have to wear a military uniform and 
stand ramrod straight. But it does mean when the time has come to get up 
-- I'm going to do this right now. I swim at 6:15 or 6:30 each morning 
for a half mile. I hate swimming -- I love to swim. I hate doing it at 
6:15 in the morning, and I hate having it built into my schedule, because 
I don't like being controlled. I also know that I'm 51 and I have an 
obligation to keep my health up and I drink too much beer and eat too 
much ice cream, and if I don't swim, I will look like a little round 
bowling ball and it will be disgusting. So the combination -- and we now 
know what sound bite they'll distort this week, don't we? But the truth 
is, for all of us, there are things, there are times, there are places 
where you've got to do it, and the only way you can do it is to 
discipline yourself. 
<P>
Except no comment later on about the degree to which I may already look 
like a bowling ball. There are limits to academic freedom. All of that, I 
think, grows out of a sense of responsibility. That you -- remember, you 
are endowed with the right to pursue happiness. But that means you have 
the responsibility to exercise that right. So responsibility, a word 
which has almost disappeared in the elite culture. And then out of all of 
this, I just want to suggest to you you still can't have a healthy 
society unless you have respect for others. Now, respect for others 
really does mean putting together and working together in a way that 
given all the characteristics I just outlined, you've got to give others 
those same characteristics. Now, if you take all that -- I think I have a 
summary question that will last for a long time, and it's this, that the 
key question for all public policy should be: will this proposal help 
people become more responsible, more productive, and more safe so they 
can be prosperous and free, so they can pursue happiness? Notice that 
set: more responsible, more productive, more safe. If I give you money, 
does that make you more responsible or less? If I give you money, does 
that make you more productive, or does it actually encourage you to be -- 
to not worry about your productivity? What are you doing? And notice what 
the goals are Here: so you can become prosperous and free, so you can 
pursue happiness. 
<P>
We don't -- we never guaranteed happiness. We guaranteed pursuit. Now, in 
that framework, I want to suggest to you that the greatest failure of the 
welfare state was its direct and indirect undermining of personal 
strength. That the actual effect of the welfare state is to weaken and 
cripple the poor, to encourage more people to slide into poverty and to 
set up a structure in which personal strength decayed because of the very 
actions of government behavior. So it's not: should we have a cheap 
welfare state or an expensive welfare state? It is the structure and 
culture and psychology of the welfare state which is devastating, because 
it destroys personal strength.
<P>
And we're going to spend two hours on this later on talking about how we 
replace it towards the end of the quarter, but for the moment, I want to 
go back and just say to you: the best single work I mentioned earlier is 
Olasky, "the tragedy of American compassion." Because it really, really 
outlines what the welfare state has done and what used to work. And, in 
fact, there's a column in "Newsweek" this week which points out that this 
book and another book which I haven't read yet by Bea Himmelfarb on 
Victorian morality says flatly, in the 19th century, there was a steady 
drop in poverty, alcoholism, and addiction, and, in fact, we were winning 
the struggle, and the model was radically different than the elite model 
we've tried for the last 30 years. What I'm suggesting to you is the 
welfare state attitudes, taxes, and regulations discourage work, which 
undermines perseverance, discipline, and responsibility. That the whole 
structure of the welfare state actually cripples us. I'm also suggesting 
that the welfare state undermines the family. And, in fact, as I may have 
mentioned the other day, the earned income tax credit, if you earn 
$11,000 a year and you marry somebody who earns $11,000 a year, you lose 
$4600 in earned income tax credit by the act of marriage, and then we 
wonder why people don't get married. Now, a state which punishes marriage 
by taking over 20% of your income by getting married is crazy. It is 
literally, certifiably nuts. And it has destructive behavior. The welfare 
state, the sheer volume of rules and regulations undermines integrity. 
Fact is, when you have enough red tape, you cheat on it. That is a fact. 
May not be desirable, but it's a fact. How many of you have found 
yourself at some point in the last year fudging on something, where you 
know you broke some rule? Just raise your hand. Virtually all of you. 
Okay. So why should it shock you that a person on food stamps does the 
same thing? Why should it shock you that a person on AFDC does the same 
thing? 
<P>
Why should it shock you that a person in public housing does the same 
thing? We have built a law dominated, bureaucratically dominated, red 
tape dominated system in which everybody believes they should cheat at 
something. Not that they mean to be bad, but after all, we all know we do 
it. I mean, how often do people say, "yeah, well, you can do it. Go 
ahead. It doesn't really -- it's not a real rule." All right? Sort of a 
rule. It's a rule that matters if they catch you. That is --that is a 
cancer at the heart of a free society. You're going to have few rules 
ruthlessly enforced rather than many, many rules mostly neglected. 
Furthermore, the welfare state's litigation system attacks virtually 
every aspect of personal strength. Somebody's in a car wreck, you stop to 
help them. You get sued for malpractice. Have you ever thought about how 
many different ways you're now legally vulnerable so that trial lawyers 
can get richer, and how much that biases against the system? In addition, 
what happens is people come to rely on government instead of their own 
strength. That instead of focusing on "how can I be personally strong," 
people focus on how to get the government to send them money. "you owe 
me." 
<P>
Now, this core assertion of this, which I think all of the Founding 
Fathers would have agreed with, is that governments can't give you what 
you don't earn. Now, when governments try to give you what you haven't 
earned, the result is loss of self-respect, loss of humanness, and the 
rise of pathologies. And I think that's where we are today. Now, our 
vision is, first of all, everyone can have personal strength. And I would 
debate this anywhere in the country. And you're going to see in a little 
while Max Cleland and hear his story. You've seen Charles Krautheimer on 
television. When you see the examples of people of courage who overcome 
tremendous odds, senator Bob Dole, then they -- then you see an 
able-bodied person tell you that they're a victim and it's just too hard, 
what you've got to say to them is, "get a grip on yourself." Everybody 
can have personal strength. Our vision is that with effort, help, and 
faith, extraordinary things can happen.
<P>
And now, before anybody says, "oh, yeah, Gingrich is just talking about, 
once again, all those rich people who are able- bodied who get to do good 
things. He doesn't care about those who have real problems," I want you 
to listen to a leading Democrat, Secretary of the State of Georgia Max 
Cleland, and really, I think you're going to be very impressed by this 
interview.
<P>
Max Cleland: I was about 15 miles east, setting up a radio relay site on 
a mountain, and had gotten off a helicopter with my radio team, and 
looked down and there was a grenade. I didn't think it was live, and I 
really thought it was mine. I thought it had fell off my web gear and 
stuff, so I was carrying an m-16 in this hand and reached down to get it, 
and just before I reached it, it went off. So I was absolutely stunned 
and terrified, obviously, and looked down and my right hand wasn't there, 
and looked down and my right leg wasn't there, and my left leg was so 
badly mangled, it was amputated within the hour. So within the space of 
one hour, I was, one, lucky to survive, but, number two, lost three limbs 
right there. Bad things happen to good people, and difficulties happen to 
people in life, but that doesn't mean it has to stop you. And my heroes 
now are the people who went on to succeed regardless. 
<P>
People like Abraham Lincoln, who ran for public office many, many times 
and lost and ultimately ended up president of the United States in 1860. 
Or Thomas Edison, who was told by his teachers he was too stupid to learn 
and went on to become the most prolific inventor of modern times. Or 
Helen Keller, who worked through three devastating disabilities, 
blindness, deafness, and the inability to talk, worked through that and 
became a great humanitarian. So my heroes now are people who are able to 
work through the valley of the shadow and come out, as Hemingway said, 
"strong at the broken places." So in many ways, I think I'm probably 
stronger because of that experience, but it hasn't been easy. It's 
possible to be strong after injury or adversity or tragedy. It is 
possible, but it's not easy. So in terms of personal strength, I think 
what happens is you find along the way people say to me, "oh, I couldn't 
do that," or, "if that happened to me, I'd never have the energy or 
strength to get out of -- get out of the bed or get out of the corner or 
go do things." You really don't know what you can do. I think that's one 
of the things I've learned. You never -- that there's great power and 
potential in the human body, mind, and spirit when it goes all out either 
to fight for survival or to fight for some goal or for some idea, or just 
to fight for one's own dignity. Victor Frankel, the great psychiatrist 
out of world war ii, said that "to live is to suffer; to survive is to 
find meaning in suffering." I think when something dramatic happens to 
you, something traumatic happens to you, loss of limbs, loss of friends 
or family, a divorce, some catastrophe in your life, you spend a long 
time thereafter trying to sort out what it all means. You have a search 
for meaning. And the ability to survive after that depends on your 
ability to find some kind of meaning out of it all. 
<P>
As I was going through my valleys and struggling so much with the Vietnam 
experience and a sense of loss and hurt and trying to make sense of it, 
trying to find a sense of meaning and purpose out of it, these words 
meant a lot to me, and as I've continued my struggle and my search for my 
own destiny and how things are going to work out for me and what I should 
be doing and so forth, a lot of the answers of life, so to speak, this 
prayer has meant more and more to me, not less and less. "I asked god for 
strength that I might achieve. "I was made weak that I might learn humbly 
to obey. "I asked for health that I might do greater things. "I was given 
infirmity that I might do better things. "I asked for riches that I might 
be happy. "I was given poverty that I might be wise. "I asked for power 
that I might have the praise of men. "I was given weakness that I might 
feel the need of god. "I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. "I 
was given life that I might enjoy all things. "I got nothing that I asked 
for, but everything I had hoped for. "almost despite myself, my unspoken 
prayers were answered. "I am, among all men, most richly blessed." 
<P>
>>what's your reaction?<br>
>>his prayer is very similar to the prayer of St.. Francis of 
Assisi.>>Now, if you took that -- and you can take that five minutes and 
we could get>>volunteers to go out and visit every home of every 
so-called -- every person who lacked money who was not necessarily poor. 
A huge difference here. In the 19th century, we didn't -- we talked about 
paupers, who were people who lacked the core structure, and then people 
who were poor, which meant you had no money. Today, poor has come to mean 
"pauper." Many people in history have had no money, and yet they've not 
been poor. They've been rising. They would have money soon. Their 
children would have money. In fact, if you look at "little women," it is, 
in fact, a movie about a family which has lost money, but is working very 
hard not to lose status. And it's really very interesting. 
<P>
There's a recent "New York Times" essay on the three versions that have 
been made that we still have available and what they each meant in their 
own generation, how they reflected the values and structures of their own 
generation, and it's worth seeing "little women" and thinking about that 
in that context, and then you think about: all right, what if every 
person in America told you today they couldn't make it saw that five 
minutes? And you said, "now, tell me again what your problem is." This is 
at the core of what we're trying to say, yet part of it which is totally 
outlawed in the modern system, is if you were to say, first of all, who 
is so challenged they can't find personal strength? There are some people 
who have genetic disabilities, they have birth problems, they have -- you 
know, they're a very tiny group, and for those people, I believe we 
should all of us through the government generously find ways to maximize 
the third wave information revolution opportunities to improve their 
lives. 
<P>
I mean, there are lots of things you can do with computers and with 
technology and with rehabilitation. Those folks we ought to invest in to 
get them up to a point where they have a chance to lead a decent life. 
But they're a very tiny number of people out of 260 million. For 
everybody else, it seems to me you have to start by saying: you're going 
to have to find personal strength. Now, the problem with that and the 
thing which has been so driven out by the elite culture in this 
discontinuity is that in American Civilization, we know that faith is 
central to personal strength.  Let me give you some examples. 
<P>
These are among the great success stories of 20th century America, which 
very seldom make page one. Alcoholics Anonymous. This is the big book, 
the basic text for Alcoholics Anonymous. This is what they say on 
foreword to the first edition as it appeared in the first printing, 1939, 
second paragraph: "it is important that we remain anonymous, because we 
are too few at present to handle the overwhelming number of personal 
appeals which may result from this publication. "being mostly business or 
professional folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an 
event. "we would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an 
avocation. "when writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge 
each of our fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself 
instead as a member of alcoholics anonymous. "very earnestly we ask the 
press also to observe this request, because otherwise, we shall be 
greatly handicapped. "we are not an organization in the conventional 
sense of the word. "there are no fees or dues whatever. "the only 
requirement for membership is an honest desire to stop drinking. "we are 
not allied with any particular faith, sect, or denomination, nor do we 
oppose anyone. "we simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted." 
Totally different model. Costs no money, has no structure, and is, I 
think, arguably the most successful single anti-alcoholism operation in 
the world. 

<P>
Second example, if you take a look at "one day at a time" in al-anon, 
which is their book, al-anon is the drug addiction parallel to the 
system. They emphasize a lot about the degree to which you have to 
confront yourself. You have to worry about yourself. This is for January 
15th. They have one day at a time. Literally, every day they have a 
little message. They say, quote, we pray for sobriety for the alcoholic 
because -- I'm sorry, "we pray for sobriety for the alcoholic because we 
believe this will solve all our problems. "this is an illusion. "sobriety 
is only the first step in building a good life. "unless we both work to 
overcome the emotional conflicts within ourselves, we remain at a 
standstill. "our troubles only take new forms because they did not stem 
from alcoholism, but from the personality flaws that caused the 
alcoholism and from our irrational reactions to them. "even when the 
alcoholic has conquered the compulsion to drink, I must remember that I 
have much to learn about adjusting to the sober alcoholic. "today's 
reminder: I will not delude myself into thinking that sobriety is the 
sole goal. "I will deal with each problem that comes to me with the help 
of the 12 steps and the loving interchange with my friends in al-anon." 
Quote, I pray for the wisdom to take a rational and tolerant attitude 
toward whatever troubles I must face each day. In terms of personal 
strength, notice how it is being driven in again and again. "24 hours a 
day," which is meditations which relates again back to alcoholics 
anonymous as a program, this is for day one -- this is for January the 
1st. Prayer for the day, "I pray that god will guide me one day at a time 
in the new year. "I pray that for each day, god will supply the wisdom 
and the strength that I need." This is central over and over. You are 
smaller than your problems. Only god can help you. You can get through 
today. We can't save the rest of your life we can help you save today. 
<P>
And then tomorrow, you can get through tomorrow. So it's a very 
consistent, one day at a time. Finally, one of the books that made me a 
revolutionary. This is "how girls can help their country." I bought it at 
the girl scout house down in Savannah, Georgia, where the girl scouts 
were founded, of course, Juliette Lowe, and it is a wonderful book on 
"how girls can help their country." And my point to you would be that 
when you look through this, the common sense, the basic commitment again 
and again, this book was written in -- published in 1913 before there was 
an ERA. It's emphasis on helping others. It's emphasis on strengthening 
yourself. It's emphasis -- for example, every girl should get two jobs -- 
should have two trades so that if one dies, she can earn a living at the 
other. When you read that passage, then you think about modern 
unemployment compensation and the attitude of waiting. There's a -- this 
book is a profound statement for women of a set of values in a time when 
most of you probably assumed they were unliberated.
<P>
But, in fact, it talks about professions, it talks about patriotism, it 
talks about serving your country, and, of course, imagine how 
old-fashioned the concept, "how girls can help their country." Not how 
their country can help the girls. Now, in that framework, I just want to 
suggest to you that voluntary school prayer matters, because we are 
endowed by our creator, and authority comes from a supreme being. And I 
want to wrap this up, because it comes right back, in a sense, to 
personal strength. The thing that Marvin Olasky says he found fascinating 
is that when you talk to the successful philanthropy groups who really 
help people cease to be a drug addict, cease to be an alcoholic, learn to 
rise from poverty, they emphasize over and over again they start with 
faith. When you read the big book of alcoholics anonymous, it starts with 
faith. And I'm going to come back to this later, but when you read the 12 
steps, it starts with faith. 
<P>
When you go through item by item, it is a continuing again and again 
process of saying: if you don't dig into yourself, where d O you think 
personal strength's going to come from? And Olasky tells a story of a 
very powerful mission system, I think it's in California, that was doing 
really well, but they -- and they would help the local poor, they'd help 
the homeless, they had a tremendous 75% getting off of drug addiction. 
The local government loved them so much, it came to them and said, "we'll 
give you the money to triple your mission, but you have to quit this 
prayer stuff." And they said, "we'd love the money, but it's the prayer 
stuff that is the reason we're successful." The average rate for secular 
government programs, according to Olasky, is, like, eight or 10% success. 
They were having 75%. They said, "what you're telling us is to get the 
money from you, we have to quit doing everything that works, which is the 
reason you want to give us the money." And so my argument's very simple, 
and I am totally against state prayer, I'm totally against the teacher 
praying, but I think we've got to have a debate and a dialogue about 
reestablishing the right to have some level of concern for faith and 
spiritual being everywhere in America.
<P>
And it has to be diverse and it has to represent everybody, and it can't 
be in any way an establishment system. But if you start by saying: in 
order to solve our problems, we will not discuss faith, spirituality, or 
inner strength, you are saying, in fact: we're not going to solve our 
problems. And no matter how much money you pour into an empty vessel, if 
the bottom of the vessel is open, it's going to go straight through. And 
the whole point of this opening hour is to suggest to you that if you 
want a healthy, free society, it starts with personal strength. Personal 
strength starts with some inner strength and inner sense of courage, 
inner sense of integrity, inner sense of spiritual faith, and that unless 
you address that, you're not going to have a healthy, free society. 
<P>
And every government solution that precludes those, that undermines 
strength by giving you an excuse not to get up, that Undermines family by 
punishing you if you get married, that sends signals that tell you, 
"these things don't matter, but why don't you come down to the 
bureaucracy and apply for a check," are, in fact, undermining the very 
goals that they're designed to achieve. So what we'll do in the second 
hour is we're going to take this back up again and work our way through 
some examples and then discuss the works of peter Drucker at the very 
end. We have five minutes. Okay, thank you.
<P>
Let me start with a couple of things just -- first of all, somebody 
reminded me, and I appreciate you all sort of keeping me up to speed on 
all this, that Marvin Olasky, the author of "the tragedy of American 
compassion," which I showed you a while ago, will be interviewed on 
C-Span's "book notes" program on Sunday night at 8:00 p.m.., I guess it 
is. So you get a chance to see Olasky personally. He's a very, very 
interesting guy, and I think you'll find it very interesting to have a 
chance to see him. Let me also suggest to you, somebody brought me -- one 
of the students brought in -- this is the "how to read a book" by 
Mortimer Adler. Adler wrote this. It was originally published in 1940 and 
then rewritten on several occasions and republished. And it starts with 
how to read, you know, your first book, although you obviously have to be 
able to read a fair amount to be able to read it. But for parents -- you 
know, for parents, it's a pretty good introduction to helping your kids 
read, but also, how to read history, how to read plays, how to read 
practical books. 
<P>
I mean, Mortimer Adler was, in some ways, the greatest popularizing 
philosopher of his generation. And this was his effort to really explain 
how to approach books and how to get things out of them. So when we 
talked about active learning last time, this would be -- this would have 
been very useful. And I appreciate very much your bringing it in, and you 
gave it to me, but I'm now going to loan it to Kathleen Minnix, so if you 
could pass it back up to dr. Minnix. She gets to read it while I go back 
to Washington this week. Let me also say that I want to get into a very 
controversial section for a few minutes. We're not going to talk about 
giraffes, so don't get panicked, but I want to get into talking about 
personal strength in some of the most difficult areas, and I want to 
start by arguing that personal strength applies to every American. And 
that literally -- remember I said earlier, people who are born with 
genetic challenges, mental or physical, people who are born -- people who 
get into an accident that severely -- leaves them with a severe handicap 
or disability, that's -- that's a separate challenge.
<P>
I think we have to think there how we help those people, and, in effect, 
give them compensatory investment and education and rehabilitation and 
technology in order to give them a chance to lead a full life. But if you 
except that very small number, I want to suggest that if you are 
relatively able-bodied and relatively intelligent -- and that's a very, 
very broad range. Now, we're talking about probably 256 or 257 million 
out of the 260 million Americans, and I'm sure there will presently be an 
article that analyzes exactly how many it is. But if you take that 
concept, for the vast overwhelming majority, that you're sort of born as 
a person. I used to use the word "normal," but I'm told that's not 
correct anymore. So but you're born as -you're a human being without a 
significant disability or a significant mental or physical challenge, 
that personal strength applies to you, and applies to you wherever you 
are today, whether you are a street person or a homeless person or you 
are living in poverty or you're the richest person in America. Personal 
strength applies to you. 
<P>
Now, what I want you to do is we're going to start this by looking at a 
fabulous introduction, and I should -- to Marva Collins, who is a great 
teacher in Chicago who teaches at a private school which is 
extraordinarily successful in exactly the same neighborhoods that the 
public schools are destroying the kids because they have structures that 
are so undisciplined, lacking in challenge, and they have the wrong 
attitude about the kids. Marva Collins is a very tough disciplinarian. 
And I want you to watch this story of her school, and particularly look 
for a little girl who you'll never forget for the rest of your life when 
you see her. 
<P>
You won't hear students reading about dick and Jane at Marva Collins' 
west side preparatory school in Chicago. Even for the little ones, it's 
back to the basics and the classics.  Cleopatra and Mary queen of Scots 
are all stories of very strong women. The classics to me is a real world, 
it's life. It's about struggle, it's about hard times, it's about 
overcoming the hard times of life. It's about not quitting. While the 
crumbling buildings in the inner city neighborhood near the school may 
say "quit," Mrs.. Collins teaches her students that "can't" is just "can" 
without the "t." Every child in here will tell you we do not take average 
papers. We tell them average people are never in short supply.  If we 
strive for excellence, we can become all that we want to become.
<P>
Great expectations prompted Collins to begin West Side Prep 15 years ago 
with her own money. The teacher believes that there are no poor students, 
there are only poor parents and poor teachers. There are more and more 
people who cannot raise their families in dignity and self-esteem, and I 
never intended for that to happen to any child that ever passes my way. 
They really do not have a choice to fail if they stay here. Since failure 
is not a choice here, Collins reminds students they're bright, and 
discipline and correction are made with positive affirmations. When she 
says that, "I love you, you're too bright to do that," they just know 
that they are too bright and they just stop it. Like a magic that she has 
over the children. At other schools, teachers, they didn't care. I've had 
teachers tell me, you know, "I'm here to get my paycheck. I don't care if 
you get this or not." While some educators have been critical of her 
teaching methods, students do not share their skepticism. She's a fun 
teacher.
<P>
>>it's a small school, but yet it has such big hearts and such expanding 
minds. And students of all ages have great expectations for themselves. 
People without vision perish. People without education don't make it very 
far. I've learned that I can do it if I try and that god made me so I can 
-- so that I can achieve, and I will achieve. Socrates taught Plato, and 
Plato taught Alexander the great, who said, "my parents gave me life, but 
you taught me how to live it," and I think it just goes on and on and on 
and it lives infinitely.
<P>
Don't you think that little girl's probably going to have a fair chance 
of succeeding? But notice how it's all, in a sense internalized, and 
notice how Marva Collins makes the history of the human race relevant to 
those kids. So you study the classics, because they have been powerful 
ways of expressing your life. That the dilemmas of Ulysses and Hercules 
in a sense are your dilemmas, or the dilemmas of Diana, the huntress, are 
your dilemmas. I mean, if you think about the Greek mythologies, the 
roman mythologies, the effort to bring to bear Shakespeare, that it's an 
effort to say: every person should somehow come in touch with the rich 
historical tradition. 
<P>
And yet we have a crisis in our culture which I think we have to talk 
about openly and honestly, and that is, in a sense, the dilemma of 
African-Americans. That the choice is the following two principles: by 
personal strength, I can learn the rules of success and become a 
successful American versus no matter what I do, racism will trap me in my 
Blackness. And it's a very key debate which I think we're going to have 
to engage in the next five or six years, because the question is, in 
America: is my success or my race the key factor? Am I more like an 
unemployed, uneducated "brother" or "sister," or more like other 
successful Americans, even if they are of Asian, Hispanic, or native 
American background? Now, this is not my view. I agree with it, but in a 
sense, I was profoundly moved by Shelby Steele. You remember we showed 
last week dr. Martin Luther king's great speech in Washington at the 
Lincoln memorial where he said, "I have a dream of an America where my 
children will be judged by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin." Well, dr. Steele took the content of our character, a new 
vision of race in America. 
<P>
I would encourage every American who's really interested in the challenge 
of race in America to read this, because it's a very personal book. And 
he walks through from his own personal experience being in rooms, role 
playing, playing games and how he feels about it, and also the challenge. 
He says the following. This is on page 164 of the paperback edition. He 
says, "I recently spoke with a Black woman who described herself as a 
cultural nationalist. "in her view, there were virtually no opportunities 
for Blacks to enter the mainstream of American life, which she saw as 
fundamentally racist. "she was, as we say, the Blackest of the Black. 
"yet this purified identity was achieved by an absolute denial of 
mainstream Black opportunity. "in her scheme, the more opportunity one 
admitted to, let alone took advantage of, the less Black one was. "the 
power of memory and inversion had virtually called this woman back to 
slavery and left her no option but collective action, since individual 
possibility was all but invisible to her.
<P>
"she was an extreme case, but also an extreme version of the paradigm 
that touches many Blacks. "even among middle-class Blacks who function 
well in the mainstream, when the time comes to declare one's identity, to 
announce one's Blackness, there is invariably a denial of Black 
opportunity. "this is the denial that brings one securely back inside the 
circle of Blackness that quite literally lets one feel Black. "to point 
to opportunity is to stand outside this circle, to be less Black." This 
is a real crisis of our civilization, because it goes to the heart of 
quotas, it goes to the heart of set-asides, but it also goes to the heart 
of the cultural debate about who we are. Are we 260 million people? And 
think about it this way. In American Civilization, we would argue there 
are 260 million of us and that we're each individuals. But in the current 
elite alternative view, there's this sort of thing called America.
<P>
But then there are a series of blocks, and the real test for you is: 
Which block are you in? If you think I exaggerate, look at government 
forms. Do they say you're an American? They say: who are you? And what if 
you are Anglo-American whose mother was Dutch and Protestant, whose 
father was Greek orthodox? And I would argue in the 19th century, they 
would not have thought of that as Anglo-American, but they would now, 
because Mediterranean people weren't considered the same as Northern 
Europeans. And you marry somebody whose mother was Black and father was 
Chinese. But who -- but the father was Chinese-Hispanic, because his 
mother was Hispanic, while his father was Chinese. Which box are you in? 
And the correct answer is what? See, you don't think.

<P>
>>American.<br>
>>no, no. Think for a second. In the real world, in all honesty, if you 
were filling out a job or scholarship application, which of the boxes 
would you check? Black.>>Probably Black, probably. It would depend. The 
correct question -- now, listen, listen, listen. You're not thinking. 
>>>>all right, take us through it. Right. But the correct question is: at 
this school at this time, which group has the best shot of getting the 
scholarship? I mean, let's be honest. I want you to think about it. 
That's why there was a scandal in San Francisco in the fire department, 
because everybody was inventing an American Indian great grandmother. 
Isn't that exactly what the system does? And furthermore, notice how it 
drives you apart. And yet look at the threat. If you're in one of these 
-- if you're in a favored group, favored because of some victimization, 
you know, if we suddenly say, "you're just an American," you lose all of 
your group rights and your group identity, and you get into a big 
cultural conflict, which, by the way, is not new. This has been going on 
since the 18th century, when the Germans arrived and lived in German 
communities. Go look at the Amish today. The history of America is the 
history of a tension between who you were and who you're becoming, and 
it's a very powerful question. And yet the crisis of the inner city is 
really a clash between American Civilization and a culture of poverty and 
violence.
<P>
This is one of the things -- and this -- I really believe the inner city 
is not about racism. It's not a Black problem or a Hispanic problem. And 
you're seeing it gradually spread. If you look at white births outside of 
marriage, they're now about where Black births were in 1960. Black births 
in 1960 are actually closer to white births in 1960 than they are to 
Black births now, because what's happened is the first group to get hit 
were Blacks, because they were the most pushed into the welfare system, 
the Blacks and American Indians. Nobody has honestly looked at American 
Indian reservations as centers of pathology brought on them by the 
government and the way the government Indian bureau works and the 
standards and system. That, by the way, is breaking down for a most 
ironic reason. They're opening up casinos because they have a legal 
loophole, so they're becoming centers of wealth. So they're rapidly 
become Americanized. 
<P>
It will become a great crisis among native Americans in the next 
generation, because they'll come to be rich enough to say, "fine, I'm 
glad I'm a native American. Send me the check. I've got to go to brazil 
for a vacation." It will change their whole world, because they'll 
suddenly start being capitalists. But what happened gradually is as the 
welfare state values have been spreading, it is spreading a culture of 
poverty and a culture of violence. I want to read to you -- Leon Dash 
wrote a tremendous book called "when children want children: the urban 
crisis of teenage childbearing." And I want to read two quick passages, 
but it is absolutely an astonishing work. He says, "I began my research 
into adolescent childbearing" -- let me back up. Leon dash is a Black 
reporter, African-American reporter, at the "Washington Post," who was 
required to do this book to live in a public housing area for 18 months 
in an apartment, going out, listening to and probing people. Trained by 
the greatest investigative reporter of our time, bob Woodward, who 
insisted he go back again and again and again.
<P>
Listen to what he says. "I began my research into adolescent childbearing 
burdened with adult presumptions. "I assumed that the high incidence of 
teenage pregnancy among poor Black urban youths nationwide grew out of 
youthful ignorance both about birth control methods and adolescent 
reproductive capabilities. "I also thought that girls were falling victim 
to cynical manipulation by the boys, although the number of babies born 
to adolescent girls appeared to be awfully high for this to be the 
dominant pattern." Remember, this is a Black reporter who lived in the 
system. "I was wrong on all counts." I want to repeat this, because since 
all modern welfare state policy is based on the preceding paragraph and 
all of the recent surgeon general's arguments are based on the preceding 
paragraph, listen to his conclusion. "I was wrong on all counts. "among 
the adolescents in Washington, DC. Whom I interviewed, I found that 
teenage boys and girls as young as 11 knew more about sex, birth control, 
and their reproductive abilities than I had known at the same age. 
"others had had extensive school courses in sex education in the 6th or 
7th grade. "I found that the girls, far from being passive victims, were 
often equal or greater actors than their boyfriends in exploring 
sexuality and becoming pregnant. "girls were as often the leaders in 
their desire to have a child as the boys were. "I did not find one 
adolescent couple where both partners were ignorant about the results of 
sexual activity without the use of contraception. "in time, it became 
clear that for many girls in the poverty stricken community of Washington 
highlands, a baby is a tangible achievement in an otherwise dreary and 
empty future." 
<P>
I want to repeat this sentence because it's so powerful. "a baby is a 
tangible achievement in an otherwise dreary and empty future. "it is one 
way of announcing: I am a woman. "for many boys in Washington highlands, 
the birth of a baby represents an identical right of passage. "the boy is 
saying: I am a man. The desire for a child is especially acute among 
adolescents who were doing poorly in school. "they knew implicitly and 
had been told explicitly that they were not likely to graduate from high 
school. "these were the youths age 15 to 17 and still in the 7th grade 
who were at highest risk to get pregnant or father a child. "while the 
better students strove for a diploma, the poorer students achieved their 
form of recognition with a baby. "if the crisis of Black teenage parents 
was simply a matter of ignorance, then it might be relatively easy to 
solve, but poor academic preparation that begins in elementary school, 
the poverty that surrounds them, and social isolation from mainstream 
American life motivate many of these boys and girls to have children." 
<P>
The only other point I would say to you is that he estimated that on 
average, it took him -this is Leon dash, African-American, reporter at 
the "Washington post" -- on average, it took four months for him to get a 
girl to tell him the truth. That he listened and asked, listened and 
asked, came back a week later, listened and asked, four months. Which 
says what about most of your academic studies, most of your newspaper 
reporting, and most of your government servants? They're useless. They're 
totally misleading. Leon dash, until I'd read Olasky, I thought this was 
one of the most powerful books. It's a great book, and Leon dash did 
great work and deserves -- he has a new book -- a new report coming out, 
because he's gone back into the period before urban poverty to look at 
it, but it's a great work. The argument I'm trying to suggest here to you 
is that given what he's saying, this is not about birth control 
education. That, in fact, personal strength is the key to replacing the 
culture of poverty. 
<P>
If you really want to replace the culture of poverty, you've got to focus 
on personal strength, and you've got to redesign the entire system to 
focus on personal strength. Now, we're going to spend two hours on this 
later on, but let me, for today's purpose, outline for you nine vision 
level principles for personal strength. First, will this proposal help 
people become more responsible? You'll notice, we did this earlier, more 
productive and more safe so they can be prosperous and free so they can 
pursue happiness. Every time a proposal is clearly going to undermine 
responsibility and productivity, you ought to say to yourself: why are we 
doing this? If you went through the current welfare state and every 
single item which undermined personal strength was eliminated, you'd 
replace about 80% of the welfare state overnight, because it is actively 
destructive. It's not that it's failing to help. It is actually 
undermining, because it is sending the wrong signals. 
<P>
Second, everyone must have full citizenship, and that includes both the 
rights and responsibilities. That means when you see a homeless person, 
you say: fine, I'll go halfway. But you've got to go halfway. If you see 
somebody who is poor sitting there 17 years of age doing nothing: we will 
help you, but then you have to help yourself today. By the way, every 
successful program says it starts today. Not two years, not six months, 
today. Work begins day one. I just met with a sister who's in charge of 
covenant house, which is a catholic charity that has 41,000 girls a year 
who come through it. She said: our principle is simple. You have to work 
the first day. No other system works. So when you hear somebody say: 
we'll get around to it. You have two years to sit around and wait and 
then we'll start, well, if you're going to start, why wait two years? Why 
ruin two years of their life? Why entrench deeper the habits of not doing 
things? Three, everything costs something. 
<P>
There is no free lunch. And as a citizen, you have some obligation to 
help out a little at all times. The 19th century traditionalists have a 
wood pile next to the mission house, and when the homeless showed up, 
they cut wood before they ate. Because if you wouldn't cut wood, you 
weren't prepared to do your share. And they cut wood both for themselves 
and for one widow, because you have an obligation to have dignity by 
contributing. Think about that model compared to the current model. Again 
that's Olasky. Four, reward what you want to encourage, punish or make 
more expensive what you want to discourage. How's that for turning the 
welfare and tax codes on their head? You want to reward savings? Make it 
tax-free. What do we do? We punish savings and we reward credit. Go 
through the whole list. You want to reward entrepreneurship? Make it 
advantageous. You want to reward going to work? Have a very low marginal 
tax rate when you go to work. We do just the opposite. The FICA tax gives 
you a very high marginal tax rate as soon as you get a job.
<P>
Ask any young person the first -- how many of you had that shock the 
first time of getting a paycheck? Raise your hand if you got a paycheck 
and you were stunned how much smaller it was than you thought it would 
be. Okay. Five, these rules apply from childhood throughout your active 
life. In a few weeks, we're going to see a great entrepreneur on 
videotape who talks about he went to work when he was 9 or 10 years old 
because he wanted to buy a pony. Okay. It turns out in a recent "Wall 
Street Journal" study or a "Wall Street Journal" report of a study, over 
half of all the first-generation millionaires they interviewed had their 
first job by the time they were 10. It may be a lemonade stand, it may be 
cleaning up around the yard, it may be carrying newspapers, but notice 
how different that is from the welfare state mentality. Can you imagine 
what trouble I'd be in if I said every poor child should actually be 
earning money? Gingrich wants to exploit child labor. Return to -- you 
know, return to 19th century coal mines.
<P>
I just threw that in so the reporter who's distorting the class can go 
ahead and do it, will have some help. You know, and yet as a matter of 
pragmatic reality, when you see a study that says over half the 
first-generation millionaires rose because very early in life they 
acquired the habits, and then you start talking to middle-class parents: 
do your kids earn their allowance? Just think about it. The families that 
are healthiest, I'll bet you they earn them and they don't give them. I 
even know millionaires whose parents made them work for their allowance 
to instill the habit. You aren't given this money, you earn it. Then it's 
yours. If it's given to you, then it's really not yours. It's your mom or 
dad, and they have the strength. But if you earn it, it's your money. 
Now, if you're physically or mentally challenged, you should receive the 
best possible rehabilitation and assistance to lead the fullest possible 
life, and as I said earlier, I really feel very, very strongly about 
that. 
<P>
Seventh, the key is not a big leap. It is one day at a time with 
continuous improvement. That's the key to success. You've got to do a 
little bit every day. You've got to try to improve every day. You don't 
get this done in a big jump forward. You get it done one step at a time. 
And again, every time you run into people, they say, "well, that doesn't 
get you very far." No, but it's the right direction. It's the right 
movement. There's no hamburger flipping job. Any job beats welfare. 
Because it's the step, it's the beginning. It's where you get started. 
Now, in that framework, you want to build on opportunity and success, not 
focus on problems and failure. This is going to be one of my greatest 
challenges this year in the congress, is convincing our committees to 
have hearings on success. What are the 10 best addiction reform programs 
in America? What are the 10 best alcoholic programs in America? What are 
the 10 best small inner city schools in America? What works? So people 
can copy what works, not just study the pathologies.
<P>
And, ninth, and this one will obviously be -- fit my personality, or at 
least my experience: do not shy away from controversy. This is a choice 
between two value systems, two power structures, and two visions of 
America. Conflict is inevitable and direct. Blunt debate is desirable. 
That until you're prepared to engage the issue of personal strength and 
talk honestly about what it implies, you're not going to get anywhere, 
and that, by definition, is going to be controversial. Now, let me give 
you some examples. I would suggest that in American Civilization, that 
Americans favor work over idleness, saving over debt, family over 
individual chaos, helping your children over abandonment, responsibility 
over irresponsibility, learning over ignorance, and responsible 
citizenship over indifference. Now, and in every case, my point -- this 
is not just nice words. My point is in each case, the law and the 
government should favor the former over the latter.
<P>
That is, you ought to literally go through the tax code, the welfare 
code, the bureaucratic rules and regulations. You should go through the 
entire structure of government and say: are we sending signals that favor 
work over idleness? That favor saving over debt? That strengthen family 
over individual chaos? That give you an incentive and a legal structure 
to help children rather than abandon them? How are we doing this? Or, in 
fact, do we, without even realizing it, send the opposite signal? Go to 
work and we'll tax you and we'll kick you off Medicaid. Save and we'll 
raise your social security taxes. Try to get married and the earned 
income tax credit will take $4,600 away from you. Try to adopt a child 
and it can cost up to $50,000 to adopt a child, so they're trapped in 
foster care and they're trapped -- and, you know, people attacked me over 
the orphanage argument. This is a society which has artificially made it 
expensive to adopt children. Just the opposite of a good, strong 
pro-family environment. 
<P>
Now, the reason I said that we should look at the law and The government 
is because the law is a great teacher. And I really don't think you can 
fully appreciate the power of this. You know when a teacher is saying, 
"you ought to work hard," out in the yard there's an illiterate drug 
dealer driving a Cadillac, then the law is tolerating a lesson to be 
taught, and no matter how often you say it in the classroom, it's not 
going to work. So you've got to structure the law so that you are 
learning from your government and society what you wish to teach in the 
classroom. And if the classroom is teaching one thing and government and 
society is teaching another, you should assume that at best, you're going 
to have conflict, and at worst, that the ultimate reality of the society 
will drown in the classroom. Doesn't do any good to say, "lets teach it 
to them," if the law doesn't teach it, too. And so you've got to think 
about the law as a teacher. In addition, frankly, leaders can be 
teachers. 
<P>
It's very, very important to recognize that leaders play a very, very 
important role, and the way they model, what they say, where they go is a 
very important part of this process of teaching. Do you go to the boy 
scout jamboree or not? Do you go to the girl scout national meeting or 
not? Do you think the salvation army is important enough to visit or not? 
How does a leader spend their time and where do they go and who do they 
see and then what do they talk about? These are important factors. I wear 
a habitat for humanity pin. I understand the other night that on 
"Saturday night live" that the person that caricatures me also had a 
habitat for humanities pin on, but I'm sending a signal. I'm saying 
habitat for humanity is a good program and that others ought to have a 
pin, too. You pick the program you like, but tell me what you're doing 
that's important, because these are signals. They matter. They 
communicate. Public symbols and awards can teach. It's why the thousand 
points of light wasn't a bad idea. That's why when you find ways -- you 
know, as you'll see later on when we talk about Deming and quality, 
creating a Baldrige award at least created a sense of looking at things.
<P>
You know, people would say, "well, they must think quality's really 
important." Getting a scholarship, having a star student. These are good 
things to do, because they help the society talk to itself about what it 
values. And again, we come back to the core point about why civilization 
matters. Civilization must be learned, so values must be taught. And for 
Americans, personal strength must be at the center of those values and of 
our civilization. So if you go out and you start with head start and you 
look at the curriculum, how much are we emphasizing personal strength? 
How much are we communicating it? If you look at the way government 
bureaucracies work, how much do they talk about personal strength? Olasky 
makes the point that when you have 200 cases and you're a welfare worker, 
you have no personal contact. That in the 19th century, because it was 
all volunteer, the average was one to one or one to two. You actually 
knew person you were trying to help.
<P>
At 200 cases, you're filling out the paperwork and sending the check. So 
how can you teach personal strength? And so you've got to really think it 
through in terms of how we teach these things. Now, I want to take for 
the next few minutes one of the two people who I think is at the center 
of the revolution in American productivity and success in the 20th 
century. He's actually, interestingly enough, an Austrian by birth, came 
to the US. In the early 19 -- late 1920s, still alive, still writing in 
his mid 80s. Has an article out this month in the "Atlantic Monthly" in 
the February edition called "really reinventing government" by Peter 
Drucker. And it's just fascinating to me, here's a guy who in his -- I 
think he's now, like, 85 or 86, still teaches at Claremont college, still 
writes, clearly the greatest management writer of the 20th century. He 
and Edwards Deming, who I'll talk about in a little bit, who died at 93 
while still teaching, they're exemplary models of the idea that in the 
information age, our whole Sense of aging is going to change, which as I 
get older I think is cool. 
<P>
But what I want to talk to you about is the book that we have as a 
required reading today, which is Drucker's "the Effective Executive." 
Now, I hope all of you began the process of reading it. This is the 
paperback edition. I hope all of you have bought it, and I want you to 
keep it forever and I want you to mark, like, January of each year, and I 
want you to take it back up for at least four or five years and reread 
it. Now, you may say: why is Gingrich being nutty about this? I read this 
book for the first time in -- and you're going to have to really cue me 
on this, because I'm just going to go rolling for a while because this is 
so important. I read this book for the first time, I believe, in 1969 
when I was in Brussels working on my dissertation, and it shaped my 
entire life. In the first place, really good books lead you to people. In 
my case, Drucker led me to Alfred Sloan and he led me to who was the 
creator of general motors in its modern form, and he led me to George 
Marshall, who was the creator of the American army in its modern form.
<P>
And he said: these are two of the three greatest management leaders of 
the 20th century. Theodore Vail was the other one, and I have not read 
much on Vail. But I found Drucker himself came to the US., Was actually a 
philosophy professor, came to the US. He'd also done merchant banking in 
Vienna, and he began writing on management, and then in one of those 
great moments -- and you'll hear me talk a lot about the idea that life 
is lived organically by bonds of people. That is, if you look at great 
NFL coaches, you'll find out they often studied under great NFL coaches 
and actually find sort of schools of coaching. Well, the same thing's 
true of learning. Drucker was asked by Alfred Sloan, the man who created 
general motors, to come and spend a year in the modern -- he took over a 
company that was bankrupt and rebuilt it. It was on the verge of 
bankruptcy and rebuilt it. 
<P>
Sloan said to him, "I want you to come and spend a year inside general 
motors and explain to us how we operate." It was the greatest industrial 
corporation in the world. He wrote a book, I think it came out the year I 
was born in 1943, called "the concept of the corporation," which in terms 
of just reading a great work on management and history is extraordinary. 
He begins the book by saying, "I'm a little bit like the scholar of china 
who found he was almost ready to write and then there was another century 
he hadn't studied." And one day decided that he'd better start writing, 
because there were always going to be more things about china than he 
could ever learn, and if he didn't stop in ignorance and start writing, 
he'd never get anything written. So he said, "I confess up front general 
motors is so complex and so extraordinary, I don't really understand all 
of it, and this book is simply my effort to explain what I learned in one 
year." Which to me was a very helpful way of reminding us: we're never 
really experts. We never really know. There's always something more to 
learn. 
<P>
And then he outlined how general motors worked in the early 1940s. From 
that, he began developing his approach to management. And Drucker's 
central argument is that the key to -- remember that in his lifetime, the 
central challenge to the democracy is totalitarianism, whereas in 
Washington and Lincoln's lifetimes it was aristocratic kingship. Well, 
kingships were gone, basically. But the new threat of the 20th century 
was that the way you organize humans is you have a secret police state 
with a totalitarian leader. Mao Tse-Tung- in china, Joseph Stalin in 
Russia, Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini, and to some extent 
imperial japan, which was a mixed system with an emperor but with a 
police state, a military dictatorship. In that framework, Drucker's 
trying to explain: how can humans organize themselves to be productive? 
And how can they do so in a way that they share power, with no one 
becoming a dictator? And he creates the concepts of management, the 
principles of management, has written over 20 books and is, I think, 
without any question, the most widely read management consultant in the 
world today. 
<P>
More people -- more managers have read Drucker than anybody else. Now, 
he's older now, and there's a tendency to now skip his books and say, 
well, let's read the latest fad, which I would say is an enormous -- it's 
like skipping Shakespeare. You know, let's read the latest playwright. 
And I would say that at least two or three of Drucker's books should be 
permanent in every management school in the country, and at least one of 
them ought to be in every high school, and that's this one, because "the 
Effective Executive" makes this point. And this is a man, by the way, who 
wrote about the information age in the 1960s and was more accurate then 
than anybody who's writing about it now, because he understood core 
principles about human beings and how systems work. His point is: every 
one of you's an executive. The number of decisions -- I mean, just think 
about today. The class is over. How many of you came here by car? 
Two-thirds of you. How far could you go in a day by car? 600 miles? A few 
of you could go a lot further, but let's not admit that on public 
television. Draw a 600-mile radius. Look at that first choice. Second 
choice, you don't want to go very far today. Well, would you like to go 
to the movies? Would you like to go shopping? If you want to go shopping, 
there are within 30 miles of here 15 malls. Which mall would you like to 
go to? In a typical mall, there are four anchor stores and 280 shops. 
Which shop would you like to go to? Or would you rather go home and stop 
by blockbuster's and pick up a movie? There will be about 6,000 titles. 
Well, you don't want to do that, you're going to go by the county 
library. Or you'd rather go out and play softball, or you'd rather go 
hike in the mountains. My point is: you have at your fingertips such an 
enormous range of resources that you are the first generation in the 
history of the world in which every person is an executive.
<P>
Every person is controlling resources on such a scale that you have to 
think it through and you have to plan it and you have to make it work. 
And so Drucker's argument is if you're going to be an executive, because 
you can't -- you have to to do it. When you go to a grocery store, I 
think it's an average Wal-mart-mart has 100,000 items in it. I think 
there are some superstores, Publix and Kroger, that now are in about the 
same range. So you go to a grocery store, if you don't have a list either 
in your head or in writing, and you say, "I think I'll shop randomly," 
which some of you do -- I was going to say: don't feel guilt ridden. 
<P>
You looked right at me when you said that. I looked at three different 
groups of people. You're the only one who reacted badly. We know a lot 
more about you. My point's just what Drucker's trying to do in this 
little book, and as you know, it's only 178 pages. And what he's trying 
to say to you is: effectiveness is a set of learned habits. It goes back 
to why the bell curve is sort of a goofy book. Effectiveness can be 
learned. It's not a function of being charismatic -- and he's very clear 
in here. It's not a function of being charismatic, it's not a function of 
being good looking, it's not a function of even being smart. It's not 
even a function of working long hours. It's a function of knowing what 
you're doing, thinking it through, doing it systematically, which means 
you have to learn the habits.
<P>
And so what I'm going to do, we -- at one point I started to put up a 
series of Chyrons so you could actually read key things, and then I 
realized as I went back and reviewed the book, I had literally -- and 
this is an important thing about certain books in life. The bible is 
another one that fits this. A lot of books you just read. You go, "well, 
that was interesting. What were the three big points?" Then occasionally 
you run into a book you shouldn't do that. Cookbooks are that way. I 
mean, imagine you tried to read a cookbook the way you read a novel, and 
then you tried to remember a recipe. Okay? This is a cookbook for 
effective life. And so part of my suggestion -- I stopped because I 
decided what you really need to do is go through here, mark it down, and 
then go back, and at each point you need to say to yourself: what does 
this mean to me? Now, I'll give you a couple of examples. Notice that he 
starts by arguing that this is not about managing other people. This is 
about managing yourself. Now, I cannot tell you in terms of how I became 
speaker of the house and done all the different -- and people say to me: 
how can you teach a course here, teach part-time at the industrial 
college of the armed forces, serve as speaker of the house, represent the 
6th district, and have a TV show on Tuesday nights?
<P>
And the answer is this book. This book taught me a quarter century ago 
how to systematically discipline, plan, think through, delegate, trust 
others to build a system. Now, the day we were sworn in, when I got down 
as speaker after my speech and I spent about -- I spent I think about 40 
-- an hour, I think, on the house floor, I left. I had other things to 
do. I did not go back to the house floor until 2:15 in the morning, and 
for 14 hours I just worked. Why did I work? Because of this book. That's 
how powerful I think this book is. This is a book I refer to again and 
again and again. It's the first book I ask all of my members and all the 
senior staff to read. Not all of them have done it yet, and I'll start 
reminding them in the near future, because I can tell when they haven't 
done it. And you may say to yourself: how can you tell when they haven't 
done it? There's a section in here which talks about effective decisions. 
It's chapter 7. 
<P>
And I'm deliberately just going to jump around, because I just want to 
take illustrations, because this -- I would have to teach for three 
two-hour sessions to carry you through this book in detail, and I don't 
want the people to get the Cliff Notes version: newt thought these were 
the six big points. Every page of this book is incredible. If you will 
read it and then stop and say: okay, what did that mean in my life? How 
do I change my behavior? He says in here, on effective decisions, that 
you have to look for disagreement. I'm trying to find the exact reference 
here. Somebody may want to help me for a second. But he talks about the 
notion that you're always looking for an argument or a disagreement, and 
he cites the fact that Alfred Sloan would often say, "if everybody agreed 
instantly," he'd say, "let's postpone this decision for a week so we have 
the time to find something to disagree about." Because he wanted people 
to slow down and talk through the decision. He wanted to make sure that 
everybody in the room understand the decision, because if you just say, 
"yes," 
<P>
And then later you realize, "oh, that means you're cutting my department 
30%?" He doesn't want you to make the decision until you understand the 
decision. So when I watch my chairmen, if they rush something through, 
they haven't gotten Drucker yet. Because they're missing -- you want to 
cultivate all the disagreements before you decide. He has a section in 
here on -I think that particular reference is in "the elements of 
decision-making." He has a section in here in which he talks about 
building on strength. I've always vividly thought about this, because 
it's one of the great weaknesses of modern management, and it drives some 
of my associates crazy because they don't understand a particular style 
that Drucker emphasizes, and that, he says, flatly came out of both 
George Marshall and Alfred Sloan.
<P>
Now, what does building on strengths mean? Drucker's argument's real 
simple. He says: if you want a mountain, guess what you've got on both 
sides of it? Huh? You have valleys. If you want a plateau, you don't have 
a mountain. What does modern management -- what do modern human resource 
vice-presidents look for? We're not going to hire you because of -- we 
found valley "a" or we found valley "b." So you don't fit. You get 
enormous achievement in life if you focus on managing this, if you 
recruit strength. Why can I delegate and walk off? Because all around me 
there are people as powerful as Dick Armey and Tom Delay and John Casey 
and Nancy Johnson and Susan Molinari, and they're all -- they all have -- 
now, does every one of them have a down side? Of course. As some of you 
probably have noticed, so do i. And you'll notice, I never worry about 
the valleys. I knew when I said I'd teach a 20-hour course after becoming 
speaker that some idiot would deliberately distort what I said, so when 
we had the giraffe comment totally taken out of context, that's just one 
of the valleys. You can't go mountain climbing unless you're willing to 
have valleys. But if you assemble a team -- and this is one of the -- if 
you look at George Marshall and you look at Alfred Sloan, remember what 
Drucker says: Sloan would spend weeks thinking about personnel. He'd 
really try to be concerned. 
<P>
Now, this book is so important, we're going to come back to it two more 
times. And I beg all of you, read it, mark it up, think it through, come 
in with questions next week. We may even get to it a third -- another 
time. We're certainly going to get to it next week on entrepreneurial 
free enterprise, and we're going to get to it the last week when we're 
talking about citizenship. So mark it up, look for questions, look for 
things you don't understand, things you don't agree with, but we're not 
going to try to build any Chyron out of this. We're not going to say, 
"here are the three big ones." Every page of this, if you read it and 
think about it and study it, this was a work of genius. This is -- 
Drucker is, I believe, one of the great men of the 20th century, and this 
was an extraordinary effort on his part to lay out the lessons he'd 
learned. When he wrote this, he was already in late middle age. And so 
this is a book I wish every American citizen would someday read and 
understand its implication, which is: you are powerful. You're a free 
person in a free society at the beginning of the information age, and you 
have resources and capacities un -- that no king in the ancient world had.
<P>
Every citizen has opportunity, if we can figure out how to make that true 
and how to get them to learn. Now, having said that, let me also suggest 
to you that you've got to reestablish, as part of that, heroes. Notice 
that heroism teaches the values to be lived for. If you'll notice, 
Drucker, in a sense, talks about heroes. Alfred Sloan's extraordinary 
achievement in building the greatest industrial corporation in history. 
Truly one of the great, great studies. In Sloan's two works, "my 
adventures as a white collar man," which is his earlier memoir written 
just before world war ii, and "my years with general motors," are 
extraordinary books, well worth your reading, but Sloan is a great man. 
George Marshall may well be the most -- certainly the most disciplined 
and maybe in some ways the greatest American of the 20th century. He 
built the modern army from 200 -- or 170,000 men to 15 million in three 
years. 
<P>
One of the greatest leadership achievements in the history of the human 
race. And he was a man of such nobility that he rivals Washington in our 
lexicon of people who are truly noble. Theodore Vail created the modern 
telephone company, avoided nationalization, which was the current thing. 
But the whole concept in your book of readings today, "building a 
community of citizens," Don Eberly was the editor, the section by Dennis 
Denenberg on the role of heroes and heroines in the American story makes 
a very important point. And that is that when you are surrounded by 
heroes and heroines, when the pictures on the wall of your school are the 
pictures of real achievement, when you grow up thinking, you know, that 
you could be like Helen Keller, you could be like Clara Barton, you could 
be like Eleanor Roosevelt, you could lead a life that is dynamic and 
exciting, you could do things that are real, it's different than when you 
grow up without the -- because they, in a sense -- what heroes and 
heroines do is they remind us there are mountaintops and that humans get 
there, and that you, too -- not that you'll necessarily get there. 
<P>
Drucker says at one point: you're not necessarily ever going to be able 
to write like Mozart, but you can play like Mozart. So maybe you only get 
halfway up the mountain, but it beats being stuck in the swamp. And the 
purpose of heroes and heroines is to both give us a goal to strive for 
and to pull us above where we would normally be. In a free society, every 
person has a chance to be a little bit of a hero or a heroine every day. 
There's a Reagan line to that effect in his first inaugural. Now, I want 
you to watch a section which I always watch with great emotion because my 
best friend, who's now dead, and I went to see this many times when we 
were in high school. This is an excerpt from an older movie, and I want 
you to listen carefully to Charles Bronson as a gunfighter that just had 
a fight, all of the local -- these are American gunfighters who have gone 
to a Mexican village to save the peasants from a group of bandits. And 
it's " The magnificent seven."
<P>
It's a derivative actually of Curacao, who was a great classic, and the 
seven samurai. And the parents hid because they're not gunfighters. Later 
in the movie, they become very heroic and they help wipe out the bandits, 
but at the moment, the kids are ashamed of their parents. And watch this 
scene, because I think it tells you a lot about heroes and heroines. 
<P>
>>can we go with you, Renardo?<br>
>>no.<br>
>>you like us, don't you?<br>
>>I guess so.<br>
>>you're one of us, aren't you?<br>

<P>
>>yeah, I'm one of us, all right.<br>
>>take us with you, please?<br>
>>no.<br>
>>we're ashamed to live here. Our fathers are cowards. Don't you ever say 
that again about your fathers, because they are not cowards. You think I 
am brave because I carry a gun? Well, your fathers are much braver 
because they carry responsibility for you, your brothers, your sisters, 
and your mothers, and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs 
a ton. It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the 
ground, and there's nobody says they have to do this. They do it because 
they love you and because they want to. I have never had this kind of 
courage. Running a farm, working like a mule every day with no guarantee 
will ever come of it. This is bravery.
<P>
Point being that if every person counts, then there may be no more heroic 
act than raising a child. There may be no more heroic act than earning a 
living or doing the right thing by your community. That heroism isn't 
just Horatio at the bridge. But in a free society, heroism is every man 
and every woman every day doing the best they can. Now, I want to remind 
you as you start thinking about these things and as we start applying 
them, we want to apply them in a framework of vision, strategies, 
projects, and tactics, so that we think them through at these four 
levels. But then you also want to discipline yourself into the habit that 
when you think you know what you're doing, that you go out and you listen 
to other people, you learn from other people, you help other people, and 
you lead other people, in that order. So when you think you've got it, 
you've got to go now and listen to see: well, does it make sense to them 
in their world and what are they thinking?
<P>
And I also want to remind you that the whole concept of this course is 
that these ideas are the beginning of a dialogue. This course is not 
about, you know, wisdom that we're guaranteed will work. This course is 
about starting a dialogue about: what is an American Civilization like? 
Now, dr. Minnix suggested for next week we got some great stuff, which 
we're going to codify and reproduce and get back to you on everybody who 
last week gave us their list of what they would teach immigrants, which 
is very helpful. Then we had the test, or the question was: if somebody 
who just arrived walked up to you and said, "what are the first five 
things I should do to learn to be an American," what would you list? 
Interestingly, I would say 70% listed "learn English" as the first thing. 
It was very interesting in terms of some national debates about 
bilingualism, but dr. Minnix suggested for next week that you just write 
us a couple paragraphs of one of two things: what is the best example in 
your own life of personal strength? Or, alternatively: what would be an 
example, again, in your own life, of a hero or a heroine?
<P>
And I think if you'd do that, what we're going to do is we're going to 
keep pulling together everybody's ideas, and I think you're going to find 
by the end of the quarter, we have some very interesting things to share 
with you, and that gives you a way of making it real. Let me stop now, 
because we have a couple minutes left. Questions? Reactions? 
<P>
The point you were saying about having people disagree with you and stuff 
like that, I was wondering on the first day of congress, when you made 
all the rules about the three-fifths majority for a tax increase and the 
open laws on the floor, I thought -- I thought those rules were effective 
from here on out for every congress, and then I learned that it was just 
for this congress, and I was -- and I thought, you know, well, gee, that 
gives democrats more power, you know. Assure.
<P>
>>that they're in the minority now, and that gives them so much more 
power. Is that why you did that? You mean it gives them more power 
because they could vote "no"? Because next time -- the reason you did 
that is because -that's a good question. In the constitution, the house 
and senate are very different. The senate is a continuing body, because 
only a third of the senators get elected every time. The house, however 
-- so the senate rules carry over. The house, though, is entirely a 
single body. And the house is in a situation where we all get elected 
every time, so every time we create a brand new house, so the rules are 
brand new every time. And the house -- under the constitution, the house 
controls its own rules, so the constitution limits us to do that, which 
is, I think, fine. But that's a good question. I think we have time for 
maybe one other question before John yells at me. Yes, ma'am. With the 
advent of the third wave, the political categories we place people, 
conservatives, liberals, populists, is that going to change, or is that 
-- yeah, my personal guess is that all of the political language of the 
last 30 years is gone. We just don't know it yet, and we don't know what 
the new language is, but that an information age, world market society on 
the scale we're describing is going to be dramatically, dramatically 
different, and we'll talk about that. We're going to spend two hours on 
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's third wave and American Civilization, and we 
may well get into that, and then we'll talk about it again at the last 
session of the course, which will be two hours on citizenship and 
community. Now, let me remind you that next week's topic is pillar three: 
entrepreneurial free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, 
solution, and opportunities. I'm going to talk about that. And next 
week's reading is to finish up "the Effective Executive" and to read 
chapters 7 and 11 of "building" -- of "Building A Community Of Citizens."

NEW AGE CHANNELLING FOR RIGHT-WING WONKS</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Dr. Philip Gold<BR>
Discovery Institute Senior Fellow</B></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Got a grant to write a culture book. Started reading New Age stuff (Know
Thy Enemy). Unbidden, the question arose: Can conservatives also recover
past lives? I asked a very liberal, very Buddhist lady friend. She replied
that conservatives could not recover past lives until they acquired present
ones. That made it personal. I decided to attempt Recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a dark and stormy night. I sat on the porch with the necessary meditation
aids -- scotch 4 soda, good cigars, meat-based munchies, and a yellow legal
pad to record the results. Trees howled. Wind swayed back and forth. And
when I accessed my first prior life -- Betakh-Betakh, senior fellow _ King
Solomon's think tank, the Center for_ Proverbial Wisdom -- I knew that the
Foundation would soon be getting its money's worth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fourteen other lives were recovered that night. Names have been omitted
when unverifiable and *** indicates possible false recovery.<BR>

In sum, the Recovery was an unqualified success. Only problem is, the book's
getting impossible to write. Everybody has their ideas, wants their input,
needs to share. Except for Hiddekel, Perpetua, and Sir Hamilton. They just
edit.<BR>

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class Six<BR>
Pillar Five: Quality As Defined By Deming<BR>
<PRE>
>> The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
>>Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the sixth of
>>10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor
>>at Reinhardt college, will continue his course, which presents the
>>foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American
>>Civilization.  This week's lesson, Pillar Five, Quality, focuses on
>>quality, customer orientation, teamwork, continuous improvement, systems
>>analysis, and the spirit of Edwards Deming.

>> Let me say good morning.  I want to welcome the students of Mind
>>Extension University who are taking the course by television around the
>>country.  And remind you that you can mail your comments to:  Renewing
>>American Civilization, post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia  30065.
>>Or you can fax your comments to: 404-528-9806.  You could e-mail your
>>comments to America online at renewam@aol.com.  Class transcripts and
>>other class materials are available on our Internet web page, which is
>>http://www.pff.org.  And if you got that, you probably didn't need it,
>>because you probably already knew it.  And if you didn't get it, you
>>probably don't need it, because you probably can't do it.  For those who
>>are not quite into the third wave, you can call 1-800-to-renew to learn
>>more about "American Civilization" newspaper or how to get the video and
>>audio tapes of the course and how to get the course readings.
</PRE>
I want to remind everyone that this is premised on the idea that there is
an American Civilization, and that the five pillars of American
Civilization are, first, the historic lessons of American Civilization.
Second, personal strength.  Third, entrepreneurial free enterprise.
Fourth, the spirit of invention and discovery.  And, fifth, today's topic,
quality as defined by Edwards Deming, and that as we go through each of
these pillars with two hours with a class devoted to them, we will then
pick up starting next week with the four areas to which we will apply these
pillars.  First, the third wave and American Civilization.  Second,
creating American jobs in the world market.  Third, replacing the culture
of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.  And,
fourth, citizenship and community in 21st century America.
<P>
Now, today's topic is quality as defined by Dr. Edwards Deming.  But before
we get into talking about quality, I just want to take 30 seconds and ask
you, based on having read Drucker's "the Effective Executive," which, as
you remember, is one of the books I most emphasized buying and I'm frankly
encouraging every American citizen to buy, because I think it's the key to
being effective in the 21st century.  How many of you have found yourself,
from Drucker's work, keeping better track of your time?  Okay.  Those of
you who are doing that, how many of you found that it's actually helped
you?  Okay, almost all of you.  I raise this because everybody who's
watching, as well as the students in this class, ought to consider if you
haven't already read Drucker and you're not applying these ideas, you ought
to.  And if you have read Drucker and you've now been told by about 90% of
the people who are actually using it that keeping track of your time and
then thinking through how you use your time is actually effective may be
the key then for a lot of people who say they're too busy to keep track of
their time, is to keep track of their time so they can learn what they're
too busy doing.  And I think that's a very important part of this.
<P>
The -- let me say that today also, we are going to look at applying Quality
and Profound Knowledge to education.  This is something I want you all
during the class today to make notes to yourself.  I mean, the one thing
about virtually every American is they spend a lot of time asa student.
You've been in education.  And Dr. Minnix was reminding me last night that
we want you to literally, for the next two hours, just take notes. And then
we're going to spend a little bit of time at the very end of the class
saying, okay, based on what you've learned from Deming and based on the
concepts of Quality and Profound Knowledge, how would you change the
process of learning?  But in addition, we're going to ask you by next week
to tell us what three -- what are the three biggest changes you would make
in the way people learn based on what you're learning today about
knowledge?  And all of you are experts, and all of you have been in school,
all of you have spent the hours.  You certainly have plenty of expertise at
having studented and hopefully having learned, and so you ought to be in a
position to say, based on my years of experience, here's what I think we
ought to change based on what I've now heard about how Dr. Deming thought.
Okay?  So we're going to come back to that at the very end of the course.
<P>
For me, my introduction to Edwards Deming started with two people.  One was
Owen Roberts, who's a management consultant who actually -- a long-range
planner who actually was the person who helped invent this course.  And
many years ago, Owen Roberts told me that I had to study Dr. Deming, that
he was right.  And he gave me Dr. Deming's book, which is very hard to
read, and the truth is, I didn't pay as much attention.  I tried two or
three times, didn't get it, and I sort of backed off.  Then Roger Milliken
invited me to come to the Milliken company's annual leadership retreat.
They take their top 270 people and they go off for three days and they hide
and they talk about, where are we at today?  Where are we going?  There's
no hierarchy.
<P>
Now, Roger Milliken owns the Milliken company.  It's a family owned
company.  He's been president of it since 1948.  He's physically a big man,
taller than I am.  And he dominates the company.  And he has taken the
company through a revolution beginning in 1979, 1980, and literally changed
the entire structure of the company. And I found myself in meetings where
37-year-old sales managers would get up and say, "Mr.. Milliken, with all
due respect, you're just plain wrong.  "you do not understand what's
happening in marketplace, and we're in the marketplace, and we're telling
you that isn't right."  And I watched Milliken get up at one point and he
said, "I know I'm supposed to just be part of a team here, but can I say
something, too?"  And it was astonishing, because it was a sincere
partnering between the guy who literally owned the company and people who
were working.  Now, this is the most successful textile company in the
world.
<P>
And so I stopped and I said, what is it you guys are doing?  And they did
the red bead experiment, which we'll do, and every year as part of their
retreat they stop and they talk about Deming and they do the red bead
experiment to remind themselves to ground their behavior in Profound
Knowledge, which is Deming's term.  But what I found at the Milliken
company was that they had shared vision, they all had the same vision.
They had shared strategies.  They had open discussion.  Facts, not
opinions, dominated.  Everyone studied the basics.  Everyone counted.  And
they had an explosion of productivity.  When I say everyone counted and
everybody understood the basics, I meant Mr.. Milliken had to be studying
the same material he asked everybody else to study, and when I tell you
everybody counted, he wore a name tag and everybody else wore a name tag,
and he said, "you can't know 13,000 people. "but the newest janitor can
wear a name tag and the head of the company can wear a name tag, and there
is an immediate ability to read each other's name.  "and you can create a
dialogue that is more personal instantly."
<P>
And so they had a system where they had thought through how everybody could
play a major role.  Now, from that, I decided, look, this is such an
amazing change, and I listened to his key people tell us how they had change
d the company.  And after I left there, I had dinner with several of his
top people, and I talked to them about, what did you do?  How did you do
it?  And it literally was a revolution.  They took a system which had been
top-down and they redesigned the entire system, and it was very, very nerve
wracking, and the guy who was in charge of doing it went off and ran this
experiment, decided it worked, came into see Mr.. Milliken, outlined for
Mr.. Milliken and the top three deputies: this is the scale of the change
we've got to go through, and the senior guy said, "that's not the Milliken
way.  "we don't do things like that."  And he said Roger Milliken sat at
the end of the couch for about five minutes, and there was nothing said.
And he's thinking, okay, I can get a new job.  It's not a bad deal.  This
has been a great experience. And at the end of it, Milliken said, "you
know, he's right. "that's not the Milliken way, but it's going to be," and
they just changed the whole system.  Took them three years.
<P>
Now, in that framework, what I want to suggest to you is that part of what
happens and part of what Milliken does a lot of is let people do things for
which they are recognized.  They liberate people to achieve excellence.
They allow people to work beyond their job definition.  They give them a
level of responsibility and creativity which allows them then to be
participants in the continuous improvement of the company and to make
hundreds of little suggestions.  Because one of the things you're going to
discover out of this is that most of the time it's not the giant leap
forward that matters.  It's having specific little breakthroughs every day,
but having so many of them that the cumulative effect is a giant leap.  And
this leads to recognition.
<P>
In Japan, the leading award for being a company of quality is called the
Deming award after Edwards Deming.  In the U.S. It's called the Baldrige
award after the former secretary of commerce.  Now I want you to
understand, the reason -- one of the reasons we're focusing on Dr. Edwards
Deming today is this is a man whose impact on Japan was so profound, that
their top award for the highest quality Japanese company is the Deming
award.  In 1950 or '51, he was invited -- he'd been in Japan earlier as a
statistician.  He was invited back to talk to what he described as 80% of
the capital investment in Japanese manufacturing.  They had about 400
people in a room, and for three days he taught them.  Now, he later
developed that into a four-day, 10-hour-a-day course, and he taught it
until he died at 93 years of age.  We're going to give -- we're giving you
a very brief two-hour overview of what is truly an extraordinary system.
And he's left behind people who studied Dr. Deming and his work all over
the world.  But the reason for prizes, this is a very important first
point.  The prizes and awards and honors are signals to people of good
behavior.
<P>
And this is very important, because it's very different from normal
American behavior.  The trick is not to say, I think I will now do
something so I can win the prize.  The trick is to behave in such a way
that the prize is a signal to others to study how you behave.  Let me draw
a distinction.  One of the great dangers with the Baldrige award is that
people will try to get the Baldrige award so they can then run an ad
saying, this is how good we are.  That's a very misleading way, because
it's an external motivation.  It's a manipulative motivation.  The trick is
to say, I want to be the highest quality company in the United States
because that's the best way to serve my customers.  That's the way to stay
in business.  That's the way to create jobs.  And, oh, by the way, they
honored me by giving me the Baldrige award for being the best at what I do.
As distinct from, now, what gimmicks do I -and all of you think about
courses you've taken -- what gimmicks do I have to do so the Baldrige award
committee will give me the award so I can then run the ad?
<P>
Do all of you see the difference?  Huge difference in why you're doing these
things. Recognition for internally driven achievement is good.  Seeking
recognition for external motivation is bad.  Very big difference in what
you're doing.  Getting an "A" because you actually mastered physics is
good.  Getting an "A" because you conned the teacher into thinking you'd
met the requirements is bad.  And if you have an "A" driven system rather
than a physics driven system, you have truly broken the back of learning.
So just take that and think about what's gotten -- why we're having such
huge problems with education in America today.  Because people are
extrinsically motivated.
<P>
What do I need to do to get enough credits to get out?  I mean, how many of
you have friends who take college courses in order to get the credits so
they can get out?  Seriously, raise your hand.  How many of you know
somebody who takes courses in order to get the credits to get out, as
opposed to taking the course in order to learn the material?  So you've got
to rethink, why do you do things?  Let me also suggest the reason that I
focus on Deming and use up 10% of the course on this topic is that with a
-- I believe with a culture of quality, Americans can out-compete anyone in
the world.  And I believe that for three reasons, so you understand.  This
is not just Pollyanna, oh, gee, we're wonderful.  We can win.  One, we're a
continentwide nation.  We're huge physically.  I mean, only china and
Russia are comparable to us, and Australia are comparable to us, and I
guess brazil.  Everyone else is just smaller.  I mean, people talk about
competing with Japan.  Japan is the size of California, and about 80% of it
is mountains.  In the long run, Japan's not competitive in terms of just
sheer resources. Second, we are the most ethnically diverse society on the
planet.  I mean, if we ever get our act together and are truly organized,
you want to send a salesman to Nigeria who fits in?  Fine.  You want to
send a salesman to china who fits in?  Fine.  I mean, we are an
extraordinarily diverse society, so we bring more potential creativity from
more backgrounds than any other civilization in the world.  Third, because
we are an individual society where you are endowed by your creator with
individual liberty, we have a greater capacity to liberate energy, to
liberate creativity.  I mean, if you talk about the Deming model of
everybody playing a role, everybody helping, continuous improvement, there
is no other society on the planet that is as consistent about saying
everybody can play.
<P>
So we should in the information age easily be the dominant competitor on
the planet if we decide we have to have a civilization committed to Quality
and to Profound Knowledge.  I believe that quality can transform
government, and that we need to really think through, how do we apply this
-- these ideas across the system?  This is much deeper than simply
reinventing government, to use a current phrase. This is literally
rethinking from the ground up.  How would a customer-oriented system
behave?  How would you design it?  And you'll see by the end of these two
hours how different that is. I think quality can transform services.  It's
not just about manufacturing.  It's about any systemic -- systematic human
behavior, and so it's just as applicable to the newsroom or to an insurance
company as it is to making cars.  It's important to understand -- and this
is one of the great problems in dealing with a lot of consultants on this
topic -- that Quality and Profound Knowledge are not gimmicks or management
techniques.
<P>
You know, quality is not, you know, putting up a sign on the wall or hiring
somebody for a two-day course to teach you the five -the five habits of
quality.  Quality is very different.  Quality and Profound Knowledge are
essentially cultural, intellectual, personal.  It is a way of seeing
things, a way of doing things. It's a way of life.
<P>
Now, I spent about 60 hours with Dr. Deming over a three-year period.  And
it was like peeling -- unpeeling -- or peeling an onion.  I mean, I started
with his ideas as he would explain them, andthen I'd ask him a set of
questions. Then I'd go off and think about it.  Then I'd come back and ask
him more questions.  What I discovered was that Deming had a cultural world
view that represented America between 1910 and 1930, and it started with
levels of integrity and hard work and sincerity and decency that were
integral to American Civilization.  And that those were his assumptions.
They were working assumptions on which he then built his philosophy.  And
so you had to really listen carefully, because he's talking -when he talked
about quality, he was talking about a way of life.  He was not talking
about a gimmick.  A way literally of getting up each morning and how you
felt all day, how you thought about things all day.  Think of it this way,
we codify our beliefs and ways of doing things into processes, systems, and
structures, whether it's business, education, or society.  In other words,
how do you answer the telephone?  You know, are you friendly, are you
orderly, are you organized?  How do you deal with customers when they walk
in?  What are your habits?  How do you take phone messages?  Is it a habit,
or is it random pieces over paper scattered all over the house?
<P>
I mean, it's a very simple example, but think about it.  How do you decide
to learn how to cook something new?  Do you randomly experiment, or do you
have a cookbook?  And what you find is that the people who are really
effective consistently codify things.  They think through, what are my
habits?  What are my structures?  And all a large system is is a series of
structures and habits.  So we have a habit of building a car at the ford
motor plant.  We have a habit of how we do an appendectomy operation.  It
is this set of processes. So it's very important.  Do you all understand
what I'm trying to say here in terms of the notion it's not magic?  Every
time you encounter a set of behaviors, you can say, what are the habits and
systems and structures that that behavior is an example of?
<P>
How do TV people operate as compared to print people, for example?  Print
reporters type.  TV people talk into a camera. Very different ways of
presenting.  They need different quantities of information.  Print people,
the entire evening news is less than a full page of a newspaper.  So if I'm
a TV reporter, I need to know the right 40 seconds.  I mean, watch how
short the time is for a TV reporter to speak, and then say to yourself, I'm
going to spend all day, I'm going to be on the air one time, and I need 40
seconds.  How much do you have to know to do 40 seconds?  And then think
about the reporter who writes a very long article.  Look at the difference
in density and the habits that implies.  And so you go through and you ask
yourself, what are the -- what are the beliefs and ways of doing things
that we're codifying?
<P>
A good place to go look at a waffle house, which is a great little system.
I mean, they hire people, they train people, you suddenly have a short --
have you ever tried to imagine doing what that short order cook does?  Have
you ever just sat there at the counter and listened for a while as the
various waiters and waitresses yell the orders and it somehow all works?
Can you imagine yourself being, you know -- what is waffle house?  It is a
very highly organized set of habits and behaviors and systems.  And they
train people very quickly into learning how to do that.  And they do a very
good job.
<P>
Now, in that framework, three men have created the modern awareness of
quality, Dr. Deming, of course, and then Dr. Juran and Dr. Crosby.  Very
different people.  Very different people.  Deming and Juran -- Juran's
still alive, but he's also now in his late 80s.  Deming died a year ago,
and Crosby is much younger.  He's a generation younger.  Crosby was the
quality -- was the real popularizer.  He wrote a book called "Quality is
Free," which was a best seller and which basically argues that quality
actually lowers your costs and improves -- and it was Crosby's book which
led Milliken to Deming, because Deming -- Milliken said he read Crosby'sboo
k and Crosby says something like 20 to 30% of what you're doing is waste,
and if you can simply cut out the waste, you increase your profit by 20 to
30%, and since he owned the company, he stopped and said, wait a second.
This is an enormous amount of money.  Well, think about your own life.  If
you could literally combine Drucker and Deming and improve your daily
effectiveness 20 to 30%, how much would that over a year impact?
<PRE>
>> don't the market forces naturally force quality issue?

>> no.  Not if everybody's equally mediocre.  It's true.  I mean, we're
>>going to get to this in a minute, but it's true.  You can have an entire
>>-- I mean, look at a third world country.  They have a market.  But the
>>market force is a bowl of rice, not McDonald's.  Because quality is not
>>forced.  Quality's created. Now, the market then can discern quality.
>>The market can invent quality.  We're going to get to that in just a
>>minute, but it's a very big difference.  What the market will do is at a
>>given level of quality, I will choose the better over the worse, but it
>>will not raise the level of quality.  It takes leadership to raise
>>quality.

>> doesn't that encourage quality in itself?

>> yes, it does encourage it over time if you know how to think systemic,
>>if you grow up in a civilization which teaches you to think
>>systematically, but it doesn't encourage it over time if you don't.  And
>>you'll see this in just a minute.  I mean, again, imagine there were no
>>cookbooks and you said you went to the place that most -- that most
>>frequently actually cooked the egg, but since there were no cookbooks, it
>>was random.  You hire a cook and you say, cook the egg.  They haven't got
>>a clue what you're talking about.  Okay?  The first step is, this is the
>>recipe.  This is the stove.  This is how we wash the dishes.  And then
>>you begin to improve, and then ultimately you get to ray Kroc's invention
>>of McDonald's, which is one of the great breakthroughs of consumer
>>culture.  Or coca-cola, the invention of coca-cola in the late 1880s,
>>early 1890s.  But it took somebody to invent it.  Once it's invented,
>>quality drives out non-quality, but until it's invented and begins to be
>>the new accepted standard for the market, you stay at whatever level you
>>were at before.
</PRE>
Now, the thing that's fascinating to me about Profound Knowledge in
Deming's model is that it has deep American roots.  It has the work ethic,
basic honesty, basic decency, self-respect, and respect for others.  It has
teamwork.  Think of a wagon train, pragmatism, trying to achieve the aim,
and personal responsibility.  The only way you'd get all these if you --
and this was very striking to me and when we first designed the course.  I
see the entire personal responsibility two hours as coming, in a sense, out
of Deming's work, because Deming's assumption was you had to have personal
responsibility.  If you couldn't have personal responsibility, you couldn't
even begin. So that's one of the reasons we emphasize it so much in the
course.  That in his vision of America, the first thing you'd say to every
person on welfare is, what are you going to do about it?  The first thing
you'd say to every addict and alcoholic is, what are you going to do about
it?  Now, we'll help, but you tell us what you're going to do first.  And
so you start with this very deeply ingrained sense of personal
responsibility.
<P>
And again, I mention the wagon train because in a lot of critiques of
American Civilization, there's a tendency to overstate the lone cowboy,
which, by the way, is nonsense.  I mean, you almost never had lone cowboys.
You had herds which were herded by cowboys who operated as a team.  But if
you think about this whole notion of the lone gunfighter in the middle of
the street, that is an almost pathological vision of the 19th century.
There were very few loners.  There was tremendous individualism, but it was
individualism within groups, it was individualism within the wagon train,
individualism within the community, individualism within the group of
people herding the cows.  And you had very individualistic personalities,
but you had people who were very used to working as a team.
<P>
And it's very important to understand that.  It's individualism with a
capacity to then deliberately surrender your individuality to be part of a
team, knowing you can then leave the team and go back to being an
individual and that you'll form a new team.  But it's America as a sequence
of teams not America as this hegemonic individual who is totally isolated.
I mean, Jeremiah Johnson was a very rare person.  And he's the mountain
man.  There's a movie by -- with Robert Redford.  He's a real figure, but
he's very rare in the 19th century.  There are very few people who were
that alone, and the real model was the cavalry patrol, the wagon train, the
community, the small town.
<P>
Now, in this context, Deming, who was born in Indiana but raised in Cody,
Wyoming, born in 1900, is, I think, in many ways in his own life the
personification of those kind of core American values and core American
behaviors.  So what I'd like you to do for a minute is take a look at Dr.
W. Edwards Deming and his life.
<P><PRE>
>> it's been said that James Watt, with his development of the steam
>>engine, set the industrial revolution in motion.  Henry Ford advanced the
>>revolution to its second phase with his assembly line method of
>>production.  And some say that W. Edwards Deming created the third phase
>>of the industrial revolution, with a simple philosophy based on customer
>>satisfaction, continuous quality improvement, and a focus on the people
>>who make it work.

>> Donald Petersen: the one stipulation that Dr. Deming had was that, in
>>fact, I would be the one that would meet him, not someone down in the
>>organization.  And he explained that when we did get together, he
>>explained that to me by explaining how disappointed he was in his
>>inability to get the leaders in America back in the '40s and early '50s
>>to understand the importance of putting quality as the number one
>>priority in your business.

>> W. Edwards Deming: a manager is a leader.  Should be.  He understands
>>how he, his work, and the work of his people fit into the system for
>>optimization of the system.  That's the first job of a leader, to try to
>>find -- recognize that all people are different.  Try to fit each one
>>into what he can do best.  That he takes joy in doing, and help him to
>>improve.  He's coach and counsel, not judge.  Judge people, you shut
>>them -- you shut them up.  They don't talk.

>> I asked Dr. Deming why he felt American workers had not been turning out
>>quality products.

>> how could they?  All they ask is a chance to do a good job, to take
>>pride in their job, and to be proud of the company.  That's all they ask
>>for.

>> just hammering away as he does on the supreme importance of serving the
>>customer and then enriching the definition of what we mean by a customer.
>>It isn't just the ultimate customer, but everyone with whom we work.

>> customer doesn't know what he wants, he makes a choice.  He does not see
>>his future needs.  Customer's expectations are only what you and your
>>competitor have led him to expect.  He's a rapid learner, but he does not
>>foresee what he might need.  No customer asked for electric lights.  No
>>customer asked for photography.  No customer asked for a telephone or for
>>telegraph.

>> The best definition of what this concept is all about is the continually
>>and never-ending effort by the leadership and everyone else in an
>>organization to understand and meet and  exceed the needs of customers.
>>

>> anyone that has started to spend time with Dr. Deming and the basic
>>ideas, the importance of people and treating of people, it's almost like
>>the golden rule and some of the other things cast in a business context.
>>Why, it just came through to me that the principles were something I
>>strongly believed in and could easily make as my main statement as far as
>>what I wanted to stand for at the Ford motor company.

>> Now, let me summarize all that into three pieces for a second. Petersen,
>>whose book, by the way, "a better idea," is a tremendous introduction and
>>very helpful.  He is now retired. But Petersen describes in "a better
>>idea" what he did at Ford and how he did it.  And I found it very helpful
>>in understanding the development of quality across the board.  So that's
>>one.  Two, but notice, Deming starts at the top.  The President of the
>>United States, the CEO of a corporation, the president of a university.
>>If you don't have leadership -- this is not about all of us being equal.
>>It's about an orderly process in which everybody's equal before the law,
>>but in your organization, you get somebody -- there is a wagonmaster in
>>the wagon train.  The wagonmaster makes decisions.  There's a captain of
>>the ship.  So Deming would go to the wagonmaster or to captain of the
>>ship and say, would you like a quality wagon train?  Would you like a
>>quality ship?  And then they've got to be involved.
</PRE>
Second, notice the role of invention.  This is back to answering your
question.  In that sense, who did we see last week who was decisive in
creating consumer awareness?
<P><PRE>
>> Edison.

>> Edison.  I mean, take the list of what Edison invented, most of which
>>was not requested until it arrived.  Think of the rise of the fax or the
>>microwave oven or the cellular telephone. Third, notice Petersen's
>>reference to the golden rule.  In many ways, what Deming tries to do is
>>codify healthy behavior and simply say to people, treat everybody else
>>the way you wish you were treated.  Get everybody involved in the system.
>>Okay?  Now, I was -- one of the reasons I got very excited about this
>>and I was very interested in doing this is for many years, I represented
>>Hapeville, which has a Ford plant which is widely considered one of the
>>best plants in the world, in many ways considered equal to any plant.  I
>>think it ties one Toyota plants as one of the two best plants in world.
>>I watched it go through the transformation from the system it had been,
>>which was the classic industrial system, to a participative system in
>>which if people on the assembly line had a new idea, they would be flown
>>to Detroit to meet directly with the engineers.  And they would help
>>redesign how the company built cars.  And it was just -- you could see
>>the explosion of energy and the level of investment people were making in
>>their own jobs as they got excited.  Let's take just a minute to look at
>>the Ford plant at Hapeville.

>> the need for a change became evident when, in 1979, Japanese car makers
>>claimed a fifth of the American auto market.  Ford was losing $96 every
>>time it sold a car or truck in north America. Chrysler, near bankruptcy,
>>was losing more than $600 a vehicle. Only General Motors was making
>>money, more than $300 a sale.  By 1988, Ford was earning $591 a vehicle.
>>Chrysler was recovering, earning $288 a sale, but General Motors'
>>earnings had dropped to just $47 per car and truck sold in North America.
>>A harbor & associates report ranked the Ford plant in Atlanta as the
>>most efficient in the country, beating even the Japanese.  It
>>manufactures the sable, named one of "car and driver" magazine's 10 best,
>>as well as the Taurus, which is the number one selling American car,
>>second only to the Honda accord.  The harbor report credits Ford with
>>cutting labor costs, retooling plants, and encouraging cooperation
>>between labor and management.

>> the Taurus-sable was designed for ease of assembly, and it became that
>>way because we were involved.  I'm talking about the hourly work force in
>>this assembly plant was involved upstream of the design of that product,
>>and we designed it so it would be easy to assemble.

>> The key here, in part, is that people get integrated into the totality
>>of what they're doing and are then liberated to improve their own
>>contribution to getting it done.  So there's this constant process of
>>improvement in which everybody's a participant.  Now, by definition, if I
>>said to you, who's going to be smarter, a system in which 85,000 people
>>all get up every morning saying, "how do I improve my job?" Or a system
>>in which 84,500 people get up and say, "I'll go do my job,"and 500 will go
>>around trying to invent something?  Which was the old system. The old
>>system was, you do your job, we'll hire a consultant. The consultant will
>>come in and listen to you.  Then the consultant will tell me what they
>>think they heard you say.  Then I'll decide, although I don't do your
>>job, how to improve your job.  I'll tell the consultant, who will then
>>teach you.  I mean, isn't that exactly how it used to work?  Okay.
</PRE>
What Deming is doing is liberating everybody to improve their own
performance in a context of understanding the larger system that they're
part of.  Now, it's very important to understand, Deming is not teaching a
technique.  I cannot drive this home too hard.  Deming is teaching a way of
being.  You have to discipline yourself. Again, it's like learning how to
cook.  Let's say you get up in the morning, you said, I want to boil eggs
today, but I'm so sick and tired of putting water in the pot.  Today I'm
just going to put the egg in the pot.  To heck with the water.  I mean,
that's literally what -- that's how people manage.  I really ought to do
what Drucker says about keeping my schedule, but it's so hard, I don't have
time today to figure out how I'm spending my time, which when you think
about it is about as dumb as not putting water in the pot.  So learning new
habits, learning new approaches, is a way of redisciplining yourself.  But
it's redisciplining yourself not into what I do on the job, but into a way
of being.
<P>
I think there are six core principles.  This is my abstraction of 40 hours
of Deming.  So the first is that -- and we're going to go back over these a
couple times -- the consumer, not the bureaucracy, defines value.  The
producer invents value. To improve future results, you must improve the
process.  People have intrinsic motivation.  They want to do a good job.
Every person, process, and system is part of an interdependent larger
system.  And continual learning is the basis for continual improvement.
<P>
Now, we're going to come back to all six of these, but I want you to first
of all understand the key part of this, which is thinking about the concept
of what it is you're doing. And where we went wrong, I think, was in the
early '20s with a guy who was the leading inventor of management techniques
in the industrial era, Taylor.  Taylorism was a term.  Taylor studied what
Ford did at General Motors -- I mean, at Ford motor company. And Ford
suboptimized things.  He broke it down so you put on the wheel, he put on
the bolt, you put on the tire.  And so Taylorism was, how do we break
things down into very tiny bites?  And the ultimate model was the pyramid.
<P>

Okay?  Now, there's a problem with this.  This is the person at the top.
This person has power.  This is the person on the assembly line.  This
person has no power.  Who does this person report to?  They report upward
to a person who's their supervisor, who reports to the line manager, who
reports to the plant manager, who reports to the regional vice-president,
who reports to the vice-president of production, and so forth, right?  This
is the customer.  Look how hard it is for the customer to say, "what they
did yesterday to my car doesn't work very well," and notice this person
doesn't care.  If the customer's here saying to them, "boy, was that a dumb
way to put the car on," they go, "yes, but that's what the person above me
told me to do."
<P>
Now, who am I going to obey, the customer or -- the Deming model's much
simpler.  The customer is, in a sense, able to communicate with all these
for the following reason.  And I'll give you a couple of quick examples.
And this is one Dr. Deming used directly.  He said, you're going to wash
off a table. This is your job, is to wash off a table.  So I'd say to you,
wash off the table.  Okay?  What do you do to wash off a table? Anyone?
<P><PRE>
>> you take the rag.

>> take a rag.

>> put it under the sink and get it wet

>> put it under the sink.

>> put soap on it.


>> put soap on it.

>> go over to the table and wipe several times, knocking the dirt off on the floor or into the hand, and then you go and rinse the rag out and wipe the table off.

>> okay.  Is the table now wiped off?

>> should be.

>> does everybody agree the table's now wiped off?

>> I'll bet it's not, though.

>> no, no, no, it is wiped off.  That's not -- don't be overly suspicious
>>here.  Table's wiped off.  How many of you agree the table's wiped off?
>>Okay.  First question, you're part of a larger system.  What's the first
>>question?  I say to you, wipe off the table.  What's the first question?
>>

>> how do I do it?

>> no.

>> which table?

>> no, which table.  Why is that important?

>> got to know what you're doing.

>> so I'll tell you, it's a white table made of metal sitting in the middle
>>of a room.  It's the only table in the room.

>> which room?

>> operating table.

>> why should it be wiped off?

>> okay.

>> operating table.

>> Why should it be wiped off?  Now, if it's a -- if it's a process, see,
>>what I'm trying to draw for you here is the difference between a flow
>>chart and a pyramid.  In a pyramid, the person above you said, wipe off
>>the table.  You said, fine, I wiped off the table.  They forgot to tell
>>you it's an operating table, so the patient got sepsis and died.  It's
>>not your fault. It's not your fault.  You did exactly what the person
>>above you told you.  In a flow chart, no matter where you are in the
>>chart, what you need to know is: what is the end product?  Why are we
>>doing it?  Who is relying on me?  And who am I serving?  Because if you
>>don't have an integrated -- if you don't understand the system you're
>>part of, how can you know what your doing?  Which means, guess what?  You
>>have to hire people who are told, ask questions.
</PRE>
Notice how different this is.  Here the answer is, take orders.  Now, you
come in and you say, well, we could wipe the table off with that stuff
you're using, but, you know, I noticed recently that there's a brand new
antiseptic that's dramatically more powerful.  Whose job is it to know
that? Anybody in the organization.  Anybody in the organization is allowed
to say, I read this article yesterday.  I think we can improve this.
Because they're all equal in the flow chart. They're all necessary.  Give
you a good example.  If you fly on airplanes, you may think the pilot
matters.  And they do.  It's good to have pilots.  It's good to have pilots
who take off and land safely.  It's good to have pilots who know what
airport they're going to.  It's also good to have mechanics so that the
engine doesn't fall off.  Because even with a good pilot, if the engine
falls off, it is bad, okay?  But in a sense, it's funny. The first hearing
I attended as a freshman in congress was on a DC-10 which crashed because
the bolt broke and the engine fell off on takeoff, and it crashed and
killed 400 -- 300 people. Chicago.  Okay?  And it turned out the way they
were putting the bolt on was wrong and was causing stress and metal
fatigue.  They had to change the way they put on every engine in every
DC-10 in the world.
<P>
Okay?  So it's only when you start realizing that in a modern system, every
person matters.  If they don't matter, why are they there?  It's a key test
of how you downsize government.  if your job isn't so important you have to
do it brilliantly, why are we keeping you?  And if it's so important that
you have to do it brilliantly, how do we train you and empower you and
strengthen you so that you can be brilliant?  Every person has the
potential to be brilliant if they're put in an environment of adequate
support.  But notice how different that is from this system.  I am the
important person.  You are the unimportant person.  So I am the chief pilot
flying to London.  I get paid lots of money.  You are a lowly mechanic.
Who failed to put enough gasoline in, or jet fuel.  I am now near Iceland.
We are running out of fuel.  I am a less important pilot than I thought I
was.
<P>
Okay?  Now, the trick here is to understand that key words explain Deming,
but that you have to then say to yourself, why is each word key and how --
because it has to permeate your life.  So that you -- each of these habits,
each of these patterns, becomes part of you.  For example, a process is a
repetitive series of actions or causes that create some output. I dial the
telephone or I type on my computer.  Or I write out checks once a month.  A
repetitive series of actions or causes that create some output.  A system
is a network of processes.  I do habit "a," then I do habit "b," then I do
habit "c," and they all connect with each other.  Your car, in a sense, is
a system. Its wheels, its hydraulics, its steering mechanisms, its engine,
its gas tank, and all these various things fit together into a system.
Common causes of variation are present all the time and affect every time
you -- "trial" may confuse you.  But if you're trying things out, every
time you do something, it is affected by a common cause.
<P>
If you try to drive into Atlanta between 8:00 and 9:00 every morning during
the week, you will have a similar experience.  It's called a traffic jam.
Okay?  Very important just as an example of common cause, okay?  If you
arrive at the 24-hour grocery store early enough each morning, you will get
there before the newspapers are delivered and be frustrated. There's a
common cause here.  The correct answer is not to arrive at 5:00 and wait
patiently till the papers get there at 6:00. The answer is to figure out,
what time does the paper get there? You see -- it's very important.  The
reason it's important is special causes are not present all the time and
will only affect some subset of trials.  For example, when we have an ice
storm, the papers arrive later.  Now, when you have a flat tire, even
though you're driving into Atlanta on a Sunday and there is no traffic jam,
you will be stopped on the way in.  That's a special cause.  The reason
this is important, and this to me was the moment -- this was for me what
Roger Milliken's 25% savings was to him.  Because I saw this at the
Milliken presentation, and they made the following point, which is
devastating.
<P>
And I want you to think through carefully.  94% of all improvement is from
focus on common causes.  6% of all improvement is from focus on special
causes.  Guess which one managers focus on?  Because they take for granted
common causes.  Common causes are so common, how could you think about
changing them?  Yet it is the change in the common cause which is the
explosive improvement.  It's a very important, key part of this whole
thing, is to understand you have to say to yourself, you know -- I'll give
you an example.  I work at losing weight.  Except when I eat ice cream.  So
I can tell you by measuring calories that I do a terrific job of losing
weight most days.  Now, I have an occasional day when there's a little
blip.  That day occurs as often as once or twice a week.  Can you identify
with these kind of examples?
<P>
Now, I have discovered -- my older daughter found a fabulous diet which
absolutely works.  And I'm now on it, and I've lost one notch in my belt,
and it's a great diet.  And you eat fruit up until lunch, you eat
vegetables for lunch, and you can eat vegetables and one other thing in the
evening.  Like, you can have vegetables and meat, or vegetables and bread,
or vegetables and potatoes, but -- so I got on this thing because it
absolutely worked for her amazingly, and she eats all she wants.  It turns
out, you can eat an amazing quantity of fruit before lunch and it doesn't
matter, because all the fruit you could eat all day is less than one good
bowl of ice cream.  Now, eventually I figured out -- it took me about a
week to figure out, well, I'm happy doing this.  And we all think it's
funny in my family.  What I'm doing is just applied common sense, and I've
eliminated the common cause problem of ice cream and beer.
<P>
Okay?  Now, I'm trying to bring you back to notice, what people tend to do
is they take for granted all of the normal things they do, and then they
look for the one special gimmick.  Okay?  Common cause improvements come
from changing the system or process.  So you have to think through, what is
our system?  What are we trying to get done?  What do we do routinely which
if I could get a 10% improvement, because it would be 10% improvement
routinely, it would be big?  When you focus too much on special causes, you
actually disrupt the system and make things worse.  Now, because people
will say, oh, let's really focus on that flat tire.  Boy, we'll really make
sure we don't ever have a flat tire again.
<P>
That's not what's causing you a problem.  What's causing you a problem is
you insist on trying to get into Atlanta at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.
If you went into Atlanta at 7:00 o'clock in the morning or 9:00 o'clock in
the morning, you could get in very quickly.  You can't get in at 8:00
o'clock in the morning even if your tires don't go flat.  Now, to identify
a common cause, however, you must have a theory, a prediction, a standard,
and a goal.  This is absolutely critical.
<P>
Deming is actually, in a weird kind of way, very intellectual and then very
psychological and personal simultaneously.  First of all, you have to have
a theory.  A theory is our understanding or hypothesis of how things work.
Remember the egg?  If you have a theory that says water, pot, heat, egg,
that's a hypothesis.  "I believe I can cook an egg if I put it in water and
put the water on heat."  Now you can test the theory out.  Don't put the
heat on.  Put the egg on and put the heat on without the water.  It's very
important.  If you take every job in the world, it gets to be as simple as
that if you think it through.  What's your theory of the job?  Second,
theories let us predict what will happen. Why do you think that's going to
turn into a boiled egg?  Because you have a theory.  "it's my theory that
this is how we boil eggs."  Well, tell me about the job you're now doing.
What's your theory of how you'll do this job?  A standard conveys the level
of acceptable behavior.  I want all of my eggs to be soft-boiled.
Therefore, I should not cook them 12 minutes.  That sounds obvious.  It is
not obvious.  You'd be astonished how many people have no theory of the job
they're doing and no standard for the job they're doing.  They do what's
acceptable.  Yet every job being done in America today is susceptible to a
theory and a standard.  The goal is the desired outcome.
<P>
Why are you doing this?  Remember I asked you about wiping the table.
First question should have been, why am I wiping it?  What is the desired
outcome?  And if I said, it is so we can eat off of it, that's one level.
What if I'd said it was, frankly, to be able to make clay pots?  Think of
the difference between cleaning a table off to make a clay pot from
cleaning a table off to eat on it to cleaning a table off to do surgery.
The term "wipe off the table," unless you know why you're doing it, doesn't
make sense. And by the way, look at the theoretical model behind killing
germs, which lays at the base of why you use antiseptic to clean off the
surgery table.
<P>
There's a whole set of theories in your head that you don't make clear to
yourself that you just accept as common knowledge.  Now, if you have the
desired outcome, you know the standard you want to work at, you have a
theory of how it's going to work, we just described management.  Management
is prediction, and prediction is based on theory, an understanding of how
things work.  I believe we will make 85,000 cars at Hapeville this year.
We will do it in the following manner using the following processes.
That's a projection.  That's a theory. And great managers spend every day
immersed in the theory of how things will work and then studying why the
theory and reality didn't match.  To summarize for a second.  Now, this is
very -it's surprised, both very common sense and very intellectual. There
is no learning without prediction.  You must compare results to prediction
to then revise and extend the theory to have a reason to change the process
and behavior.
<P>
So every time you start to do something, what is your goal?  What is the
standard forthat goal?  What is the system you're involved in to achieve
that goal?  What's your theory of how you will achieve that goal?  What
common processes will you use and what common things will be involved?  And
then you begin to put it together so that it becomes a habit, a routine way
of doing things.  And then you internalize that into yourself much like
Drucker.  Just as Drucker says, you know, to keep track of your time, ask
of every problem, what is it a symptom of, so you're solving the deeper
problem.  Learn how to manage strengths, focus on the customer.  Always
focus outside your organization.  Be driven by the need to have results
outside your organization.
<P>
Similarly, Deming is saying, when you get up in the morning, what's your
goal?  What is your theory of that goal?  What standard is necessary to
meet that goal?  What are the common causes that affect that -- getting to
that goal?  And if you get every person in your organization doing that
simultaneously, the level of human talent you bring to bear -- I mean,
people -- you know, why did we run the House of Representatives amazingly
well the opening month?  Because we had 230 members and about 500 staff,
and we gave all of them responsibility.  So everybody could play. Again,
think about it this way.
<P>
And this is the essence of the American model, by the way.  It's the reason
Sloan ultimately beat Ford.  Henry Ford was a genius.  Sloan was not a
genius. Sloan was a very smart organizer of people.  But Sloan figured out,
if I get enough smart people, we will collectively outthink one person,
even if that person's a genius.  This is also the American way of war.  No
one of us can necessarily beat the best professional military in the world.
On the other hand, we can bring so many people to bear with so much common
sense that the collective team is so amazing, so that we delegate down to
lieutenants decisions some countries would keep at generals.  We tell our
sergeants to make inventions some countries would allow colonels to make.
So the total intelligence we bring to bear, the total number of people able
to think about a problem, is enormous.
<P>
And every time we do this as a country, every time we find a way to engage
everybody, we drown problems and talent. And every time we go back to this
model, which is the bureaucratic welfare state, it's the old manufacturing
model, it's the old military model, you look at "Desert Storm."  "Desert
Storm" is this.  Very enormous delegation.  Look at the old model.  Not
very much delegation.  This was -- this was what we tried to do in Vietnam.
We did not do this in world war ii. World war ii was like this.  Very
decentralized.  Okay?  Any quick questions?  We have time probably for one
question, two questions.
<PRE>
>> is that the same as Hill's mastermind theory?

>> I don't know.  In the sense -- no.  I think hill's closer to this.  Now,
>>in terms of breakthroughs for inventors, you want this.  I mean, the
>>geniuses do this, but in a smart system, you start with the genius and
>>you immediately give the information to everybody.  In a bad system, you
>>have no geniuses, or you have a genius, but they get to keep the magic.
>>It's not how it works in a good -- in -- so Edison invents the
>>phonograph, everybody gets it.  Okay?  We will take a brief break and
>>then we'll pick up with the red bead experiment.

(break)

>> Now, what we're going to do now is, in some ways, the most famous thing
>>that Dr. Deming did, and that is the red bead experiment.  In order to do
>>it correctly, we're going to need several willing workers.  We've already
>>got Justin, who's agreed to be our computer person.  He is going to run
>>averages.  The way this experiment works is this is a factory.  This
>>factory produces materials for people for our customers.  Our customers
>>want only white beads.  This is our machine, this plus a person. This
>>machine goes in, you bring it out at a 45-degree angle, and your job is
>>to produce only white beads.  Every red bead is a defect, okay?  Now,
>>we're going to run this factory on a traditional Taylor-oriented, top-down,
>>"boss tells employee what to do" model, but with all the modern gimmicks.
>>So we're going to have motivational process inside the pyramid, okay?
>>What we need now is we need five volunteers.  We need one volunteer who
>>will be our recorder.  Their job is to track whether or not the workers
>>are doing their job or whether they should be fired and replaced with
>>other workers.  Then we need four workers who are willing to come up and
>>perform to the top standards necessary to stay in business in a
>>competitive world market.
</pre>
Okay?  So who would like to be the willing workers?  One, two, three, four.
You four come up.  Now, who would like to be the recorder? You're now the
recorder.  You can come over here.  Okay, the recorder's job is to use this
-- can you write clearly?<p>
<pre>
>> sure.

>> Now, your job is to be over there and to mark that.  You four come over
>>and stand right behind me here.  For television purposes, we want to keep
>>that clear.  And Dr. Barbara Lawton, who, as I said, is my coach, is
>>going to pretend she's a student, because she's going to do a part we
>>couldn't figure out how to teach anybody in a short time.  Come on over.
>>She's going to record and tell us what our predictions should be, okay?
>>And if I get it too far wrong, she will promptly break in and tell me.
>>Now, your job -- because you're all willing workers, right?  You applied
>>for the job.  You want the job.  And you understand that your career and
>>your future is a function of doing this.


>> what's it pay?

>> pays a lot.  Pays more than you were earning sitting in this class a
>>minute ago.

>> okay.

>> okay.  And it's the only job in town, so it's a big deal. Okay, now,
>>your job is to reach in here and to pull out the scoop, filling up every
>>one of the things, and having only white beads.  What we're going to do
>>is allow each of you to do it once, and she will record, okay, so you're
>>one, two, three, and four.  Okay, what's your first name?

>> Winston.

>> Winston is going to be number -- no, no, put it over there on the line --

>> right here.

>> that's right, yes.

>> Winston.

>> good, Winston.  And your name is?

>> Bob.

>> okay, now --

>> Bob?

>> Stephanie.

>> Stephanie.  So we've now identified them, so this will be a test of
>>their competence.  And on national television, they will now --

>> Mai.

>> Mai?

>> We will now learn whether or not they are not just willing workers, but
>>they're our model of good quality-oriented workers, right?

>> absolutely.

>> okay, Winston, go for it.  This is your job.  Okay, all right, whoa.
>>Now, first of all --

>> got an empty slot.

>> First of all, Winston has an empty slot, so we know that he's not very
>>competent.  Second, he has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
>>eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 -- 15 red beads.  This is not good, okay?

>> what can I say?  I'm in food service.  What can I say?

>> Bob will now hopefully do a decent job.  Oh, Bob just cheated. Bob just
>>cheated.  Bob has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
>>red beads, but we also have to mark -- mark after it, just put a little
>>"c" after the "9" so we can remember that he cheated.  Okay.  Stephanie
>>will now hopefully -- this is a chance now for Stephanie to prove --
>>okay.

>> all right.

>> three, six, she got nine, too.  Now, she and bob are clearly superior to
>>Winston.

>> thanks.

>> go, Mai.

>> all right, now, Mai  has -- she has the largest number of vacancies, two
>>vacant.  Then she has two, four, six, eight, 10, 12 -- do we count the
>>vacancies as red beads?

>> why not.

>> okay, so they count to 14.  She has 14.  If you don't get one, that
>>counts the same as getting a red bead, which actually means Winston's at
>>16.

>> yeah.

>> and plus he should be penalized for cheating.

>> I didn't cheat.

>> no, he didn't cheat.  Bob cheated.  He was sincere, but incompetent.

>> my heritage, that's what counts.

>> all right, now, this means -- by the way, what's the total? Where's the
>>computer?  Justin, what's the total of those five -four?

>> 48.

>> 48.  You've got to do the computer faster.  What's the average, then,
>>since there are four of them?  Anybody want to do that without a
>>computer?  12, right.  So total 48, 12 average. Okay, now --

>> if I get fired from my job, I'm going to really leave.

>> okay, Dr. Lawton, do you want to tell us anything about where we're at
>>now for predictive purposes?

>> let's keep on going.

>> okay.  All right, now we're going to go to day two, but let's recognize
>>here, first of all, that we had nobody who was actually very good.

>> wait a minute.

>> I feel real bad.

>> we had two people who at least seemed to be trying, bob who cheated and
>>Stephanie, so I would say Stephanie's clearly the best worker, because
>>she tied bob but she didn't cheat.  Okay. Winston is close to pathetic,
>>but we don't want to make him feel too bad.

>> but there's no --

>> but -- what?

>> there's no way for them to do it right --

>> You're not allowed to talk.  You're supposed to -- see, each person --
>>in a pyramid, each person has their job.  Your job is not to be part of
>>this except to write.  Now, the problem we've got, in a good modern
>>management hierarchy with a pyramid, having brought in our consultant, we
>>would say,  let's put Winston on probation.  Recognize that Stephanie
>>seems to be doing pretty good.  But we also have to recognize that we're
>>in the world market, competition is tough.  We need to do better.  Now,
>>we're going to start by creating zero defect day.  We're going to say, we
>>should do better.  We want everybody to do better.  We want to raise
>>morale.  Do I put these up now?  You can help do this.

>> okay.

>> put one of these up.  "quality is our name."

>> where do you want it?

>> on the wall.  And, Mai, you can help.  "zero defects now." And in
>>addition, in order to build morale and let people understand that we are
>>committed to quality, right, we're going to give each of them -- here you
>>are.

>> thank you.

>> they're very -- and I put yours on you because I wasn't sure you could
>>find it, okay?  You are, after all, on probation at this stage.  And
>>here, you may have one too for helping.  Okay, now we have -- this is the
>>big motivational moment.  We've had quality rally, we've had quality day.
>>We have our quality signs. And everyone is committed.  "I'm a quality
>>worker," right?

>> yes.

>> all right.


>> absolutely.

>> Winston, since you're a quality worker and on probation, go for it.

>> Winston said he wanted a break.


>> can I put the beads on there?

>> no, no.  Scoop.

>> you're not allowed to do that.

>> okay.  Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16.

>> Ooh!!

>> Winston has tied his all-time record for incompetence.  You have to at
>>this point wonder if this guy's just not going to get it, right?  All
>>right, bob.  Bob.  Well, bob, now that we're monitoring so he doesn't
>>cheat, two, four, six, eight.

>> one just fell out.

>> nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 -- 22, setting a -- making
>>Winston look good.  Now, Stephanie's at 10. Continuing, although she's
>>decaying, she's nonetheless not doing as badly as bob.  Okay.

>> she's learning from my mistakes.

>> all right, Mai, go for it.  This is your moment.

>> I don't really feel so bad anymore.

>> 19.  Now, this is bad.  What's the total?  Huh?

>> 67.

>> and what's the average?  16.75.

>> now, we have to really look at this for a second.

>> we're getting tired.

>> we're motivating the workers, we've talked about quality, we've brought
>>in a quality consultant, we've had a quality rally. It's worse, right?
>>Okay.  This is -- let me be straight about this, now.  This is the last
>>day for two of you.

>> all right!

>> and you have to say right now, theory and prediction, that bob and
>>Winston, although actually Mai's now worse than Winston by one.

>> that's right.

>> only Stephanie seems to have learned how to do the job.  And if we were
>>a normal company, wewould now be honoring Stephanie, because she seems to
>>have done the best job so far.  Okay, now, go for it.  This is your
>>moment.

>> all right, Winston.

>> all right, all right, all right.

>> no, no.

>> I'm just mixing them up.

>> Ahhh, look at that!

>>	11.  Which for bob is a miracle.

>> mix them, mix them.  The key is to mix.

>> for Winston.  Bob.  Dramatic improvement over his two previous days of
>>failure.  He's almost up to being average.

>> Ooh!

>>	11.  Tied.

>> no, wait a minute.  Gosh, okay.

>> counting is good.  Okay.  But Stephanie's up to now always been better.
>>So let's see if Stephanie's now going to have the big improvement.

>> Ooh!

>> six?

>> no, seven because she missed one, seven.  Notice Stephanie continues to
>>improve.  This is Mai's moment, and Mai has lots of pressure now.

>> two, four, six -- 17.  Now, if you add across, okay -- so the team has
>>done better, but remember, the two weakest people now have to go and be
>>fired.  So if you add across --

>> this day or overall?

>> of the three days, total.

>> no, no, no, don't write that in there.  That's the fourth day. Just
>>write it up here.

>> 43, 22, 32, 41 --

>> no, 33.  It's 42.


>> well, you just asked me to write.  You didn't ask me to --

>>	46.

>> check her.


>> stop it.

>> 50, 50.  Well, so Mai is gone.  Does everybody agree?  Mai failed.  Okay.

>> she was admirable.

>> and bob is gone.  Right?

>> and bob's gone.

>> bob's gone.  The big 22 killed you.  It's gone.

>> I want a hearing.

>> no, you're gone.  You can try to file an EEOC complaint later, but not
>>during the class.  Okay?  Now, okay.  Now, each of you -they go twice?
>>Okay.  So, Winston, you get to go and we'll add you up under Winston and
>>bob.  You get to go twice.  You're very destructive.  Okay.

>> Ooh!

>> Uh-oh, two blanks.

>>	12.  Do it again.  Go again.

>> Uh-oh.  Shut up.

>>	21.

>> notice, by the way, how the scorekeeper, who's not performing -- not
>>participating, gets a certain thrill out of his failure? Just think about
>>this again in terms of hierarchies.

>> is this sick or what?

>> nine.

>> nine.  Now, clearly, clearly Stephanie is the person who has best
>>understood this.

>> watch them be all empty.

>>	10.

>>	10.  Okay.  So he did 33, she did 19.  But look how bad the day was.
>>Okay.  So as our consultant, what do you want to teach us now?  Do you
>>want them to stay up here so they can learn  that --

>> if you look at this, this would be essentially a stable process, and
>>here is where Newt laid off the two worst people.

>> all right, you need to.

>> come over and stand -- does she need the hand mic or what?

>> this is innovation.  I think you guys didn't think through this part of
>>the process.  Go for it.

>> this is called --

>> is that picking it up?

>> There's only common cause variation inside the system.  So the system is
>>stable, and therefore predictable.  And so what we have is that with all
>>of these people, you can say if this process doesn't change, then you
>>would expect the same thing to happen in the future as has happened in
>>the past.  Because this is a stable system, there's only common causes
>>present, you have predictable performance, and the only way to change the
>>performance is to change the underlying process.  When we got rid of the
>>two worst workers, nothing really changed.  The system continued to work
>>exactly the way it was before.  It's a process problem.  It requires
>>process improvement, and it had nothing to do with the motivational
>>techniques or actually laying off the two worst workers.

>> get rid of all those reds.

>> eliminate the red beads coming in.

>> Ah, yes, okay.  Why don't y'all go ahead and sit down.  You may keep
>>those as a memento of this moment of excitement.  Notice here a couple
>>things.  First of all, how did -- how did you all feel as you went
>>through this?

>> we had no control over it, really, I mean, so --

>> all right.  In fact, what is -- what is really to be attributed to your performance?

>> I filled up the holes.

>> and what else?

>> sheer luck.

>> luck, right, pure luck.  Very important.  Because how much of what we
>>think we are managing in a normal system is, in fact, not theoretical,
>>not systematic, it's just pure luck?  Okay. Secondly, how did the rest of
>>you feel?  I mean, those of you who were working, what was your reaction?
>>Bob what was your reaction?

>> I thought I had a career, and, I mean, it really wasn't that easy to do,
>>but she had good leadership.

>> bob, what was -- Winston, what was your reaction to not making it?

>> well, it was sheer luck, absolute sheer luck.

>> it's frustrating when you know what the problem is, but you don't know
>>how to change it.

>> now, why did you get -- why did you think it was funny that they were --

>> well, because you made me shut up, but right from the get-go, I knew
>>that as long as you've got red beads in there, they're going to be
>>pulling out red beads and somebody's going to lose.

>> right, so guess what?  On a traditional assembly line, what does the
>>traditional average worker know?

>> that there's going to be defects and there's nothing they can do about it.

>> right.  That they are, in fact, going to be part of a system over which
>>they have no control, and, in fact, if the vice-president for purchasing
>>takes the cheapest contract from the worst supplier, their performance is
>>going to go down. Right?

>> right.

>> Which leads them then to react exactly as you were reacting, which was
>>to be cynical, and instead of building a team, to say, well, that
>>person's gone.  Which both leads you to be frightened and therefore more
>>withdrawn and therefore more cynical, which is, guess what?  The typical
>>reaction of the classic 1930 blue collar industry.  Which defines a lot
>>of modern labor relations. Because the boss who didn't have to do this,
>>the guy who made his bonus this year by buying the cheap parts because he
>>lowered the cost of parts so he looks great, but he's ruined our career
>>because he wasn't measured as part of a system.  He was suboptimized, so
>>he measured purchasing, but if purchasing got you lousy parts, you know
>>-- if he had bought only white beads, he would have paid 8% more, and
>>this would have been a piece of cake.  So he's saved 8% and made our job
>>impossible.
</pre>
Secondly, the guy who's in charge of production was -- went to work 40
years ago when this was the only device available, so he loves this device.
It makes him feel secure.  There's a new device which will only select out
white beads, but it's different.  And so he he's no longer on the line, so
he doesn't feel the pain of your failure, so he doesn't buy the new device
because he doesn't get it.  Do you begin to see how this fits together into
a pattern?  You're part of a system.  This, this, the quality of the beads,
the instructions.  I mean, we could have said,  reach in here, use your
hand, get up only white beads, and fill this. Which would be a process
change.  But do you see the pattern?  So there's lots of way to solve it,
but to solve it, you have to recognize you're part of a process, and you
have to understand how you fit together so that in the original Deming
model, this being -- remember, this is the organizational structure.
You're down here under manufacturing right here.  Over here is purchasing.
Here's advertising, and here's direct sales.
<P>
So advertising is saying,  we're going to offer only white beads. You keep
telling them, no, no, offer 90% white beads.  They're saying, we can't
offer 90% white beads, because you can't compete in the world market with
only 90%.  Purchasing's going, we've got to keep our costs low.  Let's buy
the cheapest possible supplier. You're then forced to manufacture with an
obsolete process you are not allowed to improve.  Then the sales force goes
out and offers 90% white beads, which is what you told them is the most you
could do in the current system.  But the customer sees the ad for 100%,
looks at the lot they just got, which is 90%, and goes to the head of the
corporation and wants to know of these four guys, why are you failing?
Now, the Deming model is radically different.
<P><pre>
>> on that model, on the previous model on the classic hierarchy, shouldn't
>>the guy at the top be responsible for looking at all this?

>> The guy at the top should be responsible for setting the vision and
>>general strategies and defining a culture of the system which allows
>>every person to participate in going in the direction of the common
>>vision.  But can't possibly, in fact, know these things.  It's too big a
>>system.  Okay?  No surgeon can clean an operating room as well as the
>>best person they hire who's done it for 20 years and really cares about
>>their job.  And if the surgeon starts trying to micromanage the janitor
>>who's cleaning the room, you're going to kill people.  Okay?  So you want
>>every person to do brilliantly their job and to redesign and own their
>>job within the general vision set by the person in charge.  This person's
>>job is to, first of all, focus on the customer, focus on the inventions
>>of the future.
</pre>
They just invented the phonograph or the movie or whatever it was Edison
was doing.  How does this change our world?  How does it change our
product?  Our customers are changing.  Alfred Sloan went out once a quarter
and spent one week as a salesman on a lot.  Head of the largest industrial
corporation in the world sold cars one week every quarter.  Why?  Because
he wanted to know what questions the customers were asking because he
wanted to have a real finger -- "spitzen  gefuhl" is the German  phrase
-fingertips,  he wanted to know what  was happening in the marketplace at a
better level than his pollsters could tell him. Okay?  Remember Drucker's
point.  You're always looking for the change in the pattern.  You want to
know, what are they doing that's different?  What's happening out there
that's unusual?
<P>
Now, Deming's point is that you first have to have an aim, and you've got
to develop really thinking through that aim, you do consumer research, you
design and redesign, you receive and test materials coming in.  How many
red beads are there in our raw material?  You then talk to the suppliers,
because you ideally want to get a supplier who's going through the same
process you are, and you say to the supplier, we want you to be our
supplier. How can we work together so you won't produce any red beads?
Which means you suddenly, instead of just looking for the cheapest
supplier, you begin to build a relationship where they've got to know what
you're doing.  So you call the office -you call the supply company and say,
no, no, we're not doing restaurants.  We're doing operating rooms.  We need
to buy from you appropriate things for an operating room, not appropriate
things for a table in a restaurant.  Then you produce, assemble, and
inspect, and you test all these things constantly, and then it gets to the
consumer and it comes back around, but it's a constant process, and you
need to be thinking all the time about the totality of the process.
<p>
Okay?  Now -- and this is something you can do anywhere -- I mean, you all
can do this.  This is not a hard experiment to set up, and it's very
useful, because it's only when you get people into doing it for a while.
And again, Deming took 40 hours, 10 hours a day for four days, to immerse
people in what I'm giving you a hint of.  You're only getting a hint today.
Because you really have to be able to feel this and get the rhythm of
this.  And think about how isolated you feel. And then ask yourself about a
typical government worker or a typical schoolteacher or a typical anybody
in a classic system where you're told, do your job and keep your mouth
shut.  And what they want to do is say, wait a second, what is our aim?
What are we trying to accomplish?  I mean, apply this thinking to learning.
Yes, sir?
<p><pre>
>> I think you could envision the union's response to the scenario we just
>>experienced, but what about this Deming model? What's the union response
>>to it?

>> Well, the unions are confused by it and increasingly willing to work
>>with it because they see the pressure of the world market.  But remember,
>>the union response was a response to Taylorism.  It was a response to the
>>idea that, we're going to suboptimize your job and we're going to
>>brutalize you into a dehumanizing job with no power, no control.  You
>>know, do the white beads or else.  That's why you got all the union work
>>rules, was a response to Taylorism.  And now you're saying to people, we
>>want you to be a complete person.  We want you to completely understand
>>where we're going, and we want you to have complete authority for you to
>>help be creative and in redesigning your part of the process.  Very
>>different model, and places like Ford are unionized.  I mean, they go
>>through lots of dialogue trying to find a way to break through, trying to
>>talk with each other, trying to figure -- it's very -- the cultural
>>change is enormous.  It's not just a management change.  It's a cultural
>>change.
</pre>
Now, what you've got here is -- let's go back and start at the beginning.
Principle number one, the consumer, not the bureaucracy, defines value.
This is very important for this reason.  You've got to define the consumer.
Okay?  If I can go back to the notion of flow charts -- where did the
eraser go? Oh, there it is.  Okay.  What I want to show you is normally, in
most large systems, who's defining value?  At the welfare office, who
defines value?
<p><pre> 
>> the bureaucracy.

>> right, the head of the welfare office, right?  So it's downward.  Okay.
>>In a normal hierarchy -- I'll just do a simple one -- you're down here
>>working, right?  Here is your customer. In a normal hierarchy, this
>>person's defining value for you, right?  I don't care what you, the
>>customer, want.  I care what my boss wants.  But in a flow chart, here's
>>the customer.  You should be feeding back into the system, this is what
>>I'm hearing, this is what we need to change, this is how we can improve
>>it.

>> this Deming model, if we make this -- if our civilization makes this
>>move towards this Deming model and we pass out responsibility to the
>>workers, will it render the unions as we know them today obsolete or
>>impotent?

>> no, the unions as they are today are obsolete.  Unions today have to
>>reinvent themselves.

>> well, is there any place for the union in this model?

>> Sure.  Sure, in a very big system where it is more efficient for you to
>>organize yourselves if you have one person who studies the whole system
>>than it is for you to try to do it yourself.  I mean, if you're all the
>>baseball players, you probably want to have a spokesman who somehow is
>>working.  But the aim of the spokesman would be different than the aim in
>>a traditional union.

>> Well, wasn't the whole need for the unions with the Taylor model because
>>the people at the lowest level --

>> No, it actually goes back to the middle of the 19th century. I mean,
>>it's an effort for people to aggregate themselves into groups that can
>>talk about their life.  If you have lots and lots of people doing this,
>>they may well want some kind of association to discuss doing it.  But the
>>goal of discussing in a Deming world is totally different from the goal
>>of discussing in the Taylor pyramidal world.  Here it's a fight.  I mean,
>>this person is above me.  They don't understand my life.  They're going
>>to try to force me to do things I can't do.  They'll fire me if I can't
>>do this, even though it's not my fault I can't do it.  In this world,
>>you're all on the same team.

>> so would it be safe to say that the Taylor organizational structure is
>>more adversarial and it's much more therapeutic --

>> Much more.  This is an inherently adversarial power structure. This
>>should be an inherently team collegial power structure. Okay?  Very big
>>difference.  I can only remain speaker of the house as long as I convince
>>a majority of 230 of the republicans that I am listening to them well
>>enough that they should re-hire me.  They are my consumers.  And the
>>minute I forget that -- I have two sets of consumers.  600,000 Georgians
>>and 230 house republicans, and the minute I forget that, either set of
>>consumers can fire me.  It's a wonderfully market-oriented system in that
>>sense.  Very -- it's a hard system, but it's market-oriented.  But the
>>first goal here -- and it's something to think about education.  Who is
>>the consumer?

>> students.

>> If the students -- actually, there are three consumers, the society, the
>>parent, and the student.  Because, remember, the student's not paying
>>directly.  The student is being paid for by the parent and society to
>>achieve three sets of goals.  But now go back and ask yourself about the
>>typical learning situation we currently create.  If those three are
>>defining it, who defines it today?  The politicians, the bureaucrats, and
>>the professionals. Second principle, the producer invents value.  Nobody
>>knew they wanted to go to McDonald's till ray Kroc copied the McDonald
>>brothers plan.  Ray Kroc, remember -- this is one of the great stories of
>>how history unfolds, because it's not linear.  It's not from here to here
>>to here.  Ray Kroc was what?  Anyone remember?

>> milkshake --

>> milkshake machine salesman.  He wanted to sell milkshake machines.  He
>>was the best milkshake machine salesman in the country, and the McDonald
>>brothers had a great product based largely on their French fries, and
>>lots of people came to McDonald's, and he went to them and said, you guys
>>ought to franchise.  If you would franchise.  Now, why does he want them
>>to franchise?

>> sell more milkshakes.

>> Sell more milkshake machines, and they said to him, we won't do it.  He
>>said, if you'll just expand, I could do it.  They said, we don't want to
>>expand.  We're happy being the McDonald brothers.  So he finally, after
>>two years, talked them into letting him expand, at which point he gave up
>>being a milkshake machine salesman, but it was all a historic accident.
>>The minute he opened McDonald's in Chicago, people flocked to it, and he
>>suddenly said, this is really a winner.  By the way, do you know why they
>>use Coca-Cola?  The regional Coke salesman loaned him the equipment.  He
>>was an -- he was a small businessman he was getting off the ground, and
>>they said, we'll help you.  We like your idea.  We want you to succeed.
>>Someday you'll be a good customer.
</pre>
Notice how Deming-like this is.  Okay?  Let us help you be successful?
Well, guess what the largest single customer in the world is for Coca-Cola?
McDonald's.  Out of one local guy being positive.  Now, in this model, of
course, or in this model back here, finance would have said, you did what?
Okay? Principle number three, to improve future results, you must improve
the process, which means if you're serious -- this is why Deming and
Drucker blend together so brilliantly -- if you're serious, you have to map
the process you're engaged in.  You have to always be thinking process.
What am I learning about the process?  So you can't focus on the event.
The event is, oh, I did this number.  It's part of a process.  Show me the
map of the process.  What does the chart look like?  Okay, so you're
constantly improving the process, because it is the process improvements.
Silly example.  You have a phone which is too far from your desk and the
cord is too short, so 12 times a day you have to stand up and walk over to
the phone.  What is the obvious answer?
<P><PRE>
>> get a longer cord.

>> get a longer cord or --

>> move the desk.

>> move the desk.  It may seem obvious.  Great managers do it
>>instinctively.  Bad managers get up 12 times a day for their whole life.
>>Okay?  Fourth, people have intrinsic motivation. They want to do a good
>>job.  Very important part of this.  The average human being wants to do a
>>good job.

>> what do you think's behind it?

>> it's an assumption about human nature.  Doesn't mean that they're good
>>-- they're necessarily good people.  Every one of us has some potential
>>for evil.  Every one of us has to go through a process all of our lives
>>of sorting out how we live out our potential, but most of the time most
>>people inherently would prefer to achieve rather than to not achieve.  And
>>you can acculturate to increase that tendency.  It's the basic tenet of
>>America.  I mean, if we're endowed by our creator with certain
>>unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
>>happiness, you're assuming people will pursue.

>> I would argue that if people wanted to do a good job, we wouldn't see
>>the social problems that we see today.

>> Unless you have a system which is telling them not to do a good job.
>>Remember, the person down here who's not doing a good job may be -- is
>>being sent signals all day to keep their mouth shut.  A person on welfare
>>is being sent signals all day,  don't try.  Why would you want to get off
>>Medicaid?  Why would you want to leave public housing?  You don't have
>>any personal friends who work.  Why would you want to work?  Why would
>>you get good grades?  Talk to black kids who get good grades in an inner
>>city school and the peer pressure they're under to not succeed.  I mean,
>>humans will -- humans, I think, have a desire to be good, they have a
>>desire to be liked, they have a desire to achieve. But they can be broken
>>of those desires by a system which repetitively pounds in them to teach
>>them bad behaviors.  Why wouldn't you get pregnant?  All your friends
>>are.  I mean, just think about it as -- if you apply Deming, if you read
>>Leon dash's book "When Children Want Children" and think of it in a
>>Deming model of a system and a culture and a process, you have a totally
>>different view of what happens.  And we'll get into this when we get to
>>the section on the culture.
</pre>
But our presumption here, it's at a core part of Deming, it's why Deming is
so American, is that people basically want to pursue happiness.  Now, if
you don't believe that, you need a dictatorship, you need a police state.
But if you believe that, then you ought to design a system that starts with
the idea probably you want to do well. Now, if you're one of the tiny, tiny
percentage that don't want to do well, we can deal with that, but for most
people most of the time, it is safer to assume they want to learn, they
want to grow, they want to do well, and we are the facilitators of their
behaving in a positive way.  Principle number four
<P><PRE>
>> excuse me, does that mean that baseball players can roll into some kind
>>of a --

>> well, jack Kemp has a very simple -- we'll keep this Chyron up.  Jack
>>Kemp has a very simple theory on the baseball strike. His theory is that
>>when the marginal tax rate finally broke 50%, by the time you count in
>>state taxes, that if you're a normal player who knows you've only got a
>>six- to 10-year playing career, that the marginal tax rate makes you much
>>more desperate than you were when it was 28.  And that the tax increases
>>have a direct impact on why the players are so concerned.  Because
>>they're actually making much -- by the time you take out the agents' fees
>>and you take out the tax rate at the state and federal level, they're
>>actually taking home much less than people think they are.  And these
>>guys know that they're probably not going to play more than 10 or 12
>>years, so they've got to build up in that length of time the entire nest
>>egg to sustain the rest of their life.
</pre><P>
I mean, they're huge salaries, and I don't feel any sympathy for a guy who
makes $7 million a year in field sport, but that if you really evaluate as
a system in a Deming model and said, now, what happens to your salary?
Tell me how much your agent gets.  Tell me how much the union gets.  Tell
me how much the tax collector gets.  How much is left?  And you're 26 years
old and you're a pitcher and you may not have 10 more years, how worried
are you?  And they're in an adversarial environment.  I mean, they and the
managers have -- they and the owners have had a lousy relationship
culturally.
<P><PRE>
>> arrogant, bad decision-making by people like Steinbrenner.

>> On both sides, on both sides.  You've got owners who have made bad
>>decisions.  You've got a player's union that's made bad decisions, and
>>instead of in a Deming-like model stopping and -I mean, what they -- I
>>think what they ought to do, frankly, is go off on a retreat and not come
>>out until -- you know, if you took every owner and every player and you
>>said, we're now all going to go to Yellowstone and we can't leave until
>>we have a solution, they'd get one.  They'd talk to each other.  But
>>until you can unlock that, as long as you keep it adversarial, back to
>>this.  Well, these are just the players.  I am the owner.  Who do you
>>think you are?  Okay?

>> that's like saying that the worker at Ford is laid off.  And they've
>>worked for Ford for 20 years.  Three weeks before Christmas, they get
>>laid off.  They can't make their boat payment, their house payment, that
>>and that and that.  Well, you know, what a rotten president, what a
>>rotten congress, you know, we can't make our house payment.

>> I didn't say the Congress should do anything.

>> well, I'm just saying --

>> I said -- but a healthy leader would tell everybody eight months
>>earlier, we have a big problem in the world market.  We're not competing
>>very well.  We may end up having to close the factory if we're not
>>careful.  We'd better think about this together.

>> that's what I'm saying, is that they've got to take responsibility.  If
>>they know their career is only 10 years --

>> then they've got to slow down.


>> -- they've got to save it up.

>> and what they're saying to you is as long as we raise the marginal tax
>>rate, the amount they have to play with is going down, so the pressure on
>>them to get higher salaries is greater than people think it is, because
>>the net they're making has gone down, not gone up.


>> but it's free.

>> I'm just saying if you're the owner and you treat that with arrogance
>>and you're an owner who has a private corporate jet and you own a big
>>corporation and you have a stadium given to you by the city on a really
>>nice deal and they now get into a fight, if you decide just to fight each
>>other, which is Taylorism, why would you think the strike would end?
>>Whereas, if you'd come over here and say wait a second.  We're part of a
>>lot bigger system that has customers out here.  We are actually the
>>fiduciaries of a great national pastime called baseball.  We have a moral
>>responsibility to find a solution, this tone, this conversation is
>>totally different from Taylorism.  It's a different model.  But notice,
>>this is also broken up, because when you go to Taylorism and they hire a
>>union agent, now these guys have an agent who's paid to fight, and these
>>guys have an agent who's paid to fight, and they go off into a room and
>>they couldn't care less about the customers.

>> absolutely.  But what they're doing is the same thing we do with the
>>beads.  They're pulling them out and they don't have any control over the
>>red beads coming in.

>> right.

>> which is this guy  over --

>> right, which is why what they really ought to do is every single one of
>>the players and every single one of the owners ought to go off as a
>>group, kick out their agents on both sides, and sit down without the
>>lawyers and talk as human beings about the national pastime.

>> without the president and congress, also.

>> they ought to do it because as people who want to serve their fans and
>>the sport that they are the fiduciary responsible of, it's the right
>>thing to do.  And just say, we don't want -- now, when you get done with
>>all the talk and you have reached an agreement, you bring in the lawyers
>>to legally codify the agreement.  But the minute you get the two sides
>>lawyers, you leave this and you go back over here.  And what you've done
>>is you've now blocked right here.  And these guys don't talk to these
>>guys because they each have a hired hatchet, a hired gun. And the hired
>>gun's just sitting there shooting at each other.

>> and they can't make any decisions anyway --

>> right.

>> -- to solve the baseball strike.

>> But they can blur the communications.  So this team only hears from
>>their hired gun and this team only hears from their hired gun, so the
>>owners get one-sided views and the players get one-sided views, and over
>>here is the customer and the national pastime, both of which are being
>>served badly by both the owners and the players.  And that's why the
>>Deming model is so much more powerful at providing service and providing
>>goods than is the Taylor model.  Now, we've got to get through some more
>>stuff. But notice what the next Chyron is.  Principle five, every person,
>>process, and job is part of an interdependent larger system.  So if you
>>start with, gee, here is the pastime of baseball, here are the 130
>>million fans, here are the people who earn a living selling, you know,
>>cokes and beer and popcorn and tickets, here is the players and the
>>owners, now you see yourself in a much bigger system, and your ego gets
>>much smaller.  You're a tiny part of that system, okay?
</pre>
And unless you see yourself as your -- you and your process and your job
are part of a larger system, how can you figure out what your contribution
is?  That's why I said earlier when I said wipe off the table, the first
question is, why?  Because you've got to figure out what system you're part
of.  Principle number six, and this is very hard to get across to people,
continual learning is the basis for continual improvement.  I can't
overstate this.  You have to learn every day of your life.  We have got to
rethink education from the ground up, so from prior to birth, from
conception to death, there are things we can do to maximize your chance of
learning.  If we are the best learning society on the planet, we will
dominate the planet in terms of our productivity, and that means rethinking
everything from the ground up.  And if you're not continually learning
every day, you don't get it.
<P>
Okay? Principle -- now, so take those six principles and let me go back and
show them to you in this way,  value is defined by the customer, value is
invented by the producer, production is a system of processes, everyone
contributes, and continuous improvement by everyone is the most powerful
model.  Now, let's look at a non-manufacturing example of this, one of the
great systems of this country, the Ritz-Carlton.
<p> <PRE>
>> thank you for calling the Ritz-Carlton --

>> for Ritz-Carlton hotels, it's a matter of constantly improving services
>>to its guests, for in a real sense, its product is service.  And they
>>also understand that with total quality management, the old way ways no
>>longer work.

>> Horst H. Schutze:  if it was true that quality, that it could reach the
>>peak of quality, if it was not a moving target, if it wasn't a continuous
>>voyage, then we would still be driving model-t Fords.  You see, there is
>>always a new dimension and new frontier to be captured.  It's very
>>interesting that most people think that statistical process control does
>>not exist in the service industry.  And it certainly does.  We have key
>>demands by customers, key expectations identified, of course, through
>>careful service, and for all those key expectations, we have processes,
>>and those processes are measured.

>> in fact, they measure 720 work areas throughout the company, and on a
>>daily basis.  Then those measurements are combined with comments from
>>guest surveys to form a data base which is used for continuous
>>improvement.

>> okay?  Is that helpful?  Now, seen from that context, I mean, you can
>>apply it to, how does the reservation clerk answer the phone?  How does
>>the bellman greet you at the door?  How do they take care of your towels?
>>How do they take care of room service? How do they take care of the
>>restaurant?  I mean, every aspect. It's not just manufacturing.  Every
>>aspect of life.  What if we had a quality-driven legal system?  What if
>>we had a quality-driven bureaucracy?  And you can be.  I mean, you know,
>>"bureaucrat" doesn't have to be a negative word.  Because originally, it
>>simply meant somebody who was systematic in doing things.
</pre>
Now, remember the three big concepts of entrepreneurial free enterprise.
First, the entrepreneur as a creative -- is a creative inventor.  Second,
the customer or the market or the goal defines success.  And, third,
getting the job done is the focus.  So you invent, the market judges
whether or not your invention is useful, and getting the job done as you've
defined it is how you define whether or not you're succeeding.  If you
apply quality to education in that context, you have a totally different
rhythm and pattern of how we try to learn.  It be much more dynamic, much
more open.  And the focus would be on,  how much do you learn, not how long
do you sit?
<P>
And this is why we really do want you by next week, every one of you to
have written down what three major changes would you make in the process of
learning in America based on Deming and Drucker and, in particular, on
today's session.  The vision here that we're trying to communicate with
this particular two hours is an America committed to Quality and Profound
Knowledge so that every American, the poorest American, the richest
American, the least powerful, the most powerful, somebody with a sixth
grade education, somebody with a Ph.D.., every American starts out each day
and says, what process am I involved?  What system am I part of?  What is
my goal?  What customers am I trying to satisfy? How am I doing this?
Okay?  In that framework, it seems to me that our strategies,  learning,
speaking, teaching, recognizing, living, okay, how you have to learn, then
you have to speak.  You have to explain what you're doing.  You have to
teach it.  When somebody does do it right, you want to recognize them.  And
all this gets summarized into literally,  how do you live every day?
<P>
And it may sound at first kind of hokey, but just think about it. What
we're trying to do here is suggest to you that Deming took the best of the
American Civilization, he codified it into a way of empowering every person
to have control over their contribution, so that every person can literally
live this out. You ought to be living it out in your marriage or your
relationship to other people.  You ought to be living it out in your
community.  You ought to be living it out in your own life. Think of your
own life as a system, as a process.  All that should fit together in a way
that makes sense.
<P>
Now, if that's true, one of the questions I'd ask you to think about, which
I don't have an answer to, is, what are the projects and what are the
tactics that ought to grow out of this?  What would make your community
more quality-oriented, more like a Deming Profound Knowledge system?  Or
your family, or your job, or your volunteer activity?  If you would,
imagine applying Quality and Profound Knowledge to health, safety,
government, the welfare system, and learning.  Notice, by the way, health,
safety, and learning do not imply health care.  They don't imply police.
They don't imply education in the traditional sense.
<P>
They simply say, okay, how do you maximize learning?  How do you maximize
health in America?  What if we didn't need any open-heart surgery because
everybody had habits of diet and habits of exercise so that they didn't
need it?  How much would that save?  Very different way of thinking than if
you  start -- you know, what if every neighborhood had its own patrol and
every neighborhood did -- had its own people who systematically became
deputized and you didn't have any crime?  Which is different than,  can we
hire enough police and enough prosecutors and build enough prisons so that
after the crime is committed, we can lock up the bad people. Very different
models.  And I'm trying to get you to break down the internal barriers to
creativity where you start with blinders on, and instead, get you to think
about all of it, the totality of opportunity that's available.
<P>
Remember that we talk in terms of vision, strategies, projects, and
tactics.  And what I want you to think about is applying it to quality in
education.  And, frankly, if I were redoing this particular Chyron, I'd
probably say quality in "learning."  I wouldn't say "education."  I have
almost no interest in education.  I have every interest in learning.  Now,
you may learn in a setting which is an educational setting or you may learn
some other way.  But what I want to know is,  how much are you learning?
What is your process of acquiring knowledge?  What's your process of
changing your life?  And you find more and more learning goes on outside of
structured, bureaucratic environments.
<P>
More and more people who buy tapes or they go to a particular three-day
seminar or they do something on their own or they pick up books or they use
expert systems in computer.  Or they find a consultant who comes in for a
day.  You know, I mean, think about it as an adult, if you had to go learn
skiing, would you take a five-hour credit course on skiing, or would you go
and spend three intense days at a resort with a ski instructor?  Which
technique -- they're both kinds of learning.  Or would you read a book on
how to ski, practice it a little bit, and go down the slope and see what
happens?  Different people do different things.
<P>
My point's just that's a -- if you focus on learning, it's a dramatically
more open-ended question than if you focus on education, which is a
predefined professional status in a bureaucratic setting occupied with
credentialing.  Very different systems.  Remember, also, that after you
think you know what you're doing, we've got to go back to applying listen,
learn, help, and lead.  That is, you think you have your vision, you think
you have your strategies, you think you have your projects, you're ready
with your tactics, fine.  Now go listen to the person next to you.  What do
they think?  What are their concerns?  Why do they do it?  Because if all
you do is focus on your version of visions, strategies, projects, and
tactics, you still have not listened to everybody else who's part of your
game.  So there's an enormous amount of listening involved in this kind of
leading.
<P>
Okay?  So how does -- how would this lead you to change learning in America
based on what you've learned today?  What might you do?  Just brainstorm.
No rights and wrongs.  Just be creative.
<PRE>
>> let the students choose who they want their teachers to be for which
>>subjects they want to take.

>> put the students in a teaching capacity.  The best way to learn
>>something is to teach it.

>> teach it, sure.

>> get the parents more involved in volunteering in the schools.

>> what else?

>> like, learn through experience.

>> okay.  Should that count?

>> sure.

>> I mean, if we say to you, we want you to become something, what if you
>>just go and do it as an apprentice and actually learn it, but you didn't
>>sit through the five-hour course?  Does that count?  Does that count?

>> bureaucracy has to be defined.

>> yes, ma'am?

>> I think you ought to make computers check-outable at libraries just like
>>you do books, because they can learn things faster on a computer.

>> that's interesting.  What if you could check out a PC and the software
>>package literally and maybe put -- give a credit card or something as a
>>device, but what if public libraries became centers where people could
>>literally go in and check out computers?  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.

>> I think field trips should be part of, like, for history and stuff.  I
>>know when we were, like, in fourth grade, we toured the cyclorama and
>>berry college, and in high school it was so much more paperwork, we
>>couldn't go anywhere.

>> I was going to say, did you learn on field trips?

>> yeah.

>> what are the new rules in Georgia on field trips?

>> there's so much paperwork, you can't --

>> anybody know?  You do fewer field trips today.

>> too much litigation.

>> too much litigation.  Too much time out of the classroom.  The rules in
>>Georgia today are actually worse for field trips than they were 30 years
>>ago.

>> even the bureaucracy of the tests.  They have a test now that says you
>>can't graduate from high school in Georgia, and teachers are going to
>>have to teach, this is what's going to be on the test.  That ends -- you
>>know, my English teacher couldn't teach Maya Angelou's poetry because she
>>knew that this wasgoing to be on the test, because you have to pass the
>>test to get out of high school.

>> See, they teach to the test.  Remember the Deming point?  The purpose of
>>recognition is for what you've already internalized, and if we set up a
>>standard for recognition that you  then -- you then gain the system,
>>right?  And say, I've got it.  What I've got to learn to do is to stand
>>on one leg.  Okay, I can now stand on one leg, so I'll get an "a."  Who
>>cares?  Now, if the other answer is, the reason you're standing on one
>>leg -- and I'm not going to do this -- the reason you're standing on one
>>leg is you're a ballerina and you're doing a pirouette, see the
>>difference?
</pre>
Okay, and we're now going to honor the best ballerina.  That's a very
different reason for learning to stand on one leg.  And what we do in a
bureaucratic credentialed environment, you systematically reduce the
creativity of people, and you systematically reduce the holistic manner in
which they learn, and you reduce them so that they become passive, narrow,
and shallow, and then we say,  gee, why do our schools not work? Because
the entire core structure is wrong.
<P>
Now, next week we're going to pick up the Third Wave in American
Civilization.  Next week's readings are Alvin and Heidi Toffler's "Creating
a New Civilization, the Politics of the Third Wave."  Alexis de
Tocqueville's "Democracy in America," volume II, books 2, chapter 18, and
volume II, book 4, chapter 1.  And Don Eberly's "Building a Community of
Citizens," chapter 5.  And we'll take up, what does the third wave mean and
how will it change our lives?  Okay?

<title>Renewing American Civilization Class Eight -- PFF</title>
Renewing American Civilization Class Eight<br>
Creating American Jobs in the Work Market<br>
Reinhardt College February 25, 1995<br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
Television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the eighth of
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course which presents the foundational
principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization.  This week's
lesson, the world market, focuses on the world market and an information
age third-wave American strategy for being the highest value-added
competitor with the most productive jobs, the most market-oriented
producers, leading to the highest take-home pay and the highest quality of
life.
<P>
Let me welcome everyone this morning, and I want to welcome the students of
Mind Extension University and remind everyone who might be watching us by
television or on videotape or audio tape that you can mail your comments
to: Renewing American Civilization, post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia
30065.  You can fax your comments to 404-528-9806.  You can e-mail your
comments to America Online at renewam@aol. com.  Or you can get class
transcripts and other class materials available on our Internet web page,
which is http://www. pff.org.
<P>
Finally, for people who are into a more traditional kind of way of
communicating, although I'd point out 800 numbers were not very traditional
30 years ago, you can order "American Civilization" newspaper, video and
audio tapes, and course readings by calling 1- 800-to-renew.
<P>
And this course is based on the premise that there are five pillars of
American Civilization.  First, the historic lessons of American
Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third, entrepreneurial free
enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and discovery.  And, fifth,
quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And in the course of this course, we
take two hours with each of those pillars, and then we apply them to four
areas.  Last week we talked about the Third Wave and American Civilization,
the Alvin and Heidi Toffler model of a Third Wave of change.  Then we
talked today about creating American jobs in the world market.  Then next
week, we will talk about replacing the culture of violence and poverty with
a culture of productivity and safety.  And finally, we'll talk about --
we'll end the course with citizenship and community in 21st century
America.  What does all this change mean and how do we Renew American
Civilization, and what's our role in that?
<P>
Now, today's class is creating American jobs in the world market.  And I
think it's very important to see this as a dual edge, creating American
jobs, but doing so in the world market.  And before we get to that, several
of you, in the spirit of a certain amount of current events, it is true
that in weekly "World News" cover, "Space Alien Meets with Newt Gingrich."
This was not about negotiating for a bigger market than the world market.
And national security prevents me from describing exactly what happened.
But since one of you brought this today, I couldn't resist starting by --
this is the closest to current events we've gotten in this course so far.
Just further proof that this is a diverse and creative society, with people
who think up a lot of strange things.
<P>
By the way, I also have to say in terms of the concept of the Third Wave
and what an extraordinary, diverse civilization we are, you'll remember
last week, I talked about the notion that the Chinese word for "crisis" is
actually made of the ideograph -- two ideographs for "danger" and
"opportunity," and that when we figured this out, we were going to use it
-- about 10:00 o'clock Friday night preparing the class -- that we did not
have the ideograph, and then a gentleman faxed this to us from San
Francisco.
<P>
Now, after the class, I learned that the story gets even better.  The top
character is "danger." The bottom character is "opportunity." And that this
was sent to us by Fred Chow, who is an 82-year-old first-generation
American who emigrated from China, and he lives in San Francisco.  And a
friend of ours who knows Fred Chow heard me say -- on camera, heard me say,
"gee, we don't have this ideograph," literally picked up the phone, called,
and said, "Fred, can you fax it to Reinhardt? " And within that length of
time, it got here.  So pretty good deal.  And again, an example both of how
extraordinarily diverse America is and of how the information age works and
how rapidly you can get things done.
<P>
Now, there's a central premise to this particular session, and one that I
think we don't focus enough energy and attention on as the base of much of
our public policy, and that is that economic growth is vital to a free
society.  That it's economic growth that creates jobs, it's economic growth
that creates wealth.  That you can't redistribute wealth if you don't
create it, that you can't have charities if you don't first have income.
That you can't take care of your family if you don't have a job, and that
jobs come from economic growth.  And that the best way to ensure future
jobs is to have a growth-oriented pattern, not to have a protective
pattern.
<P>
I'm going to get into this and spend some time.  But it's very important,
because the first attitude of people is to say, "boy, I want to protect my
current job." And that leads you, as you'll see in a minute, into a
past-oriented, defensive attitude.
<P>
So let's start with the premise, what this two hours is about is, how do we
get economic growth in the 21st century?  What does economic growth in jobs
and take-home pay mean for Americans?
<P>
Now, I want to now go to a second point, which is very controversial, but I
want to assert as a fact, and I would be very glad to defend either here or
anywhere else, and that is that the world market is an inescapable reality.
And that it will define the requirements for economic growth.  Now, this
is a very central debate that we have to have as a country.  My point is
that you cannot avoid the world market.  I use the term "inescapable
reality." It's not about, do you like it or dislike -- this is not about
GATT and NAFTA.  This is about the objective fact that all over the planet,
there are smart people getting up every morning and competing, and that
that's just an objective reality, and that they are going to have an impact
on your interest rate, they're going to have an impact on your money
supply.  They're going to have an impact on your products.  And that unless
you start a design with "let's look at the world market," you are not being
realistic economically about who we're competing with.
<P>
You can come in and say to me, boy, here we are in North Georgia.  We have
got a plan that will knock the socks off Tennessee.  And if, in fact, it is
a plan which will be drowned by Germany and China, it is irrelevant.  And
so as we design American economic growth, we have to start from a 21st
century notion of the world partly driven by technology.  You now live on a
planet where you can pick up the phone, dial direct and reach virtually
every country on the planet in real-time.
<P>
Now, this is an enormous change from 100 years ago.  It's a big change from
30 years ago, when it was still fairly hard to make a transatlantic call
and now it's universal.  You can fax worldwide.  And we did.  During the
problems in Russia several years ago, people were faxing back and forth and
e-mailing back and forth.  A level of openness that was unthinkable.  And
it was probably unavoidable in the modern world.  Somebody told me this
morning that they're now talking about taking out dish receivers in Iran,
because having your own dish receiver, you know, is a way of getting
information.
<P>
Of course, this is happening at the very moment, as Kathleen Minnix was
saying, when we're now inventing smaller and smaller dish receivers, which
means people will have a contraband dish receiver in their attic.  I mean,
it's that kind of constant effort.  You know, the world's getting smaller.
We are competing not just with other Americans, we're competing with Mexico
and China and Japan and Germany, and we have no choice.  You can choose
what the terms of the competition are, but you can't choose the
competition.  You can determine how your government interfaces with the
competition, but you will compete somehow.  In that framework, I want to
suggest that a global economy is important because there is more
opportunity in the world than there is in one country.  And because
competition within a global economy forces us to be more creative and
innovative.
<P>
Now, there are two points here.  First of all, as a consumer, if your
choice is to buy bananas grown in a hothouse in North Georgia or to buy
bananas grown in Africa or Latin America, it is an economically nutty
decision to buy a hothouse banana, because it's just dramatically more
expensive.  And so the wider the world market, the greater the choices you
have.  In addition, if you take every good idea on the planet this year and
you weave them together into American productivity, you're going to have
more good ideas than if you only take the American ideas.  So that being
open to the world allows you to have both more consumer choice and it
allows you to have more understanding of ways of being productive that are
good for competition.
<P>
In a sense, Arnold Schwarzenegger by coming to the U. S. created a major
export industry.  I think it was "Terminator II" that made $200 million
overseas, which is literally the same as selling textiles or shoes or
something else.  He had created a product which earned at foreign exchange
for the U. S. , And yet he originally, of course, was born in Austria.  But
whether you're importing a human being or you're importing an idea, I mean,
many ideas now come to the U.S.  We and the Japanese are the two highest
value-added producers of new ideas on the planet.  So if somebody in France
will invent something, we'll market it.  We and the Japanese are basically
in competition to see who can market better.
<P>
The other part of it is that when you have to compete inside a global
economy, it's the same as belonging to a regional football league or
belonging to a national football league.  When you've got to compete in the
highest level of competition on the planet, your factories get better, your
managers get better, your inventors get better, and you just have a
different level in pace and pressure of creativity.  So by being in the
world market, you keep your country at the front edge.  And to the degree
that you withdraw from the world market, you allow your own companies to be
less competitive.  This is a big problem in Europe now where the more the
Europeans protect their industries, the more obsolescent their industries
get.
<P>
Whereas, Ford, for example, which is a world company, had to go through an
excruciating cultural change to compete with Toyota.  Volvo, Mercedes,
Renault, Fiat, they didn't go through that big a change.  The result is
Ford is now a generation ahead of any European car company at being
competitive.  General Motors is in the process of going through the same
change.  Chrysler is going through the same change.  And the result is the
two most efficient producers of cars in the world are Ford and Toyota, and
they're almost indistinguishable now in terms of how competitive they are.
And they play head to head.  The really great -- and there are great
European car companies, but they're dramatically more inefficient.  They
have a much longer turnaround time on new models, and they have much less
effective use of resources.  And over time, that eats you up.  It means
you're not competitive.
<P>
Now, in that setting, let me suggest to you that our goal here -- and I
really have to thank my wife Marianne, who came up with this -- is that
local jobs through world sales defines the new reality.  One of our
problems is to get across to people, this is not about overseas jobs.  When
we talk about the world market, it's not about fancy people overseas.  It's
about scientific Atlanta, which now has a five-year backlog of orders.  So
in North Atlanta, scientific Atlanta is employing several thousand people
selling all across the planet.
<P>
And it's that kind of continuing process of Coca-Cola, which makes money
everywhere on the planet, practically.  And so there are jobs in Atlanta
which come directly out of Coca-Cola.  It's interesting, "Georgia Trend"
magazine had a 250-page section entitled, "global connections." This is the
December 1994 issue.  And they have 20 pages of listings of companies in
Georgia that have specific relations to the world market.  So this is
literally about, how do we create local jobs through the world market?
Because that's the reality we're now dealing with.  To understand how we do
that, we have to start with certain societal aspects of competitiveness.
That is, compared to other countries what's our taxation, regulation,
litigation, education, cultural values, and government structure like?
<P>
Let me carry you through.  Does our tax code encourage saving and
investing, or does it encourage consumption?  If it encourages consumption,
compared to the German and Japanese tax codes, guess who will have more
money available for the next generation of factories?  So when you talk to
the biotechnology companies, where of the top 15 products of the world, all
15 are American, their major problem in creating new jobs -there are over
100,000 high evaluated jobs now in biotechnology -their major problem in
creating new jobs is they can't get enough capital to build new factories.
It takes hundreds of millions of dollars because of our next item, which is
regulation, to bring a biotechnology product on the American market.  So if
you can't find the money even if you have the idea, you can't market the
product.
<P>
And so Japanese and German companies are looking at buying our
biotechnology where we have a dominant position, because they have the
capital.  We don't.  Second is regulation.  It takes -- it now takes almost
as long for the regulations for building a computer chip factory to be
processed as the lifetime of the computer chip.  So even if you solve
taxation and you have the money and you're told, "well, now, you can come
to Thailand and break ground Tuesday morning or you can file for an EPA
permit and in three years we'll solve it," you may conclude because of the
speed of change in computers, that you have to go offshore just because you
can't afford to deal with American red tape.  The third problem is
litigation.  You're told, "you could do this in Germany, and there they
have a 'loser pays' system, and there are very few lawsuits about this, or
you could do it in the U. S.  And there are 23 trial lawyers who'd like to
meet you Tuesday."
<P>
Which system - - and by the way, Edwards Deming said that litigation was
one of the two major things, health care being the other, that made America
non-competitive.  And he singled out litigation and the degree to which
this is a litigious society, where you graduate more lawyers than engineers
and then you compete with Japan, which graduates more engineers than
lawyers.  There are more lawyers in Georgia than there are in the country
of Japan.  Just to give you some sense of scale.  Fourth is education.  I
mean, to do quality right, you have to know math.  The average American
high school graduate does not know enough math.  In fact, the average
American college graduate does not know enough math to do the math expected
of a typical high school graduate in Japan.
<P>
So if you're going to do quantitative analysis, if you're going to set up a
systems approach, if you're going to say, "what is" -- you know, "what is a
common occurrence and what's a unique occurrence? " Remember when we did
Deming?  In order to build the statistical model, you have to have a better
ability to do math than most Americans have.  And so corporations find the
education level is not only not acceptable, it's decaying, particularly in
the inner cities.  So that you're less likely to be able to hire somebody
to compete in the world market if your education system collapses.
<P>
Fifth is cultural values.  If you're competing with somebody who still
believes in the work ethic and you're competing with somebody who gets up
every morning thinking about, "how can I win this competition," and your
culture now has said, "well, don't be a workaholic and don't push it, and
after all, you know, you really don't -- you don't want to be a rate
breaker." Again, we find, for example, honor students who get beaten up now
because in some inner city schools, they're seen as being deviant because
they want to study too much.  Well, how's that going to compete in the
world market?  So cultural attitudes matter.
<P>
And finally, government structure.  I mean, do you have a government --
when you learn that, for example, as was recently reported, there are 27
factories in China that are pirating American products, openly pirating
them, and when the Chinese government says to them, "we won't stop them,"
you have an obligation to have a government which is aggressive enough and
competent enough to hit them hard enough economically that they can't
afford it.  And if you are too slow, too soft, too confused, you can't be
competitive.  And so you've got to have a government structure which --
because in the world market, governments are like blocking backs in
football.  I mean, if you don't have a government which is strong enough to
protect your interests, the companies can't survive, because they're up
against nation states.
<P>
And so if the other side says, "my government will help me cheat, your
government won't help you at all," guess who wins in the long run?  That's
a very key part.  If you're going to have a free market on a worldwide
basis, the government had better be competent enough to be a good referee,
because the other side's going to have a government that intervenes on
their behalf.
<P>
Now, when you look at those larger issues, what I want to do now is come
back and I want you to be looking for how the five pillars of American
Civilization relate to success in the world market.  What are the
historical lessons of American Civilization?  And we're going to use some
examples.  What does personal strength mean if you're going to be
competitive?  How does entrepreneurial free enterprise factor in?  What
does the spirit of invention and discovery mean?  And what is quality as
defined by Deming?  And how do all five of these begin to relate to
competing in the world market?
<P>
And what I want to start with is the notion that there are actually two
models, and before we put them up -- well, they got excited.  They put them
up.  One is the welfare state, which is -good.  They stopped.  What I want
you to see, we talk a lot about vision, which then leads to strategies,
which then leads to projects, which are definable, delegatable
achievements, and then, what do you do every day?  What are your tactics,
okay?
<P>
And this is a very important example to show you, which we'll do again next
week, that we're talking here about two very, very different models.  And
that they are literally models.  That based on what you believe at a vision
level, that you end up with two very different ways of approaching things.
But if all you do is come down here -- and this is one of our problems,
frankly, with the modern news media and with modern politics.  If all you
do is you focus on these tactical issues down here, you can't appreciate by
studying at this level how enormous the difference in the two systems is.
And, in fact, they may look like they're sort of similar.  But if they're
similar in appearance but relate back to a totally different system of
thought, you're making radically different decisions.
<P>
And so one of the reasons I take the time to try to teach the course and
try to lay out the ideas is until we as a people can get used to talking
about vision and strategies, we just drown in tactics.  And we don't
understand what the core problems are.  And this goes back, remember, to
Drucker's warning in "the Effective Executive" that good executives always
ask of a problem, what is it a symptom of?  And this relates back to this
whole model.  When you find out that the Chinese are getting away with
pirating goods, what is that a symptom?  What failure led that to happen?
And you find out that the failure is, we don't have an aggressive enough
customs agency.  What is that a symptom of?  What does it tell you about
the layer above that?  So you're constantly trying to go back in and look
for the -- it's sort of like imagine you're coughing this morning, and we
keep focusing on the cough.  But is your cough because you have
tuberculosis?  Is your cough because you have the flu?  Is your cough
because you have hay fever?  Is your cough because you just have a sore
throat?  You know, what's going on and why are you coughing?  Well, you've
got to work your way back up.  You've got to understand what's behind the
tactical event.
<P>
Now, what I'm going to describe in the next few minutes are two very
different models of thinking about America in the world market, and I want
to -- I'm going to suggest to you that one of them is a welfare state
model, and the other is an opportunity society model.  That the welfare
state basically hides from the world markets, and the opportunity society
believes you have to win in the world markets.
<P>
Now, there are two important concepts here.  One is, gee, if only we could
build big enough barriers, we could hide, and then people wouldn't come and
compete with us.  The other, though, is -- notice the key word I used here,
which is a sometimes controversial word, "win" in the world market.  That
is, you want -- you don't want to design a strategy just to compete.  You
want to design a strategy to win.  And I would argue at the vision level,
that you want to design a strategy which creates the highest value-added
jobs in the world, so that Americans have the highest take-home pay, so we
have the highest standard of living.
<P>
Now, if you start thinking about -- and think about the difference you get
psychologically if I say to you, "let's compete" or I say to you, "let's
win." Because winning justifies the extra weekend of work.  Winning
justifies the extra focus on quality.  Winning justifies the extra effort
to be creative.  But notice how different the two are.  So I don't just
want to be in the world market.  I think America's goal ought to be to win
in the world market.  In that framework, there are a couple of key
differences.  The welfare state is essentially static.  The opportunity
society is dynamic.
<P>
Now, let me give you an example of that that I'm going to come back to
later, but that I just can't resist.  The president of M. I. T.  Visited me
this week and was telling me about the marvelous things they're doing
there, one of which, by the way, is developing surgical training by virtual
reality, where you literally -- huh?
<P>
>>I read about that somewhere.
<P>
>>Okay.  So you literally will have surgeons who will practice, in effect,<br>
>>inside the computer based on virtual reality.  Those of you who have been<br>
>>to Dave & buster's have a slight taste of what this is going to be like.<br>
>>This is -- I don't know if the camera can come in and pick it up.  This<br>
>>right here, can you see the gray thing?  It shows up on the screen pretty<br>
>>good.  Okay?  Got the gray thing?  That has 70 electric motors on it.<br>
>>You will have, early in the next century, in essence, a personal<br>
>>Roto-Rooter, and if your arteries clog, we'll be able to just sort of cut<br>
>>a slice in your leg and put in the Roto-Rooter, it will run up connected<br>
>>by fiber optic, clean out the clogged areas, come back out, and that will<br>
>>be open-heart surgery.  Probably be an outpatient procedure.  Now, what's<br>
>>it worth to do that instead of going in the hospital for four days or for<br>
>>three days?  How good a -- or die.  I mean, how good a product does this<br>
>>start getting to be, right?  And I'll let you think about everything<br>
>>which could be miniaturized and which would be useful at a miniaturized<br>
>>level, but I'm using this as a tiny example.<br>
<P>
The world I think of living in is a world that is dynamic.  It is
constantly evolving, constantly changing.  Whatever happens today doesn't
tell you what will happen tomorrow, so we're constantly looking for the
flow of things.  But in the welfare state, the world's static.  So the
welfare state sees change as danger, where we see change as opportunity.
And we see change as inevitable, where the welfare state thinks it can hide
from it.  Now, this is compounded by the next layer, because the welfare
state is essentially bureaucratic, and the opportunity society is
potentially entrepreneurial.  One is driven by regulations and rules, the
other is driven by a desire for results.  Very different models of
behavior.  In the welfare state, numbers count.  In the opportunity
society, people count.
<P>
Now, what does this mean?  It means that where they're saying, "well, we
can invest $214 million," we're saying, "let's see if we can find bill
gates." Because Bill Gates will ultimately be worth billions.  Where
they're saying, "let's see if we can have this level of training in this
box organized this way," we're saying, "I wonder if Steve Jobs would like
to drop out of college and invent Apple Computer." It's a totally different
model.  It's a model that says we want to liberate every individual, and
that the total potential is 260 million creative individuals doing their
own thing and being excited.  Very different models of structure.
<P>
The welfare state tends to prop up the past; whereas, an opportunity
society focuses on creating the future.  I used to tell the story that if
Thomas Edison had invented the electric light in the age of the welfare
state, it would have been reported on TV news in a report which began, "the
candlemaking industry was threatened today." And the focus would be on what
had happened that was negative.  And the opening of the transcontinental
railroad would be described as "the stagecoach industry in decline."
<P>
It's an attitude.  It's a way of thinking about things.  Do you think
about, gee, the past is leaving me?  Or do you think about, wow, what an
exciting future?  And that doesn't mean it's not a difficult future or a
slightly scary future.  I'm not being Pollyanna.  But which way are you
oriented in terms of your policies and your behavior?  The welfare state
ultimately ironically is oriented towards big business and towards unions.
Whereas, the opportunity society is focused on small business.
<P>
There's a practical reason, by the way.  If you're a bureaucrat and you can
get three auto companies in the room, you can deal with three.  If you're
told there are 72,000 silicon valley software companies in America, you
can't as a bureaucrat deal with it.  The number's impossible.  And so
bigness makes government feel more secure, because it reduces the number of
variables.  Whereas, smallness leads to extraordinary creativity, but it's
literally unmanageable.  You can barely lead it.
<P>
>>You maintain a stability, though, in your system if you --
<P>
>>no.
<P>
>>-- Back to not --
<P>
>>you get the stability you get by surfing or by riding a kayak on a wild<br>
>>river.  I mean, you stay afloat dynamically -- that's exactly my point<br>
>>earlier.  You stay afloat dynamically.
<P>
>>but your feet are always wet.
<P>
>>That's exactly -- that's a good way to put it.  I mean, in an<br>
>>entrepreneurial society, there's always the sense of, this is going to be<br>
>>interesting.  Whereas, during the period of decay -- and you see this in<br>
>>Britain after world war ii -- you sort of feel good as you decay.  It's<br>
>>like being on a raft that's heading towards a waterfall and the raft is<br>
>>very stable, and you're going, well, this is sort of nice, and I don't<br>
>>have to work too hard and I don't have to change, and why are these<br>
>>people over here in the kayak going nuts, you know, and then you hit the<br>
>>waterfall and the whole thing goes off.<br>
<P>
Now, similarly think about the following: the welfare state sees technology
as a threat.  If you watch the way we operate in the opportunity society,
we consistently see technology as an opportunity.  It's a very powerful
cultural test.  The next time you read about new technology, do you think
it's an interesting way of improving the future or do you think it's a
threat to the present?  Now, it's, of course, both.  This goes right back
to the Chinese word, doesn't it?  I mean, every new technology is danger
and opportunity.  And the question is, which one do you make it?
<P>
So, of course, you know, if you are a glassmaker who blows glass and
Coca-Cola comes along and invents a system to make bottles automatically,
it's an enormous threat.  On the other hand, if you're the consumer of
bottled coke and they were going to charge you $37 per hand-blown bottle,
it's a terrific -- so you've got to constantly be looking in a dynamic way.
The welfare state ultimately, because of all this, clings to the Second
Wave, and the opportunity society inherently tries to grow the Third Wave
faster.
<P>
Now, one of the keys to this, which makes it very complicated to talk about
public policy, is that creating Third Wave jobs is the role of the
entrepreneur.  And we don't know how to teach this and we don't know how to
create public policy about it, but the fact is jobs are created by
entrepreneurial personalities who do not fill out reports very well, do not
show up in bureaucracies very well, don't make government employees very
comfortable, and can't explain themselves to reporters very articulately.
<P>
But almost always you can explain the past better than you can explain the
future, and almost always politics is organized around propping up the
past, not around creating the future, because by the time you get organized
enough to have an interest group, you're already the past.  And the people
who are inventing the future are too busy inventing to worry about being an
interest group.
<P>
In that framework, however, people need to learn if you wage class war on
employers, you are waging war on employees.  It's a very core concept.  I
mean, if you believe it's an entrepreneurial society and that to get into
the Third Wave and to dominate the world market you have to have lots of
entrepreneurs, but your attitude is if you're an entrepreneur you must be
bad, because after all, you're going to get rich, I mean, look at Bill
Gates.  It's terrible.  I mean, he's created 2200 millionaires in
Bremerton, and that's even worse, so it's not just him.  It's a whole class
of people who are doing bad things.  So if you want to punish the
entrepreneur, you by definition punish the job that would have been held by
the non-entrepreneur.
<P>
You can't have it both ways.  You can't say, well, let's just target --
we'll do a rifle shot.  Let's just shoot the one who is creative.  We won't
shoot the people who have jobs.  Guess what happens to all the jobs?  They
all disappear.  This is one of the most important psychological decisions
the country has to make.  Do you want jobs enough to create entrepreneurial
behaviors, in which case entrepreneurs will behave like entrepreneurs?  Or
do you dislike people who are successful enough that you'd rather punish
them even if the result is other people don't have jobs?  Because you can't
in a free society break out of that box.  It's one of the great formulas,
one of the great interesting conundrums of our time.
<P>
So you also want to remember that entrepreneurs create baby businesses.
It's not small businesses.  A baby business is a small business with a big
potential.  A lot of small businesses that start out small stay small and
want to be small.  People earning -- remember the McDonald brothers?  They
didn't want to become McDonald's, because it would have been too busy --
they'd have been too busy being managers.  They wanted three restaurants.
And so they said to Ray Kroc, you want to create McDonald's?  You create
it.  In fact, they didn't even want to do that until he talked them -- had
to literally talk them into it.  "please let me make you rich." You -- it
took him over a year, if you read his book "Grinding It Out."
<P>
So you're looking constantly for the baby business which is going to
explode.  Microsoft was always a baby business.  Federal Express started as
a baby business.  I mean, Fred Smith knew from the word "go" thiswas going
to be a world company.  Because it didn't make any sense as a Memphis
company.  In that framework, there are tremendous virtues of starting
small, thinking thoroughly, and combining patience with persistence.  I
mean, if somebody came to me and said, "how can I get to be truly wealthy
or truly successful," I would say literally, "start small, think things
through thoroughly and combine patience with persistence." That is,
patience is not being inactive.  Patience is being very active, but being
patiently very active.  Not allowing the frustration to stop you.
Entrepreneurship is a learned skill.
<P>
And again, I recommend -- I go back to Drucker's "Effective Executive." As
all of you know, I mention it often enough.  If you wanted to be an
entrepreneur, I'd start with "the Effective Executive," because the core
lessons of effectiveness are absolutely vital if you're going to be an
entrepreneur.  You combine this with a visionary sense of wanting to get
something done, a very strong ego, and a willingness to work very, very
hard.
<P>
Now let's look at one of the great entrepreneurs of our time, a man who
you'll be surprised as you see this how many things you relate to that he's
involved in, Norman Brinker.  I just want you to just listen to this and
maybe make notes about what you learn as you listen to it.
<P>
>>Whether it's his beloved game of polo or his magical success in business,<br>
>>Norman Brinker simply does not know how to lose.  Since he began running<br>
>>the Chili's restaurant chain in 1983, annual sales have soared from 30<br>
>>million to $500 million.  Before that, he turned around Burger King.  He<br>
>>ran Bennigan's, and, of course, he founded Steak and Ale.<br>
<br><br>
>>Ron McDougall: Norm is like one of these living legends they have in<br>
>>business.  There's very few of them around.  One of the things I learned<br>
>>from Norm is that you never stop trying, and you're not afraid to take a<br>
>>risk.  You try things.  If they don't work, you come back and try it<br>
>>again or you improve it, modify it, and attack again.<br>
<br>
>>Ross Perot: you walk into one of his restaurants and you can see<br>
>>everybody's faces just light up, and you realize that he treats people as<br>
>>equals, he treats people with dignity and respect.  He gets the very best<br>
>>out of people by treating them fairly.<br>
<br>
>>Who are we going to play first?  Him first, Uno?<br>
<br>
>>though horses have always been Brinker's first love, it was ironically<br>
>>the love of a horse that taught him how to be a good businessman when he<br>
>>was just a boy in Roswell, New Mexico.<br>
<br>
>>I can recall in the first grade where my friends were interested in<br>
>>bicycles, I was interested in -- I was interested in horses.  And was<br>
>>bound and determined someday to own a horse.  And so I went to work, I<br>
>>think, when I was 9 on a paper route in order to make some money to buy a<br>
>>horse.<br>
<br>
>>in 1964, after a management stint at Jack in the Box, he left to open his<br>
>>first restaurant, Brink's coffee shop in Dallas.<br>
<br>
>>Pete Schenkel: I can remember Norman waiting on tables in there.  He was<br>
>>the cashier, he was the cook.<br>
<br>
>>I knew Mr. .  Brinker.  He's nice.<br>
<br>
>>Pete Schenkel: he has enthusiasm that's just bubbling from the time he<br>
>>gets up in the morning until the time he goes to bed at night.<br>
<br>
>>Norman's enthusiasm led him to bigger things.  He started a restaurant<br>
>>chain called Steak and Ale.  He taught his waiters and waitresses to<br>
>>introduce themselves in a way that would soon be copied nationwide in the<br>
>>restaurant business.<br>
<br>
>>good afternoon.  My name is Mike.  I'm going to be your waiter today.<br>
<br>
>>Hi.<br>
<br>
>>How are you doing?<br>
<br>
>>Doing fine, thanks.<br>
<br>
>>At Steak and Ale, Brinker also created the first salad bar in a<br>
>>restaurant, which again would set a national trend.<br>
<br>
>>Norman Brinker: so I said okay, if I have a salad bar, that means as soon<br>
>>as you take an order, the customer can get up and get to a salad bar so<br>
>>he won't have to say, "well, what's happening? " And it avoided getting<br>
>>into the bread and butter appetizer business.<br>
<br>
>>Steak and Ale was an amazing success story.  It grew to 102 restaurants<br>
>>in 10 years and was worth $102 million when he sold it to the Pillsbury<br>
>>corporation in 1976.  As chairman of the Pillsbury restaurant group,<br>
>>Brinker oversaw such chains as Bennigan's and Burger King.  In the early<br>
>>'80s, Brinker led Burger King in a burger war against McDonald's, and<br>
>>eventually tripled the chain's profits.<br>
<br>
>>Norman Brinker: I learned early on that excitement makes a lot of<br>
>>difference in this business.  I'm not in the food business.  I'm in the<br>
>>entertainment business.  I'm in the fashion business, if you will, and we<br>
>>happen to serve food.<br>
<br>
>>despite his hectic schedule, Norman finds the time to meet with young<br>
>>people just beginning their career.<br>
<br>
>>Norman, what do you tell that 29-year-old who's worried about life right<br>
>>now?  What do you tell him or her is at the end of the entrepreneurial<br>
>>rainbow?<br>
<br>
>>Well, well, I tell them that there -- the neat thing about being an<br>
>>entrepreneur, there's no end to the rainbow.  It can go on into your 80s.<br>
>>But what I tell them, if you want to get there, you need to do a few<br>
>>things.  One is to know who you are, what you are, and what you really do<br>
>>enjoy.  You can't go "say, I'm going to do something because it makes a<br>
>>lot of money." You may do something -- if you go do something you are<br>
>>really good at, then the money may come.  And then I say, you ought to<br>
>>set a clear-cut set of goals to accomplish what you want and become very<br>
>>-- the very best in that line of business, and then go do something on<br>
>>your own.  And also, benchmarks along the way so that you know -- the<br>
>>people know who have accomplished a great deal is step by step by step.<br>
>>I see these people wandering around who are waiting for that big deal.<br>
>>That never happens.  It's step by step by step.<br>
<br>
>>so what do you all think?<br>
<br>
>>I've never heard the name before.<br><br>

>>Huh?<br><br>

>>That's wild.<br><br>

>>Why is it wild?<br><br>

>>I just had never heard the name before.  I didn't realize he was<br>
>>associated with all those things.<br>
<br>
>>Sounds like what my dad used to say, work hard.  Nothing's free.  Just<br>
>>work for it slow and steady.<br>
<br>
>>How about the rest of you?  What is your reaction?<br><br>

>>well, he had a vision for a restaurant, and he was willing to take his<br>
>>time, bide his time, and, well, as we said just a second ago,<br>
>>persistence, and persistence paid off.  Look at what he's got.<br>
<br>
>>Wasn't his real vision to own a horse?<br>
<br>
>>yeah.  What did he say was the most important -- I mean, I think this one<br>
>>tape could be an entire class.<br>
<br>
>>I believe he said the most important thing was to enjoy it.<br><br>

>> right.<br><br>

>>Enjoy what you're doing.<br><br>

>>Notice how this breaks out of all of the regulatory -- I mean, think<br>
>>about how we do first grade, second grade, third grade, you are a child,<br>
>>don't be an adult.  I mean, look at Brinker, and we've seen this in a<br>
>>couple of other cases.  When does Brinker start growing up?  Huh?<br>
<br>
>>Never.<br><br>

>>When there's something he wants.<br><br>

>>What did you say?<br><br>

>>I said, "never." I think he's still a kid.<br><br>

>>that's right.  On the one hand he's still a kid, and yet when did he<br>
>>start doing what we think of as an adult thing?<br>
<br>
>>9 years old.<br>
<br>
>>9.  At 9 years of age he gets his first job, so that you can say, "oh,<br>
>>gee, we've sure made him become an adult too early, and I'll bet he's a<br>
>>workaholic and he's terribly repressed." On the other, hand what is he<br>
>>doing in the film?  He's running around playing with ponies.  I mean, I<br>
>>saw Brinker three weeks ago.  He'd hurt his leg again playing polo.  But<br>
>>notice how different this is from the regulatory, organized,<br>
>>control-dominated welfare state model.  Here is a guy who is a kid in his<br>
>>50s or 60s and was an adult at 9.  And that's not right.  I mean, you<br>
>>have to choose, because remember, go back to the model.  It's static,<br>
>>orderly, planable.  And yet why did he do it?  For a pony.  Can you<br>
>>imagine the adults who will say, "well, that's a silly reason to work."<br>
>>Wasn't.  That's what he wanted.  In a free society, he was pursuing<br>
>>happiness at 9 years of age.  Notice how inventive he is.<br>
<br>
Somebody said to me the other day, six million people work in restaurants
he helped create ormanage.  Now, he wouldn't count as a job creator, of
course.  He's just some rich guy playing polo.  But just think about the
notion.  And think about the inventions.  How much money would you guess we
make from Japan out of Burger King?  It's a substantial currency earner for
us, as is McDonald's and as is the others.
<P>
My point here is a couple.  I mean, I want to really try to show you how
different the model is.  One, people ought to work in terms of their own
voluntary doing things so they have money, so they get to play games they
want when they want to, as early as they want to.  I am not calling for the
end of child labor laws, okay?
<P>
>>Sounds like it.
<P>
>>Right.  I mean, I just want to make clear, because otherwise they'll be<br>
>>grotesquely distorted.  But think about what Brinker's saying here.  Two,<br>
>>what should you do?  You ought to do what you like doing, so people say,<br>
>>"I need to go see a career counselor." Maybe.  Maybe you just need to go<br>
>>get a career.  How will you know it's the career you'll want?  You'll go<br>
>>try it.  Notice his attitude towards innovation.  What did the other guy<br>
>>say?  Try it.  I mean, don't hire 12 consultants, think about it for<br>
>>three and a half years, and maybe do it.  You've got a good idea, go try<br>
>>it.  If it works, keep it.  If it doesn't work, rethink it.  Remember the<br>
>>Edison line the other week about the first 4,000 experiments?  It was not<br>
>>a failure.  What did he say?<br>
<br>
>>a good start.<br><br>

>>And why?<br><br>

>>Because those were 4,000 things that he knew didn't work.<br><br>

>>right, 4,000 things you know won't work, so we're beginning to narrow it<br>
>>down.  Notice the psychological attitude.  Very entrepreneurial.  I have<br>
>>a good friend of mine, Tom Kershaw, who owns the Hampshire house, which<br>
>>is the site of "Cheers" in Boston.  He was a engineer with an MBA from<br>
>>Harvard doing engineering MBA things, and he wasn't happy, and he went to<br>
>>see a guy and he said, "I'm not happy." And the guy said, "what do you<br>
>>like to do? " And he said, "you mean -- what do you mean? " He said,<br>
>>"tell me, what do you like to do? " He said, "I love hanging out with<br>
>>people, you know, and when I get off work, I go and I hang out with<br>
>>people." And the guy said, "so why aren't you hanging out with people?" <br>
>>He said, "because that's what I do after work." And the guy said, "but is<br>
>>it what you like doing? " He said, "yeah.  "I love it.  "and I thrive on<br>
>>it.  "it's me." He said, "so where might you hang out with people? " So<br>
>>he opened a bar and restaurant.  He opened the first discotheque in the<br>
>>United States.  I mean, he opened the Hawk and -- or the Bull and Finch,<br>
>>which is the site of "Cheers," and he was doing reasonably well, and then<br>
>>"Cheers" came along and then he was doing disgustingly well.  But he's<br>
>>doing well at what he likes doing.<br>
<br>
Now, why is that important?  Because -- this is, again, one of the things
you can't get across in a welfare state -doing anything well is
time-consuming and hard.  There are no serious things worth doing that you
can do easily.  That, by the way, is a great speech by Tom Hanks in "a
League of Their Own" at the very end of the movie.  It's well worth renting
the movie just to see that one speech.  So if you're going to do something
really well, you're going to have to do it a lot.  If you're going to have
to do it a lot, you'd better like it or you're going to hate your life.
And that means you've got to have courage to just go be yourself.  Now,
being yourself doesn't mean, you know, leaning back and saying, "well,
world, take care of me, because after all, I'm me." It means energetically,
aggressively live your life out being you in a way which is productive.
And "productive" doesn't have to mean you want to get rich.
<P>
But you should -- you should make consistent series of deals with yourself
where you, as a mature adult, this includes at 9, you want a pony?  Work.
There ain't nothing wrong with that.  Except, of course -- and we'll get
into this next week -- if you're in the welfare system and you work and you
save for the pony, they take the money because it's illegal.  You put your
family in the wrong class.  This happened in Wisconsin to a woman who'd
saved $3,000 for her daughter's education.  They forced her to spend the
money.  So it's a totally -- I cannot overstate it is a totally different
world view.  The entrepreneurial, world market oriented, dynamic system is
a totally different world view from the static, passive, and regulated
welfare state.  And it's not about little changes down here.  It's about a
fundamentally different way of doing things.
<P>
Let me put it differently, entrepreneurship is a whole range of skills,
attitudes, habits, and knowledge.  It's a complete package.  It's like
trying to learn to be a ballerina or trying to learn to be a football
quarterback and saying, "okay, practice throwing your arm." That's not what
it is.  It's a totality of things.  Or practicing standing on one leg to be
a ballerina.  That's not what it is.  It's a totality.  It's a gestalt.
Bureaucrats focus on control and process.  Entrepreneurs focus on
liberating, creating, solving, they focus on results.  It's hard to get
more different.  Bureaucrats see a static world in which numbers count.
Entrepreneurs see a dynamic world in which people count.
<P>
So bureaucrats in the static world are very risk averse; whereas, Norman
Brinker figures, hey, people are resilient.  Go try it out.  If it doesn't
work, get up off the ground and try it again.  You'll survive.  It's a
totally different mind set.  The welfare state's despised low-paying job is
the entrepreneur's great learning opportunity, first rung on the ladder of
opportunity.  It is a beginning, not an ending.  It is dynamic, not a trap.
And it is hopeful, not depressing.
<P>
I mean, you can't get a -- all of you've heard the phrase said with
contempt, "oh, that's just a hamburger flipping job." That sentence said
that way tells you everything about which world view the person's in.  That
is a static, welfare state world.  Because, in fact, to say, "wow, I got my
first job, I'm on my way," doesn't matter what your first job is.  It
matters where your first job leads.
<P>
Now, to prove that, let me give you another example, and that is a really
interesting film that McDonald's did.  McDonald's is the largest job
training system in the world.  More people learn how to work at McDonald's
than anywhere else in the world.  But, I mean, literally when you walk in
the door.  Let's show the McDonald's thing.
<P>
>>Teri Goudie: the day I walked in there to apply for the job, I must have<br>
>>walked by the place six times.  I was 15 and a half, very shy.  When I<br>
>>went in and I got the job, I think it was the first notch in my<br>
>>self-confidence.  It helped me bring it out of it.<br>
<br>
>> William Morris: I worked at several McDonald's.  I worked as a<br>
>>16-year-old.  I had my first job at a McDonald's, and then I worked my<br>
>>way through college at McDonald's, and then after we were married and had<br>
>>our first child, I supplemented my income working in a McDonald's.<br>
<br>
>>Michael Perez: if I wasn't in the entertainment field, I would definitely<br>
>>seek a position at McDonald's.<br>
<br>
>>Michelle Sarkesian: the manager that I worked with was really nice.  He<br>
>>was really flexible for me as far as when I needed to work.  "oh, come in<br>
>>when you can.  "we'll arrange, you know, the schedule."<br>
<br>
>>I learned how to coordinate things, just teamwork, you know.  That was<br>
>>very important at McDonald's.  Everything was like one, two, three,<br>
>>clockwork.  And I learned a lot of responsibility as a person and<br>
>>responsibility as far as coping with others.<br>
<br>
>>Brian Welch: McDonald's showed me a lot of responsibility and teamwork,<br>
>>which is important as a firefighter and cooking hamburgers.<br>
<br>
>>Tim Wilcox: benefits that I derived from working at McDonald's was<br>
>>primarily a steady income in order to pay my bills so I could eventually<br>
>>become an airline pilot so I could go through flight school and college.<br>
>>Second, it was a flexible working schedule where they worked their<br>
>>schedule around me.  And third most, it was fun.  I still keep in touch<br>
>>with the people I worked with back then as now, and we're still as good<br>
>>friends after working two years together.<br>
<br>
>>I've served in the Illinois Senate, I served as mayor of a major city in<br>
>>Illinois, and I now work as an officer in one of the major banks in the<br>
>>country, and in all of those careers, McDonald's experience is an<br>
>>important part of the fabric of my life.  It taught me things that I've<br>
>>been able to use, and obviously, working in government and politics and<br>
>>now in sort of a sales role, it helped me learn how to identify people,<br>
>>see what their interest is, and try to deal with that interest.<br>
<br>
>>And no matter what you're going to go into, what career you're going to<br>
>>decide upon, the principles you learn there you can take anywhere.  And<br>
>>you can learn a lot by the corporation as a whole, to watch how they do<br>
>>their day-to-day business.  And the managers will let you in on that.<br>
>>They'll show you how they do the books.  They'll show you how to do<br>
>>inventory.  I was exposed to all those things so when I went into the<br>
>>corporate world, I didn't feel like I was a stranger to it.<br>
<br>
>>What's the first thing you learn in your first job?  What's the most<br>
>>important -- what's the most important first thing?<br>
<br>
>>responsibility.<br>
<br>
>>Show up for work.<br><br>

>>To show up.  Again, to show up.  See, again, this is one of the things<br>
>>that academics and the welfare state don't get.  Most of what you have to<br>
>>learn is not preprinted in some neat, orderly program done by a Ph. D. .<br>
>>I say this even though I'm a Ph. D. .  Most of it is learned in the<br>
>>richness and depth of life.  Number one thing about going to work is<br>
>>going to work.  What's the number two thing about going to work?<br>
<br>
>>going to work again.<br><br>

>>No.<br><br>

>>Carrying out tasks.<br><br>

>>Huh?<br><br>

>>Going to work again.<br><br>

>>Carrying out your tasks.<br><br>

>>Carrying out your tasks, because -- and this is very important if you've<br>
>>never -- and this is one of the things we don't get, which we'll get into<br>
>>next week, about how do you replace the culture of poverty with the<br>
>>culture of productivity.  First you've got to learn, I don't feel good.<br>
>>Go to work.  But I'm having a big fight with my girlfriend.  Go to work.<br>
>>My boss wasn't nice to me yesterday.  Go to work.  The customer didn't<br>
>>respect me and appreciate the way I gave them the hamburger.  Go to work.<br>
>>Learn.  Grow up.  Now I'm at work.  I don't feel like being at work.  I<br>
>>want to go talk to my girlfriend who I am fighting with.  Stay at work.<br>
<br><br>
My older daughter went to work for Delta several summers.  One of the first
-- and it's great.  I watched her grow.  I watched her go through this.
And she had this wonderful guy who probably was totally politically
incorrect, although he was probably saved because he was black.  But he was
physically huge.  My daughter's not.  She's about five- four.  And he said
to her the first week, "you show up or I'll kill you." This is clearly a
litigatable statement.  Kathy said to me, "I'm convinced, I'm showing up."
I'm not -- and they had a rule, one of the jobs she had that summer down at
the Atlanta airport was she met the 5-year-old who was flying who had to
change planes.  Losing the 5-year-old was an automatic fireable offense.
And it was very -- but think about this, because it's so opposite of the
welfare state mentality.  They had to get into this college kid's head,
we're really serious about this.  You can't lose a 5-year-old in the middle
of an airport.  The child could get killed.  They could get kidnapped.  Bad
things could happen to them.  Hold their hand.  Don't talk to your
girlfriend.  Don't think about your boyfriend.  Pay attention to the little
kid.
<P>
Now, when you're 18, 19 years of age or more, you're 16, you've grown up in
poverty, nobody near you has ever had a job, you don't know anybody who's
been to work every day and stayed all day.  There is no one in your
personal experience who's done it.  The first thing you've got to do is
have a job.  Any job beats a theoretical academic, let me hold your hand, I
hope you'll come most mornings, 70% is a passing grade.  I mean, what's a
passing grade at McDonald's?  It's close to 100%, isn't it?  You walk in,
you say, "I want an Egg McMuffin." Guess what you want?  I mean, what's
your reaction if you say, "I want an Egg McMuffin and they give you
something else?  It's 100% wrong, right?  So anything below 100% is a
failing grade.
<P>
Now, they've been through the school system where if you have 65% but your
grandmother's been sick and you've really got a good excuse and, well,
we'll give you a "C" because we don't want to make you feel bad.  You go
into the real world of real business where you're dealing with real money
and real customers, it's 100%.  And, now, nobody's 100%, so it's 99. 97.
But it ain't much slack.  Now, when you're on the customer side, you don't
give any slack.  Isn't that right?  I mean, what's your reaction?  You want
your order and then you give them cash.  You want the exact change.  You
don't want within 5%.  Hey, an "A's" within 5%.  Why are you mad at me?
<P>
I mean, just think about it.  The whole academic setting is nuts in terms
of teaching people about the real world of interacting in the real
marketplace, and so what happens?  You create the first hamburger flipping
job.  The kid shows up.  At a McDonald's, they don't start by flipping
hamburgers.  They start by cleaning the place up.  Now you've reduced them
to a janitor.  How can you have -- how can you lack dignity and be out
there pushing a broom?  And the answer, of course, is if you're smart,
because it is the first step to a career in which you'll know how to go to
work, you'll know how to earn a living, you'll know how to work in a team,
you'll know how to manage others, you'll know how to deal with customers,
and what's the result?  You'll have a better future.  But unless you have a
dynamic view in which you see life taking off, if you have a static view,
"we've now trapped this poor person and they're not going to ever have any
future at all because you forced them to go to work," and that's sort of
the core distinction.
<P>
It's a very deep distinction.  And when we come back after the break, we're
going to look at, how does this apply to America in the world market?
<P>
(break)
<P>
>>All right.  Let me recap for a second the notion of the entrepreneurial<br>
>>dynamic model in which we emphasize growth and learning and focusing on<br>
>>the future.  You can summarize it, I think, pretty simply.  It's not who<br>
>>you are today, it's who you want to be tomorrow that counts in America.<br>
>>And I, frankly, would argue that when we pick up on welfare next week and<br>
>>on the culture of poverty, that that's the core weakness in the way we<br>
>>deal with the problem today.<br>
<br>
We don't emphasize with people, tell us who you want to be.  Don't tell us
about your problems.  Don't tell us about your past.  Don't tell us about
your weaknesses.  Tell us who you want to be, and now let's figure out what
strengths and skills you need to get to be that person, and let's go to
work on them.  It's a very different attitude.  It's an attitude of
opportunity focus rather than victim.  Excuse me.
<br><br>
Now, at the vision level, what we're suggesting is that a successful
America will have the highest value-added jobs with the greatest
productivity leading to the greatest take-home pay, and the greatest job
security.  That is, the way you get job security is not by blocking the
world market, it's by winning in the world market.  Let me put it a little
differently.  And I think that Morris Schechtman's book "Working Without a
Net" -- which I've told him I think is mistitled.  I think he's really
talking about creating your own net rather than relying on big systems for
a net.  But his idea's essentially right, and that is that real security is
based on real productivity and real economic growth.
<P>
So real security is based on real change.  It's the security of a kayaker
in a white water river who is paying attention and negotiating the changes.
It's very different from what people think of.  People really say, "gee,
can I build a castle where I can stop and rest? " And the answer's no.
What you can do is you can think through and you can build assets and you
can build resources, and obviously, if you're prudent and careful, you can
build a lot of resources for your old age.  But during your working years,
you have to dynamically interface with a world that is changing.
<P>
One of the ways to measure that is to look at how in each generation who is
succeeding changes.  For example, if you looked at Henry Ford in 1905, or
Alfred Sloan in 1922, or Bill Gates today, each of them, in a sense, was a
man of the future, but the question is, who's tomorrow's men of the future?
Gates is now an established figure.  He's been around for 10 or 12 years.
He's, in a sense, yesterday's great success story.  Not that he's not
important, not that he's not powerful, but Microsoft is now in some ways
what IBM was 30 years ago.
<P>
So what's the next Microsoft?  And it may well be in biotechnology,
frankly.  But it's this concept that what you're always looking for is not
some static academic, planned, structured investment.  What you're looking
for is the dynamic, creative, entrepreneurial energy and drive that meets
the marketplace, and what you want to do, in a sense, is given this vision
of winning in the world market, creating local jobs through world sales,
you need to set up a series of strategies.
<P>
Now, what we're trying to do now is build strategies that come out of our
vision, which is an entrepreneurial vision, so the strategies will be very
different than the strategies that bureaucrats and academics would create
in a welfare state vision.  It's very important to understand why they're
so different.  Remember I drew earlier, and I want to go back and remind
you.  The core theme here, and the same thing will come up next week, is
that the vision is dramatically different up here at the top.  Therefore,
the strategies, even if they look similar, are, in fact, relating to a very
different vision.  Therefore, the projects, even if they might be identical
in form, are inside of different strategies, which relate to a different
vision.
<P>
And so finally, what you're doing tactically, for example, presumably even
in a welfare state restaurant you would be nice when the customer walked
in, presumably, although you might take the attitude of a government-run
cafeteria and compare it to the attitude of a restaurant where if they're
not nice, you don't come back.  But presumably, they would try to create
the same tactic.  Please be nice to the customer.  Please wash the plates.
<P>

But the whole underlying model of reward and incentive, the whole
expectation, is different in the two systems.  One of the strategies is to
reward success at job creation and keep resources with job creators.
<P>
Now, this refers back both to the lessons of American history and to
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  That what you want to do is you want to
reward success at job creation, you want to keep resources with job
creators.  It also means, in terms of looking back at personal strength as
a pillar, what you'll say to people is, if you don't have a job right now,
have you considered creating one?  Have you considered calling Amway or
Tupperware or Mary Kay or beauty control or any one over 100 systems?  Have
you considered going out and starting your own small business?
<P>
But don't say automatically, I can't get a job, there is no job, I'm
hopeless.  Please let me be a victim for a while.  Totally different
attitudes.  Second, you want to strengthen the family for an economic
reason, families create human capital.  The most important bankers in
development are families.  Because somebody comes to you and says, I need a
little bit of money to finish college, or I need a little bit of money to
open up my store, or I need a little bit of money to do something else.
<P>
Why do we see such a rapid rise of Asian families?  Because they are
extended networks of capital accumulation.  You can have 20 or 30 or 40
families that say, cousin, you know, Sam has got a great idea.  Let's each
of us kick in a little bit.  And then cousin Sam does well, and now cousin
Sam is part of the extended bank.  It's a family bank.  And so extended fami
lies and strong families are major sources of capital development.  And by
the way, guess where most learning takes place?  Inside the family.
<P>
So when you see the collapse of the family and when you see a society which
tolerates totally self-centered, destructive parents, I mean, parents who
have not got a clue why they're parenting, that haven't got a clue how to
educate their child, they haven't got a clue about being responsible and
you tolerate that, and you think, "well, that poor victim," who is, of
course, now creating new victims, you are cheating yourself of a major
capital resource, which is the human beings of the next generation.  So
when you end up with kids who don't know how to clean up after themselves,
don't know how to study, don't know how to be disciplined, don't know how
to be nice to anybody, don't know how to interact with other human beings
and have had nobody in their immediate family do anything to teach them,
the burden you put on the school system is hopeless.
<P>
Because most learning doesn't occur in a classroom.  Most learning occurs
in a family environment and in a neighborhood environment.  And until we
are honest about that, we're not going to solve it.  Now, if you really
want loss of jobs -- and this is exactly counter-intuitive to the welfare
state.  It's the exact opposite of the welfare state.  If you really want
lots of jobs, what you do is you cut taxes on job creation.  You really
want to increase the employment factor for the marginally unemployed, for
black inner city kids and American Indians on a reservation, and poor
whites in west Virginia?  Cut out all the taxes.  Say, you hire that
person, you don't have to pay FICA.  You don't have to pay income tax.  You
don't have to pay unemployment compensation.  Just pay them straight.  You
see, the minimum wage isn't the minimum wage.  Minimum wage is gross pay,
and it's not real cost, because you have to add all the extra taxes.
<P>
Jim Longley told me the other day, the congressman from Maine, that there
are nine taxes in Maine when you hire somebody.  So you're paying the
surface amount plus the other taxes, and the person isn't even getting the
surface amount, and so if you really wanted to hire the hard-core
unemployed, you'd say, for anybody who fits in this zone, there are no
taxes if you hire them.  And overnight they become more employable.
Because the cost of walking in the door and teaching them what we talked
about the last hour -- show up, stay here, serve the customer, work with
the rest of the team -- the cost would drop dramatically, and so you could
begin to afford to bring them on board.  But notice how counter-intuitive
it is to say, in terms of the welfare state, let's cut taxes on the very
entrepreneurs, who are the people that the welfare state most wants to tax.
And yet if you want to create jobs, what you say to people is, go create
jobs.  If you're a big winner, if you employ 3,000 people, we'll make you a
big winner.  And suddenly you have an explosion of human energy trying to
find a way to have more people at work.  Similarly, you want to reward
investments and productivity.
<P>
I mean, how do you compete in the world market?  You have the most
productive work force.  I recently did a TV show with one of the wealthiest
men in Mexico, and I said -- you know, he said he wanted to go into the
beeper business, you know, where somebody - - does anybody here have a
beeper?  Okay, you've got one here, a pager, over there, okay.  I said, "so
are you going to manufacture them? " He said, "no." He said, "we can't
afford to." That the beepers are now made so efficiently in the U. S.  --
which is what the Japanese also discovered.  It's why Motorola dominates
the Japanese market, that we're going to buy American beepers, pagers.
<P>
Now, if you reward investments and productivity and you dominate
production, if you make it cheap to be productive, you have a whole
different attitude, which means you want very low taxes on investment, you
want very low taxes on new machinery.  You want very low taxes on new
computers and new software.  So you can have the finest inventory control
in the world.  It's a totally different attitude than, well, they're making
money.  Let's raise their taxes.  That's a source of money.  Sure it's a
source of money.  What it does is you then slow down the very investments
that make you productive that allow you to hire people that create the
jobs.
<P>
You want to encourage entrepreneurs and job creation by giving
self-employed and small business the same tax breaks as big business.  We
currently do two or three examples that are just -- I mean, you have to
wonder how out of touch with reality we could be.  Big business, you buy
health insurance.  You get 100% deductibility.  Until last week, you bought
insurance as a small business, you got no deductibility.  We passed 25%
deductibility.  It ought to be 100.  Big business has all sorts of tax
breaks that little businesses can never get to be large enough to take
advantage of.  The home office deduction.
<P>
If you're going into a Third Wave information age, you should be
encouraging the home office deduction.  Instead, we're piling so much red
tape on it, we discourage it.  I was told by somebody the other day that it
almost guarantees you'll be audited if you list a home office.  That's the
opposite of sound behavior.  So you want to think about, how do you reward
the kind of investments, and how do you reward them for the self-employed,
for the person who's out there on their own?  We probably ought to design a
system where the self-employed have an I. R. A.  That is their version of
unemployment compensation.  In other words, you want to literally make it
easy to build your own safety net.  Which is the opposite of welfare state
policies, which is to raise your taxes so the bureaucracy has the money so
the bureaucracy decides whether or not you're safe.
<P>
Now, you want to encourage entrepreneurial learning.  That's why I strongly
favor, for summer teenage employment, that they work at real jobs in real
businesses.  I mean, if my choice is to give the money to the city
recreation program to have them come and play basketball or to give the
same money and vouchers to small businesses to hire them to do real work, I
want them, as teenagers, learning to do real work.  I want them in real
businesses, dealing with real customers, working for a real boss, learning
how to keep -- you know, and it's because it's not a just for me.
<P>
And again, I'm not undervaluing.  I mean, my son-in-law's a coach, and I
believe deeply in the value of sports, and I learned a great number of
things playing high school football that helped me get through my whole
career.  There are lots of things you can learn playing sports.  I'm for
playing sports.  But I'm even more for making summer employment real.  And
that doesn't mean just, you know, painting down at city hall because your
cousin the city councilman got you a cushy job.  I'm talking about getting
people out there in the real world, dealing with real customers, and
learning something that's very, very different.
<P>
It also means, I think, reestablishing apprenticeships in a big way.  We
have taken far too much of learning out of the marketplace and put it into
academic environments.  There are a tremendous number of things you learn
best by being an apprentice because they're too complicated, they're too
much a matter of judgment to learn them in a classroom.  The classroom
breaks things down and makes it artificial.  Makes it too easy, for one
thing.  It makes it too slow, and people like Michelangelo were
apprentices.  I mean he became a great sculptor and great artist because he
was apprentice to one of the great artists of his time.  Benjamin Franklin
was an apprentice.
<P>
And there's a great virtue, I think, to rebonding entrepreneurs to the
young by having apprenticeships that may start as early as 16 or 17.  If
you have somebody who isn't good in an academic setting and they don't like
sitting around and they don't want to take notes and they won't do their
homework, maybe part of the answer is to figure out an apprenticeship where
they go out and they do real work and earn real money, and then at 25 they
decide to go to night school or they go to weekend school.  But you want to
get them into doing things in a structured environment with a master
craftsman or a master -- and the master craftsman may just run the dry
cleaner, but learning to run a dry cleaner to earn a living is a heck of a
lot better than being a dropout sitting on the street corner.  So it's a
totally different way of seeing things.
<P>
Another thing we ought to do absolutely is change unemployment compensation
to retraining.  We should not give money to people so that they can bass
fish and deer hunt.  I mean, if you don't have a job and you need
unemployment compensation, fine, what are you going to learn during the
week that we're paying you?  And if you're not willing to learn something,
why are we paying you?
<P>
I think it's very important conceptually that you've got to have this
attitude of saying to people, we're going to have a partnership, but you
have to be involved in it.  You have to have a responsibility for it.  If
you look at it from that standpoint, let's look at workmen's comp.
<P>
We ought to turn workmen's compensation into assessment, retraining, and
investment.  Today, all too often, workmen's comp is the lawyer's gravy
train to file the suit to get money for the person who then expects to do
nothing.  You can't have a healthy society where you are -- where you're
encouraging litigation and where more money goes to the administrative
process than goes to rehabilitation.  What you want to say to somebody --
and by the way, very often the lawyer will say, "don't go and get
rehabilitated until after we're done with the trial."
<P>
Now, I want you to think about how dumb this is.  I mean, how dumb is it to
say -- if I can draw down here without confusing you for a second -here is
an accident right here.  What we should do is the next day, we should
assess and begin rehabilitation.  Instead, in the welfare state model,
first you have to go to trial.  So we have delayed fixing your problem so
that your problem may well get substantially worse or you may harden into
it.  You've lost all this intermediate income, because after all, you have
to prove that you have to be -that you've had this problem.
<P>
So even though we live in a computer age where we probably can retrain you
and you probably can be back productively at work in a relatively short
time, and you probably could get modest compensation, but the primary
purpose of workmen's comp was not to get you compensation.  It was to get
you an ability to get retrained and rehabilitated.  So this is exactly the
opposite of common sense.  I mean, take --
<P>
>>excuse me for interrupting, but -- and at the same time, as the employer,<br>
>>I'm being taxed and beaten to death for my insurance company to turn back<br>
>>around and just settle out of court.<br>
<P>
>>Right.
<P>
>>My rates go up, and nothing has happened.  We're still waiting to go to
trial.
<P>
>>What you should have is immediate rehabilitation.  Now, rehabilitation<br>
>>means you pay the doctor, you pay the therapist, you might buy a computer<br>
>>or you might buy whatever equipment they need.  Those dollars today go to<br>
>>the bureaucrat and the lawyer.<br><br>

>>they get paid first.<br><br>

>>Not in that order either.<br><br>

>>Not in that order, right.  Well, the bureaucrat actually is there all the<br>
>>time, so they get their money.<br>

>>let's go back one, though.  Isn't unemployment -- isn't that moneys that<br>
>>have already been paid by the employee?<br>
<br>
>>right.<br><br>

>>And if that is the case, isn't it inherently wrong to make them work<br>
>>twice for the money that they've already earned once?<br>
<br>
>>no.  Because we compel you to pay a tax collectively.  It's not money you<br>
>>personally -- we compel people to pay a tax collectively into an<br>
>>insurance fund for unemployment.  And my point to you is, if the goal of<br>
>>that fund is to help you get employment, I mean, it's not called the<br>
>>"vacation fund."<br><br>

>>Right.  No, I understand, that but by the same token, if you've paid into<br>
>>unemployment all your life and you find yourself unemployed and you're<br>
>>going to go bass fishing for three months, collect your unemployment<br>
>>before you're ready to come back into it.<br><br>

>>You didn't pay it.  Your employer paid it.<br><br>

>>you didn't pay it.  And everybody around you paid it.  Why should we as a<br>
>>society -- I mean, look, if you want us to set up a bass fishing fund,<br>
>>I'm not against bass fishing.  I mean, dick is a close friend of mine,<br>
>>fishes all the time.  I'm not personally into bass fishing, but I'm not<br>
>>against it, but we don't have a bass fishing fund.<br><br>

>>Right.  I understand --<br><br>

>>we have an unemployment compensation -- let me tell you how I got to<br>
>>this.  At villa Rica high school about eight, nine years ago, I went to a<br>
>>graduation, a man walked up to me after graduation and he said, "my<br>
>>daughter graduated tonight.  "I'm glad your here." He said, "I worked at<br>
>>the General Motors plant at Lakewood.  "they laid me off four years ago,<br>
>>and "they paid me supplemental pay, which was 95% for four years.  "and I<br>
>>thought that the plant would re-open.  "and now it's not going to<br>
>>re-open, and my supplemental pay runs out in two months.  "what should I<br>
>>do? " The signal we had sent to him was, wait.<br><br>

>>Right.<br><br>

>>Okay, in other words, let me try to draw it differently for a second.<br>
>>Okay, laid off.  In the old days, the theory was you got -- and it was<br>
>>actually a game rigged by the unions and by the big manufacturers.  You<br>
>>could have unemployment compensation so the government would pay you<br>
>>during the layoff until you were recalled, okay?  This assumes a national<br>
>>cyclical model where your company's not downsizing.  That is, it assumed,<br>
>>"oh, we'll be off for six weeks.  "let's go bass fishing."<br><br>

>>Right.<br><br>

>>You don't live in that world anymore.  Your job may be gone.  And we<br>
>>can't afford to spend money on you unless we get something for the money,<br>
>>and that fund is a government fund.  This is a tax.  This is not your<br>
>>voluntary vacation fund.  This is a compulsory tax.<br>
<br>
>>But unemployment still should be discernible from welfare.
<br><br>
>> of course it should.
<br><br>
>>Okay.
<br><br>
>>But my point is, if we're going to give you -- if you need unemployment<br>
>>compensation, you should use the free time you now have, because by<br>
>>definition, you're unemployed --<br>
<br>
>>right.
<br><br>
>>-- You should use that time to learn something.  If you are not learning<br>
>>something, we are wasting our capital base, because this person comes<br>
>>over to here, there is no recall.  Now they turn to you and say, "gee, I<br>
>>just got four" -- in this case it was four years, and most of the time<br>
>>it's 26 weeks -- "I just got 26 weeks of money paid for by a tax fund.<br>
>>"I didn't do anything.  "now would you please retrain me? " Well, why are<br>
>>we wasting 26 weeks of your life, and why are we wasting 26 weeks of tax<br>
>>money and not retraining you starting right here?  Because our assumption<br>
>>has to be that every adult has to learn their whole life.  Which is a<br>
>>totally different model.  The old model was, "hey, I've already learned<br>
>>to work in the steel mill.  "why are you bothering?  "the steel mill will<br>
>>re-open in a couple weeks and I'll go back to work." This was the classic<br>
>>industrial cycle for about 80 years.  It died in the '80s.  The world<br>
>>market crushed it.  And now you're into a totally different model where<br>
>>people -- because of the information age, people are going to have to<br>
>>have some level of learning all the time, and if you took all of the<br>
>>money we're spending on unemployment compensation and made that, in<br>
>>effect, "yes, we'll give you unemployment compensation, and by the way,<br>
>>while you're unemployed, learn something so you're more employable," we<br>
>>would have substantially in the last 10 years increased the intellectual<br>
>>capital base of the society.  Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
>>the ultimate cost to the consumer, if that were made as part of the cost<br>
>>of an ultimate product or service, is very significant.  When people<br>
>>start thinking that the employee is paying, no.  The consumer's paying<br>
>>that.<br><br>

>>Furthermore, the cost to the human being.  I mean, I felt terrible for<br>
>>this man.  We had sent him a signal as a society to do nothing with his<br>
>>life, to waste his life for four years.  And he was terrified.  And yet<br>
>>-- common sense cues off the culture.  I mean, if the culture says, "why<br>
>>are you being stupid?  "this is your time to go on vacation," and again,<br>
>>I have relatives out of heavy industry areas who felt it was unpatriotic<br>
>>to go back to work early.  "I've got 13 more weeks left, and deer<br>
>>season's about to open.  "why would I go back to work now? " This is not<br>
>>apocryphal.  I personally have relatives who have done that.<br><br>

>>but that obviously -- that obviously won't work.  I mean --<br><br>

>> it did work.<br><br>

>>You don't have --<br><br>

>>it worked for 70 years.<br><br>

>>But it didn't work because we're in the decay that we're in right now, so<br>
>>obviously --<br><br>

>>no, but it worked for the individual.<br><br>

>>It's not competitive --<br><br>

>>huh?<br><br>

>>It wasn't competitive collectively.  I mean --<br><br>

>>that's right.  As a society, it's not competitive.  Even if it's okay for<br>
>>an individual and for an individual to carry to the extreme of the guy in<br>
>>villa Rica, it's disastrous.<br><br>

>>but when we're forced to face the Japanese model, we lose.<br>

>> well, but we're in a more competitive world.  So I'm trying -one of the<br>
>>strategic things we're trying to do is find every opportunity to use<br>
>>resources more intensely.  So if we pay you for unemployment, we also get<br>
>>you trained.  It's a constant matrix so that every time we get a chance,<br>
>>we're doing two or three things at once with the same resource, because<br>
>>you can't compete in the world market if you're sloppy with either your<br>
>>human or your financial or your physical resources.  You've got to have<br>
>>all of them working together if you're going to keep up with China and<br>
>>Japan and Germany.<br>
<br>
Now, let me also suggest to you that this is why you have to replace
welfare with a work requirement.  That you absolutely have to establish the
assertion that work is the preeminent -- is a preeminent American
characteristic, and that we expect people to work, period.  If you're
able-bodied, if you're under the age of retirement, you should work.  And
that goes back to Jamestown, 1607.
<P>
Now, we also should be -- if we're going to compete in the world market, we
should eliminate jobs -- government policies that kill jobs.  And one I
want to focus on for a minute, because it's so fascinating, is create a
common sense legal system through liability reform.  Edwards Deming picked
on litigation as one of the two major impediments to American
competitiveness in the world market, and "U. S.  News" last year put
together, I thought, a very interesting list.  What they did is they took a
product you buy, they showed you the retail price, they then showed you the
cost to retailer -- or the cost that it would be without the cost of
insurance and litigation.
<P>
Just look at these, because they're fascinating.  Eight-foot aluminum
ladder.  Retail price, $119.  True cost, 95.  Litigation tax, $24.  On a
$119 ladder.  Heart pacemaker, $18,000 retail.  True cost, 15,000.
Litigation tax, 3,000.  Two-day maternity stay.  Retail price, 3,367.  True
cost, 2,867.  Litigation tax, $500.  Tonsillectomy, retail price, 578.
True cost, 387.  Litigation tax, 191.  In that case, it's almost one-third
of the total.  Motorized wheelchair, $1,000.  And these are all "U. S.
News'" numbers.  True cost, 830.  Litigation tax, 170.
<P>
>>one-third is going to litigation?
<P>
>>For manufactured goods and for health-related goods.  It's higher in<br>
>>those areas.  But it's -- there's a significant distortion in the system,<br>
>>I mean.  And you can tell this when you turn on the TV in the afternoon,<br>
>>and what do you see?  You see a lawyer who says, you know, "if you<br>
>>haven't sued somebody recently, why don't you bring your rolodex down to<br>
>>the office and let's go through it together? " I mean, just listen -- if<br>
>>you're thinking about a competitive world versus a self-destructive,<br>
>>decaying welfare state, just think of the psychology of a society which<br>
>>bombards itself all day with messages, "have you sued somebody recently?<br>
>>"<br>
<br>
>>I've got a more --
<br><br>
>>okay.
<br><br>
>>Equally amazing.  A medical helicopter, about $40,000 a month.  My insurance is $16,000 a month.

>>So your medical helicopter, getting the -- not counting whatever the<br>
>>litigation cost is, the product liability cost of buying the helicopter,<br>
>>you're actually paying 40,000 for the helicopter and 16,000 for your<br>
>>insurance.  And this is for a helicopter which is built to go save lives.<br>
>><br>
<br>
>>and we have a perfect safety record for 18 years, so --<br><br>

>>this is why they bury you rather than treat you.<br><br>

>>I'm not getting into that.  But anyway.  Does that -- does that framework<br>
>>make some sense now, to give you a sense of -- and again, it's not that<br>
>>you shouldn't have litigation when appropriate.  It's not that you don't<br>
>>want to have the right to sue when it's absurd, but where is the<br>
>>standard?  How -- what -- what percent should the society pay to sustain<br>
>>the right to sue?  And because nobody's saying, "don't pay anything," but<br>
>>is there a point where you reach relative justice at rational cost, or<br>
>>you maximize the opportunity to sue but then pay such a large cost that<br>
>>you're actually diverting resources out of competing with Germany and<br>
>>Japan and China into fighting yourself?  And that's the sort of question<br>
>>you've got to ask about that kind of reform.  You've also got to reform<br>
>>red tape.<br><br>

I got an interesting letter from Christopher Mcintyre in Woodville, Ohio.
He says, "I'm a 29- year-old" -- he takes the course, I think, on Mind
Extension University.  He says, "I'm a 29-year-old entrepreneur.  "I own a
small heating business in an area in northwest Ohio.  "the business will be
three full years old in April.  "it's gone from absolutely zero dollars to
projected sales of $400,000 in 1995.  "it now has four employees, and we
pride ourselves in our teamwork, for we understand it is united we stand
and divided we fall.  "I am now going to list the government agencies which
keep my business on the edge of existence, absorb 54% of the 1993 gross
profit, and hamper our progress through needless paperwork." He then lists
20 agencies.  He says, "1, internal revenue.  "2, social security tax.  "3,
federal income tax.  "4, state income tax.  "5, local municipal tax.  "6,
bureau of employment services.  "7, auditor of state.  "8, auditor of
county.  "9, treasurer of state.  "10, bureau of workers' compensation.
"11, state tax collected.  "12, state unemployment tax.  "13, federal
unemployment tax.  "14, excise tax in communications.  "15, sales tax.
"16, gasoline tax.  "17, permit fees.  "18, license fees.  "19, insurance
bonds.  "and, 20, paying an accountant $40 an hour to figure out the taxes.
"one problem I have is when no one collects unemployment or uses the
workers' compensation fund for a period of three years, why don't we get a
percentage of that back? " See?
<P>
Now, this guy -- I mean, this is just one of the letters we get.  We get, I
guess, 30 to 100 letters every week, and this one's from Christopher
Mcintyre in Woodville, Ohio.  But it gives you the sense of, here you are,
you're a small business, you're an entrepreneur, you're out there for the
first time, and as soon as you open the door, here comes the government.
And so you have to work your way past the government to be able to get to
work.
<P>
And it's a very interesting -- how many of you have run a small business?
Can you all -- a good number of you.  Can you all identify with his --
okay.  But you have to ask yourself.  I mean, this is not an act of nature.
Governments are creations of free will.  So if it's a dumb thing to do, we
do have the option of not doing it.  I mean, this is radical.  You have the
option of redesigning it so as not to be dumb.  Okay?  It's a very
important part of what we're trying to do here, is say -- one of the
lessons of American Civilization is to stop being dumb.  That's what
pragmatism based -- I mean, if you think about it, I mean, just think about
the word "pragmatism." Pragmatism, in a very real sense, was a philosophy
that said, "try not to be dumb."
<P>
I mean, when you -- you know, and you used to see it in the old movies
where you'd have the cowboy and you have the English duke who'd arrive, and
the English duke would be wearing all these fancy European clothing and
carrying all these books and doing all these European things, and the
cowboy would sort of say, "you know, probably riding across the desert in
Arizona.  "it's just as well not to do those things." And, of course, the
Englishman will say, "well, of course we have to do these things.  "after
all, that's how we aristocrats are." And the cowboy or the Indian scout or
whatever would then say, "well, of course you can do those things, but this
is not going to be good." And, of course, the whole rest of the movie would
be gradually the guy learning how to dress like an American, act like an
American, et cetera, so by the end of the movie, when the Englishman who
had now been Americanized got back to England, people were going, "why are
you doing that? "
<P>
Now, true pragmatism would recognize that it is fine to wear wool in
Scotland and not as smart to wear it in the Arizona desert, so that, in
fact, there's no right.  I mean, the right thing in the Arizona desert is
the wrong thing in Scotland.  I'm not arguing that the deer slayer would do
better from "the Last of the Mohicans" if we sent him to Scotland.  What
I'm arguing is that American pragmatism basically started with the idea, do
what works.  Don't do what's dumb.  I mean, and again, this is so basic
that it often sounds -- I feel like, I mean, I almost ought to remind you,
you know, that I have a Ph. D. .  And I'm Speaker of the House.  I'm not
just making these things up so that they sound odd.  But you now have a
high culture, an elite culture, which is so nutty that to wander in and
say, "why don't we quit doing the dumb ones," and people go, "well, you
can't do that." But of course you can do that.  That's what a free society
is all about.  It's about the right to adapt and change.
<P>
>>it's in the declaration.
<P>
>>Yeah, it's in the declaration -- where is it in the declaration?  What<br>
>>does it say?<br>
<br>
>>"That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,<br>
>>it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a<br>
>>new government having its foundations on such principles and<br>
>>organizations, its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely<br>
>>to effect their safety and happiness."<br>
<br>
>>so, in other words, the Founding Fathers would think it was all right to<br>
>>quit being dumb.  See?  I know this -- but I'm trying to -- okay.  I'm<br>
>>just trying to lay out here in very simple English what is really a very<br>
>>radical thought.  When you run into something which is destructive, stop<br>
>>doing it.  If you applied that across -- Drucker had a way of saying it.<br>
>>He said -- he said -- he said, at least once a year, walk through<br>
>>everything you're doing and ask the question, would you start it?  And if<br>
>>the answer's no, why are you still doing it?  And you apply that test, it<br>
>>is amazing how much stuff you'd change.<br>
<P>
Now, we also want to, frankly, in the current setting, cut the size of
government.  On every government dollar, we should ask, is it more
productive than the same dollar spent in the private sector?  It's a very
important challenge.  Because in an entrepreneurial society, the question
is, who is more likely to create the next 1,000 jobs?  Norman Brinker, or a
department of labor bureaucrat?  Very important question.  Because guess
where the welfare state would tend to spend the money.  They would tax
Brinker and his investors to transfer the money to the bureaucrat in the
department of labor.  Or the Department of Commerce.  I'm not trying to
pick on one department.  I'm trying to give you a model.  So you want to
shrink the size of government to maximize the resources available to
entrepreneurial behavior.
<P>
Which is why limited government, low taxes, balanced budgets, and stable
money -- what I think I'd call honest money -- are the core lessons of
Smith, Hayek, Schumpeter, and Friedman.  That all of them argued again and
again for the last 220 years that you want government to be very limited,
not to be weak.  To do very well the limited things it does.  You want low
taxes, so most resources stay with entrepreneurs.  You want balanced
budgets, because you want to force priorities and force decisions to keep
the government limited.  And finally, you want money to be stable, or I
would describe it as honest money.
<P>
That is, if the government gives you a dollar and you save that dollar,
then 10 years from now, you should be able to cash that dollar in and it
should still be a dollar.  Very key idea in the Constitution.  The
Constitution's a very anti-inflationary document, which is why they
literally wrote in you can't repudiate the debt, you have to pay the
interest on the debt, because they were very determined to minimize
inflation.  Remember that money is both the medium of exchange -- I give
you a dollar, you give me a goodie -- and it's a store of value.  I give
you a dollar, you want it to still be a dollar.
<P>
And so the idea in the theoretical model was you had very limited
government, you had balanced budgets, you kept most resources in the
private sector, and most of those resources could be stored in a currency
which would not lose value, and that was the core model of the
entrepreneurial system under Alexander Hamilton and others.  And for the
government that does remain, which will still be, frankly, pretty big, you
want to apply quality to turn Second Wave bureaucracies into Third Wave
citizen-oriented service organizations.  That is, again and again, you want
to say to people, how can we re-create customer behavior in the bureaucracy
so that instead of bureaucrats seeing you as trapped, they see you as a
customer to be served?  And how do you get the kind of speed and
effectiveness in government that you would normally expect in a private
sector?
<P>
One example of that is you want to reshape our foreign service so that it
helps Americans create local jobs through world sales.  You want to -- we
for 50 years focused our foreign service on defeating the soviet empire.
It's gone.  I think we now want to say, all right, how do we compete across
the planet?  What do we do in order to be able to make sure that Americans
are selling everywhere?  You also want to draw distinction between what
government does and what government makes happen.  This was the essence of
Hamilton's policies.
<P>
The thing we can say -- we want something -- building the transcontinental
railroads.  One way to have built the transcontinental railroads would have
been to set up the federal department of transcontinental railroads and
have the Corps of Engineers build it.  We did that with the Panama canal,
which was so big a project and so unusual that we actually had the corps of
engineers build the Panama canal.  But for the transcontinental railroads,
what we said was, "we'll give you land and we'll give you cash if you'll
build the railroad." So you had a lot of entrepreneurs rushing around
trying to build railroads for about a 35-year period.
<P>
We wanted air travel around the world.  So we had -- we subsidized Pan Am.
Much of the early rise of the domestic airlines industry was paid for by
airmail, which subsidized their routes.
<P>
So there are a lot of ways that government can shape things.  We can change
tax laws to shape behavior.  You can say, "we want more scientists, so if
you can score above 1300 in math and science, we'll give you an automatic
four-year scholarship to the school of your choice, and if you'll continue
to major in math and science, we'll guarantee you a graduate fellowship,"
and you'd see a shift.  You'd see people responding to the incentives.
That's different than government doing it directly.  We want to encourage
people to buy homes, so we give you a mortgage deduction on your house.
The result is people have a propensity to buy homes, and people do - how
many of you have thought about tax consequences when you think about your
home mortgage?
<P>
All right.  So a government can shape activities and not just do them.
Government actually has three very different roles in the economy.  It has
police powers.  For example, we insist onfood being healthy.  It can
reshape markets.  We can encourage and discourage behavior, and we can
operate directly through the bureaucracy.
<P>
They're very different ways of doing things.  Police power is when we say,
we won't tolerate water that would poison you.  We won't tolerate food
being sold that will poison you.  It's literally the government interfering
and saying, this is a matter of criminality, this is a matter of law, and
we'll use the state to enforce it directly.  Second, we can shape the
markets.  So we have tax deductions.  For example, if you have a very long
tax deduction which may be perfect for a steel mill and you're in the age
of software and it depreciates every 18 months, your depreciation rate
which is perfect for a steel mill is five times as long as the software.
And so you may literally want to rethink your tax code as you go into that.
<P>

Third, you have bureaucratic decisions.  We're going to have a brand new
program, five bureaucrats will get together and they'll pass out the
goodies.  That, in my judgment, is the least effective and the most
politicized way for a government to function.  And is the one we should
avoid as often as possible.  Which is why I would suggest we want to
replace bureaucratic government controls with achievement oriented systems.
<P>

And the three examples I'd give you are the occupational safety and health
act, or health agency, the environmental protection agency, and the food
and drug administration.  In each case, I mean, one way to get safety is to
hire somebody who becomes a bureaucrat who visits your plant and has a
cookbook, and they check off whether or not you're doing what the
regulations say.  Another way is to say, "if you have no accidents at your
plant, we'll lower your taxes.  "if you have a lot of accidents at your
plant, we're going to dramatically raise your taxes." People would then
have a tremendous incentive to avoid accidents.  And they would apply their
human ingenuity to make sure that it was safe.
<P>
And I'm just trying to give you that as a way of thinking about a very --
one approach is to say, we will hire somebody, they'll come inspect you.
Now, the way we got to this -- did we talk in here one day about speed
limits?
<P><pre>
>>yes.

>>Just go back to the speed limit model, because that was really for us the
>>great breakthrough.  That we Americans routinely look at a speed limit
>>and add five or 10 miles an hour to the posted number.  Which means when
>>you have an Osha regulator walk in, your initial instinct is to resent
>>them for being there, and then it is to figure out not "how do I get to
>>safety," but "how do I get around the rules? " And so you become
>>rule-focused rather than safety-focused.

>>A few weeks ago when Frederico Pena announced that in the light of the
>>recent poor period for airline safety that they were going -- there was a
>>new policy whereby -- wherein the aim would be zero accidents, I had two
>>questions.  One was, what was the policy before?  Ten accidents, five?
>>And the second question was, what was the incentive?  There was no
>>incentive.  It was just a blanket announcement that we're going to go for
>>zero accidents.  Did we talk -- did you and I talk about that?

>>no.  But remember, what did we do when we did the red bead experiment?

>>Tried for zero.

>>Tried for zero.  And how did we communicate that to the workers?  There
>>you go.  You see, he still has it.  There's his "I'm a quality worker" --
>>remember?

>>I still have my "quality worker" sticker.

>>see?  You know, once the union steward, always the union steward.  It's a
>>-- and he's ready.  But do you see the model?  That if all you're doing
>>is exhorting, "let's not have any accidents," what does that mean?  Of
>>course, we're not -- let me tell you, I fly often enough, I always think,
>>I hope the mechanic did a good job.  I hope the pilot's really excited
>>about this.  I hope they put the right kind of fuel in the tank.  You
>>know, I hope that the air traffic control system's doing right, and I
>>hope the next airport's not fogged in.  I mean, I'm big on this idea you
>>ought to get down the same way you got up, which is in one piece.  Huh?

>>That's the way I like it.

>>Right.  But the idea that the way you get to that is you set incentives,
>>you encourage the right behavior, you go through Deming's sense of a
>>quality system, it's so totally different than having the next bureaucrat
>>show up.  And, in fact, if you look at the best of the federal aviation
>>administration, it's cooperative, it's not adversarial.  It's just --
>>because the pilots, after all, have an equally big incentive.

>>They're always the first ones to arrive at the scene of the accident.

>>That's right.

>>My father's a pilot, and he said that mothers will come up to him and
>>say, you know, "be careful, my son's on the plane." And then he'll tell
>>them, "well, you know, my mother's son's on the plane too."

>>Yeah.  I mean, if you think about it -- and that's one of the reasons why
>>aviation works so interestingly, because everybody has a vested interest
>>in safety.  And so what you want is you don't want an adversarial role,
>>what do I have to hide from?  How are they going to try to regulate me?
>>You want a team effort, where everybody gets in the same room and says,
>>"let's swap notes honestly and let's find the right way to do this." It's
>>very different than the government as adversary and regulatory
>>bureaucrat.
</pre>
We also ought to, frankly, reshape incentives to regain a one generation
lead in technological products.  The examples I just list here are
aircraft, space, biotechnology, materials technology, and computing.  We
should literally have as a national strategy, how do we create the tax
incentives and the other incentives so that we are consistently staying a
generation ahead of the rest of the country, I mean, of the rest of the
planet?  So that when you want to buy the best aircraft in the world, you
buy American.  When you want to buy the best computing or the best software
or whatever, you buy American.  And I think that's very, very important
conceptually.
<P>
Now, what I want to suggest to you, and this is what I've been working on
for a couple years that I'm trying to get into the national dialogue,
because it's so different than the way we normally think of it.  I believe
that health could be our biggest job creator and foreign exchange earner.
Don't think of -- and this goes back to the two models here for a second.
Do not think of health as problem.  Lost cost.  Lots of red tape.  Instead,
think of it over here as opportunity.
<P>
What if the best health on the planet were in America?  And everybody in
America who got seriously ill decided that they would come to Americans for
their health care, and the best products on the planet were American, and
therefore you consistently got diagnosed with American tools, you took
American medicines.  If you had a genetic defect, you used an American
system of gene therapy.  If you had a serious illness, you had an American
do the operation.  And they might do it by virtual reality 3,000 -- 12,000
miles away by satellite.
<P>
Now, what would happen to cash flow?  We would buy Chinese teddy bears.
They would buy open-heart surgery.  And so you could afford -- and you'd
have a huge assemblage in America of very high value-added people, so that
having the most specialists in the world wouldn't be a problem, it might
well be an opportunity.  Depends on how you -- you see, if you think of it
only inside the welfare state and you say, "wow, we have too many
specialists." How do you know?
<P>
One of the things you hear often in the welfare state model is, there are
too many cat scans.  Do you realize that there are more cat scans in
Washington state than there are in Canada?  People say that like it's a
problem.  There are also more microwaves.  There are also more cellular
telephones.  There are also more fax machines.  There are also more VCRs.
Why aren't the others a problem?  Why?  Because they're private and the
price crashes.  The only two places the price doesn't crash in the welfare
state, the only two places the technology does not crash in the welfare
state are defense and health.  These are the only two places the government
messes it up totally.  In fact, there's an article, it's the cover of this
week's "business week," on the fact that, you know, you now get cellular
phones as a give-away.  You know, what is it, order "time" magazine and
we'll send you a phone?  I want you to think about that, okay?  Why isn't
that happening in health technology?
<P><pre>
>>People are always going to be sick.

>>No, it's not simply -- people are always going to use the telephone.
>>Because over here, you have an open market in the entrepreneurial model
>>and everybody's out, you know, busting their tail to produce it cheaper
>>and better.  Over here, you have some bureaucracy taking seven years to
>>approve, and over here, you've got a bureaucrat paying for it.  Over
>>here, you have a customer paying for it.  So you want to rethink the
>>entire health system, but your goal should be to make American health and
>>American health care the finest value-added on the planet, because as
>>people get richer, they pay more for health care.  There is today a
>>Boeing 747 that fills up in Japan that flies to Minneapolis in order to
>>go shopping at the mall of the Americas.  Now, if you'll go to the mall
>>of the Americas from Tokyo in order to buy Reeboks, can you imagine what
>>you'll do for open-heart surgery or for a liver transplant?

>>Don't we already see that happening today, I would argue --

>> It's beginning to happen, but in the welfare state model, it happens
>>despite us, not because of us.  And what you want to do is accelerate it
>>and change the whole model from bureaucratic to -- so what I'm suggesting
>>is you want to think vision, strategies, projects, and tactics as it
>>relates to health.  And when you think you've got this aggressive model
>>locked in, you then want to go to doctors and you want to go to
>>pharmacies and you want to go to biotech people and you want to go other
>>places, and you want to go back to listen, learn, help, and lead, and you
>>want to share with people the concept of health within a renewed American
>>Civilization, both better health care at lower cost with greater health
>>for Americans, and the idea that health can lead to tremendous creativity
>>and to a very big market all around the world.
</pre><p>
Think of it this way, health is a Third Wave information revolution, which
means it should be an explosion of lower costs, higher quality, more
choices, and greater access.  That should be the model you want.  I mean,
entrepreneurship, all the things we talk about, if you look at the lessons
of American history, personal strength combined with entrepreneurial free
enterprise combined with the spirit of invention and discovery implemented
through Deming's model of quality should lead you to lower cost, higher
quality, more choices, and greater access, and yet in the welfare state
model, you can't even quite believe.  I mean, you say, "well, that's silly.
"nobody can get all those." That is the normal model, isn't it, in the
private sector?  That is what we expect.  And so you want to liberate
health from bureaucracy, reestablish this dynamic.  Now, we have a pretty
neat video that came out of Hewlett-Packard that I'm going to share with
you that gives you an example of the kind of dynamic Third Wave world
market health system we're thinking about.
<P><pre>
>>hi.  This is Tom Miller.

>>Tom, this is Hal.  You wanted a consult on your patient, Emily nelson.

>>Yeah, Hal.  Emily's labs show no infectious etiology, but her liver
>>function continues to deteriorate.

>>well, this berry picking, we can see a fairly high suspicion now for
>>mushroom poisoning.  Now, look at this.  I've asked the nurse to get an
>>ID.  From Emily on these if she can.

>>good.  I'll also order a screen for amatoxins.

>>a word of caution, tom, now, if this is amanita, liver failure can be
>>quick, and the mortality rate among kids is over 50%.

>>I'll be over to the hospital soon, Hal.  I want to thank you.

>>okay.  I'll keep current on her labs.

>>Good.

>>Emily, I've got some pictures of mushrooms that I'd like you to look at.  Do you think it could have been this one?

>>huh-uh.

>>No?  How about this one.

>>Uh-huh.

>>Are you sure?

>>Uh-huh.

>>Okay.

>>Emily's hepatotoxic, and the amanita did test positive.  I've notified
>>the CDC and the state health department.

>>how bad is she?

>>Not good.  The pet scan shows progressive liver damage.  In fact, I've
>>got her listed with the national registry for possible transplant.

>>When would she need it?

>>Soon.  However, here's something interesting.  Two amanita cases in
>>Oregon were treated with forced Diuresis and pulled through.  Of course,
>>Emily's going on 30 hours now, and I'm not sure she'll respond, but then
>>I found this from Jean Leclair in Geneva.  He's the leading expert on
>>toxin mycology, and he's trying a whole new protocol.

>>We should call him.

>>I did.

>>So having studied your patient's pet scan, I think she can be helped by a
>>procedure we have begun to use in Europe.  Here is an article on the
>>treatment protocols we have devised.  Though this is a new therapy, it
>>has proved quite effective in several cases already.

>>I went ahead and started Leclair's treatment.  I hope it works.  There's
>>no telling if we'll find a liver in time.

>>"softer, cleaner hand.  "he sat up and began to groom his whiskers,
>>always a good performance."

>>How's the little girl in 137?

>>Emily?  Her family's had a hard day.  But it looks like she's responding now.

>>Bile support system's working well.  Labs look good.  What's next?

>>A quiet night, I hope.

>>Hi, tom.  We just did a new liver function test on Emily nelson.  And
>>good news, I think we caught this thing in time.  She's doing so well, I
>>canceled her listing for a transplant.  I'll fill you in tomorrow.

>>Hi, sweetheart.

>>Hi, Mommy.

>>Now, I want to say three things very quickly out of this one film.  One,
>>you're going to move into a world where you have worldwide real-time
>>distance medicine.  And that means both job opportunities, it means
>>dramatically different health care costs, it means dramatically different
>>quality of care.  Two, by using this kind of a model, you can literally
>>be current in the smallest community in the world with the most advanced
>>technology wherever it is.  So that you're able to move into saying,
>>"this just happened.  "what do we need to do about your cancer? " And
>>know what the most current treatment is anywhere on the planet in real-
>>time.  Three, there's no reason only doctors have access to it.  I mean,
>>what this is going to mean is -- I have several friends now whose
>>children have problems, and the friends are on the Internet accessing
>>medical libraries.  Because they have a higher passion for solving the
>>problem.  Not that they know as much, but they're willing to focus on
>>getting their child's solution.
</pre>
So within a decade, I think you're going to start getting user friendly
medical systems that allow you to learn about your disease and your
protocol, and you to look at all the research being done everywhere on the
planet, and for you to access it from your home or from your hospital bed,
and it's a totally different model than the model we've had for the last 70
years, and it both creates tremendous revolutions in health care and it
creates an enormous opportunity for us, if we lead that revolution, to
provide the highest value care on the planet and to create the most high
value jobs.  And in that kind of world, you have Americans who don't worry
at all about China or Mexico or anywhere else.  We offer health care, they
offer other things.
<P>
Next week, our topic is going to be replacing the culture of violence and
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety, and we're going to look
at next week's reading, which is don Eberly's "building a community of
citizens," chapter 16.  And I strongly recommend you look at Marvin
Olasky's "the tragedy of American compassion" which I have with me and
which is a fabulous book.

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class 4<br>
Pillar three, entrepreneurial free enterprise, focuses on entrepreneurial 
free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, solutions to problems, 
and developer of opportunities January 28, 1995. <br>
<P>

>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, College 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From college in Waleska, Georgia, this 
is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the fourth of 10 class 
presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at 
college, will continue his course, which presents the foundational 
principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization. This week's 
lesson, pillar three, entrepreneurial free enterprise, focuses on 
entrepreneurial free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, 
solutions to problems, and developer of opportunities.
<P>
Welcome, and let me begin by welcoming the students of Mind Extension 
university, which is in, I think, some 26 million homes around the 
country. Let me remind everyone who is watching that you can mail your 
comments to: Renewing American Civilization, P.O.. Box 6008, Marietta, 
Georgia 30065. You can also fax your comments to 404-528-9806. Or you can 
e-mail your comments to America Online at renewam@aol.Com. Or you can get 
class transcripts and other class materials available on our Internet web 
page, which is too silly for me to repeat. That's not English, so I now 
refuse to say it. But anybody can write it down. I should say, by the 
way, I think John was telling us last night, John McDowell, that I 
believe there have been, like, 460 transcripts downloaded from Internet 
and, there have been another, I think, 100 from Compuserve and another 
100 from America Online. So people out there are getting it.
<P>
I was at the Library of Congress yesterday looking at the national 
digital library, and it is amazing what we're about to be able to do, and 
we're seeing it in terms of reaction to the course, and people are 
accessing us electronically. Finally, for more traditional folks, you can 
order "American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes and the 
course readings, by calling 1-800-to-renew. And the fact is for about 90% 
of the country, that's still the most practical answer, is pick up the 
phone, call the 800 number, and don't worry about it. But it is 
interesting to see the expansion of what's happening. In this course, our 
suggestion is that there is an American Civilization, and that it has 
five pillars. That the five pillars are: the historic lessons of American 
Civilization, personal strength, entrepreneurial free enterprise, the 
spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined by. Now, what 
we're going to do is take two hours on each of these five pillars, and 
then we're going to talk about four areas, and we're going to apply the 
five pillars to four different areas.
<P>
First, to the third wave and American Civilization, what will the 
information age mean for America. Second, to creating American jobs in 
the world market. Third, to replacing the culture of violence and poverty 
with a culture of productivity and safety. And, fourth, citizenship and 
community in 21st century America. Of these, today's topic will be the 
pillar entrepreneurial free enterprise and looking at: why is 
entrepreneurial free enterprise so important? And that's where I want to 
start, because I want to explain just for a minute what we mean by that. 
We have to first examine in America: why is entrepreneurial free 
enterprise important? And I think this is a very key question to what 
we're trying to get at. Let me say, first of all, when I use the word 
"entrepreneur" from the French "to undertake," I don't just mean making 
money. The first time I taught the course, I used a section out of a book 
on dinosaurs called "T-Rex" by one of the leading current dinosaur 
collectors, and in the book, he talked about the fact that they found a 
Tyrannosaurus Rex and didn't have the money to get it out of the ground, 
and he explains all the different things they did to get the corps of 
engineers to lend them a bulldozer, get a company to loan them a big 
truck, get volunteers to go out. He undertook -and the meaning of the 
word "entrepreneur," he undertook to solve his problem. If you look at 
the great teachers in the country, 

<P>
If you look at Jaime Escalante in California who teaches Hispanic kids so 
that they can go to M.I.T.. and Cal tech on a regular basis because he 
makes calculus come alive in the barrio, he's an entrepreneur. He's an 
entrepreneur of learning, and he does what it takes to get it done. So 
entrepreneurship doesn't mean just getting rich. It means a psychological 
attitude that says: I will undertake something, and in that process, I 
will make sure it happens, and I will learn what I have to learn to get 
this done. That is, it is a project-centered learning. If I can for one 
second, this is one of the most important things to learn about the 
difference between the dead end we've gotten to in credentialing and how 
America works when it's healthy. In credentialing, we say to you: learn 
what is in this box. You will get five hours' credit, and then learn what 
is in this box, and you'll get five hours' credit. And when you learn 
enough boxes end to end, you'll have a Ph.D.
<P>
What entrepreneurs do is they say: I'm here now. I want to get here. 
Everything I have to learn in order to get there, I will learn. And it is 
the project which drives the learning. If I have to learn psychology in 
order to convince the banker to give me the loan, I'll learn psychology. 
If I have to learn management skills in order to be able to take care of 
a particular project, I'll learn management. If I have to learn 
accounting to be able to take care of the cash flow, I'll learn 
accounting. You tell me what the project requires, let me break it down 
into a series of learning sequences and I'll learn them, and my payoff is 
in the real world, not am I credentialed, but am I accomplishing 
something? And if I'm not, let me go back and start again and figure out: 
now, what is it I missed? So it's a learning-driven system, but the 
learning is defined by what we're trying to accomplish, and that is a 
very, very different approach. When you liberate human beings to be 
entrepreneurial, that is, you break down the bureaucratic habits and the 
sloth that says, "you sit there until I give you red tape and I tell you 
the regulations and I'll define for you" 
<P>
-- there's a great funny story Sonny bono told the other night. True 
story. Bono had retired from the entertainment business, had gone to Palm 
Springs, had bought a restaurant, he wanted to put up a sign. He goes 
into the city hall, he says, "I want to put a sign in my restaurant." The 
bureaucrat in city hall says, "you're in Palm Springs." He says, "I 
bought a restaurant. "I want people to know it's Bono's restaurant." He 
says, "you don't make the rules. "we make the rules. "fill out all these 
forms." Fills out the forms, he comes back, the bureaucrat says, "It will 
be a while before we decide whether or not you can have a sign." Bono 
comes back again, he said, "I've bought the restaurant, I'm making 
monthly payments. "I can't get people to come to my restaurant because 
they don't know it's Bono's restaurant, and I need a sign." Finally one 
day, he said he walked in and he said, "I've found a solution." And the 
bureaucrat looked at him and said, "It's not your job to find solutions. 
"we find solutions." Bono said, "I'm running for mayor and I'm going to 
fire you." And the other night at the Washington Journalism Foundation 
dinner, Bono looked out and he said, "but I'm a compassionate man. "he's 
my gardener now." 
<P>
Now, the point of the story, which I believe, by the way, up through the 
"I'm running for mayor," is absolutely true. The point of the story is 
that bureaucrats and academic credentialers and people who are locked 
into control, they basically create a sense of passivity on the part of 
the recipient. "you sit there and we'll take care of you." "you sit there 
and we'll get around to you." Entrepreneurs are very different, and 
again, because of the cynicism of the culture which broke down American 
Civilization beginning in 1965, they don't get -- they don't get this 
next paragraph. I'm going to read to you one of the most important 
paragraphs from Adam Smith's "the Wealth of Nations" in which he tries to 
describe why entrepreneurship works in a free
society.
<P>
He said the following, and I quote: "In spite of their natural 
selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, 
though the sole end which they proposed from the laborers of all the 
thousands they employ be the gratification of their own vain and 
insatiable desires, they are led by an invisible hand, and without 
intending it, without knowing it, advance the interests of society." Now, 
this is very much like the Federalists. The Federalists who are writing, 
after all, in the same period as smith, understand that it is human 
nature to be selfish. That all of us are selfish. That when you see the 
noble government officials, it's just disguised selfishness. When you see 
the noble reporter, the noble politician. Now, you can raise people to a 
higher moral standard. You can occasionally get a person to seek fame, to 
seek long-term glory, to believe in virtue over greed, but it's very 
hard, and it's not the natural state of things.
<P>
It is educating people above their normal behavior. That their normal 
behavior is to be self-interested. I mean, you find those exact quotes in 
Madison's -- in "the Federalist." But that if you free up people to 
pursue their self-interest in the marketplace rather than any political 
bureaucracy, that in order to please themselves in the marketplace, they 
have to sell you something that pleases you, or you won't buy it. So if 
you can harness their desires to your desires, so the only way they can 
succeed is to give you a service or a product you want, then they get to 
be happy because they're selling, and you get to be happy because you're 
buying, and if they aren't clever enough to figure out what you want, 
then they're not going to be clever enough to be successful. So they can 
only achieve their success by pleasing you, the customer. Now, that's the 
core of Adam Smith's argument that the more freedom you create, the 
greater the opportunity you will find a chance to buy what you want to 
buy, to live the way you want to live, because you'll now create an 
opportunity for entrepreneurs to invent things you never dreamed of.
<P>
I mean, nobody invented the thought of walkman till it was invented. I 
mean, nobody walked around all day and said, "gee, I sure do wish I could 
listen to a radio or a tape recording while I'm jogging." The second it 
was invented, people said, "I've got to have that. "I can't live without 
it." Nobody invented the microwave. I mean, nobody who sat around as a 
consumer and said, "I need a microwave." The minute it was -- or the fax 
is an even better example. I mean, the fax exploded in use once it was 
invented. But smith's point is that what you want to do is create a very 
free society in which whoever pleases you best, not the best Ph.D.., Not 
the best lawyer, not the best bureaucrat, not the most powerful person, 
not the richest person, the person who pleases you best is the one that 
resources shift to, because you as a consumer say, "I want that one." 
That's why you had the rise of Japanese cars. That's why you've had the 
resurgence of Ford. If you watch what happens, the competition ultimately 
exists to serve the customer, not to serve the producer.
<P>
And in that framework, what you've got to do is encourage maximum 
entrepreneurial behavior, and in a, sense you can see the Father Flanigan 
at "Boys Town" as an entrepreneur if you watch the Spencer Tracy movie. 
That's clearly entrepreneurial behavior. He had his vision of what he 
wanted to accomplish. He went out and put it all together. He overcame 
obstacles. And so entrepreneurial behavior is not just about getting 
rich, but it is about having a dream and figuring out: what does it take 
to put together the resources to achieve my dream? The resources may be 
inside you. I want to be a world figure skater or whatever. And the first 
key to this, I think, is that entrepreneurial free enterprise depends on 
personal strength. If you are not personally strong, you cannot possibly 
engage in entrepreneurial free enterprise. A couple of good reasons. 
First of all, you have to have the courage to take risks. It takes 
tremendous courage to -- again, to go out and try anything. I think I may 
have told you all at one point about I tried to learn how to roller skate 
when I was in my early 30s, and I had never roller skated. Its just 
something I hadn't done. And my two daughters, when I ran the first time 
and lost, they said to me, "okay, it's our turn.  we want you to learn 
how to roller skate." And I found myself in my early 30s, overweight, not 
particularly athletic, out on skates in a skating rink down in Newnan, 
Georgia, and a 4-year-old skated by backwards waving at me. And I'm 
looking down at this little kid and I'm barely able to stay up on my 
skates, and the kid is skating away from me backwards smiling, and I 
realized whatever it is you're learning for the first time is hard. And 
so whatever you've already mastered, when you go to the next one, it's a 
whole new experience. And you have to have courage to keep learning, to 
keep growing, to keep trying. Second, you have to have the discipline to 
persevere and to work harder. 
<P>
My older daughter owns a coffee company in Greensboro, North Carolina, 
and she's learned the hard way setting up her own business. She has two 
coffee stores and an 800-number mail order service, and a coffee cart at 
a hospital. Suddenly she has, I think, 20-something people that work for 
you. It's really hard work, you know, and yet she loves it, she enjoys 
it, she's having a great time, but it also owns her. I mean, first you 
own the store and then the store owns you. Okay? I mean, anybody who's 
ever been in a small business knows that's how it is. Well, you've got to 
decide you want it bad enough. I met recently with the Amway folks. We 
were talking about putting together for Americans who don't have money an 
entire program on cable television designed to say to them: you know, you 
can do beauty control, you can do Mary Kay, you can do Amway. There are 
100 systems you can get into for almost nothing if you want to get out 
there and you want to sell, but then it's hard work, but don't tell us 
you don't have an opportunity.
<P>
What you're telling us is the opportunities are too hard. Very different 
attitude. So you've got to have courage. Now, what I want you to look at 
for just a second is a little film about Alger. Alger is the great figure 
who popularized in the 19th century the concept of rising. I think as you 
watch this, you'll have some sense of what 19th century cultural values 
were about.
<P>
Don Johnson: gifted with a keen sense of observation, Alger began 
interviewing the children of American immigrants. Most were poor, many 
orphaned without family or teachers to inspire them or guide them. But 
these were Horatio's heroes. They earned their keep shining shoes, 
peddling newspapers, delivering messages, lucky to earn a penny or two a 
day. From their courageous stories, Alger produced 134 novels reflecting 
the theme of rags to riches through ambition, honesty, and respect. The 
titles tell it all: "sink or swim," "try and trust," "brave and bold," 
"strive and succeed," stories and bywords that motivated generations of 
American youth to reach for the stars. And just how many books did the 
rejected poet end up selling? Over 400 million copies, making him still 
the most widely read author in America and a name synonymous with 
hard-earned success. Alger's effort was to popularize, and it was modeled 
on Samuel smiles, who was a writer in Britain, and both of them were 
trying in the mid 19th century to say: here are -- in very simple, very 
easy-to-read books, here are the habits that work. Here is the way to 
succeed. Here is how you should live your life if you want to get ahead. 
In a very real sense, the key to this is to understand that Alger is 
about you. That the goal here is to say to every American: you should be 
an entrepreneur. If you aren't an entrepreneur, why not? You have all the 
freedom to be an entrepreneur. You have all the opportunity to be an 
entrepreneur. 
<P>
Remember, that means "to undertake." It doesn't mean you have to go out 
and start a small business. But it means you get up in the morning with 
an attitude that says, "gee, I wonder what I'll undertake today. "I 
wonder what I'll do today." Not how I'll suffer, not how I'll be 
victimized, not how I'll feel sorry for myself. What will I do? And that 
reminds me. You were asked last week to turn in reports of being -- 
people who were your personal hero or heroine, because so much of this is 
an attitudinal thing. Here are just a couple. I'm not going to give you 
the names, but here are various folks. "I've been influenced by a large 
number of very special people: my father, a teacher, my commanding 
officer in the service, people from history, but my greatest hero is my 
wife. "she had polio as a child, was told she would not live past age 14, 
spent a total of three years in a body cast as a result of five back 
operations, lost her first husband in an accident at age 30, and was left 
with three children and a bankrupt business. 
<P>
"Yet through faith and hard work, she has persevered and succeeded and is 
an inspiration to everyone she meets." And in the 19th century, she would 
be the subject of a Alger type book. In the 20th century, of course, 
since she's succeeding, she could not make it on Donahue. Whereas, if she 
would refuse to do anything, stay at home and explain that she'd been 
victimized by bad luck, she could be on at least three talk shows. Second 
example, "my heroine is my paternal grandmother, who mothered me in many 
ways. "she struggled with her husband in a dry-cleaning business, 
struggled with his alcoholism, had one child at age 36. "she probably 
overattended to family business and underattended her child, a child who 
would ignore her for the rest of her life. "her husband died in 1966, and 
she lived completely alone in little love for 20 more years. "she could 
have chosen to be bitter. "she could have chosen to isolate herself from 
her son and grandchildren. "Instead, she was always welcoming, nurturing, 
and loving her grandchildren, and never had a disparaging word for anyone 
in her family. 
<P>
"She is my heroine, and her gifts in the midst of apparent emptiness are 
a shining example." Third example, "my grandmother is my example of a 
heroine. "she survived four husbands, with two dying of heart attacks and 
watching one die of cancer. "through all this, she managed to raise three 
children, all of whom are successful leaders in the community today. "she 
also had a full-time job and worked another job to keep her family above 
poverty. "she has been a leader in her church for the past 30 years. "she 
has survived two heart attacks, and still continues to be a community 
leader, as well as a church leader today. "she inspires me through her 
continued strength and perseverance." Now, again, imagine every one of 
those excuses to say, "well, I've had it. "time to quit." Lastly, "while 
I was in the military, I had an instructor that was a Vietnam Veteran. 
"he'd been an air crewman on medivac helicopters and lost both of his 
legs while saving the lives of two marines.
<P>
"He overcame his disabilities to teach others. "His knowledge of rescue 
obviously saving many more lives." So I just want to give you a flavor 
that when we talk about courage, perseverance, strength, that this 
applies to every person. When we talk about being an entrepreneur, we're 
talking about every person. If you didn't get up this morning thinking, 
"It's great to be an American, I'm a free person, time to go do 
something," then the problem's in you. It's not in the country. Now, in 
that framework, there are three big concepts. First, the entrepreneur as 
a creative inventor. By that, I mean that when you encounter a problem, 
the trick for the entrepreneur is to invent the solution. Now, again, I 
mean -- so over and over, when an entrepreneur runs into a problem, they 
try to think through: what would solve this? Rather than: look at me, I 
can't get it done. And as a general rule, entrepreneurs have a lot of 
common sense and they are very creative at problem solving, and the more 
they practice being an entrepreneur, the more creative they are. 
<P>
Second, it is the customer or the market or the goal which defines 
success. That is, you have to decide: what is it you're trying to please? 
How do you keep score? And I'm not asking you to have a -- I think every 
American should keep score separately. You ought to keep your score. But 
when you do, it is this thing outside you, it's the customer or the 
marketplace or the goal, that's what defines for you what your success 
is, not inside you. So as an entrepreneur, I'm not talking about your 
values. Your values should be internal to you. I'm talking about how you 
focus your energy and your effort. It ought to be outside yourself, which 
you'll see also in "effective executive" is a major point, that leaders 
are focused outside. What are you trying to accomplish? Now, the third is 
to recognize that getting the job done is the focus. And again, the 
credentialing really tears us apart, because credentialing says getting 
the right piece of paper is the focus.
<P>
That's why modern education is collapsing. Because we have too many 
people who know how to get papers and too few who know how to learn, and 
you say -- that's why bureaucracies collapse. Bureaucracies say, "hey, we 
did all the processes. "Why are you mad at us? "The fact that nothing got 
achieved is not our fault. We had every meeting, we've stamped every 
paper, we reviewed every document. You shouldn't be mad at us." But an 
entrepreneur knows that it's getting the job done. See, you define the 
job, you make sure the job fits your goal, your market, or your customer, 
and then you get the job done, and you do what it takes ethically and 
legally to get the job done. Now, this comes into a fascinating thing 
which Jeff Eisenach and others have really opened me up to and the whole 
concept of: how do we define getting to success?
<P>
And I want to share with you what I think is truly, if you'll focus on 
it, a remarkable insight. There are two visions of success that grew up 
in the 20th century: Character building versus popularity seeking. That 
from Benjamin Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanac" and the autobiography 
of Benjamin Franklin up through Napoleon Hill's "Law of Success," which 
is a great old book that I really recommend to you to just to at least 
check out of the library and take a look at. The "Law of Success" by 
Napoleon Hill, he went around and interviewed Andrew Carnegie and Henry 
Ford and Thomas and a generation of successful people, and he said: what 
works? And he wrote down what works. And if you read this, I mean, it 
says to any American: if you spent some time and read this, for example, 
the "Law of Success," Lesson 8, self-control, and he walks through why 
self-control matters. You find that he focuses consistently on building 
character, on what it is that we need to do. And you can read "the 
Effective Executive," which I'll come back to. You can read "Grinding it 
Out" by Ray Kroc. These are -- when people, "say how can I be 
successful?" "go to a used book store and get a copy of 'grinding it out' 
by Ray Kroc, or go to the library and check it out for free. "don't tell 
me you're too poor to learn." 
<P>
It's a great book. He founded McDonald's. It's a study of perseverance 
and his story of getting permission to build a McDonald's in Chicago, but 
only according to the specifications of the original McDonald's brothers 
building in California, which was in Bakersfield near the desert, getting 
to Chicago and realizing they had no basement for a furnace, and spending 
a year getting them to rewrite the documents so he could build a furnace 
in a basement, is hysterical. Or his discovery that one of the secrets of 
McDonald's is its French Fries. Anyone know why their French Fries are 
different? What do you mean by "blanch"? 
<P>
>>they're slightly cooked and I guess to seal in the moisture. No? Aged. 
no, they're aged. This is very important. He discovered -he couldn't get 
the French fries right in Chicago. He went back out to the desert. He -- 
again, he's following the problem to get the knowledge. He goes back out 
to the desert and he says, "what do you do?" They say, "well, when we buy 
the potatoes, we put them out back in the shed." Turns out they were 
dehydrating 8 to 10% of their body weight. The French fries from 
McDonald's are slightly dehydrated. That's why they're crisper. But he 
had to work his way back historically to figure out what they had done. 
It's a great book. Equally great book, Sam Walton. I mean, if a man makes 
$17 billion net worth, creates the largest retail system in the world, 
does it all after going broke and does it all as a very down-to-earth, 
practical kind of guy, maybe it's worth reading. And so when somebody 
says to you, "oh, gee, I don't know how to do all those things." Or in a 
more complex way, "the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen 
Covey. Very popular best seller, now out in paperback. Very worth 
reading. Available in your library.
<P>
And I say this in part so people who are in public housing and who have 
no money and can't find any opportunity at all say -- but are sitting 
there getting paid full-time to not have to do any work for an entire 
month, "walk to your nearest library. "pick up a book." The book which 
turned me a on to the whole concept of character versus popularity, a 
tremendous human being, John McCormick, "self-made in America." 
First-generation millionaire, went bankrupt at 29, sitting on the beach 
feeling sorry for himself. An older man of European descent came by and 
watched him for three days and finally said, "and why do you feel so 
sorry for yourself?" And he said, "oh, I went broke at 29." He said, 
"you're so lucky. "I was in my 40s before I went broke. "much better to 
get it out of your way now." And get back up on your feet and do it. And 
again, a modern version of napoleon hill, "Think and Grow Rich: a Black 
Choice" by Dennis Kimbrough, who's from here in Atlanta, and Napoleon 
Hill, translating specifically challenging black Americans and "saying, 
here is a way to do things." 
<P>
Now, in this context, what I want to suggest to you: that there is an 
entrepreneurial spirit in American history, and it teaches us at least 
three key lessons, and if you look at the history of entrepreneurship in 
America, you learn a lot, because we're the most entrepreneurial society 
in history. Lesson one: new experiences force us to rethink old rules. 
What used to work in Europe doesn't work in America. Big shock when you 
arrive from England or Germany or France, you're on the edge of the great 
forest, you're in a new society, a new environment, you'd better rethink 
it. Well, guess what? If you're at the edge of the information age, you 
know, our new frontier is this Third Wave Information Age. New rules are 
going to have to grow up, new discoveries, new ways of doing things. 
Lesson two: the market is more productive than the bureaucratic system. 
This is a very important central lesson. Are you going to gamble on being 
productive in a bureaucracy or are you going to gamble on being 
productive in the marketplace?
<P>
Now, if you say, "In the marketplace," I'd say to you, "fine, why do you 
have 18 years or why do you have 12 years of mandatory bureaucracy for 
education?" You've got to take seriously what the words mean. If the 
market's more productive, maybe we should rethink education from the 
ground up. If it's -- and so you've got to start -- not just education, 
the whole bureaucracy, the whole way we do medical care. Which do you 
believe in, bureaucracies or markets? And why? Third, lesson three: 
technological innovation can precede scientific understanding. It's a 
very important Americanism that we came very close to losing in the last 
20 years because of academics and credentialing. In the academic world -- 
and by the way, this is a big problem with the food and drug 
administration. Because if you can't explain -- aspirin could not be 
today brought to the market because we do not know why it works. You 
cannot do a paper explaining for the food and drug administration why 
aspirin's good. You know it's good, but you can't explain it. Since we 
can't explain it, you couldn't do it. It's exactly backwards. But if you 
go to credentialing, credentialing says, "If you can't explain it, it 
doesn't exist." 
<P>
So here you have the entrepreneur -- and again, this is why Americans 
historically were anti-intelligentsia, they were anti-credentialing. If 
you go back and you read the -- go back and look at how Americans dealt 
Europeans who had lots of college degrees, and there was an automatic 
sense of, "I'll bet you can't do anything competent," and the reason is, 
if you are driven to ascertain fact by credential, you do what your 
tenured professor tells you to do, and that's the truth, so that in the 
middle ages, they didn't go out and count the number of teeth in a horse. 
They read Aristotle and how many teeth Aristotle said a horse had, even 
if, in fact, it was no longer accurate. There's a book by white on 
medieval agriculture which he points out that the actual practices of 
agriculture were 1,000 years ahead of the way it was taught. 
<P>
Because the farmers weren't trapped into doing what the Greeks had done, 
so you just went and did better things. And they'd actually had 1,000 
years of invention by the middle of the middle ages in what farmers 
actually did, none of which showed up in the academic world. And so 
you've really got to look at this question of: what if it just works? 
Could we do it? What if we can't explain it? What if it's intuitive, or 
what if we have a discovery or we don't yet have an explanation? Could we 
just use it for a while? Penicillin. I mean, there was not a theoretical 
model to get to penicillin, but it worked. In fact, you may remember the 
reason they discovered penicillin is they were trying out an experiment, 
they couldn't get the bacteria to live long enough because the mold kept 
killing it. And they finally said: if the experiment is to figure out how 
to kill the bacteria but we can't get the experiment to work because the 
bacteria keep getting killed, maybe we ought to look at the mold. Which 
was an accident. Penicillin was an accident. It was a discovery. Now, 
entrepreneurial free enterprise works and bureaucratic credentialism 
fails for a couple of reasons. I think these are very, very profound 
about how far off track we've gotten from American Civilization. First, 
the real world is very complex. So many different things come together to 
make up the real world that it is impossible to capture them in any kind 
of academic environment. Second, much of reality is non-verbal, 
non-rational, and non-linear. You look across the room, you see the right 
person, you fall in love. Now, that's not just a romance novel, that's 
not just a movie. It really does happen. You are suddenly caught up in a 
situation, and everything in your life has gone fine and you get mugged, 
and suddenly whatever your current line is, it changes. Or you find out 
you have liver cancer. I mean, much of life, you know, you're having a 
really great time, you have a great marriage going on, and you have 
triplets. 
<P>
Your whole life changes. And my point's just that a lot of reality can't 
be captured by drawing lanes on a board or having academic studies. Best 
example of this, if I can, David Ogilvy, terrific guy, "Confessions of an 
Advertising Man," founder of Ogilvy-Mather, one of the great advertising 
geniuses of the post World War II era, this is his description, okay? 
He's in high school, and then he gets to college. "I was too preoccupied 
to do any work and was duly expelled. "that was in 1931, the bottom of 
the Depression. "for the next 17 years while my friends were establishing 
themselves as doctors, lawyers, civil servants and politicians, I 
adventured about the world uncertain of purpose. "I was a chef in Paris, 
a door-to-door salesman, a social worker on the Edinburgh slums, an 
associate of Dr. Gallup in research for the motion picture industry, an 
assistant to Sir William Stevenson in British security coordination, and 
a farmer in Pennsylvania. "my boyhood hero had been Lloyd George, and I 
had expected to be prime minister when I grew up. "Instead, I finally 
became an advertising agent on Madison avenue. "the revenues of my 19 
clients are now greater than the revenues of her majesty's government." 
<P>
And he goes on to talk about being all these different things, and he 
describes what it's like to work for a great chef in a great restaurant 
and the lessons he learned there that he takes 20 years later and applies 
to advertising, because he understood that if you learn everything and 
keep saying, "now, how does it apply to this," there's nothing which is 
outside the box for your lifetime, because you don't know what you're 
going to do later on. So when you say, "why am I doing this boring 
thing," the real question is, "what can I learn out of this boring thing 
that will apply later?" Totally different attitude. Nothing is boring if 
you think it applies to you. Is that not true? Just think about it. It's 
the key to why I learn a lot, because I think everything applies, so you 
can walk in and talk to me about anything and I go, "wow, that's 
interesting." Because sooner or later somewhere I'll be able to figure 
out how to apply it, and that's Ogilvy's point. The third big principle, 
I think, is that learning by discovery should inform and guide planning, 
not vice versa. Now, the idea of learning by discovery is very, very 
important. Go out and do it, and as you're doing it, say to yourself, 
"what am I learning?" This is how I'm becoming Speaker, by the way. I 
mean, we're doing it and then we're checking it out every night, we go: 
now, what did we learn today? So the opposite of planning. Because, you 
see, what happens is -- and here's the -I'm going to see if I can put it 
up here in a chart real quick. What we tend to say is: okay, we will now 
have a planning meeting. This is our plan. Unfortunately, it turns out 
reality is outside the plan. 
<P>
What do we normally do? We translate this and lie to ourselves and bring 
it to here. Right? Because we're going to do our plan. Instead, if you 
say, I think I'm going in this general direction, but I think I'll figure 
out if this is what's happening, I think I'll try to learn from what I'm 
experiencing, it's a very different model, and then I'll do my planning, 
getting up every morning, trying to think through: what did I discover 
yesterday based on what I was learning? And now I think I'll apply that 
to rethinking my plan. As opposed to: what did I plan? Which means -- 
which is going to make me deny reality and go ahead and do it even if it 
isn't smart. Now, there's a powerful reason for this, and this may 
surprise you. It's inside us. Self-interest is real and powerful. Self, 
you, yourself. I'm talking about you personally in this class. 
<P>
You have a powerful self-interest. One of the things, if you use it as an 
entrepreneur, is self-interest leads you to learn about your projects so 
you can achieve your goals. This is self-learning. "boy, I really want to 
get this done. "I better really focus on it. "what do I have to learn so 
I'll be happy, because I'll get what I want?" But the very same 
self-interest encourages you to hide from negative information. It is 
self-protection. The technical term in society is cognitive dissonance, 
blocking information, which will cause you to have to rethink what you're 
doing. You buy a dress you really love, except you look horrible in it. 
You don't want to be told you look horrible. Now, you know you should be 
told you look horrible in it because you really don't want to look 
horrible in it, but then again, if they tell you you look horrible in it, 
think how bad you'll feel about all the money you just spent on this 
dress that looks horrible? So which do you want? Do you want your friends 
to say to you, "boy, is that horrible"? Or do you want your friends to 
say to you, "well, it's an interesting dress"?
<P>
Do you see the problem that builds up? I was talking to the guys on that 
one. You know, several of you -- just think about those long weekends. 
Now, the point is when you think about -- or getting your haircut or 
whatever. What I'm trying to say to you is you've got to think about half 
of you wants to be told the truth even if it's painful, because you 
really want to do better, and after all, you won't do better if you don't 
have the truth. The other half of you wants to be protected from the 
truth if it's painful, because you don't like the pain. Bureaucracies and 
credentialing minimize self-learning and they maximize self-protection. 
"I don't have to learn these things. "I'm already a tenured Ph.D.., So I 
don't care what you think of my class." This is not true of me 
personally, but this is a -do you see what I'm saying? "I'm a bureaucrat, 
so even if I'm an arrogant, stupid bureaucrat doesn't matter, because you 
can't fire me. "It's too much trouble." On the other hand, because 
markets won't let you hide from failure, they maximize self-protection 
and they minimize -- I mean, they maximize self-learning and they 
minimize self-protection. In the marketplace, if you lie to yourself, you 
go broke. People refuse to deal with you. You know, if I'm a bureaucrat 
and you have to see me to get your driver's license, I can be as nasty as 
I want to be, because you have to see me.
<P>
But if there are three competitive driver's license offices and they pay 
the government a little fee to be allowed to issue driver's licenses, 
you're going to go to one that is the most efficient, the most courteous, 
the most available. Now, I, the bureaucrat who's now a contracted out 
self-serving person, I now have to be nice to you or you won't come to my 
particular drive -- there's no reason you couldn't issue driver's 
licenses through three or four or five different companies. Each of them 
would pay the state a fee for issuing the driver's licenses. Sure. You're 
seeing lots of different things. But just think about it. You see it in 
hospitals. I mean, look at the ads you now see: "come to our hospital. 
"you have more fun having a baby with us." I mean, I don't know of any 
woman who's had a baby who thought that was a convincing ad, but it's -- 
but the principle's right.
<P>
But notice the difference in the two systems. In a credentialed, 
bureaucratic structure, if you don't like what I'm doing, tough break. I 
don't have to learn it, because I'm still here. In a market environment, 
if I don't pay attention and I don't do what the market wants and what 
the customer wants, I go broke. Now, because of self-learning and 
self-interest, entrepreneurialism ultimately requires a moral basis. This 
is one of the things which I think the modern age has explicitly failed 
to understand. You see the cynicism and the attitude of the elite culture 
and of the press corps about this whole notion of markets and 
entrepreneurs and bureaucracy, what they don't get, and frankly, this is 
partly because of some levels of libertarian thought. What they don't get 
is that Adam Smith wrote two great books. The more famous is "the Wealth 
of Nations." It is actually his later book, and I suspect in his own mind 
his less important one, this is "the Theory of Moral Sentiments." Let me 
say up front, it is a lot harder to read than "Grinding it Out" by Ray 
Kroc. This is very dense, mid 18th century literature. But his argument's 
very simple, and it's well worth your spending a minute on. Smith is a 
moral philosopher. He's not an economist. Economics -- and this goes back 
to credentialing. In the early -- in the original world of learning in 
the 18th and 19th century when Smith came out, you learned what you 
needed to learn to write what you needed to write.
<P>
Only in the modern age under the influence of the German school of 
professionalism we began to break it down so that this is an economist, 
this is a political scientist, this is a historian. And we have all these 
various subdivisions which are our efforts to break life down so we think 
we can master it by knowing a great deal about one subset. So I know a 
lot about your wallet as an economist, and I therefore know you, which is 
silly. Of course it's not true. Smith, however, was of a different world. 
Smith was a moral philosopher. He would have thought of economics as a 
subset of moral philosophy. And in the theory of moral sentiments, he's 
trying to wrestle with: why do people behave the way they do? 
<P>
He comes up with a great concept. It's important, remember, the invisible 
hand is his model in "the Wealth of Nations," that the free market guides 
us to serve the most people in order to make the most money, and if we 
don't make you happy, you won't pay us, so you won't be happy and then 
wewon't be happy, so our own self-interest forces us to learn about your 
self-interest, which is why the marketplace is the most self-disciplining 
mechanism ever built, much more so than a totalitarian police state. 
Because it is the invisible system which forces me to make me happy to 
figure out what will make you happy. And since Spielberg does it with 
"Jurassic Park," he got more money, so he's happy. If he produces a bomb, 
he won't be happy. And even though he might say, "I sure wish we could 
pass a law to make all of you go to my next three movies," as long as 
it's a free market, he will only succeed by pleasing you. So that's the 
invisible hand.
<P>
In Volume 1, the earlier work, "the Theory of Moral Sentiments," what 
Adam Smith says is there is a man or woman in the mirror. Every person, 
except for people who are sociopaths, every person has an invisible 
mirror in their head which they look into and they say, "Is it right?" 
And they can't avoid it. And they do wrong, but they know it's wrong. I 
mean, since we're all weak, we all do wrong, but he says -- he builds a 
theory of moral sentiment. He says the base of society is right and 
wrong. It's not money, it's not economics, it's right and wrong. And that 
a healthy society consciously thinks about: how do we establish a 
framework in which the rules tend to favor those who ask that question 
and listen to it? So it's a framework that favors the honest over the 
crooked. Now, that may sound obvious, but it's not obvious. It's a 
framework for example which would be very tough on passing bad checks, 
because it is a deliberate act to defraud your neighbor.
<P>
And so we would say, "hey, we want to really reward honesty. "we want to 
set a standard of honesty, "we want a standard of not taking from your 
neighbor." Very different kind of society. And Smith saw economics, "the 
Wealth of Nations," as a part of this much larger picture, which begins 
with the notion that if we're going to have a free society, if we're 
really going to -- if you think about it, free societies require enormous 
levels of trust. We'll form a partnership. We'll both work at it. That's 
a very high level of honesty. That's an assumption that you're not going 
to try to rig the game and cheat me. If you live in a society -- there 
are cultures on the planet where people don't trust each other. They wake 
up in the morning with distrust. In that kind of a society, it's very 
hard to work together to be creative, because I assume you're going to 
cheat me, so I've got to figure out all sorts of -- this is why lawyers 
are devastating to American Civilization. Because lawyers create an 
adversarial environment. 
<P>
I mean, if you live in a country where there are TV commercials that 
basically say, "If you haven't sued somebody recently, why don't you 
bring your rolodex down and let us go over it together"? I mean, the 
legal system of adversarial thinking is devastating to an entrepreneurial 
society. Because it begins to break down the barrier of friendship and 
relationship and trust, and begins to say -- we're having -- I mean, I've 
found in my own business now that there are moments when the lawyers who 
now are trying to protect me and make sure I don't do anything are 
saying, "well, if you do 'x,' it will set up 'y,'" so you're being told: 
don't do the common-sense, compassionate, decent thing, because it will 
be a pretext for a lawsuit. You've got to wake up every morning assuming 
every person you deal with could potentially sue you. Now, that is death 
to an entrepreneurial society. The lawyers. In a totally misshaped 
understanding of what the purpose of the legal system is. It is not the 
purpose of a legal system to find ultimate justice at the ultimate end no 
matter how destructive the total cost.
<P>
The purpose of a legal system is to create a framework in which people 
live together with reasonable costs, solving problems in a reasonable 
way. Now, what you have today is a legal structure which is dominated by 
the trial lawyers who make the money by the lawsuits, who rig the game in 
favor of more lawsuits. I mean, it is a very sick system, and it has to 
be thoroughly overhauled.
<P>
Do you think it can be changed?
>>sure. That's what we're all about. You can come to the town hall 
meeting. Are you doing a town hall meeting today? Sure. At noon in 
Woodstock. I do it every Saturday. But my point is, is you think about it 
culturally. This is a cultural point. It's a point makes in his book that 
he says the two greatest challenges to us in the world market as a 
society are the cost of health care and the legal system, which creates 
adversarial psychology. And that comes right back to this notion to have 
an entrepreneurial free society, you have to consciously cultivate 
honesty and a sense of trust, and you have to instill that and you have 
to reward those who follow it, and you have to punish those who break it. 
Otherwise -- and punishment can be things as simple as economic costs. I 
don't mean put them in jail, but finding says -- somebody once said 
reestablishing shame. You know, re-creating a sense of: that's bad 
behavior. That's unacceptable. Now, in that framework, let me just 
suggest to you that markets reinforce success, but bureaucracies 
reinforce the failure to get accurate information.
<P>
That to maximize your own success, you have to emphasize honesty and 
integrity and discourage misleading or dishonest information. This goes 
right back to remember the notion that if you put on a dress or a suit 
that doesn't look good, in a truly healthy society, you would like your 
closest friend to suggest to you taking it back. Wouldn't you? Isn't that 
the real the fact, that you'd like to get honest feedback, but to get 
honest feedback, you have to live in a society which values it? On the 
other hand, if you think you'll be punished for giving honest feedback, 
you know, "complain about us and we'll see that your papers get lost and 
the bureaucracy won't approve it for three months," or, you know, "mess 
with me and you won't get tenure," or "mess with me and you won't get a 
good grade," and so the more you can get down to a marketplace, the 
further you can get away from bureaucracies and credentialing and the 
better off. 
<P>
This fits, by the way, the one uniquely American philosophy, pragmatism 
as developed by William James. "Pragmatism," which actually grew out, and 
James gives credit to an earlier American who'd written an article 
actually in a scientific magazine, is a fascinating concept. It's 
originally based on the work of Charles Pierce, and what Pierce was 
trying to discover is: how do Americans think? And what he concluded was 
that Americans have developed a new philosophy where they looked at 
reality and then came back and created their thoughts. The pragmatic did 
not mean to sell out. In Washington today, "pragmatic" often means 
selling out. That's not what the term meant. The term "pragmatism" meant 
trying to use common sense and your real understanding of real life in 
order to then formulate a philosophical understanding working back from 
it. Being pragmatic meant taking in all the data, thinking it through, 
and then reaching a conclusion that fit the realities you were dealing 
with. And it was seen by 19th century Americans as the absolute logical 
way to deal with things. 
<P>
So you didn't start out and say, "look, here's what I have in my head. 
"let me now re-interpret reality so it fits what's in my head." It said 
the opposite: "let me try to understand reality and then come back and 
think in my head what I should do now that I've been in close touch with 
the real world." Did not mean, you know, to compromise. It did not mean 
to sell out. It did not mean any of those things. It was, in fact, a way 
of trying to come in close touch with practical reality. Which is why 
pierce first writes about it in a popular scientific magazine, not a 
philosophical journal. He's trying to grab: why are we such an inventive 
people? Because we're willing to pragmatically try to solve things, as 
you'll see next week when we talk about the spirit of invention and 
discovery. This is a country which has a huge drive to invent, to 
discover. You know, Benjamin Franklin invents the lightning rod. Why does 
he invent it? Because he wants lightning to quit hitting buildings. How 
does he invent it? He tries to figure out something that will draw the 
lightning -- the electricity away from the building. I mean, why did he 
use the product he used? Because it worked. "It worked" is -- for most of 
American history, "It worked" or "It failed" were definitive statements. 
Only in more recent times do you say, "well, it may be failing, but let 
me give you the really good explanation of it." In most American history, 
it was, "well, that didn't work. "let's go try something else" which is a 
pragmatic kind of approach. 
<P>
There are five enemies of entrepreneurial free enterprise: bureaucracy, 
credentialing, taxation, litigation, and regulation. Let me walk you 
through them. First, bureaucracy. Bureaucracy teaches that process is 
more important than achievement, that rules are more important than 
productivity, and that bureaucrats should dominate productive people. And 
I think those -- and all three of those are absolute -- I could validate 
1,000 times a day that those three things happen every day. Second, 
credentialing. You can apply this to your own experience of college; 
emphasizes attendance over achievement, obedience over creativity, and it 
emphasizes an elite's definition of useful knowledge. And the elite, by 
the way, is largely a credentialed elite. It's not an aristocracy or an 
elite of achievement. Third, taxation shifts resources away from hard 
workers, achievers, and entrepreneurs into the control of bureaucrats. 
Taxation discourages the productive by taking from them the fruits of 
their effort. 
<P>
Taxation transfers wealth from the best market-oriented entrepreneurs 
into the control of government careerists who focus on inputs, not 
outcomes, and who measure processes, not successes. "how committed are 
you to dealing with drug addiction" is a question which means: will you 
spend a lot more money? It does not mean if you find out that the most 
effective drug programs in America are very cheap, do we take all the 
expensive ones and replace them with cheap ones? Which, by the way, turns 
out to be true. Almost all successful transformational programs are very 
inexpensive, because they rely on a missionary spirit and a spirituality, 
which are antithetical to government bureaucracies. And almost every one 
of them are cheaper than the parallel government service which fails. Yet 
if you were to say, "I have a terrific idea. "I'm so committed to helping 
addicts, we should cut the program in half," people would think you were 
crazy, because that is not how the modern welfare state measures. 
<P>
It measures process, not result. Investment, not outcome. Regulations are 
a burden to entrepreneurs, a diversion of their time, often a process 
that requires learning the bureaucrat's meaning and the bureaucrat's 
system even when it objectively has no impact on reality. It is a daily 
reminder that the bureaucrat is more powerful than the entrepreneur in 
modern America. That's a very key statement. At the present time in 
modern America, a totally obscure bureaucrat who has achieved nothing and 
knows nothing has more power than a person who creates a million jobs. 
You decide which of the two can put the other out of business. Litigation 
is a direct threat to the entrepreneur. Operating on scarce resources to 
create a better future, the entrepreneur is constantly threatened by the 
specter of a lawyer whose lawsuit will, at a minimum, divert time and 
money, and may literally bankrupt the endeavor. Just when the 
entrepreneur should be focused on achievement, he or she must focus on 
legal self-protection. Now, those are the five killers of entrepreneurial 
behavior, and so what we're going to think about as we come back in the 
second hour is we're going to lay out looking at: how do we create a more 
entrepreneurial society? 
<P>
Remember, "entrepreneur" means "to undertake." It doesn't mean just to 
make money, but we want an entrepreneurial society so that people create 
local ballets, they create local sports team, they create local 
charities, local hospitals. Entrepreneurship is the idea. I think I want 
to get something done, I will go undertake it. Now, what you want to have 
is a healthy free society where there are 260 million people who get up 
in the morning and go, "wow, this is a great day. "we're free. "we're 
Americans. "I wonder what I'll undertake today?" And then if we do that, 
our gamble is, this has been our gamble for 300 years, that the explosion 
of energy that we arouse by allowing everyone to pursue happiness creates 
such enormous creativity that it drowns the more disciplined, efficient 
systems of centralized dictatorship. So we'll let the other team have the 
bureaucracy, they'll be real smart for three weeks.
<P>
We will then drown them in the sheer energy and creativity of free 
Americans who are liberated and who, therefore, rush around with enormous 
energy trying to pursue happiness. Very core cultural commitment of our 
civilization. So any -- I think John said there was, like, a minute and a 
half. Any questions? Yes, sir.
<P>
'What kind of an advantage or disadvantaged environment would you say 
that having been a historian and not an attorney in your political life, 
which is essentially a world of lawyers, has been? Well, I believe it's 
not being an historian. I believe whatever you want to do, study the 
history of those who did it. That's what napoleon hill did. If you ask me 
to what -- what advantage do I gain by any problem I face, I start by 
saying, "tell me a story." And I listen to the history of the problem. I 
listen to the history of the people around it. Why did they fail to solve 
it? What are their views. So if you say -- if you're asking me how 
valuable do I think it is to start by learning about reality by studying 
history? I think it is irreplaceable. I think it's one of the real keys 
to my success. It's different than being a historian. It's useful to have 
historians who write histories you can then read, but every American, I 
mean, I think every successful entrepreneur who's smart, you learn this 
over time, starts by studying the history of what they're trying to do, 
and I think in that sense it's invaluable. So when we come back, we're 
going to pick up the notion of what would getting back to American 
entrepreneurial behavior, reestablishing the "Laws of Success" of 
Napoleon Hill, and looking at how to be an effective entrepreneur, a 
variation on "Effective Executive," and we'll gather in a couple minutes.
<P>
(break)
<P>
>>let me remind you where we're at at this point. We're talking about to 
undertake, entrepreneurialism. And what I'm going to suggest to you in 
the next few minutes, using the standard model for planning that we've 
talked about for analysis and planning, is we're going to look at 
entrepreneurial vision, entrepreneurial strategies, entrepreneurial 
projects, and entrepreneurial tactics. So we're going to literally come 
right down to a model of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics, and 
we're going to look at in a large sense, if you really wanted every 
American to have in themselves the sense of it, if you grew up in 
America, planning to undertake things, planning to be an entrepreneur, 
what would it be like? Interestingly, it's very different than the 
working model that came out of world war ii. Remember, in World War II, 
we mobilized 15 million people, put them in uniforms. Big systems did big 
things. We had the manhattan project to invent the atomic bomb. We had a 
huge fleet.
<P>
We got in the habit of if you look at the Eisenhower cycle, you have the 
habit, and it's legitimate in total war, a large structure doing large 
things in a very orderly manner, and so the big became the thing. We -- 
you know, we admired IBM, we admired general motors. But now look at an 
entrepreneurial society. What would you favor? You'd favor the small, the 
beginner, the one who undertakes. Now, imagine you rewrote your tax code. 
Right now, if you work for a big corporation, you get a tax break if you 
buy your health insurance. If you're self-employed, you don't. Just start 
with that and work your way through the whole system. So imagine you 
started and you said right now, if you're in the welfare system and you 
go out and start to work for Amway and you report your earnings, you get 
kicked off welfare, so you might earn enough out of Amway to begin to 
learn how to sell and to begin to learn how to work and to begin to learn 
how to have money, but if you got just that first rung of the ladder, 
basically what we've done in the welfare state is two things. We've said, 
in terms of big and small, that government which is very comfortable with 
the big. 
<P>
The president could meet with the head of the three auto companies. You 
can't meet with 20 million small businesses. So in a sense, the 
government tilt between big and small, the bias is towards big. The big 
-- and it's not because of any corruption. It's because they're easier to 
find. They're more organized. So you say, "let's pass a regulation." The 
big already have lawyers on their staff. It's the small who have to go 
out and hire a lawyer. So the big says, "not a big deal. "this is not a 
bad regulation. "just more work for my lawyer." The small goes, "that's 
my margin of profit." Okay? Second, to understand an entrepreneurial free 
society, you have to have a ladder. This is a ladder. I can't draw very 
well and I can't write very well, but just bear with me. What the welfare 
state does is it -- it says: you'd better jump from here -- this is a 
stick person. 
<P>
This is not a giraffe. In a healthy free society, you're down here. 
You're poor. You get to the first rung. What the welfare state does is it 
says: if you can't jump from here to here, we're going to punish you. So 
you can't go out and get a part-time job. It's illegal. You can't go out 
and begin to undertake. It's illegal. You couldn't open up a beauty shop 
in your public housing apartment. It's illegal. Yet how did people 
historically rise? They worked at home, they did odd jobs, they got a 
little bit of money, they learned the habits, and three to five to six 
years later, they're up here. We've killed the first five years of 
rising. Made it illegal. And that's why you've got to revisit this whole 
thing. You know, a smart society favors entrepreneurs, because 
entrepreneurs provide the resources for helping others. I mean, if you're 
going to -you know, if you're going to tax the successful, it's helpful 
to have lots of successful, and if you have enough people -- if you have 
enough people who are successful, they give away enough money.
<P>
Andrew Carnegie endowed 2,563 libraries. He built them personally. The 
deal was the city or town would provide the land. And they would provide 
the books. He'd provide the building. 2,563 personally given libraries 
around the world. Now, in order to do that, he had to be very successful. 
And yet today, we don't -- there are a lot of people who love jobs, but 
they hate job creators. So they punish the job -- sort of like loving 
eggs and hating geese. So you keep shooting geese so that you can't get 
any golden eggs, because you'd be happy to have eggs, but the stupid 
geese keep coming in. Very important to say if you really want energy and 
success and wealth, you'd better encourage lots of people to be 
entrepreneurs. Now, culturally, we're still okay. We haven't totally 
broken down, despite the discontinuity from 1965 to 1995. Americans favor 
achievement over bureaucracy, learning over education, health over health 
care, housing over housing authorities, safety over government 
ineffectiveness, and job create over taxation and regulation.
<P>
And literally, what I'm suggesting is you can take the ones we favor, 
achievement, learning, health, housing, safety, and job creation, and 
start saying: all right, what would be -- the changes be like to get to 
there, the changes culturally, the changes in the society, the changes in 
government? Or to put it differently, look at the difference between 
entrepreneurial business and bureaucratic business, entrepreneurial 
government and bureaucratic government. I mean, government doesn't have 
to be bureaucratic, and business is not automatically entrepreneurial. 
There are big corporations that are so bound up in red tape and so 
bureaucratic that they are basically parallel variations on the 
government. And there are some government systems that are so lean and so 
creative that they arelike the most -- they're like the best of the 
entrepreneurial systems. So the question is not: where is the structure? 
It's not government versus business. The question is: are you 
entrepreneurial, are you problem solving, are you creative, are you 
focused on the market and on the customer and on getting the job done?
<P>
Or whatever you happen to be, private or public, are you slow and 
dominated by procedures and dominated by red tape and dominated by people 
who tell you the rules rather than the achievements? And those are 
psychological. Now, another factor here, and this is going to be a huge 
factor in the next few years, a healthy, productive system is very 
decentralized. I can't say this too strongly. Very decentralized. What 
you want to do, I mean, it's interesting if you watch the way I am 
speaker. People think I'm the strongest speaker in maybe 70 years. The 
fact is, I decentralize all the decisions. Dick Armey runs the house on a 
day-to-day basis. We have very strong committee chairmen. My strength 
comes by delegating back out to lots of good people who are then to get 
the job done so that they are solving the problems. I called Joe Paterno 
a couple months ago and asked him about being a head coach. He said: one 
of the keys is to let your assistant coaches make mistakes.
<P>
Because if they can't make mistakes, they can't grow. So you've got to 
delegate, get it away from you, let them go learn. You want a very 
decentralized society. You want local people making local decisions. It's 
a totally different model from the sort of centralized command 
bureaucracy which grew out of Ludendroff's management of Germany in World 
War I and then was gradually primated throughout the modern world and 
ended up with people thinking you could plan health care and you can plan 
education. You need centralized national plans. Totally wrong. You need a 
centralized national direction. You need leadership that says, "we're 
going that-a-way." But when you say, "go west," you then want 20,000 
individual wagon trains. You don't want to try and have one centralized, 
you know, government wagon center. A very different model. And as a 
result of being decentralized, a healthy, productive system has a lot of 
small units. 
<P>
So that one of the things you want to do is you want to constantly create 
the nurturing of: how do I spin off small things? For example, when Zoo 
Atlanta became privatized instead of the mayor of Atlanta spending five 
minutes every three months thinking about Zoo Atlanta, you had a 
full-time director and a president of the Zoo Atlanta -- of the friends 
of the zoo who worked on it every day all day, because they now had 
control and they were in charge. It went from $850,000 budget to a $9 
million budget. It went from being almost disaccredited because it was so 
bad to being a world class research zoo. It's totally privatized. All the 
funding's now private. There's no tax money left. And by decentralizing 
away from the city of Atlanta to that unit doing its own thing, we have 
dramatically changed how it operates. Now, one of the reasons the post 
office is failing, frankly, is that it's neither fish nor fowl. We've 
neither said to it, "you're now in charge, good luck," nor do we take it 
under the government and say, "we're going to reshape you, because we're 
in charge." 
<P>
So you have a bunch of guys who aren't really in charge because the rules 
are set by the congress, and then the work rules are set by the union 
negotiations, and then it's a mess. And we would be much, much better off 
to decide decisively: how do you want to get it run, and then run it. And 
get it away from the federal government, which can't think about these 
things. I mean, you can't think about Bosnia, Chechnya, Somalia, Haiti, 
Rwanda, trying to think about the entire national economy, and then 
micromanage a system of 800,000 employees. Nobody has that kind of span 
of control. So what you want to do is have lots of smaller units. You 
want to constantly devolve things away, get them back to somebody who can 
actually do something. A healthy, productive system is best educated and 
shaped by markets. I'm lost. What are you doing? Let me go back and try 
again. If you look at the notion of marketplaces, what we're suggesting 
here is that to truly shape things, you want to have the market making 
the decisions. 
<P>
Not the bureaucracy, not the politicians, not the academic elite, not the 
lawyers, but the marketplace. And you want to find out some way so that 
you have choice. In a funny way, it means you're constantly thinking 
about you as a consumer. How do I maximize your right to choose, your 
right to choose in health care, your right to choose in education, your 
right to choose in government services? If there's not some overwhelming 
reason for it to be a government monopoly, why not simply decentralize it 
and dump it into the market? Even if the government wants to do it. Have 
the government do it in a competitive manner. Now, it's also fair to say 
that as a result, if you're going to have a very decentralized system 
with lots of small units running around focused on the markets, that a 
healthy, productive system has a lot of leaders. And that that model, 
having a lot of leaders, means you've got to think about a system where 
it's not who's the president or who's the speaker or who's the 
government, but it's: who's doing something neat today?
<P>
So Bill Gates shows up, he dropped out from college, he never got a 
degree, and he happens to be worth billions of dollars and he runs 
Microsoft, which happens to be the most heavily capitalized company up to 
GM in the world. Or somebody else shows up, you know, Steve Jobs drops 
out of college and invents apple computer. Or Spielberg creates "Jurassic 
Park." I mean, what works is what works. This goes back to remember 
pragmatism? How can you tell what works? Because it's working. And what 
happens is credentialed people and academics and bureaucrats want to have 
something that gives them stability. They want to decide what works. And 
so very often, they will define the most grotesque failure as a good step 
in the right direction. You know, have you ever noticed there are no 
public failures? I mean, you know, if McDonald's did as bad at serving 
the customer as public housing, it would not only bankrupt, it would 
probably put the head of McDonald's in jail. But there are no public 
failures. If you put the word "public" in front of something, it's 
morally good. That's an example of what happened in the mid 20th century.
<P>
I mean, why is it morally good? Why should the word "public" mean 
anything except that it's a great word? I mean, yet you can talk about 
people and you can say, "well, public spokesman" for it as though private 
is bad. But what we're suggesting here is that what you want to test is: 
does it really work? What are the real products? Let me tell you, you 
measure much of modern government by that test, it's gone. You measure 
much of education by that test, it's gone. You measure a lot of health 
care by that test, it's gone. Because if you go to the customers and you 
say, "are you happy? "do you think you're getting the best product? "Is 
something actually working?" You'll suddenly discover that they're being 
coerced by the legal power of the state to engage in behaviors they would 
not voluntarily engage in and which they don't think are very productive, 
and so what you want to do is you want to say, "all right, by definition, 
you show me something real big and I'll show you something we should 
rethink," and that includes the Pentagon.
<P>
I mean, I'm not standing here saying, "let's not look at everything but." 
I'm saying: you look across the board, and then you've got to say if you 
want the society to get something done, try to keep it private, try to 
keep it small, try to keep it decentralized, try to find local leaders 
who grow by doing. Which is totally different than a credentialed simply 
bureaucratically planned system. Then you come back to the notion, which 
is really the scary part of this, that entrepreneurial free enterprise 
includes the right to fail. Very important. I mean, if you're not going 
to let people fail why do you think they're going to learn? If you have a 
school system that says, "as long as you show up, I'll give you a 'C,' 
even if you can't read, I'll at least promote you because we don't want 
to make you feel bad about yourself," nonsense. If you're 9 or 10 years 
old and you can't read, I want you to feel terrible about yourself. 
<P>
I want you to say to yourself, "I have got to buckle down here and learn 
this, because I am never going to get a job in my whole life." I mean, I 
want you to feel miserable if you can't read when you're 15, and I want 
you to say, "I feel so miserable, I'm going to start learning how to" 
read. If we say, "well, it's really socially acceptable because we know 
you mean well and we don't want in any way to impair your self-esteem," 
baloney. If you can't read, I want you to have terrible self-esteem and 
then buckle down and learn how to read. Yes, it's scary. But the truth 
is, you can't read. If you can't read, you can't get a job. If you can't 
get a job, you don't have money. If you don't have money, you don't have 
any power. So now we've said: we want you to be the powerless person with 
a lot of self-esteem. We've lost our minds. There's no harm in failing. I 
keep telling that to my friends. I ran twice and lost. 
<P>
My first try at writing a novel was so bad that Alvin Toffler's agent 
wrote back and said, "I assume you shake hands better than you write 
fiction." That did actually stop me for four or five years. I decided, I 
mean -- but I bounced back after a while, and I'm back again. I've got a 
new novel coming out. I mean, you can't -- but my point is, you know, 
every -almost every -- not every one, but almost every successful writer 
can show you the first five manuscripts. I mean, Hemingway was once asked 
to write 1,000 words on how to become a writer. He said, "the key to 
writing is" -- he then wrote in the word "write" for the next 994 times. 
You know, I talked to Jack Kemp the other day about he was desperate to 
be a pro football player. He worked out four times a day. He would throw 
500 passes a day all summer. He was just -- it was his thing when he was 
a young guy. He had to do it. And it's hard. You know, and I think unless 
we're honest about it, a free society is the right to soar gloriously, 
and it's the right to crash and burn. When you get to a nanny state that 
says, "we're going to protect you from crashing and burning," they're 
also going to stop you from soaring, because you won't learn enough, you 
won't have enough adversity. You won't collide with reality. Years ago, I 
read a little "Reader's Digest" story about a butterfly that was coming 
out of the cocoon, and somebody stopped and helped him get out of the 
cocoon and so disoriented the butterfly because it didn't have to go 
through the difficult, painful struggle of getting out that it couldn't 
figure out what to do next. Sometimes people have to get out of their own 
cocoon, they have to struggle, they have to learn. And if you try to 
block that from them, they don't have the growth experience, they don't 
have the internal knowledge that they need.
<P>
Now, I want to carry you back and remind you just for a second, because 
we're going to leap into this and I want you to apply it, remember the 
four layers of planning: vision, strategies, projects, and tactics, 
because I want you to think about entrepreneurship, undertaking, getting 
things done at all four levels, and remember that you successfully lead 
by a process: listen, learn, help, and lead. So first you listen to 
people, you learn from people, you help people, and then in a rational 
society, people who know that you'll listen to them, learn from them, and 
help them want you to lead. And a good entrepreneur does a lot of 
listening. They have a burning vision of where they want to go, but they 
listened a lot about how to get there. Okay? Now, I want to come back to 
where we started, where we were at the end of last week, and take back up 
Peter "the Effective Executive." Now, remember that I said to you last 
week, that I thought this was maybe the most important single book on 
effective citizenship and effective entrepreneurship in the 21st century 
that has ever been written, and that I really wish every American citizen 
read it, and I wish probably starting at freshman year in high school it 
became sort of a once-a-year required reading. The reason is that there 
is so much in it, and when you first read it, it's going to overwhelm 
you, so you've got to come back again. And I think if people came back at 
it once a year for five or 10 years, it would truly create an 
entrepreneurial society. 
<P>
Now, I decided that my strategy last week failed, because I was trying to 
not put Chyron up, but if I don't put up, I can't make the points clearly 
enough. So then I decided that I would write out some key things for you 
to think about. So I started with something which a lot of people 
normally skip, that's the preface, which are roman numerals vii and viii. 
How many of you skipped past that? Okay. Good. I'm glad you read it. 
Those of you who read it, being as it is -- I'm now going to give you 
something like -- something like nine or 10 Chyrons that come out of that 
page, out of these two pages, because when you see them -- okay, first 
point he said, he argues, is that you have to manage yourself for 
effectiveness. Remember, this is, in a funny way, a book not about 
managing others, and although "the Effective Executive" sounds like, 
"I'll go up there and I'll be important and I'll be the executive," what 
he really is saying to you is: managing starts with yourself. So 
everybody has a target for being an executive. It's you. And everybody, 
therefore, can do it. And that's his second point. One can always manage 
oneself. Now, let me just say to you, this goes to the heart of 
victimology. And let me just stop you for a second.
<P>
I don't think technically John can put that back up again, but I really 
think this is worth really stopping on for a second, because this is a 
radical assertion. Remember, I talked to you about the notion that you 
were really faced with a question here of American Civilization with a 
discontinuity. And this is a good example. One can always manage oneself. 
>From 1607 to 1965, the dominant culture would have absolutely agreed. 
They would have said, "that's obvious." From 1965 through 1994, we had a 
discontinuity. And you had a dominant elite culture that said: how can 
you expect Sam to manage himself? Sam's black, or he's a poor white from 
West Virginia, or he's a refugee from Vietnam. Sam's had a hard life. 
He'd like to manage himself, but, I mean, it's hard, you know, and it 
just isn't fair to expect that of him. Sam's a victim. And for you to set 
some goofy standard that Sam has to actually manage himself is just a 
sign you're either totally uncaring or you're out of touch with reality. 
Now, isn't that close? I mean, how many "Oprah" shows have there been?! 
<P>
I mean, what -- can you imagine if Donahue and Oprah said halfway through 
-- if at the end of the first half when the victims got done explaining 
their pathologies, the second half of the show was: now, tell us again 
why you didn't manage yourself? And the whole second half of the show 
was: tell us why -- do you have a telephone? Do you have yellow pages? 
Can you afford a newspaper? I mean, you have people who can buy beer 
every weekend, but they don't have any money for a newspaper. And then 
we're supposed to say: that poor victim. You have people who are paid to 
do nothing all month, and they sit there a block from the public library. 
<P>
One example I was given the other day, I was on a radio talk show 
somewhere, I think in Boston or somewhere, and they called in and talked 
about a woman who had been now on welfare for 17 years. And my question 
was: that meant that she had 17 years times 365 days, take out Christmas 
and new year's and whatever, to go to the local library. But she'd stayed 
home to raise her children, which is certainly a legitimate argument, 
although working mothers go to work and put their children in nurseries 
to pay the taxes for this person to stay home, but that's not here nor 
there. Okay, fine. As soon as the kids went to school, which was about 12 
years ago, did she go to the library then? Because she had, after all, 
from 9:00 A.M.. To 4:00. And it's not to pick on this individual woman, 
but it's to say look at the mindset we now accept. I mean, when Drucker 
says, "one can always manage oneself," that's a very radical assertion in 
the welfare state.
<P>
And if you take the words seriously, going back to George Orwell's great 
essay "Politics and the English language," words matter. If one can 
always manage oneself, the first question to ask of every able-bodied 
person is: so what are you doing to improve your life? When a homeless 
person shows up for the 12th straight day, a good question: and what are 
you going to do to earn your meals? And the minute you say, "well, 
they're a victim," then either right or not right. Should the real 
sentence be, "one can always manage oneself unless one is a victim"? Or 
is it, "one can always manage oneself"? I mean, it can't be both. Now, 
let me carry you a step further, though. And this is where really was a 
genius in his studying of Sloan and Marshall and Theodore Vail. What came 
to understand was that effectiveness is a small number of practices. And 
that you can practice effectiveness until it becomes a habit.
<P>
And this is part of what truly changed my life. And the reason it changed 
my life is if day to day being effective is literally learning the habits 
that work and then practicing the habits that work, then you can begin to 
say: okay, what is it I can't do very well? I mean, maybe you're not a 
good salesman or maybe you're not a good speechmaker, or maybe you're not 
a good bookkeeper. Then you can begin to break those down into habits. 
Now, what are the habits? What are the practices? And you'll notice it 
uses the analogy of practicing Mozart. He says his music teacher taught 
him as a very young person. This is another example, by the way, like 
Ogilvy, that, who is writing a management book, is using a lesson he 
learned from his music teacher, because knowledge matters where you can 
apply it. It doesn't matter based on credentialing. So he's giving you a 
management lesson about life based on his piano lessons. Which is why 
real liberal arts is non-disciplinary. It is using that which makes sense 
out of the real world and tying it together with the perceived wisdom of 
5,000 years of written history, whether it's a play, whether it's a 
history book, whether it is politics or it is economics, whether it is a 
statue or it's a business course. It's bringing it together into one 
synthesis based on life. And so point is his music teacher says to him: 
you can't compose like, but you can practice like.
<P>
Again, those of you who play golf, you may not be able to putt like a 
great golfer, but you can practice putting like a great golfer does, and 
that means that once you begin to realize that it's a small number of 
practices and that you can practice effectiveness until it becomes the 
way you are, you literally grow and change. You become the habits. 
Somebody just came to me a while ago about taking pictures. I take 
pictures very efficiently, because I have to, because, I mean, I have so 
many pictures made all the time, and so I've learned to totally relax. 
And most people, watch yourself the next time somebody takes your 
picture, you tense up. I do just the opposite. I totally relax. For me, 
taking the picture is a moment of rest. It's a practice I learned in 
order to survive doing what I do. 
<P>
Jack Kemp came up to me one time, and he used to practice falling, 
because when you're a quarterback, you get to fall a lot. And he said 
literally, you can practice falling a way that you minimize damage to 
your ribs. So you literally -- I was very impressed, because it's a 
practice, it's a habit. Once you can identify pieces that work, you're 
going to run a small business? There are hundreds of little habits that 
make the difference. You want to be a public speaker? There are habits 
you can learn. And as you practice them, they become how you function. 
Now, the other thing he said that I think was so important that I 
underlined one word he doesn't underline: "all" effective executives have 
had to learn to be effective. Remember, he says here that after 45 years 
of studying executives, every one of them, Marshall,, Eisenhower,, every 
one of them had to practice. There were no natural-born effective 
executives. Which is also a sign of great
Hopefulness, right?
<P>
And he goes a step further. He says "all" effective executives have had 
to practice effectiveness until it became a habit. So first you have to 
learn how to be effective. Very important distinction here, two-step 
process. First you learn it, then you practice it. They're not the same. 
Learning in an academic setting is enough to pass the test. Practicing is 
enough to live it in your life. Do you do it automatically every day? 
Listening, I am not a natural listener. All of you by now know this. I'm 
a natural talker. I love to battle. My grandmother used to say that I 
clearly had a lot of Irish blood because I would just babble all the 
time. And my grandmother was a doctor, and so she's allowed to say this. 
This is not an ethnic slur. You know, and I like to wander around -but 
I've learned the first discipline when I start a meeting is -- what do 
you think I do? 
<P>
Ask first what everyone else thinks.
>>you ask questions. You listen. You go around the room. You gather the 
information. That's a learned -- and I'll go into meetings when I'm tired 
and I'm in a hurry and I'd like to cut through all that and get right to 
my deciding, and I stop myself and I say, "don't do it!" Because if you 
do it -- it's like trying to rush a cake. We'll bake it for half the 
length. We'll turn the heat up an extra 150 degrees. You know, and 
literally what offering you, is a cookbook on effectiveness. He says a 
third thing, which I think is one of the most encouraging comments I've 
ever read: "all" the ones who worked at making themselves effective 
succeeded. Now, go back and double check here. Every person he knows who 
actually worked at it became an effective executive. Now, if you go back 
in, notice how radical this is in terms of the discontinuity we've been 
living there. The idea of walking into a public housing project and say, 
"hi, all of you can learn to manage yourself. 
<P>
"and by the way, if you'll practice these habits, all of you will learn 
how to be an effective executive." How different is that from the current 
tone? And we'll create a ladder you can climb. But you see how totally 
different that is psychologically in expectations and structure of 
thought? Now, I decided -- I hate to do this, but I looked at it and I 
looked at it, and I decided that just as a way of starting the game, I 
mean, I really last week was trying to figure out how could I not put up 
to tell you about this book, because I don't want anybody who's watching 
to think, "oh, I've now heard about the book, so I don't have to read 
it." This book is -- when you realize that everything I just showed you 
up to that point is out of those first two pages, then there's the rest 
of the book. But I think the core principles are so powerful, I want to 
spend a minute or two with them. The first one is: know and manage your 
time. Bob weed, who was my first administrative assistant, was a great 
fan, and weed and I really were built into this habit.
<P>
I manage my calendar all the time. I manage it annually, I manage it 
quarterly, I manage it monthly, I manage it weekly, I manage it daily, I 
manage it hourly. I'm extremely aware of how I spend my time. So people 
say to me, "how can you be speaker of the house, go back home and have a 
town hall meeting, teach at, write a book?" The answer is because I spend 
more time managing my time than anybody I've ever met, I mean, and it's 
because I'm a disciple of and I know it works. And so you get up and you 
say to yourself -- first -- and he makes a very important point. This 
goes back to pragmatism and to learning about reality. What is the first 
thing says you should do in order to manage your time? Does anyone 
remember? Record it, right. First he says, this is pragmatism, learn how 
you are spending your time, right? Now, an example, I made the ultimate 
sacrifice, at least in terms of normal peacetime behavior, I called my 
wife last night and I said: we've been running so hard the last week and 
we only have such a short time off tomorrow, that I'm prepared to give up 
the Superbowl and just hang out with her and to heck with it all.
<P>
She doesn't totally believe me yet, but we're negotiating. But my point 
was I suddenly stopped and said to myself: yes, in a normal environment, 
I'd really like to sit and watch the Superbowl, but given what the last 
week's going to be like and what the next week's going to be like and 
what the last month was going to be like and what the next month's going 
to be like is not nearly as important to me as just hanging out with 
Marianne. You have to make real decisions, but if you don't stop -- if I 
had not stopped and said: what's this last week been like? What is next 
week going to be like? You say, well, we can watch the Superbowl, but 
we'll find some time later on in the week, nonsense. Not right now, not 
what I'm doing and not what she's doing, either. She just got a 
promotion. 
<P>
So it's really sort of -- you've got to -- but you've got to start by 
saying: how are you spending your time? Then you've got to say: what are 
your goals and values and priorities? So now you've got column a, how you 
are spending your time, and you've got column b, what is it you think 
you'd like to do? Then you've got to create column c, which is to impose 
b on a. One of the points makes, which has been invaluable in my 
training, is the higher up you go, the less time you have. Because 
everybody below you has the right to claim your time. So I know I start 
every week with a whole range of meetings I can't get out of before I get 
to decide anything about my time. It's the opposite of the way people 
think it works. Now, that means I have to reach way out, three, four, or 
five months, and figure out what it is I want my associates doing so that 
they're calling the meetings I want to go to. Because if I don't get them 
doing the right things, they'll be doing the wrong things, and they'll be 
doing the meetings on the wrong topics, so the only way I can control my 
time is to strategically be so far ahead of the system that I'm assigning 
task forces on the topics I want to meet on, because they're going to 
call me to the meetings. 
<P>
I won't have any choice. So I'd better think through three months from 
now what I wish we were meeting on. Otherwise, if I wait and decide 
Monday, what I'll find out is that I've already spent 80% of my time in 
meetings I can't get out of. Does that -- do you all begin to see a 
little bit of -- so you've got to start with: what are you doing? And you 
do that by literally recording every 15 minutes. As you get important, 
you have a staffer who does it with you. Then you look at: what do you 
wish you were doing? And then you stop and you put the two together, 
which means making choices. It means two things, okay? It means choosing, 
and it means sticking to the choice. I mean, I have now been coerced by 
age and embarrassment into exercising regularly, so I get up and I go -- 
I leave at 6:15 in the morning and I go swim at least four days a week. 
Which means about 5:45 every morning, I have this choice. You've just got 
to work through this.
<P>
>>doesn't that kill your flexibility, though? 
<P>
>>no. It means that you're being flexible when you do this. Remember that 
I do it constantly. I do it hourly, do it daily, I do it weekly. I go 
through this sequence four or five times a day. How long does it take to 
do that?
>>to do which part?
>>I mean, how much time is that actually detracting away from your 
schedule? Minutes. You learn -- I mean, when you've done it 25 years, you 
learn how to do it very fast. I tried doing that, and it took me an hour 
and a half. Yeah, but you'll learn. I mean, this goes back to the point 
about climbing the ladder. I mean, right now it takes you an hour and a 
half. Then it will take you an hour. Then it will take you a half hour. I 
mean, you'll gradually get -- you'll get the habit, and then you'll begin 
to know, "oh, yeah." If I say -- and, I mean, right now, I have my 
schedule for all of next week. On the plane back today, I will look 
through all of next week and I'll figure out what I want to kill, how I 
want to use the meetings I have to be in, and if I only have time for 
three meetings I get to call, they'd better be the right three. So it 
requires me to think through what I'm doing. There's got to be some fun 
out there somewhere. There's a lot of fun. I mean, but look, this can be, 
"I want to go to the zoo." This is not just work. You've got to decide 
what's fun. I mean, I have to tell you, I mean, sitting behind the 
president of the state of the union is okay. Yeah, but, I mean, getting 
-- the other part of it is if you decide -- and you put your finger on a 
really good point. If you decide you want to do something, you ought to 
relax and enjoy it. I decided I'd be an important person. When you're an 
important person, people love to get their pictures made with you. You 
know, the other night we passed the constitutional amendment, we got to 
the dinner late, we spoke to 2,000 people. There were 150 people who had 
not gotten their picture made with me because they were supposed to get 
it made before the dinner, but we were passing the constitutional 
amendment, which we thought took precedent, and at 10:15 at night, having 
-- for the third night in a row, because we had the state of the union, 
then we had the Washington Press Club Foundation, and now we're doing this.
<P>
At 10:30 at night, I was standing there getting my picture made 140 
times. And somebody said, "boy, that was really nice of you." No. It's 
the business I'm in. I mean, if you're a dry cleaner and you've got to 
keep the dry cleaner open because it's the prom night and folks are 
coming by to get their suit, you keep it open. If you're not going to 
take care of the customers, why should the customers take care of you? 
Now, if you don't want to be in that business, go get in a business you 
like. You'll see -- you'll see, and I can't remember now when we used it, 
the segment -- I think it's in the third wave, the segment about the guy 
who founded steak and ale, where he talks about the number one advice he 
gives to people: find something you want to do, because if you want to do 
it, you'll do it. People say to me: how do you get kids to read? I say: 
find out what they're interested in and let them read what they want to 
read. 
<P>
My mother-in-law just did that, so she has a nephew who wants to be a 
drummer, so he's now reading biographies of drummers. He's so excited, he 
can't stand it. Now, you'd never get a normal school class to say that's 
an acceptable topic, but he'll read like crazy if he gets to read about 
what he wants to read about. So I come back to you and say: if you find 
out when you go through this and this you're miserable, rethink this. Why 
are you doing it? That's why I didn't become a lawyer. I knew enough 
lawyers. And I don't mean that disparagingly, but when I was younger, I 
assumed because I wanted to go into politics, I'd probably be a lawyer, 
and I watched people who were good lawyers, I didn't want to do what they 
did. I didn't want to think the way they thought, and I liked history, so 
I became a historian. I did history because I liked history. Because I 
think it's useful, because it's fun, it's interesting. It's like reading 
novels. To me, reading a good history book is like reading a good 
mystery. I'm always curious what's going to happen next. And just a 
different way of thinking about things. My point is: if you're not happy 
doing this, erase it and start over. And that's where part of -- and 
there's also a difference between being satisfied and having fun. I'm too 
tired to be having fun. But I'm very satisfied. And again, I think that's 
an adult thing. If you watch somebody -if you watch a grandmother who has 
the whole extended family come home for Christmas, my mother-in-law does 
this, and she cooks and she fixes and she feeds everybody, it isn't fun, 
but it is enormous satisfaction. I think sometimes we're too juvenile. We 
use the word "fun" when we really want -- when we ought to use a more 
adult word, you know: are you satisfied with the way you're spending your 
life? If you're not, then stop and rethink column b, but don't complain 
about it, don't whine. It's your life. Change it. Now, the second big 
thing is: focus on outward contributions. Effective executives do not 
focus inward. Any time I run into somebody and I say, "how are you doing" 
and they start by telling me how they feel, I worry.
<P>
If they tell me, "wow, I've got this great project, I'm doing these neat 
things, we have these good" -- you know, something good is happening, if 
they're focused on contributing, "here's what I'm achieving." "I'm 
writing a script" or "I've got a great movie underway" or, you know -- or 
"I baked a good cake today, and we're having a bunch of folks over," 
anything which is outward. Effective executives focus outward. They don't 
focus inward. This is, by the way, the opposite of the way bureaucracies 
function. Bureaucracies please their own internal hierarchy. 
Market-driven systems please the customer. Totally different models. And 
so an effective executive gets up every morning and says: what am I going 
to do this week that makes a difference? How am I going to be more 
effective outside my activities? How is my company, my bureaucracy, my 
business, my museum, my zoo, you know, my house of representatives, how 
are we going to serve out there better? And then you want to clean up 
inside, you want to be more efficient so you can be more effective.
<P>
There's a big difference. Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness 
is doing the right things. It's better to do the right things 
inefficiently than to do the wrong things efficiently. Again, one of the 
places where bureaucracies die. So you focus outward. The third one, and 
this I mentioned the other -- last week, but I want to come back to it 
because it's so important and it is so opposite of the discontinuity's 
culture. You build on strengths. You do not build on weaknesses. Remember 
I showed you last week, these are mountains. If you're going to have 
mountains, you're going to have valleys. You've got a strong personality, 
you're going to have big weaknesses. What you want to do is find a way to 
balance them so that you get this strength, and then you find out what 
this weakness is and you get a strength that fits this weakness. So your 
team is very strong, because somebody in the team has a strength for each 
thing you need. But what you don't try to do is get that well-rounded, 
dull person who's here. 
<P>
And look at modern human resource management and look at schools and look 
at the way we normally think about things in big systems. What do we look 
for? The person who doesn't make waves. The person who's not disruptive. 
The person who goes along to get along, to use Sam Rayburn's phrase. 
That's not leadership. Leadership requires mountains. And so when you 
look around, when you try to recruit, you've got to say: what are you 
good at? What are your strengths? Some people's strength is they're 
brilliant. Other people have the strength that they work very, very hard. 
Other people have the strength that they're able to
Look out and they're able to organize other people, so while they may not 
be very brilliant or work very hard, they get so much out of the 
collective team that it all works. But notice how different this model 
is. This is a model that says -- and by the way, this is particularly 
true of young males. You get an "a" or you get an "f." Very common for 
very, very strong young males to do very well with the things they like, 
and do very badly with the things they don't like. Just very common. I'm 
not going to make any more comments about hunting, but it's very common. 
And yet you have a society which very often will say: well, first of all, 
do you really want to reward strength? I mean, won't that make people 
feel bad who have weaknesses? Is it really appropriate to have people who 
do as well as they can do? Secondly, how comfortable are you with 
somebody who comes in, you say they're a genius, they're also a pain in 
the neck. Are you really prepared to manage that level of diversity? 
<P>
And yet argument is that great, very effective executives are very, very 
good at spotting, recruiting, and nurturing strength and will tolerate a 
lot of weakness in order to get the strength around them. The fourth 
point, which has been an enormous help to me, is the argument that 
effective executives focus or concentrate on the few main areas that are 
decisive. If you think about it in that sense, the contract is a 
management tool. It gave us something to talk about that focused the 
debate. Whether you liked it or you didn't like it, it sounded positive, 
it did exist, you know, it was in print, and so it focused what we're 
doing. It's given us a focus for 100 days. So you say to me: what are we 
doing? Doing the Contract. It makes my job easy. I just delegate the 
Contract to Dick Armey, and he has to now figure out how to get it all 
done, but then -- but it makes his job easy, because he walks into the 
conference and says to all the committee chairmen: guess what we're doing 
the next 100 days, guys? They all have the same document.
<P>
So then they go to their committees and they say: guess what our 
committee's job is for the next 100 days? So in a sense, you've now 
focused everybody on one goal. So you've now brought together 230 members 
and 6,000 staff on one goal. Now, what brave leaders do very -- and 
effective executives do is they figure out of all these possibilities. 
Which ones are central to their game? And they then magically focus in on 
their game, whatever it is. This is their assignment in the near future. 
They don't pay attention up here and they don't pay attention down here. 
So what they do is they work back from the marketplace and they work back 
from their goals. What is it they want to accomplish? They think through 
their vision, they think through their strategies, and then they say: 
what are the two or three decisive points? Never more than five. Never 
more than five. No human being can manage more than five decisive points. 
<P>
You can have three and get two of them done and add two more. And you can 
do that the rest of your life. But you cannot at one time handle more 
than five things. It is impossible psychologically. It's just too 
complicated. And what you found is that effective executives shrink their 
area of focus so that they can truly focus. It's the difference between a 
shotgun and a rifle. And then they put all of their energy, all their 
time, into solving the specific requirements of the things they have 
decided matter. Which gets me to the last big point. We've now focused 
down, we've said: here's what matters to me. You're now rewriting your 
schedule to fit what you've said matters to you. You've brought around 
you strong people with strong personalities, which means they all -or 
with great strengths. Not necessarily strong personality, but great 
strengths. They may not be strong personalities. I mean, you may have a 
computer person with no personality, but boy, are they great at keeping 
your whole information system up. 
<P>
Or an accountant who's not exactly the life of the party, but boy, do 
they keep you out of trouble with the IRS. Then you've got one more 
thing. Now that you've focused, now that you're thinking about it, 
effective executives makes effective decisions that establish systemic 
change. Now, let me tell you what that means. Every time you run into a 
problem, the first thing you do is you say -- first you stop, right? 
There's a problem. And what do you do when there's a problem? Look at it 
and you listen and you learn. Then before you start to solve it, you say 
to yourself, "aha, is this a symptom of a deeper problem?" Automatically. 
Never ever, ever, I mean, unless it's something goofy like "we need to 
put a postage stamp on it" or something, but if it's anything which 
requires -- if it's anything which requires you to stop for a meeting, 
that's complicated enough that it's worth listening to for a meeting, 
then don't solve it until you've asked the g, that's complicated enough 
that it's worth listening to for a meeting, then don't solve it until 
you've asked the question: is there a deeper problem? The reason's 
simple: if there's a deeper problem, when you solve this one, guess 
what's going to happen?
<P>
It's going to resurface. And then when you solve this one, it's going to 
resurface. But the effective executive, and this is the essence of and 
Marshall, and it took me five years to figure this out in the mid '70s, 
the essence of it is you sutomatically stop and you say -remember, this 
is the reverse of vision, dtrategies, projects, and tactics. This problem 
is a tactic. So, now, let me see, am I going back up to a project level, 
or am I going back up to a strategies level, or am I going back up to the 
vision level? What's wrong?  Why did this happen? What's going wrong in 
our system? Did we have the
Wrong strategy? Do we need to rethink it? Did we design the project 
wrong?  Or is there a flaw in our vision of what we're doing? Because 
then it's worth your taking the time. You see, it's going to take you one 
hour to solve this, one hour to solve this, one hour to solve this, and 
you still aren't there. But if you will stop, figure out what this is, 
and get rid of it, none of these will come back. And you'll be a stronger 
institution or a stronger person or a stronger organization. 
<P>
Sort of like I learned when I woke up after having -- after having been 
out drinking all night that I had a hangover. That may mean take lots of 
aspirin or it may mean think about something deeper here. Or I'd really 
like to exercise a lot, except I never go out and get sweaty. I'm using 
silly examples, but I'm trying to drive home a deep point here: if you 
get in the habit when you run into a problem of asking if there's an 
underlying class of problems that this is a symptom of, and then thinking 
through the systemic changes you need to solve this problem, what you'll 
find happening pretty rapidly is you're really moving.
<P>
Now, notice what you've done now. You've created a system where you focus 
outside to decide what you're going to do, you then focus, narrow down to 
the things that really matter, so you're really focusing your energy 
intelligently, you then control your time so you're able to be focused on 
the things that really matter. You then recruit strength so you have 
strong people helping you solve your problems, and you then always make 
systemic corrections rather than just solve the tactical problem. When 
you find yourself doing those five things as an automatic rhythm of your 
life, then you'll find, a, that you are amazingly effective. 
<P>
I mean, Drucker was right. I mean, he got this. He absolutely understood 
how to do this and put it together -- I mean, he's still in his, I think, 
late 80s writing, but this book is a work of genius. And my point is: you 
take those five ideas, you don't have to have a penny. You don't have to 
have a master's in business, you don't have to be -- you know, you don't 
have to own a business. You know, you can get up in the morning as a poor 
person, take those five key habits, and by the end of the day, you're 
better than you were when you started, and if you did that every day for 
a month, you'd be a lot better than you were at the beginning of the 
month. So every american can learn these five principles. They can learn 
the five habits. And if every -- I mean, if we say to them: that's our 
expectations, you're an American. Why aren't you being effective? 
<P>
Notice how different that is from the psychology of victimization. And by 
the way, notice I'm not controlling anybody. We're saying: why don't you 
be effective at the game you want to play, pursuing the life you want to 
do, so you can have happiness on your terms? Because you're an American. 
You're free. But to be free, you have to have personal strength, and if 
you're going to have personal strength in the information age, you ought 
to learn to be an effective executive, because that gives you the tools 
to be personally effective. And just take that model and compare it with 
what we're used to seeing. Next week's topic is pillar four, the spirit 
of invention and discovery and the development of pragmatism and 
practical common sense, and next week's reading is "Democracy in 
America," volume II, the first book, chapters 9 and 10.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Seven -- PFF</title>
<h2>Renewing American Civilization: Class Seven</h2>
<PRE>
>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska,
>>Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the seventh
>>of 10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct
>>professor at Reinhardt college, will continue his course which presents
>>the foundational principles necessary to the Renewal of American
>>Civilization.  This week's lesson, the Third Wave and American
>>Civilization, focuses on the Third Wave information age, American
>>Civilization, and the rules of human behavior.

>>Let me say good morning. Let me welcome the students who are taking the
>>course from Mind Extension University and remind them and other folks who
>>might be seeing it on cable or on videotape that you can mail your
>>comments to Renewing American Civilization, post office box 6008,
>>Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or you can fax your comments to 404-528-9806.
>>Or you can e-mail your comments to America Online, renewam@aol.com.
>>Also, that class transcripts and other class materials are available on
>>our Internet web page at http://www.pff.org.  And you either got that
>>already or you don't know what it means, so don't worry about it.  And
>>you can -- if you're in the more traditional mode, you can order
>>"American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes and course
>>readings by calling 1-800-to-renew.
</pre>
And I would point out to all of you, since we're going to talk about the
Third Wave today, that while you all kind of go, "well, that's just an old
800 number," an old 800 number didn't exist 50 years ago, so it's amazing
how rapidly we acculturate and acclimate ourselves to technologies.  I also
want to mention, because it's fascinating for anybody who watches in
Alabama, that Michael Ciamarra, who is the head of quality for the
government of Alabama, is hosting starting, I think, this coming Thursday
night at the state capitol, this course for all the senior leadership of
the Alabama government.  And apparently Governor Fob James has decided to
support it and to be part of it, and it's -- we were sent an article from
the Birmingham newspaper about the fact that the class would be taught at
the capitol in Alabama, which is sort of interesting, and they're going to
try to apply these ideas to Alabama state government.
<P>
And, of course, we start in terms of applying ideas with the notion that
the five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the historic lessons
of American Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third,
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And, fifth, quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And that the
four areas in this course to which we will apply these pillars are, first,
the Third Wave and American Civilization, which is today's topic.  Second,
creating American jobs in the world market.  Third, replacing the culture
of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.  And,
fourth, citizenship and community in the 21st century.  And so each of the
next four weeks, in a sense, this is the payoff period.  We spent a week
outlining the course in general.  We spent five weeks outlining the
pillars, and today is the first of the topical sessions which will be four
in number.
<P>
Today's class is on the Third Wave and American Civilization.  This is
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's contribution to modern American systems.  Let me
say the Tofflers have been very successful authors for a very long period
of time.  Their most famous early book was "Future Shock," which is still
in print and available all over the place, and "Future Shock," of course,
created a title.  I mean, people talk about "Future Shock," they made it
up, but it -- as soon as the book came out in 1970, it made sense to
people.  This is the 25th anniversary of "Future Shock." About a decade
later, they tried to say, all right, if we're going through this, what does
it mean?  And they came up with the book which is the title of today's
lecture, which is "the Third Wave," and their argument, which we'll get
into in a minute, is that the -- that Future Shock can be replaced by
understanding that you are in the middle of a wave of change.
<P>
And it's sort of like thinking that you are trying to understand what is a
giant tsunami, to use the Japanese term for a tidal wave.  Well, if you
know it's a tidal wave, you still have a big problem, but at least you know
what the problem is.  And so they're talking about we're in the Third Wave
of change.  They then wrote a book which I really recommend for people who
care about national security.  This is called "War and Anti-War," and in
their effort to bring together the notion that all international relations
are a continuum where you're always engaged in the tension between war and
anti-war, they point out that from 1945 to the present, there have been
three weeks in which there was not a war somewhere on the planet.  Three
weeks in 50 years.  And since future -- since the Third Wave was, in many
ways, the basis -- intellectually the basis of the army's air-land battle
doctrine, had a dramatic impact, they have several chapters in here on how
the army came to grips with thinking about the future and the intellectual
basis of what we did in "Desert Storm."
<P>
Finally, reissued with a new cover, which we were kidding Jeff Eisenach,
who designed the old cover, this is clearly a much better commercial cover
than the one he had, and all of you can talk to Jeff about that later.
He's a little sensitive.  But this is Alvin and Heidi Toffler's new edition
"creating a new civilization, the politics of the Third Wave," and it is
really -- what they did is they edited together the best of the three books
I just cited, plus "power shift," which is another book of theirs.  Now,
the point -- the reason I'm sharing with you is not just to say, "let's do
a biography of the Tofflers," but they have been, since the late 1960s,
trying to work out what's happening in a big way to the human race.  Is
there an underlying pattern?  Is there an underlying explanation?  It's a
little bit like -- if I can use just a couple of very common human
analogies.
<P>
I have a good friend who went out one day, and he's in his late 40s.  In
fact, you know him, Dr.  Mel Steely.  He went out one day -- he's going to
hate me for having told this, because it's a true story, but he'll hate my
having mentioned his name.  He went out one day and he got all excited, and
this happens often to guys in their 40s, and he said, okay, I can do it.  I
can do it.  And he went out and he cut wood and he did everything for two
days, and he got up Monday morning and he thought he was going to have a
heart attack, and he went to the doctor.  And his doctor checked him and
looked at him a second and he said, "did you do something extraordinary all
weekend?" And he said, "yeah," and he began to list it.  And the guy said,
"Mel, you have middle-aged fat man's disease." And Steely went -- he said,
"you can't go out without any exercise, without any practice, have all
these muscles that have been laying on a couch watching football, work for
two days, and not expect to hurt."
<P>
Now, anybody who's a good runner, for example, will tell you.  I mean, you
run -- my daughter runs marathons.  You run a marathon, it hurts, period.
So if you're halfway through running the marathon and you're hurting, what
it tells you is you're running a marathon.  The reason I'm telling you is
that the Tofflers -- these are patterns.  I mean, all of us learn this
stuff.  If you drink too much the night before, you're probably not going
to die the next morning, but there's a feeling which is directly related to
drinking too much the night before.  And you've got to figure out, what are
these patterns?  I mean, you don't study, you fail the test.
<P>
I'm driving at this because what the Tofflers did is they took the most
human of things, which is to try to understand the patterns which affect
you, how can you predict based on patterns, and they backed way up and they
said, all right, let's look at the entire planet.  Let's look at the whole
human race.  What is happening to us?  And frankly, what they wrote is very
parallel to what Kenneth bolding wrote in "the meaning of the 20th century"
and what peter Drucker wrote in "the age of discontinuities." The Tofflers
believe that there have been three waves of change, from hunting-gathering
to agriculture, from agriculture to industry, and from industry to the
information age.
<P>
Now, they use the term "wave" because they said literally, the wave goes
through everything, and it's not that there's a change up here or a change
down here, but there's a wave which goes through everything.  Now, in order
to understand what we're talking about, again, we're staying at a very high
level of abstractions.  We're talking about civilizations.  And it's
important to understand that civilization is an all-encompassing framework
within which people live their lives.  It has a set of principles which
distinguishes it from other civilizations.  Now, this is something
Americans don't often think about, because we're so big as a country and
we're so sort of self-satisfied that we don't spend much time looking at
other civilizations.
<P>
In many ways, we're an ahistorical society.  But if you were to go and look
at the Greeks, if I gave you a set of characteristics, you'd say, "oh, yeah
that's Greek civilization" or "that's Mayan civilization" or "that's Han
china," and some of them could be very simple, as you'll see later on.  If
I say -- and you can -- it's like a detective story.  If I said "rice," you
would know we had blocked in a series of possibilities.  If I said "potato
before 1500."
<P><Pre>
>>Ireland.

>>can't be Ireland.  Potato doesn't come from Ireland.  Before 1500.  Where
>>does the potato come from?

>>North America.

>>no.  Comes from south America.

>>south America.

>>potato comes from the Incas, and it changes the history of Ireland,
>>because the potato allows you to grow more protein per acre, okay?  But
>>the potato's -- in fact, prior to 1500, it could not have been European.
>>Okay, so you go through -- my point is a rice-eating civilization is
>>different than a potato-growing civilization, because the entire rhythm
>>of growing rice is different.  Rice has to be planted and transplanted.
>>It's a whole different cycle.  A wheat-growing civilization has a whole
>>different cycle based on planting and harvesting.  Wheat-growing
>>civilizations, which is the base of all western civilization, are peak
>>system civilizations.  That is, you work very, very hard to plant.  You
>>then do a little bit of getting rid of the weeds, you then work like
>>crazy to harvest.  How does this relate, for example, to peak cycles of
>>studying just before finals?
</pre>
And look at rice, which requires tending to on a much more regular basis,
and a rice-growing civilization would have a tendency to teach you to study
every day.  A wheat-growing civilization would have a tendency to teach you
to have a peak experience and relax and a peak experience and relax.  Very
different rhythms.  But I'm trying to drive at the notion people begin to
acquire rhythms and patterns.  Why do -- look at the difference, and
there's a wonderful book by V.  O.  Key called "the Mind of the South" that
gives you a similar example prior to the age of air conditioning.  Look at
patterns of life in northern climates where people are literally locked in
for the winter by bad weather.  And you find different rhythms and patterns
than you find in a temperate climate where you can go outdoors all day
every day for the whole year.  And so take a look at -- if I say to you,
"let's talk about a set of characteristics," and you begin to build the set
of characteristics, for example, pyramids can only be two places in the
world.  Where are they?
<P><PRE>
>>Egypt.

>>Egypt.

>>and Mexico.

>>Yeah, and the Mayans.  And then you get into, what does that mean and why
>>does that mean it?  So when we talk about civilizations, we're talking
>>about the unifying characteristics within which people normally live
>>their lives, and that different civilizations have a different set of
>>unifying characteristics within which people live their lives.  Now, the
>>Toffler argument is that you really have had three what you would call
>>super civilizations.  The shift from hunting-gathering to agriculture was
>>a supercivilization, as you'll see in a minute.  Then the shift from
>>agriculture to industry is a supercivilization.  That is, it affected
>>rice eaters and wheat eaters.  Everybody, no matter what your background,
>>you were affected by this transition.  And so the rise of information is,
>>in the Toffler model, a supercivilization.  It transcends and absorbs.
>>The wave goes through all of the more normally studied civilizations.
>>Okay?  Let's take a minute and look at Toffler's explanation of the three
>>waves of change.

>>Alvin Toffler: for uncounted millions of years, human beings lived on an
>>untamed planet.  10,000 years ago, some genius reached out and altered
>>our lives forever.  By planting a seed, that hand launched the first wave
>>of change to surge across the earth.  Everywhere, it turned nomads and
>>hunters into peasants and farmers.  300 years ago, like a hammer blow in
>>history, the industrial revolution spread a new civilization from Europe
>>outward.  This was the second great wave of change in human history.  Now
>>a third gigantic wave of change has been unleashed across the planet.
>>Our machines are evolving at a blinding rate.  We too are changing.
>>These changes seem random, unconnected; some, even familiar.  Yet this is
>>only an illusion, for taken together, they form a dramatic pattern.  They
>>are creating a new civilization and killing an old one.

>>Now, in a sense, this is hunter-gatherer, this is agriculture, this is
>>industry, and this is the information age.  And in a sense, what the
>>Tofflers are arguing is that this is the first wave.  Because, remember,
>>they're talking about the layer of change.  This is the second wave.  And
>>this is the Third Wave.  And, in fact, you never quite get there.  But
>>notice also that because of the way in which the planet works, there are
>>places where agriculture never quite took.  Very dry areas, very
>>mountainous areas.  Guess what you get there?  Hunter-gatherers.  So that
>>as late as 40 or 50 years ago, there were still fairly significant
>>stretches of the planet that had hunting-gathering societies.  There are
>>a handful left today, but mostly as deliberately maintained museums.  I
>>mean, the people who survive in the Brazilian rain forests survive
>>because we deliberately will them to survive, because the sheer reach of
>>modern civilization is now so enormous that if we didn't discipline
>>ourselves, we'd overrun the Bushman of the Kalahari.  I mean, these are
>>people who are -- who will rapidly be absorbed into this.  And you have
>>to raise an ethical question at some point, is it really fair to the
>>human being who happens to have been born randomly into this environment
>>to not let them have a laptop, not give them a vaccination against polio,
>>and not dramatically raise their lives?  And yet the second you do, you
>>blow apart this system.

>>it's like the Masers?

>>huh?

>>that's like the Masais?

>>No, no, no, the Masai would be here.  This would be the Bushman, the
>>Kalahari.  In fact, I have a list here.  Let me just say, I'm putting
>>this up, because what I want to emphasize and go through for a minute is
>>that in each wave, everyone experiences the same general change, although
>>the details are different in each society.  That is, during a period when
>>you're -- hunter-gatherers tend to be similar everywhere on the planet.
>>And then as this wave of agriculture occurs, they tend to all go through
>>the same thing, even though they express it in the ways that are unique
>>to their region.  Agricultural civilizations are, in a way, very similar
>>to each other, and I'll come back to that.  When they start to change
>>into industry, they all go through the same wave-like pattern, although
>>they express it differently in each civilization.  Then when industries
>>arise, for example, male -- you know, males wear suits.  It's almost
>>totally universal in an industrial society everywhere on the planet, and
>>it's an artifact.  No particular reason to be true.  As this begins to
>>break down, guess what happens?  Guess what's the most commonly sold
>>article of clothing as you make the transition into an information age?

>>blue jeans.

>>blue jeans everywhere.  And you see the breakdown of dress codes
>>everywhere.  Okay?  Microsoft is a good example.

>>yeah.

>>So there are identity patterns here.  Now, let me walk you through just
>>some examples.  Hunter-gatherer civilizations is a big item.  I don't
>>believe this is a civilization, but everybody else who puts the class
>>together did, so they made me say it.  But look at the Bushman -- I think
>>these are patterns of life, but they are precivilization.  They don't
>>have the carrying capacity of a civilization.  They don't have enough
>>information.  But look at the Australian aborigines, the Bushman of the
>>Kalahari, the Indians of the Brazilian rain forest.  You could have added
>>Papua, new guinea.  I mean, anyplace where you are forced -- and this is
>>the definition of a hunting-gathering society.  You are forced to keep
>>moving.  That is, you can clear a plot, you plant for a little while, and
>>then you move.  And then you clear a plot and you plant for a little
>>while.  Or you gather food and you hunt.  But you're limited by the
>>carrying capacity of the ecosystem.  What's the number one characteristic
>>I just said that affects the capacity to become a civilization.

>>that they're unstable.

>>unstable in what sense?

>>they have no residency, they have no place --

>>right, and since they have no residency, what is it they can't do?

>>they can't set down roots, establish civilization.

>>right, and therefore, what is it that's very specific?

>>housing.

>>they don't have housing, or they have very, very shallow housing, and
>>therefore, when they move, what do they have to do?

>>they have to move everything with them, so they can't get any
>>possessions, so they have no idea of property rights.

>>exactly.  You can't accumulate.  You can't accumulate.  Since you can't
>>accumulate, you cannot build several centuries of property.

>>that's right.

>>the minute somebody invents -- and it was probably initially not wheat,
>>but related to wheat, one of the cereals -- but the minute you get
>>potatoes or rice or a cereal and you can stay in one place, you now have
>>great grandfather's stool and great grandmother's ceramics.

>>plus the land that you're working it on.

>>But then -- you've jumped to property rights.  We're not there yet.  It's
>>not property rights yet.  It's simply the notion that now you can
>>accumulate, and because you can accumulate, other things happen.  If you
>>read a wonderful book called "the forest people," which is very romantic
>>about the pygmies till the last chapter, where he points out that this
>>society means you die if you have a disability, because it can't afFord
>>to carry you.  Now you suddenly have people --

>>caring for the disabled.

>>right.

>>wait.  Say that again.

>>in a hunting-gathering society, the weakest members die because you can't
>>afFord to carry them.

>>it's termed survival of the fittest.

>>that's right.

>>Ruthless kind of survival.  I mean, it's all wonderful and it's all
>>romantic in the 90-minute film, and then you start thinking about the
>>12-year-old who has a limp and they're not going to make it.  And it's a
>>wonderful book by Colin -- let's see, "the mountain people" and "the
>>forest people." I can't remember Colin's last name.  It will come to me
>>in a minute.  Anyway -- I haven't read it in almost 30 years, but it is a
>>-- it's very romantic, it's very wonderful.  Look how natural they are,
>>and then you realize the cost of being natural.  Here suddenly you live
>>longer because you're not moving.  You suddenly get guess what life span?
>>

>>40, 50 years.

>>sure.  What's the bible say is the natural life span?

>>three score and 10.

>>huh?

>>three score and 10.

>>Right, 70.  We just passed it in the last -- in this century.  Up until
>>this century, the natural life span.  And by the way, it turns out that
>>people historically didn't die earlier, they died younger.  What keeps
>>life -- what keeps average lives low in agricultural society is the
>>number of people who die before they're 5, but if you get through 5 years
>>of age, you have a fairly high likelihood in agricultural society, unless
>>you're a woman who dies in childbirth, of living to be three score and
>>10, because you're not -- you don't have to move all the time.  Now when
>>winter comes, you've got a house, you've got food out back.  You've got a
>>rootcellar, you've got all sorts of things that are natural.
</pre>
And notice how it happens.  Agricultural civilizations include Han china,
pharaonic Egypt, Indus valley, Assyria, Sumeria, Babylon, archaic Greece,
the Hellenistic civilization, the romans, Mayas, Aztecs, Incas.  All of
those are civilizations predicated on being able to grow food.  And they
all have similar patterns.  And you see the patterns begin to evolve.  They
all have priesthoods of some kind.  They all have efforts to understand a
supreme being.  They all have political organizations and structures.  They
all have armies.  They all have policing systems.  They all have arguments
over property rights.  What is a property right?  Who owns the property?
They all have holidays, which, by the way, comes originally from the term
"holy day."
<P><pre>
>>they have the rise of the bureaucracies.

>>That's right.  They all have bureaucracies.  You go back to
>>Nebuchadnezzar at Babylon, you go back to hammurabi, the original order
>>of -- ruling of -- writing of the law.  You know, if you have a law, you
>>have to have an enforcer.  If you have an enforcer, it's a bureaucrat.  I
>>mean, all these systems have their version of the IRS.  They're all
>>patterns.  Now, if then you have those, let's look at suddenly you get
>>the rise of industrial civilizations.  Britain, bourgeois France,
>>imperial Germany, America, the Meiji restoration in France -- in Japan,
>>and czarist Russia.
</PRE>
And by the way, if you want to see really dramatic change, it is looking at
the Meiji restoration which occurs in 1868, when you suddenly have a group
of younger leaders come together and say, "we had better modernize Japan or
we're going to be run over," and they systematically go out around -- they
send teams all over the world and they go and they study the French and the
Germans and the Americans and the British, and they come back -- and the
Italians, and they come back and they say, "here's how to modernize Japan.
"let's take the best of each of these." And it is the most willfully
self-conscious act of modernization on the planet.  And they say, "look, we
are trapped here in agricultural society.  "this will not work.  "we have
to move to industrial society to survive.  "if we don't, we'll be devoured
by the Europeans." And when they do, I'll give you just one example.  The
high watermark in Japanese feudal society of the agricultural system
militarily is what?  What do you call a Japanese warrior?
<P><PRE>
>>shogun.

>>samurai.

>>samurai.  Shogun is the guy who organized it, and samurai are based on
>>the use of what weapons?

>>swords.

>>swords, and they're magnificent.  If you see Kurosawa's great work "the
>>seven samurais," it's amazing.  Okay?  The second you move into here,
>>what do you get?

>>guns.

>>guns.

>>and the swords become obsolete.

>>The sword becomes obsolete, and so does the samurai way of life.  And in
>>1870, there was a deliberate rebellion by the samurai, who get massacred
>>by peasants who have guns, because they prefer death to dishonor.  And
>>it's the symbolic end of the agricultural era in -- again, it doesn't
>>fully end.  In fact, in the information age, you can see Japanese
>>factories next to which there are artificially maintained rice paddies
>>going all the way back to here.  And you see in much of the Japanese
>>drive and energy in the industrial era the samurai spirit of the warrior
>>and of nobility and of doing duty.  But my point is each of these -- as
>>you see the transition here, for example, the word "bourgeois" comes from
>>French.  It means middle class, or comes to characterize what we call
>>middle class.  Actually, it meant originally the small property holders,
>>the small businesses and small manufacturers.  This transition occurs in
>>every one of these countries.

>>breakdown of the monarchies.

>>The monarchies begin to collapse because the power structure of
>>agriculture doesn't make sense here.  Money matters more, land matters
>>less.  Land is really important here.  So if you're in an old family, you
>>have lots of land, so you marry a new industrial -- all sorts of 19th
>>century novels about the new rising industrial class that has cash
>>deliberately marrying into the landed class for status, trying to make
>>this bridge.  Okay?  Now, if that's all true, let's look for a second --
>>since this is the one we grew up in, this is a very important thing to
>>keep in your head.
</PRE>
What I'm going to drive at today is not only is it true that we're going
through the Third Wave, but it is a knowable experience, because we've done
it two other times.  So we can study how people have done it.  And you are
personally doing it.  Because every one of you was born in this system.
This is the dominant system today.  It's still the dominant system.  This
is the emerging system, the information age.  And so if you think about it,
and we're going to take five examples just to give you a way of thinking
about it, five aspects of second-wave civilization, of the industrial era,
standardization, synchronization, specialization, massification, and
centralization.  Now, take a look at these five, and Toffler's now going to
walk you through them, and think about how they apply to way you live your
daily life.
<P><PRE>
>>Alvin Toffler: take that quintessential object of the industrial age, the
>>gun.  The gun was one of the first things to be manufactured out of
>>interchangeable standardized parts.  Take one apart, and the parts fit
>>perfectly into another of the same type.  What did this mean?  Meant that
>>we'd taken the first step on the road to uniformity.  And not just in
>>guns.  The second wave of change not only standardized products, it
>>molded us to fit into a mass society.  The world of repetitive work, of
>>identical products and images, of skyscrapers, factories, and commuters.
>>Standardization became a way of life.  Synchronization, another principle
>>of industrial life.  Millions of people sharing a common rhythm.  And if
>>some archaeologist of tomorrow found a watch, it would tell a lot about
>>what makes us tick.  The watch maintains the rhythm of 9:00 to 5:00.  All
>>mass societies are not only standardized, they are synchronized.

>>announcement: -- has been delayed for two and a half hours.

>>Alvin Toffler: yet everyone hates the 9:00 to 5:00.  "the Wealth of
>>Nations," of which this is a first edition, begins with a famous passage.
>>In it, he says, "the greatest improvements in the productive powers of
>>labor seem to have been the effects of the division of labor." And the
>>example he gave was that of the pin.  "the important business of making a
>>pin," he wrote, "is divided into about 18 distinct operations.  "by
>>dividing the task among many workers," Smith said, "greater productivity
>>could be achieved." Adam Smith used the pin to reveal another aspect of
>>the hidden code of industrial society, specialization, or the division of
>>labor.  The basic code of mass society ran through every aspect of life.

This popular amusement park in Vienna, for example, is a place where people
come to enjoy themselves, to get away from the factory and the office, to
bring their children on a Sunday afternoon.  But Prater park is special.
It boasts the world's biggest Ferris wheel, and big is what second-wave
civilization was all about.  From the earliest days of the industrial era,
all of us were inculcated with the idea that heroic scale, sheer size, had
something to do with virtue.  The French rushed out and built the Eiffel
tower.  The Americans, the empire state building.  The British, the queen
Mary, and then the queen Elizabeth.  And the Soviets, well, there's a story
about Stalin that he used to call in his experts and say to them, "what's
the biggest steel mill in the world?  "build me a bigger one.  "what's the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the world?  "I want a bigger one." Hand in
hand with the idea of bigness came another basic principle.
<P>
Alexander Hamilton in the American colonies called for the centralization
of political power.  He wanted a strong central government for the united
states.  Later, at this very desk, in the reading room of the library of
the British museum in London, a German emigre named Karl Marx called for
the decisive centralization of power in the hands of the state.  In
capitalist as well as communist industrial nations, power flowed to the
center.  The power of the state, the power of money.  This concentration of
power was paralleled by the concentration of energy, the concentration of
production, and even the concentration of people.

>>take Toffler's main notion here that there are specific aspects.  You get
>>standardized.  I mean, this is, by the way, covered in Kessler's
>>"darkness at noon," where he says that in order to get people who are

>>had gas lights in the 19th century, there's no can't.  You cannot
>>regulate your life by can to can't.  There's a second thing, since you
>>want a lot of people to work simultaneously, they have to arrive at a

>>they had calendars?  But they had broader senses of time.  "see you

>>that begins to disappear, and what I want you to understand is as you go
>>through each of these waves of change, each time you're going through a
>>wave of change, civilizational change goes through every society as a
>>wave which affects every aspect of life, economics, politics, family
>>structure, religion, the structure of society and power, government, and
>>military power and warfare.
</PRE>
So you can literally take this list -- and we'll come back to it in the
second hour -- you can take this list and you can say, okay, tell me about
economics in the agricultural age.  Tell me about economics in the
industrial age.  Tell me about economics here.  Tell me about the structure
of family.  What's family like if you're a hunter-gatherer?  What's family
like if you're in an agricultural society?  How does family change here and
how does it change here?  And you begin to get very different patterns
through all of the manifestations of life.
<P>
Now, to give you an example which is, I think, absolutely fascinating,
which Toffler did, and this comes out of a TV show that Alvin and Heidi did
about 10 years ago.  To give you an example of how these changes permeate
everything, I want you to look at what Alvin Toffler calls "the music
factory," remembering that the characteristics here are standardization,
synchronization, people organized.  And you may think about classes you've
been in, show up at the same time, sit in the same desk, face forward, do
the same thing, take the test at the same time, and I want you to look at
what he calls "the music factory."
<P><pre>
>>Alvin Toffler: before the age of the machine, concert music was performed
>>for princes and patrons, by quartets and quintets, by small chamber
>>groups.  As the second wave arrived, however, the first concert halls
>>began to crop up in Vienna, in Paris, London and Tokyo, and eventually in
>>cities everywhere.  With them came the impresario, the businessman who
>>financed concerts and sold tickets.  The more seats he added, the more
>>tickets he could sell.  But the bigger concert halls needed louder sound,
>>and therefore, more musicians.  The small chamber group grew into the
>>full orchestra.  (applause) the players all dressed in standard attire.
>>They were divided into specialized departments, each with its section
>>leader.  (music playing) the conductor with his baton maintained central
>>control and synchronized the sound.
</pre>
And so it was that the Second Wave got its music factory.  Yet mass society
was not just smoke stacks and assembly lines.  It was a rich, many-sided
social system that affected every aspect of our daily lives.  It put the
great willow run factory outside Detroit, but it also put the tractor on
the farm, the typewriter in the office, the refrigerator in the kitchen.
It gave us the daily newspaper, the cinema, subways, and dc-3s.  It gave us
corporations and cubism.  It gave us Bauhaus buildings and Barcelona chairs
and sit-down strikes and vitamin pills and longer life, and it also
universalized the ballot box.  More important, it linked all these things
together, assembled them like a machine, and produced the most powerful,
cohesive, and expansive civilization the world had ever known.
<P><PRE>
>>can you see the parallel between the symphony orchestra and the factory?
>>Organized, routinized.  Now, one example of the electronic age, we go
>>from the concert hall to what?

>>CDs.

>>A CD.  You have your music.  And, in fact, you'll begin to be able to go
>>to a store, buy -- make up your own CD, and say, "I want this song, this
>>song, this song, this song, this song," packaged, they will package it on
>>the spot, and we'll begin to be at the beginning of the next cycle, which
>>is you sit down with your computer and you write your music.  So your
>>computer will literally create for you your symphony, which will then be
>>on your CD.  I'm not going to comment on how good your symphony will be,
>>but --

>>isn't that like chuck Davis does with the synthesized music?

>>huh?

>>chuck Davis and the synthesized music, rather than having, you know,
>>where it's all computerized?

>>yeah.  Well, to be honest, I don't know.  You just opened up a whole new
>>zone.  One question.  Then we've got to keep moving.

>>one question, throughout history, though, civilizations have been adverse
>>to change.  People don't like change.

>>of course.

>>stepping into this Third Wave, is there any way to overcome that or --

>>sure.

>>-- is that just --

>>We're going to talk about that.  But part of it that helps you is to
>>understand this is not radically new.  We have done this before.  It's
>>like the first time you decide to go hang-gliding or the first time you
>>decide to go sky diving.  If you know other people who have done it -- or
>>the first time -- to use something very simple for most humans, the first
>>time you get in a boat.  It's comforting to know that lots of people have
>>gotten in boats.  I mean, think about somebody who has never been on
>>water, and think about a society where you got up to the edge of the
>>river and you stopped, and the first time somebody comes along in this
>>little thin thing and says, "it will be okay." It feels very unstable,
>>any of you who have been in a canoe, very unstable, right?  You might
>>even flip over.  Some of you may have even done this, but if you know
>>it's okay, yes, you'll get wet, but you'll survive, you change things.
>>Now --

>>the first time you eat an oyster?

>>Yeah.  It's too early on a Saturday morning.  Now, what I want to walk
>>you through is a way of thinking about this, remembering that this
>>applies to everything, which is why I wanted to show you "the Music
>>Factory" to give you a sense of culture, everything.  I want to show you
>>Daryl Conner, who lives here in Atlanta.  He has a model of change I
>>think you'll find very helpful.  He talks about being frozen, thawing,
>>and refreezing.  Now, this is at the heart of how you make the
>>transition, and we'll come back later to his book "Managing at the Speed
>>of Change," which I recommend.  It's a very, very useful framework for
>>looking at this and having some sense of how you -- how resilient
>>managers succeed and prosper where others fail, and he talks about this.
>>
</pre>
Now, here's his concept.  Normally you're frozen.  You get up in the
morning, you have a habit.  The habit's fixed.  Then things begin to
change, and it's almost like watching -- you can think about this with a
popsicle.  It's almost like watching -- or with an ice cube.  It begins to
thaw, and you're changing and pieces fall apart, and it doesn't feel right.
It's what Drucker means by a discontinuity.  See, as long as you're
frozen, it's predictable.  Now it starts to change.  Then you begin to
figure out the future and you begin to refreeze, because people normally
have to have stable conditions of effectiveness.  People are very good if
most of what they're doing is stable.  They are very bad if they have to be
constantly inventing.  So there's a natural drive for, okay, so what works?
You know, if I'm not going to use gold and I'm now going to switch to
checkbooks, fine.  Teach me how to do a checkbooks.  If checkbooks are
beginning to disappear and I'm going to use a credit card, fine.  Teach me
how to do a credit card.  But I want to know the pattern that works.
<P>
Okay?  And one of the things that makes us a society of extraordinary
efficiency is that we shorten everything into habitual patterns very fast.
That's why it's very hard to have long terms in America, because we shorten
them all the time.  I mean, Al Gore has "Reinventing Government," which
within weeks became "Rego" in Washington language, because "reinventing
government's" too long a phrase.  Okay?  Now, what you don't know in a
discontinuity is, what are we going to refreeze like?  Are we going to be
lots of tiny triangles instead of a big triangle?  Are we now going to be a
brand new thing called a circle?  Are we going to be a square?  We don't
know.  By definition, if you're going through this, but if you know, "hey,
it's okay.  "Yes, the system's breaking down, but the other end of the
breakdown is a new system," it's psychologically incredibly easier to go
through change if your job in this phase is to find the new system.
<P>
Okay?  Everybody understand this concept of frozen, beginning to thaw out,
and then refreezing?  This is at the heart of thinking about how you manage
change.  And it allows you to now see the thawing without going, "oh, my
god, we're all going to collapse." No, we're going to find a new, more
powerful, more appropriate way to refreeze.  Now, in that framework, then,
what I'd like you to be thinking about is, what other aspects of life would
you add?  In other words, we talked earlier -- remember we talk about
economics, politics, family structure, religion, structure of society and
power, government, military power and warfare.
<P>
When you start going through this, you need to start saying, all right,
what are -- and you can do it much like Drucker's advice on how you take
care of your schedule, which is you keep it.  Just as you go through a day,
think, is there something we've missed in the class that is a major aspect
of life?
<P>
I mean, transportation, for example, or communications.  You communicate in
a hunting-gathering society face-to-face or maybe by certain signals, like
"the water hole is near here," which would be a series of sticks on the
ground or something.  Very few signals.  As you move into early
agriculture, how do we communicate?  What's the key to cultural artifacts
in early --
<P><pre>
>>writing.

>>no.  Pre writing.

>>oh, hieroglyphics?

>>no.  Hieroglyphics is just a form of writing.  How was the odyssey and
>>the Iliad first maintained?

>>oral tradition.

>>stories of.

>>it's oral.

>>that's right.

>>there's an era -- if you go back to archaic Greece, there were a handful
>>of people who literally memorized the entire story, which meant when you
>>went to school, what did you practice?

>>oratory.

>>Oratory, memory, right?  Can you remember 35,000 lines?  Now, frankly, in
>>the age of the computer, it would be fairly dumb to have a large number
>>of people -- it's a wonderful thing to do as a hobby, but if you had
>>somebody who walked in and say, "hi, I can recite the entire "Odyssey"
>>and "the Iliad," you'd say, "fine, but I'd rather buy the book." That
>>begins to change with writing.  And then in 1432, with the rise of the
>>movable type -- why do we have teachers stand up and lecture while
>>students take notes?  Because prior to 1432, writing was very expensive.
>>There were very few books.  A book took a year of a person's life to
>>copy.  It was copied by hand.  Only rich people had books, or important
>>institutions.  So every student came to class, and in a pattern which
>>went back at least as far as Greece and china, the teacher stood up here,
>>wrote on the board, you wrote it down, you were creating your own
>>textbook.  After Gutenberg invents movable type, textbooks become cheaper
>>and cheaper, but we keep this, in part, because we can't figure out how
>>to break out of the cultural framework of the professors.
</pre>
And while this makes sense as a way of teaching a class that assimilates
new information, it is -- this is one of the reasons I tape the class.
It's irrational to reteach this class.  I mean, it's silly for me to stand
up here and repeat exactly next time what I said this time.  So it depends
on what you're trying to accomplish and how you're trying to get it done,
and so you go through what the new communications are.  Right now, we send
faxes, but faxes are simply electronic transmissions of traditional
writing.  Faxes are an interchange, in a sense, between -- they're part of
the breaking down.  When you start to send e-mail, you're moving to the
next stage.  And so these things keep cycling.
<P>
What I'd like you to think about doing and the way I'd recommend you do it
is as you take each of these aspects, then you start applying it to each of
the three transitions.  How did family change in each wave?  How did work
change in each wave?  How are things different?  And it's very important to
understand, when you start talking about the Third Wave, that we are not in
the mature phase.  We are as developed in the Third Wave as the airplane
was in 1908.  That is, because people will start -- you'll run into really
smart people who say, "oh, well, we're over here.  "let me tell you, it's
going to be a square." They haven't got a clue.  Where we are is here.  The
old world is breaking down and the new world is vaguely emerging.
<P>
One of the most interesting books on this, by the way, is Huizinga's "the
Waning of the Middle Ages," which is a study of the psychology of
transition and how did the renaissance look if you were a medieval
Christian.  Because the renaissance was always written by secular
historians as a good thing.  It was a terrifying thing if you were a
medieval Christian, because it was the breaking down of the known world.
It's a brilliant book called "the waning of the middle ages" by Huizinga.
But my point is, what you can know is you're here.  You're not here.
You're no longer back here in the Second Wave, you're not frozen, but we
don't have a clue what a mature Third Wave civilization will look like.
What we know is things are dying, things are breaking down, and other
things are emerging, and we're in this middle zone.
<P>
Now, in that sense, what you've got to try to think through is, how should
you think, analyze, plan, and act in a period of decisive change?  Notice
they're separate.  First you have to think.  Then you analyze, then you
plan.  Only last do you act.  And it's -- and you've got to know where you
are in terms of the cycle of change to know what's an appropriate behavior.
In a sense, there's a -- the Third Wave offers dangers and opportunities.
It is like the Chinese character for "crisis," which is made up of two
characters, one for danger and the other for opportunity.  And we were
trying last night to find the character.  We didn't have it.  If we can
find it by next week, we'll show it to you retrospectively.  But literally,
the word in Chinese for "crisis" is actually made up of two words, danger
and opportunity.
<P>
And so it is literally fair to say, as you were, in a sense, implying, this
is a big problem.  I mean, if you're a big winner here, you are now at
risk.  So that one person's -- the rise of Microsoft is enormous
competition for IBM.  The rise of e-mail is an enormous competition for the
post office.  The rise of an expert system for home diagnostic is a big
threat for the family doctor.  And so you've got to look at, how do people
emerge and change and evolve and recognize that everything is both a danger
and an opportunity simultaneously?  But to grasp that, to grasp the dangers
and opportunities of the Third Wave information age, we have to understand
its characteristics, learn its principles, invent new habits, institutions,
and systems, and sometimes invent new words and new meanings.  Go ahead,
Mai.
<P><PRE>
>>is this going to be as solid as this?  Because when you stop and think
>>about the agriculture, it lasted much longer, and then the industrial age
>>lasted 300 years, and because it changed so rapidly, is it always going

>>truth is, we don't know.  I mean, this could last for a generation or it

>>I don't know.  My answer is I don't know.  No one does.  We've never been

>>but it's not possible to go back, though.

>>It is highly unlikely, because this system, this is part of the

>>Kalahari?  Why is it that the only people who survive in
>>hunting-gathering are in marginal ecosystems?  Because they all get
>>crowded out of the good spaces because they can't compete.  I mean, the
>>Bushman of the Kalahari can't compete with the roman legion, they can't
>>compete with the Zulu force.  And so they're literally squeezed out of
>>the good spaces into the last -- the desert Shoshoni can't compete, and
>>so they were pushed into the desert because the bigger agriculture
>>system.  What happened?  And this is what the Meiji restoration's about.
>>All of a sudden, the young leadership of Japan, when Perry arrives from
>>America in 1854, they look around they go, wow, what happens to every
>>Asian agricultural civilization?  It collapses in the face of Europeans.
>>And they suddenly say, we had better change fast, because if we don't
>>make the transition, we will be non-competitive.  We will be run over by
>>the Europeans.  And so the question is -- I mean, what happened in"desert
>>shield"?  In "desert shield" -- I mean "desert storm," you had a
>>second-wave Iraqi army dealing with an American army that is at least
>>beginning to move into the discontinuity.  It was a non-competitive
>>environment.  They were just two different worlds.

>>it gets right back down to survival, it's the survival instinct.

>>Yes.  That for the civilization to survive, I think it almost has to
>>shift and make that transition.  And what I want to walk you through when
>>we come back -- because we're going to start right here -- is I want to
>>start with the notion of, how do you under -- you know, what's the
>>difference between understanding characteristics and understanding
>>principles?  And how should you think about this scale of transition?
>>And we're going to stay for a little bit right on this model, because
>>this is the thing that I think people find the scariest.  Their first
>>reaction to a period of thawing is to cling to the old and to be
>>frightened.  Whereas the most effective reaction may be to be very
>>curious about the thawing.  To say, "gee, that's interesting," rather
>>than, "boy, does that terrify me," and to try to understand, what does it

</pre>
It goes back to, listen, learn, help, and lead.  You've got to go into a
phase where you can't start thinking about your vision of the future until
you listen for a long time and learn what the options are.  So it's a very,
very important model.  And what we're going to try to do then is say, okay,
how can I think about this scale of change on a planet-wide basis?  And
what does it affect -- what does it do about me?  I mean, if there are
billions of people on the planet and the whole planet's going to go through
this thawing process and the whole planet's going to go through this scale
of change, then what does that mean for me, for my business, for my family,
for my country, for my community?  And how can I begin to figure out
patterns that are helpful in going through a change on this scale?  I think
that's the key thing.  Okay?  So we'll take a break and come right back and
pick up right here.  (break)
<p><PRE>
>>That's increasingly true.  Let me say we're going to go back and pick up
>>where we were.  Before we do, I just wanted to say Colin Turnbull is the
>>author I was mentioning earlier who wrote "the Forest People" and "the
>>Mountain People." And "the Forest People," in particular, is both a
>>wonderfully romantic introduction to the pygmies of Zaire, but also has a
>>very poignant description at the very end of what happened to those who
>>had any kind of weakness in that kind of world.
</pre>
Let me go back.  Remember we talked about the notion that to grasp the
dangers and opportunities of the Third Wave information age, we must
understand its characteristics, learn its principles, invent new habits,
institutions, and systems, and sometimes invent new words and new meanings,
and I want to start with the very first of those, because each of them is
different.
<P>
So I'm going to start by talking about understanding its characteristics.
The best way to learn characteristics is the "listen" part of listen,
learn, help, and lead.  I mean, people say, "how can I learn this? " My
answer is, go around your hometown.  You don't have to go to M. I. T.  Or
Georgia tech.  I mean, who in your hometown is doing something interesting?
Go listen to them.  People love to talk about what they do well.  So just
start listening.
<P>
And what you'd ideally have around the country, and this is something
Benjamin Franklin helped create when he founded the American philosophical
society and the public library and all sorts of voluntary associations, and
you'd have people who got together, said, let's study this.  What does it
mean?  What is everybody in our community doing?  What's happening in our
industry?  What are the characteristics?  And you just start listing them.
<P>

You know, for example, laptops clearly are going to give people a greater
level of freedom.  Why?  Because they are dealing back with an embedded
base.  It's not that the society is freer.  It's that the individual's
freer because there's this huge embedded system of the telephones and of
the Internet and of various bulletin boards, so it's actually very
sophisticated, but the net result for you is you can be very freestanding.
How can you first pick this up?  I mean, I first picked it up watching
people in airplanes.  You all of a sudden find on virtually every airplane
you fly on, there are six or eight or 10 people now using a laptop.  Well,
you say to yourself, "oh, this is a characteristic." And so part of it's
just keep your eyes open.  Characteristics bubble up at you.  And if you
start making lists of them, you begin to say, "gee, I'll bet these are
characteristics of the thaw." That's why I mentioned blue jeans earlier.
Somebody mentioned during the break women also wear -- now wear -- more and
more women wear suits.  That's true, but it's -- again, go around the
planet and look at differences in levels and speed of adaptation.  It's
truer in America than it is in Europe.  It's truer in western societies
than it is in Asian.  And then look at the enormous stress in a place like
Iran and their view of women in the context of this emerging world and how
non-competitive it is to isolate slightly over half your population from
being productive.
<P>
So when you go to a truly fundamentalist Islamic society, they are
literally ruling out of the game over half their population in terms of
competitive skill, competitive ability.
<P>
And so you've got to look at this whole pattern.  As you begin to think
through the characteristics, and that's the scouting phase, just list them.
Don't even try to make sense of them.  When you start to get enough
characteristics, you want to learn the principles.  Why are these things
there?  One of the principles is electronic is going to replace paper.  And
you're just seeing it happen.  So if your choice was to hire somebody who
could use a manual typewriter or somebody who was used to software packages
and you were trying to get clerical work done, which one is more likely to
be responsive to where we're going?
<P>
You know, more and more things are freestanding with 800 numbers.  800
numbers are cheaper and cheaper, and if you combine that with fed ex and
ups and other overnight delivery systems, you can now set up a very small
business in your basement connected to the entire world by an 800 number
using, again, the embedded system.  I did an interview this week for fed ex
which will be seen by 100,000 workers worldwide.  So you have this huge,
complex, sophisticated system that lets your single little business be
successful, which might teach you to look around and say, "what are the big
systems that are available that I can use pretty cheaply? " I mean, your
investment's $11.  They've got to take your package from you, get it to
where you want it to go, do it on time, and they get to make money if they
can do it for $11.  So you have an $11 system which is a worldwide system,
and suddenly small businesses can be connected to the planet.
<P>
Now, consider that with the industrial-age vision of what a small business
was, which was a local mom and pop operation that only had a local
marketplace.  So you get into more and more of these kind of things.  Then
as you see the characteristics -- and I describe them as putting dots on
the wall.  You know, like, remember the dot, connect the dots, when you
were a little kid, and you'd go from 1 to 2 to 3 and it would turn out to
be a rhinoceros or something?  So you're putting dots up.  That's the
gathering of the characteristics.  Then you're trying to figure out, what
are the principles that tie the dots together?  Is this an animal or is
this a spaceship?  Because you're trying to guess ahead, you're trying to
get ahead of the dots.  Okay?  Then you say, okay, now that I'm beginning
to get the principles, what are the new habits, institutions, and systems
that matter?
<P>
I'll give you an example.  In the high watermark of the industrial age,
which included television, you could be a couch potato.  As longas you
could turn the TV on, you could lay there and the TV would amuse you.
Can't be a couch potato and interact on a computer bulletin board, because
you have to respond.  And, in fact, reading will go up in the Third Wave,
and so will typing, so will writing.  Because you won't be able to get out
of it.  So you could make -- and when I got laughed at the other week for
talking about laptops for poor kids, you could make an argument that
getting people interactive systems which can only be communicated with by
typing and can only be communicated with by reading would probably be the
most powerful way to get people to be literate.
<P>
Now, how much are you willing to spend for each literacy?  Well, if you're
talking about the total number of teachers you'll hire, the total number of
hours you'll spend on this child?  And you said, what if I could find a
freestanding device that that child could use that had the same effect;
would it be okay?  How do we get them to cross that bridge?  Because the
truth is in the information age, you have to be more literate, not less.
And all of the high end of industrial age, we're all going to cease to be
literate, we'll all sit around MCluhan's vision.
<P>
Now, that doesn't mean TV's going away.  If there's an earthquake in Kobe,
that's the fastest way to see the earthquake.  And, in fact, if you watch
stockbrokers now and money managers, they have a little screen up on the --
up on their computer, so they're typing away but they've got the TV on.
And they can switch.  Or they've got a screen where they're running the AP.
Stories, and as soon as a big one breaks, they can turn on the TV in their
own screen.  You've seen the commercials now where you have the TV and the
telephone and the fax and the e-mail and all of your records all on the
same computer screen.  And you're watching four windows simultaneously.
<P>
Which is why, by the way, if you go back and look at a Strauss Waltz and
then you look at the speed of MTV, you look at a movie made in the '30s and
the rhythm of the movie, and then you look at a movie made today.  People
are in the habit of looking on the surface at more things faster and
getting absorbed in fewer of them.  It's a very different pattern of
relationship.  As you start to invent the new habits, sometimes you're
going to have to invent new words and new meanings.  Microwave.  Cellular.
Internet.  Now, this is not new.  Horseless carriage.  Automobile, which is
French.  It means "self-moving." Electric guitar, which was, in fact, not a
guitar at all.  It's a totally -- it's an electronic instrument which
resembles a guitar.
<P>
But notice how very often we'll use bridging words.  So part of the bridge
will be back here to the frozen so we still feel secure.  But, in fact,
we're beginning to move through to a different world.  The lessons of
history include parallel evolutions of the same kind of changes in other
transitional waves.  In other words, you can go back and say, all right, a
very good way to experience what you're living through is to go to somebody
who's going from agriculture to industry or from hunting-gathering to
agriculture.  James Michener's book "the Source" is a great novel for doing
this, because it takes you through a spot in Israel for 4,000 years and it
gives you a feeling for -- and starts with hunting-gathering, and it gives
you a really good feeling.  It's a pretty good novel.  Look at the early to
Old Testament as a fascinating record of the transition from a
hunting-gathering nomadic society to an established agriculturally based
society.  Isn't that exactly what's happening?  What is the meaning of the
story of Abraham and his son laying on the rock, and the angel comes down?
<P><PRE>

>>sacrifice.

>>Yeah.  It is the end of human sacrifice.  This was a people describing to
>>themselves the moment at which they decided they would no longer
>>sacrifice their children, something which the Aztecs never got to,
>>although they didn't sacrifice their children.  They sacrificed
>>prisoners.  But notice this moment in the old testament, and you literally
>>see the nomadic agrarian Israelis becoming city people and becoming
>>farmers.  And much of the fight in the old testament is between the
>>Israelis and the more urban and more commercial Mediterranean gods.
>>That's what the whole fight with Bayle is all about.  It's a style of
>>life.  And so they go and they take Jerusalem, which becomes their city.
>>And if you read the Old Testament in that sense as a historic document,
>>it is a fascinating study of the transition of a people from nomadic into
>>agricultural to having an urban high civilization with a temple and a
>>kingship.
</pre>
And that's why -- and you see literally the transition to kingship, don't
you?  Saul's the first king.  And so you see these patternings, and it's
well worth looking at in that sense literally as a study of the transition
into an agricultural society.  What you've got to look at is, what are the
characteristics of the Third Wave information age?  And you've got -- and
literally, we need for people to be in a habit of looking around and
talking about this and saying, okay, what did I learn this week?  Because I
find in my case, every week that goes by, I'm learning new things, I'm
seeing new experiences, I'm having new data come forth that I had never
thought about.  And you do it by looking at the newspapers, by listening to
television, by talking to people.  And literally just sort of gathering.
And not trying initially.
<P>
Don't try to force them into a pattern.  Don't say, "oh, wow, now I see how
we go back." Or equally bad, "boy, I see how it" -- you know, "my model's
the circle.  "now let me take all this new data and make it fit the
circle." What you want to do is literally just let it be data.  Let it tell
you.  Don't you tell it.  Then you want to try to build the principles.
What are the principles going to be?  One is that it's going to be global.
Another is it's going to be very personal simultaneously, so both you and
the planet simultaneously.  Now, how does that work?  Well, we don't know
yet.  Then you've got to look at, what are some of the new habits?  One of
the habits had better be learning.  I mean, learning -- another habit, by
the way, is exercise.  And there's a very profound reason why exercise is
suddenly emerging.  Why do people think about exercise?  In an agricultural
age, what did you have to do?
<P><pre>
>>work.

>>work.  In an industrial age, what did you have to do?

>>work.

>>I mean, I had an uncle who was a steelworker.  He thought the idea of
>>going to a gym was insanity.  He wanted to go to a bar.  I mean, he'd put
>>in eight hours in the gym.  It was called the steel mill.

>>some things are never going to change.

>>Ah, but now you go to the gym first.  Why do you go to gym first?
>>Because you don't do hunting-gathering.  You don't pull a plow, and you
>>don't work in a steel mill, so literally as a biological organism, again,
>>at the risk of getting in trouble, you have a genetic need to exercise.
>>You don't stay healthy if you don't exercise, so suddenly in a Third Wave
>>society, you have a whole new habit, which will then lead to new
>>institutions.  Which may well lead to whole new ways of thinking about
>>the tax code.  I mean, you know, what if we encouraged you to stay in
>>good enough shape that you didn't get a heart attack?
</pre><P>
Which is cheaper, to keep you in good shape or to give you a triple bypass?
Just think about it.  See, we don't even think that way over here.  That's
a stupid idea.  Well, why?  I mean, let's do a mathematical study.  Why is
it a dumb idea?  Why isn't wellness a learnable, trainable, habitual,
incentivized system?  Because it can be if you work at it.  And the
companies that are doing it, by the way, have dramatic drops in costs.  Why
do they have a gym?  Not because they're being nice and coddling people.
Because it lowers the cost of their health insurance.  Now, it takes three
years, but in three years' time, they are making money by getting everybody
to be well.  Well, what if you did that as a society?
<P>
Now, as you look at the new habits and the new institutions -- and I would
argue that gold's gym, in that sense, is an emerging Third Wave
institution, and that you find others.  I mean, I think Fed Ex is, frankly,
a Third Wave institution.  And the great power of Fed Ex and UPS is not the
airplane or the truck.  It's the computer that tracks the package.  It is
the human training.  I once spent a day in a ups uniform in a truck, and I
followed the package from picking it up to , sorting it and bringing it
back, and it was amazing.  And a ups or fed ex delivery person, man or
woman, is a full-service, holistic small business standing right there.  I
mean, they deal with the customers, they take the material, they take the
money, they do the recording.  It is an astonishing system, and is, I
think, very much a Third Wave.
<P>
And so you've got to look at some of the new systems of the Third Wave.
And we've got to look at the -- and you've got to start -- and you can
start looking around you and saying, what's going to work?  Telemedicine,
distance learning are emerging systems.  The kind of ambulance or
helicopter where you have -- all the diagnostics are in the vehicle.  And
you're literally doing the diagnostics with the best brain surgeon in the
world as you're going from the accident to the hospital.  And so when you
arrive at the hospital, you've done everything we used to do in the ER.
You go straight to the operating room, because we've already done
everything.  You've done it with a technician who is not a doctor, but who
is working electronically under the doctor's direction.  Now, that's the
Third Wave.  And it's going to happen all over the place.  And you've got
to look at new words and meanings of the Third Wave information age.  I
mean, as I said earlier, microwave.  Fax.  Which, by the way, again, in the
American tradition, was facsimile.  It became fax.  I don't know what
cellular phone's going to become.  Is there a word yet that -- "cellular's"
too long.
<P><pre>
>>personal communicator.

>>well, personal communication system, which was, by the way, PCs.

>>read-only memory, CD-ROM.

>>what about the French, who are trying to freeze their culture by making
>>non-French words crimes?

>>they'll lose.  They'll just lose.

>>they're going to have trouble communicating.

>>sure, and they'll just lose.  I mean, you can't in the long run keep an
>>entire supercivilization out of your society, so, you know, they can go
>>through a very elaborate -- and the German, I think, for telephone was
>>"far speaker." Huh?

>>is that what you are, the far speaker?

>>Yeah, I guess I'm the far speaker.  It had different speaker.  I'm the
>>far speaker from the far side.  Right.  That's a different meaning --
>>that's a different meaning.  (laughter) that's a different meaning than
>>the German.  But the point is to create, you know, to create that kind of
>>a -- and by the way, that is part of what the problem is.  In terms of --
>>and I said it as a joke because it was too good not to say.  The truth
>>is, because we're used to politicians who are here, what I'm trying to
>>do, which is understand and discuss this, does mean that by the standard
>>of this, I am outside.  And so that -- in that sense, I mean, your
>>comment was, in a different way, true.
</pre><P>
Now -- and you've got to look for dangers and opportunities that you can
see as the Third Wave evolves.  I mean, there is a real danger we'll leave
the poor behind.  There's a real danger that 45- or 50-year-olds who
invested their whole life in their company are now going to find themselves
temporarily obsolesced.  Now the question is, can you rethink the system so
it's temporary rather than permanent?  Because I would argue you need to --
we need to focus as much on lifetime learning for 50-year-olds as we do on
lifetime learning for 5-year-olds.  Because if you grew up and were trained
here and had a sense of stability, you feel really cheated here.
<P>
And so we really have to come to grips with, how are we going to make
lifetime learning real?  How do we help people start their own businesses?
How do we help people make a new career?  You can't --if you're going to
live to be 90 or 100, you can't say to somebody, "you're obsolete at 50."
You cannot have a society which says to an entire generation of people,
"sorry that you were born a little bit too early.  "you don't quite get it.
"good luck." And instead what you've got to do is think, how are we going
to reintegrate and reabsorb all the energy and talent, remembering people
are going to live a lot longer?  And that's going to have all sorts of
implications on pension plans and retirement, and what does it mean and how
much do you have to -- to save all your working life to live for five years
after retirement is one thing.  To save all your working life to live 40
years after retirement is a different thing, and probably unsustainable.
Probably means that, like Drucker -- I mean, like Drucker and Deming, that
there's some level of activity involved for most of your lifetime, because
it's inconceivable that you can get people to save.  I mean, the level of
savings you'd have to engage in in order to be able to retire for 40 years
is going to be a very small number of people.
<P>
And so as all these changes occur, we've got to be open and available to
rethinking them.  It also means that the same event can occur, and one
person can see an opportunity while another sees danger at the exact same
moment.  So the software writer at Microsoft thought it was wonderful, and
the centralized hardware computer at IBM thought it was terrible, and the
same event's occurring and you're getting two very different descriptions
at the same moment.
<P>
The rise of integration was wonderful if you were black, and if you were a
white segregationist, it was terrifying.  The sudden level of change -- I
mean, here you had -- and it's something Drucker wrote about 30 years ago.
You had blacks who were finally entering the industrial era and finally
getting a good job in Detroit the week the factory closed.  And was being
replaced by white upper middle class software writers.  And all the terms
of engagement changed just as people began to succeed.  So you've got to be
very sensitive to the fact and you've got to listen carefully, because you
can both be describing the same event, but your viewpoints are so
different.  That you've got to know -- you've got to walk -- I describe it
as walking all the way around the tree.  You've got to be willing to stop
and walk all the way around the tree and see the event from their
viewpoint.
<P>
Daryl Conner's term for it is "appreciative understanding." You don't have
to agree, but you have to appreciate why they would feel that way and why
you might feel that way if you were in their shoes.  That doesn't mean
they're right, but it means it's real.  For them, this is true.  And you've
got to work at that if you want to hold your society together.  And you've
got to study the earlier transitions.
<P>
We can learn lessons from Britain between 1720 and 1850.  We can learn
lessons from America 1750 to 1915.  From Japan, 1854 to 1930.  Germany,
1830 to 1914.  Russia, 1850 to 1917.  All those were transition periods for
those societies as they left the agricultural era and they went into the
industrial era.  Now, what did they do?  How did they respond?  What were
the tensions in their periods?  How did people respond in family structure,
in politics, in entrepreneurship?  And I think that there are also lessons
to be learned about how countries, companies, and individuals change.
Daryl Conner's work which I mentioned to you earlier, "Managing at the
Speed of Change." What Daryl attempts to do here based on about 25 years of
consulting is to show you the consistent patterns by which human beings
tend to respond as human beings.  How do people respond to the process of
change, and how do they go through it?
<P>
Another book I've seen recently that's helpful, and that is Morris
Schechtman's "Working Without a Net" in which Schechtman walks you through
the scale of change we're living through.  Dr.  Barbara Lawton, who you met
last week who helped us do the red bead experiment, wrote a note about this
week's lesson.  She had a bunch of specific ideas we'll share with you in
detail, but for example, she says, "coming into the transition, it seems
like all the structures, institutions, relationships, the pillars of our
everyday existence are threatened.  Pensions, lifelong employment, jobs and
manufacturing, traditional teaching-learning relationships, things in life
must be broken apart before it can be rearranged into more effective ways
of living." In other words, you'll see the thawing at a rate faster than
you'll see the refreezing.
<P>
So early on, the insecurity will increase and the threat of tension to old
institutions will increase.  From numerous early experiments, successful
patterns will emerge.  This is a very important part of this.  One of the
reasons you want to decentralize is so you have lots of parallel
experiments, and then it's not like you can predict the winners, but you
notice the winners as they occur, and you orient to the winners as they
occur.  Nobody in 1950 could have predicted McDonald's, but it's easy to
find McDonald's at a later point.  And you suddenly say, "wow, this must be
working," because you see more and more of them.  As you saw more golden
arches, it became pretty obvious.  "now," she says, "what it demands from
all of us personally, it breaks our expectations about our future.  We live
within a framework of implied contracts," like if I do a good job and I'm
loyal, my company is going to keep me forever.  But what if your company
can't?  What if the whole world changes?  What if the market replaces your
product?  "the change seems unfair." I've done my job.  How come it's
changing?  But the objective fact, it's that big a world.  There are that
many things going on.  She said, "we need the understanding to recognize
that what we're experiencing is not someone else trying to cheat or deprive
us, but is the result of our own collective actions."
<P>
That is, that the Third Wave is so huge, that it's not about somebody else
conspiring to take away your stability.  It's about the world changing and
us going with the changes.  Sort of like being in the middle of an
earthquake and saying, boy, I'll bet, you know, the rich did this to us or
the unions did this to us, or, you know -- no, it was an earthquake.  I
mean, the planet did it to us.  And in a sense, the Third Wave is that big
a change.  It's a planetary change.  She said, "we need the personal
strength to put our energy into creating the new experiments and developing
pathways into the future, rather than into denying the change and finding
ways to patch a system whose time has past.  We all need the understanding
of profound knowledge," which is Deming's term, "to develop new methods of
working, processes, and systems for the Third Wave world.  We must be
active learners looking for the new patterns underlying the themes."
<P>
And so I think this concept, one of the habits of the future will be that
we have to all be active learners, that we have to take responsibility.
And in the process of that learning, what I'm suggesting is that how we
apply the five pillars of American Civilization help us think through the
process of change from a second to Third Wave civilization.  Remembering
that the five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the historic
lessons of American Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third,
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And, fifth, quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And what I'm
suggesting is that we literally go back through and that you get a habit in
your head when you bounce into a new situation, a new problem, a new
opportunity, of trying to apply all.  Start with applying the historic
lessons of American Civilization to the emerging Third Wave information
age.
<P>
And here, what I would suggest is that you go back and you say, all right,
how did we change the last time?  Fulton's invention of the steamboat.  The
rise of the railroad.  What was it like to go from the stagecoach through
the pony express to the railroad?  How did people adjust to those changes?
What about towns that died because they weren't on the railroad?  Towns
that exploded, like Atlanta, because they were on the railroad.  The
importance of the rail heads in Chicago and buffalo.  And you suddenly have
a whole different pattern, okay?  Second, personal strength in a Third Wave
information age.  It seems to me pretty clear that if you're going to make
it through the freezing, I mean, the rethawing and the refreezing, it takes
a lot of personal strength.  And those people who have the personal
strength to be active learners, those people who are able to go out and
actively do the right kind of things, are going to face dramatically
greater opportunities than people who get up in the morning and passively
wait for somebody else to invent the future.
<P>
Daryl Conner, along that line, has a model of change which I found very
helpful in which he says that resilience is the key factor.  And what he
means by "resilience" is -- and his whole point is this kind of change is
never easy, so if you get in a habit of when you make a mistake, you get
back up.
<P>
Think about learning how to ski.  If you have the resilience to get back up
after you fall down and get back up after you fall down and you have the
sheer energy and the optimism and the drive to say, "okay, so I've fallen
down nine times; I think I'll try a 10th time," you are much more likely to
learn how to ski than if the third time you fall, you say, "that's it; I
can't do it," and then you leave for two days or a week or a year and come
back.
<P>
Well, the same thing's true of all kinds of active learning and all kinds
of inventing of the future.  Leading an organization.  What we're doing in
the house today.  I mean, all these things, the more resilience you have,
the greater your capacity to get things done.  Which leads you, of course,
to entrepreneurial free enterprise and the process of entering the
information age.  That the more rapidly you can invent and develop the
future, the better off you are.  Did you want to --
<P><PRE>
>>what is the fundamental -- what is the best way to explain what the
>>fundamental product in the information age is going to be?  I hate to --

>>the fundamental product's going to be what people buy.

>>we're still going to need material production, we're still going to need
>>aircraft --

>>huge quantities, yeah, you'll have huge quantities of it.

>>are those things going to be produced more easily and with less human
>>resource so what the fundamental product will be --

>>what's the largest industry in central Florida?

>>entertainment.

>>huh?

>>entertainment.

>>tourism.

>>tourism.

>>the service is not good.

>>It may well be services, it may be the layer beyond services.  It may be
>>developing virtual reality games.  May be being a gamemaster.  I can
>>teach you how to play virtual reality faster than anybody else.  For
>>$5,000, you know, I'll be the equivalent of a ski instructor.  You know,
>>come to me, because the game's get to be so sophisticated.  It may well
>>be entertainment.  I mean, look at Nashville.  Look at Atlanta, which has
>>become a fairly big music center.  Look at the amount of money for
>>"Jurassic park." It may be producing items of self-identity.  You know,
>>you wear a certain kind of t-shirt.  Why?  Because you want to belong to
>>the group that wears those t-shirts.  I mean, the truth is we don't
>>really know what's the other side of this, and that's part of why
>>entrepreneurship and the idea of a free market where the market defines
>>where you're going.  I mean, who could have guessed that coca-cola would
>>be the most widely known single symbol of the industrial age?  But it is.
>>I mean, more people across the planet recognize coca-cola than any other
>>trademark.  You could never have predicted that in 1870.

>>when you look -- it's kind of interesting that when you look at these
>>various ages and changes, all of the things in hunter-gathering and
>>agriculture and industry have to be accomplished.  These things don't go
>>away.  They're just more easily accomplished kind of thing.

>>Oh, but if you had said -- but if you had said at the beginning of the
>>industrial era that only 3% or less of the country will grow food, the
>>answer would have been, gosh, we'll have 95% unemployment.  And if you
>>had said at the beginning of the industrial era -- at the high point of
>>the industrial era that we'll be down to 17% of the population
>>manufacturing goods, matter of fact, I can show you all the static models
>>where people said -- where by looking backwards people said, my God,
>>we'll all be unemployed.  It's turning out, by the way, the information
>>age doesn't mean what John Kenneth Galbraith said in "the Affluent
>>Society," more leisure time, people who are bored.  Turns out you work
>>longer hours.  You are more absorbed by your work.  But you tend to find
>>a job you like.  So you tend to self-select, so you end up -- you know,
>>you say, what's your hobby?  For a lot of people, their hobby is their
>>work.  They like what they're doing.  It's the game they want to play.
>>And they'll play it for absurd lengths of time.  You almost have to wean
>>them from it.  You know, quit doing it.  Go away for a week.  It's not
>>necessarily because they're gaining -- you know, in the industrial era,
>>people did that to score high.  They wanted to make more money.  A lot of
>>people do it now because they love it.  But I want to do my business.
>>You know, this is who I -- they identify themselves with what they do.

>>the whole big brother theory has become obsolete, as well, if this -- in
>>the information age because it's not so much --

>>you mean the state telling you, big brother in the sense of the state
>>telling you what to do?

>>well, not so much that.  Big brother being able to track what you do.  It
>>seems like now it's more little brother.  We can access what you guys are
>>doing now.  You see what I'm saying?

>>it may be.  I mean, it may be that everybody can track everybody, in
>>which case you'll be tremendously bored.  Because it turns out most
>>people don't do all that much stuff you want to know.  But, but, it also
>>means that the government can track every credit card, every phone call.
>>

>>that's what I was saying about George Orwell.

>>You then have to discipline yourself with things like the privacy act and
>>say, yes, we could, but it will be illegal.  We will not do it.  And it
>>also turns out, by the way, that in the scale of an information society,
>>you have so many ways of communicating that a government capable of
>>tracking everything you do would itself be so confused by its information
>>that we don't know how to organize it.  So that, in a sense, Gorbachev
>>found that he had less information over time, not more.
</pre>
Look also at the notion, which is fairly self-evident, of the spirit of
invention and discovery in creating a Third Wave.  I mean, obviously, Bill
Gates is a good example, but so is Spielberg and George Lucas.  So are the
people who are developing the biotechnology of the 21st century.  So are --
so is the development of the DNA and the double helix and Watson and
crick's work on inventing modern biology.  You know, and so you've got a
tremendous spirit of what's coming next.  That is particularly important as
you enter this kind of an era.  I mean, in a stable high civilization, in
the roman world, there was remarkably little invention and discovery by our
standards.  In our era, we are exploding the rate of research and the
number of things we're learning.
<P>
It also means -- and I think that Deming, in this sense, is a very
transitional figure -- that Quality and Profound Knowledge are key parts of
the transportation from an industrial era to an information age.  That, in
fact, what Deming was doing was creating the first systems insight into the
most powerful patterns of the information age.  The kind of teams that
Deming is describing, the kind of human interaction, the notion of
continuous improvement, is a very big part of where we're going.  In this
framework, what you need to ask yourself -- it goes through a series of
questions.
<P>
First of all, individuals.  You and your life.  And you can literally sort
of put a page in your notebook and start just making notes.  How will this
affect you?  How will your life be different?  Second is, how does it
affect families?  What's the structure of families?  In a sense, we may be
rebonding extended families, because the telephone and the fax and the
e-mail allow a level of communications that rebonds us, and as the cost of
transportation drops, we fly to see each other more often, or we drive on
the interstate.  So that, in a sense, we may be rebuilding an extended
family in a different way.  We're also inventing electronic families and
electronic neighborhoods.
<P>
Most of you are not as close to the person who lives next door to you as
you are to somebody on your telephone list.  You live in an electronic
neighborhood.  If I asked you to tell me the 20 people you talk to most
often, it will not include the person next door.  That's true for almost
everybody.  And you can try that out as an experiment.  I mean, start down
the list of who do you -- you know, just keep track of who do you talk to
in a week, and see how far down you have to get before you get to one of
your physical neighbors.  And you'll be very surprised.
<P>
But we live -- but it's not that we don't have a neighborhood, it's that
our neighborhood's now electronic, which gets us to the whole notion of
volunteerism in the Third Wave.  We may have all sorts of new ways of
coaching and helping and working with each other.  You know, and it may
well be that a lot more of it's by telephone.  I mean, I don't know of how
many places have tutoring by telephone.  But it could be done very easily.
I mean, you know, kids who talk on the telephone all the time could be
tutored on the telephone.  You could actually -- you could have senior
citizens in Florida who when they get bored are tutoring kids in Detroit,
and the cost is trivial compared to that kid not learning math.  They might
only meet once a year.  But it's the whole notion of weaving together new
patterns.  Which also leads then to business and job creation in the Third
Wave.
<P>
Had a woman come by last night who has invented an entire environmental
recycling company out of boredom.  She was tired -- she put -- her children
were growing, she was tired of shopping, she believed in the environment,
so she began -- she went out on her own, using the local library, found a
particular recycling possibility, created a product, sold it to Disney and
coke, and is now off and running and creating t-shirts out of coke bottles.
Now, the two liter coke bottle has a plastic that can be reprocessed into
fiber.  The fiber can be used exactly like cotton, and she now has an
entire company that she built out of her one room in her house.
<P>
And that's that process of creating new jobs.  Which, by the way, then
means you can start talking about local government.  I mean, government is
a lagging indicator of the Third Wave, because bureaucracies don't face the
same pressures, and they have no incentives for change.  You could
revolutionize virtually every small -- every local government, every school
board, every county government, every city government in this country could
be revolutionized, and then you have state governments where we're
beginning to get some impact.  But state governments are a tremendously
long way from being as efficient as American Express or as customer
oriented as McDonald's, or as able to deliver per dollar as Federal
Express, so think about state government in the Third Wave information age
and what could it be like if you made the transition?  Because you'll find
governments rival the academic world and some parts of medicine as among
the most trapped in a frozen environment and the most resistant to thawing.

<P>
And what you're looking for is, how do you get through this process of
thawing and get people to start breaking down?  And then, of course, the
area where I'm most directly involved is, what is a Third Wave information
age federal government like?  You know, and what would you do to -- and
that's where, frankly, Vice-President Gore is reinventing government.  He's
asking the right questions.  Whether you agree or disagree with the
details, he is beginning to put us in the right direction of saying, look,
we've got to rethink this whole thing from the ground up.
<P>
But it's beyond the United States.  There are implications of the emerging
Third Wave information age for the world system and for national security.
That's part of why I mentioned Toffler, Alvin and Heidi's book, "War and
Anti-War," because you've got to think about, you know, what would have
happened if Saddam Hussein had hired 10 hackers at the beginning of "Desert
Shield" and had decided to electronically try to break down American
systems?  Not killing people, not setting off bombs, but, for example,
issuing 500,000 new American express cards.  Or simply charging absurd
fees.  Breaking down telephone systems.  Sending signals to turn off
Georgia power company's electric plants.  I mean, how much damage could you
do on the information side?
<P>
And what does it mean that you now live in a worldwide system where when
something happens somewhere, CNN is there live, and if CNN is not there
live, that there's now such a ubiquitous flow of video cameras that
somebody will be there.  I mean, how does that change things?  You know,
what's a -- I tell military classes that I teach, you're going to be in a
firefight, where it's going to be live on CNN, your cellular phone's going
to go off.  You're going to say, "mom, it's not as bad as it looks on TV.
"I'm very busy.  "I can't talk now.  "can I call you when the fight's over?
" Now, it sounds funny.  It's not a joke.  I mean, you're going to have
people who go into the field carrying cellular phones.  And since you have
more and more married people and more and more husbands and wives in the
military and they're sometimes drawing straws -- I mean, which one stays
home with the kids?  They both leave.  You know, the kids are with grandma.
Now they're both worried about the kids.  They're about to go out on
patrol.  They call in, you know, "oh, Timmy has a fever." I mean, in the
old days, there was a certain virtue of a wall between your civilian life
and the war, because you could focus on the war.  Now you're going to have
real-time flow of information all day every day.  You get in a fight with
your boyfriend or girlfriend just before you go on patrol.  What are you
thinking about?
<P><Pre>
>>because if the Third Wave does go broke, wouldn't that almost in some
>>respects render warfare obsolete?  I mean --

>>no.

>>what would be the -- what would be the advantage of going to war with a
>>trade partner or, you know, I mean --

>Ssame as it was in 1914.  Germany's biggest trading partner was France.
>And the fact is -- and this is what makes me a conservative.  The fact is,
>power in the end come from power, and somebody who has a gun at your head
>or a knife at your throat has an enormous advantage in winning the
>argument, and you have to have -- and you have to have a society capable
>of stopping that.

>>but isn't that a little humanistic?  I mean, that --

>>no, and I think it's a fact.  I mean, it is a -- just like you were
>>talking about earlier, don't you have to go through these changes?

>>yes.

>>It is a fact that if one society is prepared to annihilate the other, it
>>has an enormous advantage, and that what you've got to worry about is
>>that somebody out there who's really bad is going to get into the Third
>>Wave before you do.  I mean, Nazi Germany had an atomic bomb in '41,
>>okay?  The Soviet Union that made the information breakthrough before we
>>did.  I mean, and the theory here is simple, there is evil.  And evil has
>>to be dealt with, okay?  Now, what you've got to look at is as you think
>>about from you personally up through family, business, government, to the
>>world, how can we learn more about the changes we're living through and
>>the changes to come?  Okay.
</pre>
And before we start talking about that, I'm proud of the team.  Here is --
I assume I'm holding it up right, okay?  Here is the symbol for "crisis,"
which is made up on "danger" and "opportunities." It's Chinese.  This is
the symbol.
<P><PRE>
>>I know, but which is danger and which is opportunity?

>>Beats me.  There are limits to what I can -- and I won't fake it, because
>>somebody will call in next week and say, "boy, did you get that wrong."
>>But the point is that I think that it's very important to have this sense
>>of balance.  I mean, you know, people who are self-described futurists,
>>innovators.  I mean, when I was younger, a lot of people said, "oh, this
>>is all going to be wonderful." Maybe.  There are dangers and
>>opportunities.  Some of it will be good.  Some of it will be
>>heart-breaking.  Some of it will extend life.  Some of it will destroy
>>life.  Air conditioning, on balance, has made life easier in the south.
>>It's also increased pollution.  There is a cost to air conditioning.
</pre><P>
And so you've got to go through cycle after cycle.  Vaccinations against
various diseases have been wonderful for the human race.  They've also led
to an extraordinary population explosion, which has not been as wonderful
for other species, and so you've got to go through these kind of thinking
about what works, what doesn't work.  And I think you've got to always have
a sort of balanced sense that there's nothing that comes as a totally free
gift.  But there's also very few things that come totally bad.  And so
you're constantly trying to balance the dangers and the opportunities.
<P>
Now, what I want you to do -- if you think about going back to the core
structure of thought that we talked about, you'd like to think through what
are your vision, strategies, and projects for the transition.  How are we
going to go through the thawing and the refreezing?  What's our vision of
making the transition?  What are our strategies for making the transition?
What specific doable projects are out there that you could go and do that
would help you make the transition?  And then finally, what should you do
every day?  And, of course, as you're doing that, it's important to keep
reminding people that the basic model for leadership is listen, learn,
help, and lead.  I mean, what's the best way to learn about the emerging
Third Wave?  Listen.  And just constantly be probing.  How do you find the
characteristics?  Let people tell you about them.  And as you do that,
you'll begin to learn things that begin to piece things together, and then
you'll be able to say, gee, I wonder if that's a principle.  I wonder if
that really does give me -- remember, the value of a principle is that it
allows you to predict.
<P>
Remember, Deming says every management action has to start with a theory,
okay?  I've noticed every time that when we put the water on the fire, the
water eventually boils.  That could lead to a principle.  Water when heated
will boil.  Now, that sounds obvious because you've learned it, but it's
not obvious.  So you come over here and you start saying, all right, what
are the characteristics I am discovering by learning, by listening and
learning, and what do they start telling me about the principles that might
emerge?
<P>
And by the way, it's possible to be all three.  That is, you could end up
in a Third Wave civilization which is a global civilization and which is so
complex that you have multiple patterns interacting simultaneously.  Now,
you do some of that already, don't you?  You can walk, you can roller
skate, you can ride a bicycle, you can drive a car, you can ride in a bus,
you can get in an airplane.  And you're able to integrate all those into
your personality.  Yet they're very different, aren't they?  But you don't
even think about it, because you're used to it.  See, the great power of
being frozen is you get used to it.  And so as we start emerging over here,
we may have an extraordinarily complex system, but it may reflect itself in
very simple habits.  Again, go back to ups and fed ex.  Ups and fed ex are
unbelievable.  I mean, you try to design the complexity by which they
actually get it to work overnight on a worldwide basis, and it's immense.
On the other hand, what's your experience of it?  You pick up the phone.
They show up.  You give them the package and money.  They leave.  So for
you, it's a very simple experience.  Yet hidden behind that simple
experience is a very powerful, complex system.  Okay?  Questions, comments.

<P><pre>
>>okay, I can see that model some -- you know, in some way, but to me, it
>>seems like it's like the egg theory.  You've got the egg over here and
>>you want it cooked.  And so over here you've got to get a pan and a water
>>and everything, and so this is -- to me, this is the thawing portion,
>>where you bring all the elements together to make it --

>>right.

>>and then you come up with a product which would be this intangible.

>>but that implies you already know this game.

>>no.

>>see, you know you want a cooked egg.

>>but you don't know if the egg's going to come out cooked like you want
>>it.  I mean, you're just --

>>No, but you already have a theory of a cook.  No, I'm suggesting to you
>>that the truth is, this is so big, that we only have glimmerings, to use
>>Fred Franks, who was the commander of the seventh corps in "Desert
>>Storm," we only have glimmerings of the future.  I mean, through the fog,
>>we sort of see a little of this and a little of that, and we think it's
>>going to be this way.  But I'd carry you back a stage further.
</pre>
How do we know it's an egg?  How do we know it's food?  I mean, what if, in
fact, it's a Faberge Egg and we now put it in a pot and we start cooking
it, thereby ruining a very valuable art object.  And that -- and I'm not
trying to disagree with you, except to say, this is -- I mean, I have
certainties about the fact that we are thawing, and I have certainties
about the fact that this is going to be global and it's going to be
information.  And I have concluded -- one of my conclusions after 20 years
of thinking about it is that American Civilization will turn out to be the
highest way of organizing humans to liberate the maximum amount of energy
so you have the maximum creativity, so I'm now sort of convinced that at
that level, I know where we're going.  I can't tell you many of the
details.  I can't tell you that we'll get to a -- not just a hard or soft
boiled egg.  I can't tell you what it will be like.  I'm still in the
observation phase of, gee, the water is boiling, isn't it?  That is the
fifth time we've learned that, and just seeing how it plays out.
<P><pre>
>>but I think it's just as frustrating for the people that's here to keep
>>being in a society that's so frozen, because I have --

>>sure.  Of course it is.

>>for example, I have a daughter, or my three children are Montessori
>>trained, and it's a very -- it's more of a dialogue learning-type
>>situation, and when they go to age -- I mean, grade 6, and all of a
>>sudden they're forced back into this.

>>sure.

>>and all of a sudden this system over here's telling them, I'm the
>>teacher, you're the child, don't interrupt my class.

>>right.  Of course you're right.

>>I think they're more frustrated here than they are there.

>>And in a sense, this is one of the interesting things we're going through
>>right now.  This is the first grade crisis.  The first grade crisis is
>>not here.  The first grade crisis is, for example, the power of obsolete
>>education systems to coerce taxpayer money to continue to fail.  I mean,
>>it is astonishing the amount of money we spend on systems that are
>>totally failing.  The dc.  Schools spend $9,600 per child.

>>what's the national average?

>>much lower than that.  About 4400, 4500.  For $9600 per child, you can go
>>to an elite private school.

>>is that per year?

>>Per year, per year.  A class of 20 is $192,000 in the room.  I mean, one
>>of the studies I want to get done is to say, if we just said to a
>>teacher, "here is $192,000.  "rent a room, buy the books, and feed them
>>lunch.  "you get to keep the rest." Teacher's pay would change radically
>>overnight.  I mean, just think about that.  Literally it's -- I mean, I
>>had these numbers checked, because I knew it was going to be amazing.
>>$9600.  And that's not the highest.  The highest may well be in Newark,
>>which is, I think, like, 10,500.  I mean -- and you're not getting --
>>you're getting about $1200 worth of learning, and yet we have been
>>convinced by this system that the only answer is, why aren't you spending
>>more?  I mean, what you need to do is dissolve it.
</pre>
Lawyers are the same way, as you're going to see next week.  I mean, we
accept levels of litigation that are insane.  Why do we do it?  Because it
-- because at the high water mark of the industrial era, it's what the
lawyers could get through, because guess who dominated the legislatures?
Okay, so you go through a whole series of these things.  Now, I mean, on
the other hand, you're going to threaten people.  There's no question in my
mind that the idea of self-diagnosis will be bitterly resented and will
absolutely happen.  Just as self-learning will happen.
<P>
I mean, you're seeing it with home learning.  I mean, nobody's yet figured
out home schooling is part of the Third Wave.  I mean, if you can get the
best computer software, the best textbooks, the best videotape, and your
parents are willing to invest in your learning -- and it turns out, what
was the number, 15 out of the 17 top scorers on the sat.  Were home
schooled?  Some number like that I saw the other day that I -- don't -- the
media that normally takes this off, they should check it before they take
it out of my class, but there is some number that's amazing about the
number of home schoolers who are now doing, very, very well.  Well, why is
that?  Part of it's because it's the emerging Third Wave environment.
<P>
I mean, the embedded base of learning is so enormous, you take your child
to a great museum, then you take them over here to a great zoo.  Then you
take them down and they get to see a factory.  Then they get to read about
it.  Then they get to watch the videotape.  Then they get to use the PC at
home and use the best software in the world, and you're personally
nurturing and interacting with them.  And I'm not arguing for home
schooling.  My children and my wife and I are all products of traditional,
regular public schools, but I am saying that's a characteristic that is
bubbling here that is telling us something.  And for 9600 bucks, you can do
a lot of home schooling.
<P><pre>
>>have there been any returns on that?  I believe it was Boston that opted,
>>you know, in a certain community to give the parents -- the students the
>>money that they were spending on the children.

>>I don't think it's in -- there is in Milwaukee where, again, Polly
>>Williams, a black welfare mother, who had been Jesse Jackson's
>>CO-chairman of state legislature, created vouchers for the inner city.
>>Tremendously bitter fight.  And the republicans made her the chairman, or
>>chairwoman, of the education committee in the legislature.  But what you
>>get right now is from public managed public schools to corporate managed
>>public schools.  The Baltimore experiment, or the HartFord experiment.  I
>>think that's only a very tiny step.
</pre>
I mean, I think -- there's something happening here for doctors, lawyers,
and educators that will dissolve this system.  You're going to see the same
thing in the news media.  I mean, every person is going to become a
reporter.  And you'll just have -- you'll have an explosion of, you know,
why don't you contribute to your own newspaper?  The newspaper will be
electronic.  And you see some of it -- you see it with auto accidents,
don't you?  I mean, somebody calls in, they've got -- you know, they're --
at least in Atlanta, they're on the Bellsouth mobile phone, they get to
call, you know, wsb for free, and they go, "wow, I'm right here, and there
is a big tanker truck problem right here," and they're now the live,
on-the-spot volunteer reporter for the opening two minutes.  Doesn't that
sort of fit what you hear?  You've got traffic updates from the 37,000
people who call us.
<P>
You know, I'm now -- and it's interesting, because what you're getting is a
total redefinition of what it means to be a reporter.  You still have
professional reporters, but now getting all sorts of people who are random.
And when we shot down the airbus over the Persian gulf, there was, in
fact, a video camera in a boat just held by an amateur, and they filmed the
plane crashing.  Well, they immediately sold it, probably to CNN.  That
person was, for that moment, a temporary reporter, weren't they?
Similarly, you're going to have a lot of self-law, you're going to have a
lot of self-health, you're going to have a -- you know, where you get up in
the morning and you sit in an armchair or something and you -- it says to
you, "your cardiovascular's not good enough.  "go exercise a little bit
more.  "add -- you know, add a half mile to your run," or "add 10 laps to
your swim," or, you know, "go do stairmaster longer."
<P><pre>
>>we're talking about change, and I guess it could be argued that we're
>>change -- change is inevitable and change is constant, but why are we so
>>resistant to change?

>>Because you want certainty.  Humans operate best when they're secure.  So
>>you spend your lifetime trying to find out, what can I do?  I feel this
>>way.  I'm a very public figure, as you all know.  I hate arriving late.
>>I got into some kind of a goof-up the other day -- well, the national
>>prayer breakfast.  I arrived late because of something else we had to do,
>>and here's this huge crowd, and I was going to have to walk in late.  I
>>literally for a half second thought about leaving just because I hate
>>walking in and being embarrassed.  So people have a very high propensity
>>to be insecure, and, you know, you say, you know, what do you mean I have
>>to learn a new career?  Or what do you mean we just changed power
>>companies and now they're billing differently?  Or I'm going to change to
>>a new cable system and I can't find my favorite show?  Or they no longer
>>do checkbooks the way they used to, and now -- I mean, anything which
>>makes us insecure goes at this core notion which is, we want to build
>>boundaries around us that are stable so that we know what we can do and
>>have a sense of certainty.
</pre><P>
That's very human, and it goes back to chimpanzee politics and to Franz de
Waal's work on primates.  I mean, that people want orderly structured
environments in which they have what Yankelovich called a giving and
getting contract.  I'll do my share, and now you owe me.  That's why when
you run into the steelworker who basically thought, if I was a good
steelworker for 20 years, you're not allowed to close the factory.  You
can't make me learn a new career.  And what we're describing here is a
much, much more decentralized society.
<P>
I told Morris Schechtman that he ought to change the title of his book from
"Working Without a Net" to "Building Your Own Net."

So we will pick all of this up and go in to the Third Wave and the world
market and creating next -- creating American jobs.  And for that, we're
going to ask you to look at "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt,
chapters I, II, XI, and XII.
