On September 27-29, on a weekend that promised and produced abundant<br>
rain, over 100 people gathered at Heuston Woods State Park to set the agenda<br>
for rewilding the Western Allegheny Plateau in Ohio. The Buckeye Forest<br>
Council, an organization primarily composed of people under 30 years old, has<br>
called for the protection and restoration of 950,000 acres in the region.<br>
Rivers Unlimited Greenways Coordinator Elaine Marsh made the greenway<br>
connection with wildlands at an energetic workshop. For more information<br>
about the Ohio Wildlands Project, contact BFC at 614/594-6400 or<br>

After many years of planning and talking, the first phases of a<br>
greenbelt and bikeway that will eventually connect the east side of Cleveland<br>
and its suburbs to the downtown. The plan, which includes a bikepath along<br>
the Cleveland section of Lake Erie, finally got funding for the section that<br>
connects the Inner Harbor with University Circle.<br>
<br>
Running along Martin Luther King Blvd. and North Marginal Rd., the route<br>
will be used both by commuters and recreationists alike. Over 2 million<br>
people every year are expected to use the path. Nearly twenty years in the<br>
making, local cyclists point to momentum created by the opening of the Rock<br>
and Roll Hall of Fame.<br>

The federal high way program (ISTEA) that has spurred the creation of so<br>
many bike paths in the state will go through its last funding schedule this<br>
year. At that point, the moneys will need to be reauthorized in the next<br>
transportation budget. The &quot;enhancement&quot; portion of that funding is under<br>
siege from the state transportation departments who view these projects as<br>
&quot;frivolous.&quot;<br>
<br>
The battle to renew this funding will need all the hikers and bikers it<br>
can muster. Rivers<br>
Unlimited and its greenway enthusiasts have joined the defense. Recently the<br>
organization<br>
participated in a focus group of pro-ISTEA Ohioans sponsored by the Federal<br>
Highway<br>
Administration.<br>

Beginning in October, the 200,000 people who use the Towpath in the<br>
Cuyahoga Valley<br>
National Recreation Area in Northeast Ohio will be asked to make an annual<br>
contribution of $5 to support the maintenance of the 20-mile trail. An<br>
informal survey of users indicated that most people would be willing to<br>
contribute and that most considered it a bargain (at the cost of one ticket<br>
to one showing in a stuffy movie theater to watch imitation life, &quot;bargain&quot;<br>
is an understatement).<br>

habitat and watershed protection benefit from green connecting corridors.<br>

<p><a name="COALITION">COALITION</a> OF HUNTERS, ANGLERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS MEETS AGAIN	<br>
<br>
Taken as a group, anglers, environmentalists, hunters and conservationists<br>
comprise amajority of the adult population in this country. Unfortunately,<br>
the groups that represent these constituencies rarely work together on issues<br>
of mutual concern. Thanks to the leadership of the Ohio BASS Federation,<br>
that may be changing. Tonight in Columbus the Ohio Natural Resources<br>
Coalition (ONRC) will hold its third meeting of 1996. This meeting is being<br>
organized by Rivers Unlimited. The coalition was formed to create a forum<br>
for a broad cross section of environmental, conservation, angler and hunting<br>
groups. Topics of interest are discussed and letters of support are<br>
circulated when appropriate. Over thirty organizations belong to ONRC.<br>
Tonight's meeting will feature a presentation by State Representative Bill<br>
Schuck regarding his environmental bond initiative and a discussion with the<br>
Wildlife Legislative Fund concerning their efforts to create a<br>
Wildlife Commission in Ohio. For more information contact Rivers Unlimited.<br>

<a name="OHIO TAKINGS BILL ">OHIO TAKINGS BILL </a>PASSES SENATE COMMITTEE<br>
<br>
Despite significant opposition from environmental, historic preservation,<br>
local government, planning and other groups, the Ohio Senate, State and Local<br>
Government and Veterans Affairs Committee passed Substitute House Bill 533 by<br>
a vote of 7-1 on September 11. Senator Janet Howard of Cincinnati was the<br>
lone no vote. The bill was further amended from the House passed version to<br>
somewhat minimize the impact of the legislation.<br>
<br>
Proponents call the bill a &quot;Private Property Protection Act.&quot; Opponents<br>
however, including Rivers Unlimited, have noted that the bill is a solution<br>
desperately seeking a problem. The legislation does little to protect the<br>
rights of property owners in Ohio and places a chilling effect on local<br>
government efforts to pass new laws protecting health, safety and the<br>
environment. Opponents have also pointed out that property owners with<br>
legitimate takings claims already have the right to pursue their claims in<br>
court.<br>
<br>
The bill will most likely be considered by the full Senate when it meets<br>
again in December. If it passes the Senate, it will still have to be<br>
reconciled with the House-passed version by a conference committee before<br>
being voted on again by the House and Senate.<br>

The Great Lakes Regional Office of the National Audubon Society is<br>
initiating a registry of Ohioans with knowledge in one or more aspects of<br>
wetland ecology, natural history, policy or related fields. The Registry<br>
will be used to link community and non-profit groups in need of assistance<br>
with those that have the skills they need.<br>
<br>
Both professionals and amateurs with experience in specific aspects of<br>
wetlands are encouraged to enroll in the registry. All assistance will be<br>
made on a voluntary basis. There is no minimum time committment and registry<br>

<h3 align=center><a name="TWINSBURG CITY COUNCIL">TWINSBURG CITY COUNCIL</a> OPPOSES PLAN TO MOVE 
TINKER'S CREEK </h3>
<p>The Twinsburg City Council has joined the ever growing chorus of opponents to a proposal to 
move a portion of Tinker's Creek. On November 26, the Council unanimously passed a resolution 
in support of the appeal filed by Rivers Unlimited and the Active Citizens of Twinsburg. The 
appeal, which will be heard at the Environmental Board of Review next Wednesday, seeks to 
overturn the decision of Ohio EPA Director Donald Schregardus. The Ohio EPA director put 
parking lots ahead of people when he approved a proposal by the Whitlatch company to move 
1000 feet of Tinker's Creek so that the company could build a parking lot for a strip mall. </p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted that the city of Twinsburg is supporting our effort to protect this creek,&quot; stated 
Todd Ambs, executive director of Rivers Unlimited. &quot;We believe this is a devastating precedent for 
the 61,000 miles of rivers and streams in Ohio. As far as we know, no where else in the country 
are proposals being seriously considered, let alone approved, to move creeks solely for the benefit 
of a single company.&quot; </p>
<p>When this application was approved, the Ohio EPA said this would not be a precedent for future 
projects. Within three weeks of the decision, Martin Marietta Materials filed a 404 permit with the 
U. S. Army Corps of Engineers to move 1200 feet of Indian Creek, at the confluence with the 
Great Miami River, so that they can expand their gravel mining operation. </p>
<p>The hearing on the Tinker's Creek case will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, December 18 at 
the Environmental Board of Review, located at 236 E. Town Street in Columbus. </p>

<h3><a name="GOVERNOR SIGNS POLLUTER'S PROTECTION ACT">GOVERNOR SIGNS POLLUTER'S PROTECTION ACT</a> </h3>
<p>Governor George Voinovich today signed the environmental audit privilege bill, better known as the 
Polluter's Protection Act. The bill was vigorously opposed by Rivers Unlimited, a host of other 
environmental and conservation groups, the U. S. EPA and the Ohio Prosecuting Attorney's 
Association. This secrecy measure will now allow companies to conduct voluntary audits of their 
facilities and shield what they find behind a cloak of immunity from civil prosecution. In addition all 
violations, including criminal violations, can be labeled privileged information and kept from 
regulators and the public. This bill is sure to be a green light for unscrupulous companies that want 
to hide their environmental misdeeds behind a wall of immunity provisions, courtesy of the Ohio 
General Assembly and our environmental Governor. The bill passed 62-29 in the House and 
passed on party lines in the Senate with all Democrats opposing the bill. </p>

<h3 align=center><a name="STATE TAKES ACTION TO REMOVE DAM ON LITTLE MIAMI RIVER ">STATE TAKES ACTION TO REMOVE DAM ON LITTLE MIAMI 
RIVER </a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately for the rivers of Ohio, actions taken by state government these days usually adversely 
impact a waterway (see story on Tinker's Creek above). So it is especially nice to see the ODNR's 
Division of Natural Areas and Preserves (DNAP) recent application to the U. S. Army Corps of 
Engineers. DNAP is seeking permission to remove a low head dam on the Little Miami River in 
Greene County. The Little Miami is a state and national scenic river and is truly one of the gems of 
Ohio's waterways. Removing the low head dam will return this portion of the Little Miami to a free 
flowing river. </p>
<p>There are many obsolete and unnecessary low head dams in Ohio. They are dangerous, many 
people drowned in the undertow each year, the dams are expensive to maintain and they harm the 
aquatic ecosystem in that section of a waterway. </p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited will file comments in support of DNAP's application to help the Little Miami 
River. </p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Action Needed to Ensure Strong
Air Quality Standards</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and
particulates on November 29th. Revision of these standards is one
of the most important public health decisions the EPA will make
this decade. Now is the time to voice public support for
standards that best protect public health and air quality.
Citizens need to weigh in to counteract the enormous political
pressure against tighter standards coming from Capitol Hill, many
Governors, and a well-financed industry coalition led by the
National Association of Manufacturers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Both ozone and particulates result from burning
fossil fuels in our cars and power plants. The proposed new
particulate standard has resulted from scientific evidence that
particulate matter (airborne microscopic particles that enter our
lungs) is a serious health hazard, particularly to those most
vulnerable: the elderly, children, and individuals suffering from
respiratory ailments. Scientists say particle pollution can
reduce life expectancy by one or two years in cities with serious
pollution problems and particulate pollution is blamed for about
65,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The current standard controls for particulate
matter of a certain size (10 microns); because recent studies
show this standard to be inadequate, the proposed standard will
cover much smaller particles (2.5 microns). In addition, how EPA
resolves issues such as time frame, short-term peak
concentrations, and ways of determining exceedances of the
standard can either strengthen or weaken protection. Therefore,
it is important to urge EPA to maintain the integrity of the
proposed new particulate standard.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Scientists and public health officials have
also documented the serious impacts that result from increased
ozone pollution. Ozone, the main component of smog, is a powerful
lung irritant; it causes breathing problems, reduces lung
function, aggravates asthma, and increases the severity and
incidence of respiratory infections. In addition to impacting
public health, ground level ozone also is a climate change gas
and contributes to global warming.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Again, how the standard is measured is
important. We are urging EPA to maintain the current one-hour
standard of 124 parts per billion which protects against
short-term pollution spikes. We also support the most protective
eight-hour standard under consideration (70 ppb). Not
surprisingly, business and industry are pulling out all the stops
to fight stricter standards, claiming that the costs outweigh the
benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">At least $1.5 million has been spent to date by
the Business Coalition whose members include the American
Petroleum Institute, Dupont, General Electric, and the American
Automobile Manufacturers Association. The Coalition has organized
opposition to the revised standards, sending letters to the
President, lobbying the Departments of Defense, Energy,
Agriculture, Treasury and Transportation, generating letters from
15 Governors, and orchestrating a major press campaign.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">We must counter this highly organized and
well-financed attack in order to prevent public health and clean
air from being compromised. Even after the formal EPA
announcement, there will be a public comment period and your
voice will provide much needed balance in the debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">WHAT YOU CAN DO! Write, fax, or e-mail via EPA
website: Administrator Carol Browner, Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460; fax
202-260-0279. Also, please send a copy of the letter to Mary
Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the
same address as above. We do not yet have a direct e-mail address
for Administrator Browner, but you can send e-mail to her through
the EPA website at http://www.epa.gov</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Express your support for stricter standards for
particulates and ozone. Urge Administrator Browner to make a
decision based on overwhelming scientific evidence and maintain
the integrity of the new standards to afford maximum protection
to the public¹s health and air quality.</font></p>

<p>US Forest Service Chief, Jack Ward Thomas said earlier this week that the ESA should be 
changed to emphasize ecosystem management instead of single-species protection. Greenwire 
reports from an Albuquerque Journal article that Thomas was speaking at a forester's conference in 
Albuquerque, NM. Thomas also said that he regrets the amount of micromanagement that came 
from Washington during his years as Forest Service Chief. &quot;I kept trying to push money and 
authority out, but the pressures in Washington are.[saying] `We want you to control that money. 
We want you to control those decisions.'&quot;</p>

<p>A $200-300 million &quot;takings&quot; lawsuit by the Michigan Peat Company is on hold while MI 
Department of Environmental Quality officials negotiate with the Houston based mining company. 
Michigan Peat is mining the Minden Bog, the last true raised bog in Michigan. The state had 
allowed the mining company to continue mining already disturbed land but would not permit mining 
of the natural part of the bog says Watershed News, the Journal of Defenders of the Great Lakes. 
Fred Fuller, Mayor of the City of Yale says, &quot;What we fear is the Engler administration [Michigan's 
governor] will negotiate away more of the irreplaceable natural bog. This will be a real test of 
whether our wetlands laws mean anything.&quot; Fuller urges supporters of the Minden Bog to contact 
their legislators, the DEQ and the Governor Engler.&quot; For information call (313)389-0029.</p>

<p>The Boston Globe reports that consumers will be paying much more for their Christmas caviar due 
to overfishing of Caspian Sea sturgeon. The number of adult sturgeon on the Caspian Sea is 
estimated to have dropped from 142 million in 1978 to 43.5 million in 1994. A report written by 
Andrea Gaski, of the World Wildlife Fund, says that &quot;with significant illegal trade, little regulation, 
tremendous profits and increasing demand, sturgeon species are perched precariously on the edge 
of extinction.&quot; Gaski says aggressive fishing by Russian and Iranian trawlers kills all sturgeon, not 
just the egg-bearing females.</p>

<p>An article in the <u>Christian Science Monitor</u> reports that attempts to repair the country's only living 
barrier coral reef are working. Two ships grounded in 1989 severely damaged more than 3,000 
meters of the fragile reef. The groundings prompted Congress to create the Florida Keys National 
Marine Sanctuary and to expand the buffer zone prohibited to ships. The shipping companies 
agreed to pay for reef restoration efforts in an out of court settlement. Bill Causey, superintendent 
of the Marine Sanctuary says, &quot;We are undoing something devastating that humans have done. I 
don't feel we are replacing Mother Nature.&quot;</p>

 CITIZEN ACTIVIST NETWORK FOR THE OHIO
ENVIRONMENT -- CANOE</P>
<P> BACK ROOM ATTACKS AGAINST WATER QUALITY</P>
</CENTER>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">River advocates across Ohio are anxiously
awaiting a decision by the Franklin County Common Pleas Court
that could protect 96 percent of the state's waterways from
additional pollution discharges. On or about August 1st,
Judge Beverly Pfiefer will render a long-awaited decision on
the validity of the antidegradation rules, a statute slipped
into the massive 1,300-page 1993 budget bill. The new law was
passed without the benefit of legislative hearings or public
review. Most legislators who voted for the budget bill were
unaware they had just approved rules that allow more
pollution into Ohio's waterways.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> <BR>
</P>
<CENTER>
<P>HOW THE RULE WOULD WORK</P>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
The antidegradation rules were drafted by
the Ohio EPA with the help of wastewater treatment plant
operators and representatives of privately owned electric
power companies, developers and manufacturers. The rules will
reclassify all 61,000 miles of Ohio waterways into five
categories. The top four categories of waterways receive a
variety of protections. In fact, those waterways classified
as &quot;Outstanding National Resource Waters&quot; could
actually benefit from the new rules. However, the fifth
category, &quot;General High Quality Waters,&quot; would
suffer the most if this ruling goes into effect. Rivers
Unlimited has calculated that 97.6 percent of Ohio's rivers
and streams are presently classified as &quot;General High
Quality Waters&quot;-- a figure the Ohio EPA does not
dispute.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<CENTER>
<P>BATTLE TO STOP THIS LAW</P>
<P> </P>
</CENTER>
<P>This winter Rivers Unlimited organized a broad
alliance of environmental, conservation, and recreation
organizations that worked to prevent the rules from being
approved. The alliance, called Citizens for Clean Water in
Ohio, represented nearly one million Ohioans, the largest
cross-section of people ever assembled to fight for clean
water in Ohio. On February 20, 1996 representatives from the
coalition testified for over four hours before the Joint
Committee on Agency Rule Review (JCARR). After four hours of
testimony against the rules, the vote by JCARR members to
overturn the rules failed on a 4-4 vote. </P>
<P>This unprecedented assault on water quality is now being
fought in the courts. Rivers Unlimited, with the help of nine
organizations, has led the legal battle to throw out the
antidegradation statute. The lawsuit charges that the
anti-degradation statute does not comply with the federal
Clean Water Act and that it was passed in violation of the
single-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution.</P>
<P>Keep your fingers crossed and we will update you on the
decision.</P>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Meat Monoopolies &amp; the
False Promise of Irradiation</font></h2>

<h5><font size="2">Excerpted from &quot;Meat Monopolies: Dirty
Meat and the False Promises of Irradiation,&quot; a report
written by Susan Meeker-Lowry and Jennifer Ferrara</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">Since four children died after eating E. Coli
contaminated hamburgers at a fast food restaurant in 1993,
citizens have been calling on the federal government and the meat
industry to clean up their acts and provide safe meat products.
In an effort to put the public at ease, President Clinton
approved new meat inspection laws this summer, promising stronger
safeguards against contamination. But corporate monopolies
continue to churn out most of this country&#146;s meat supply on
overcrowded farms and in unsanitary processing plants without
regard to public and environmental health, and the new laws do
nothing to stop bacterial contamination at the root of the
problem.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This country&#146;s large farming and meat
processing operations are breeding grounds for contamination and
disease. Cattle are confined in pens, open and unprotected from
weather, in groups of 100 to 500. Poultry are raised in total
confinement in large floor-pens which hold 10,000 to 20,000
chickens. At the slaughterhouse, animal carcasses are exposed to
hides, feathers, trimming and cleaning equipment, floors, and
buildings contaminated with bacteria-ridden feces and contents of
intestines. At cattle plants, carcasses are inspected for
contamination at an average rate of 360 per hour, not leaving
time for thorough inspections. Poultry processing plants chill
chicken carcasses after slaughter by dipping them in a tank of
cold water. The water in these chill tanks is called &quot;fecal
soup&quot; by some federal inspectors who say that their use is a
primary cause of the high rate of salmonella on chicken
carcasses.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Just three companies control almost 80 percent
of today&#146;s U.S. beef production. Four companies dominate 44
percent of broiler production, and four produce 35 percent of the
nation&#146;s turkeys. While the top meat companies make billions
of dollars yearly, 500 people die and at least 20,000 fall ill as
a result of E. coli contamination. Salmonella causes almost two
million cases of illness and up to 2,000 deaths each year. Time
and again, the meat industry has denied responsibility for the
chronic contamination of the meat supply, calling it a
&quot;natural&quot; occurrence that can best be eradicated in
consumers&#146; kitchens.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">This irresponsible stance leaves doors wide
open for promotion of irradiation, a controversial food
processing technology that exposes food to an equivalent of 30
million chest x-rays, to come along and claim a silver bullet
solution to a deadly problem. The U.S. Food &amp; Drug
Administration (FDA) has already approved irradiation for
poultry, pork, fruits, vegetables, and spices and is close to
giving its approval for red meat. Irradiation does kill
pathogens, but the dangers of the technology far outweigh any
possible benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Food is irradiated with radioactive gamma
sources that break up the molecular structure of the food,
forming free radicals. These free radicals react with the food to
create new chemical substances called radiolytic products, some
of which are known carcinogens (like benzene in irradiated beef).
Others are completely unique to the radiation process and their
effect on human health is unknown. Exposing food to radiation
also causes essential vitamin and nutrient loss, and the process
kills beneficial bacteria that warn citizens when meat has gone
bad. The safety of a long term diet of irradiated foods has never
been proven. In fact, Dr. Marcia Van Gemert, the chair of the FDA
committee that investigated 441 studies on food irradiation
before the approval of the process for some foods in 1982,
testified in 1993 that all 441 studies were flawed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Irradiation proponents advertise the technology
as the food processing and retail industries&#146; dream solution
to meat contamination, and are hoping to use the coming FDA beef
approval to convince other sectors of the food industry to adopt
irradiation. But citizens have long rejected food irradiation due
to the environmental and health hazards it poses. Because of
strong consumer opposition, no major supermarket will sell
irradiated foods and the country&#146;s top poultry companies
will not use the technology.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dirty meat will remain a problem, and
irradiation a looming threat, as long as huge corporations that
value profit over health maintain monopolies over meat
production. The new federal meat regulations, the product of
years of compromise between government and industry, only
solidify this monopoly. They allow corporations to perform their
own microbial inspections. Companies&#146; safety records are
considered &quot;trade secrets&quot; and are not subject to
public disclosure. Furthermore, the goal of these laws is not to
eliminate dangerous bacteria, but to keep contamination from
exceeding current average levels. For poultry, that&#146;s one in
five chickens and one in two turkeys contaminated with
salmonella.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The new meat laws and other solutions to the
contamination problem proposed by industry and government
don&#146;t go far enough to address the root causes of meat
contamination. Unsafe meat is only one among many problems caused
by centralized agribusiness. Only by restructuring the current
agricultural system, turning away from meat monopolies and
cleaning up meat production at the source, will the long-term
safety of the food supply be assured.</font></p>

<h3 align=center><a name="DECISION TO MOVE TINKER'S CREEK APPEALED">DECISION TO MOVE TINKER'S CREEK APPEALED</a></h3>
<p>On October 30, 1996, Rivers Unlimited and the Active Citizens of Twinsburg appealed the Ohio 
EPA decision to allow a developer to move Tinker's Creek to the Environmental Board of Review 
(EBR). On September 30, The director of Ohio EPA, Donald Schregardus, had approved the 
controversial proposal to move this creek in Twinsburg so that the Whitlatch Company could build 
a parking lot for a strip mall.</p>
<p>&quot;We have appealed this decision because this case sets a very dangerous precedent for the 
waterways of Ohio,&quot; said RU executive director Todd Ambs. The director of Ohio EPA had the 
legal grounds to deny this permit. The person who developed the stream restoration technigue 
being used to move this creek says it was not intended for this purpose. As a result, we believe 
Tinker's Creek will be permanently degraded by this project.&quot; The EBR has scheduled a 
preliminary prehearing conference on the case on December 10 at 10:30 a.m. in Columbus. </p>
<h5><a href="#CANOE">Return</a></h5>
<h4 align=center><a name="RU ASKS OHIO EPA TO ELIMINATE LIMITED RESOURCE WATERS">RU ASKS OHIO EPA TO ELIMINATE LIMITED RESOURCE WATERS</a></h4>
<p>The Ohio EPA has begun a rulemaking process to update their regulations for surface water quality 
standards in Ohio. Rivers Unlimited filed its preliminary comments today. Ohio EPA plans to 
submit the final rules to The Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review (JCARR) on November 25. 
A public hearing will be scheduled after the first of the year and then the rules will go before 
JCARR sometime in January.</p>
<p>As part of this process, RU has asked Ohio EPA to eliminate its lowest surface water designation 
category, Limited Resource Waters. Waterways with this designation must meet minimal aquatic, 
human health and wildlife criteria. As a result, Limited Resource Waters are little more than open 
sewers. </p>
<p>A summary of the main comments filed with the agency today are listed below: The enclosed 
comments represent the views of Rivers Unlimited regarding the proposed new rulemaking for 
Ohio&#146;s surface water quality standards. The organization will also be presenting testimony at the 
public hearing and on the final rules before the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review.</p>
<p>&#183; Rivers Unlimited firmly believes that the limited resource waters category should be eliminated. 
There is no requirement that these waters meet chronic aquatic criteria standards. In addition, the 
thresholds for attainment of acute aquatic, human health and wildlife criteria are so low as to make 
these waters little more than open sewers. We believe that limited resource waters are violative of 
the intent of the federal Clean Water Act which is intended to restore and maintain the chemical, 
physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters.</p>
<p>&#183; In general, Rivers Unlimited opposes any downgrades of stream segments to less stringent 
standards. Short of that, any downgrade should only be approved after point source dischargers 
have agreed to take specific steps that in the future would prevent pollution, reduce discharges and 
allow the stream segment to be redesignated at a higher, more protective level within a specified 
amount of time.</p>
<p>&#183; Downgrading stream segments is a self fulfilling prophecy that raises the level of pollutants that 
may be dumped into the receiving waters and triggers a downward spiral that can only result in a 
severely degraded waterway.</p>
<p>&#183; OhioEPA should incorporate the economic and environmental losses of consigning streams to 
greater pollution. When some 50% or more of Ohio's waters are not fishable and swimmable, and 
fishing expenditures in Ohio were $861 million in 1990, is Ohio's economy foregoing up to another 
$861 million because half its streams are too polluted? What other conclusion can one come to? 
Are sewage ratepayers and a few major industrial polluters actually saving that $861 million 
because lax laws and enforcement permit them to externalize their costs of manufacture and waste 
disposal? Downstream economic and environmental costs should be included in any 
decision-making process for use designations of Ohio&#146;s 61,000 miles of rivers and streams.</p>
<p>OhioEPA may indeed be acting in accord with the letter of the law, but certainly not in accord with 
the intent of the Clean Water Act, which says that any additional pollution permitted must be in the 
economic and social interest. True economic benefit/cost analysis has never been used by Ohio 
todetermine the public interest in having clean water in this state.</p>

<h2><font size="2">Corporate Monopolies and Meat Contamination</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">Food &amp; Water, Inc., a leading national
non-profit grassroots environmental and food safety organization,
released an expose of the highly consolidated U.S meat industry,
detailing the links between industry concentration and chronic
bacterial contamination of the meat supply that continues to
claim thousands of lives every year. In the 37-page illustrated
report, Meat monopolies: Dirty Meat and the False Promises of
Irradiation, Food &amp; Water also discredits proponents of
irradiation who claim that it presents a solution to meat
contamination. The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration is
expected to approve red meat irradiation within the next several
months.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The chronic plague of microbial
contamination of the food supply is a symptom of the corporate
monopoly over meat production,&quot; reads the report.
&quot;Three companies control 80 percent of U.S. beef production.
Other sectors of the meat industry are also highly consolidated.
As long as such corporate monopolies have control over the U.S.
meat supply and government regulatory agencies, meat safety will
remain a serious public health concern in this country.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Industrial meat production already
exposes citizens to severe and outrageous health risks like
deadly pathogens in meat and toxic pesticides in land and water,
an now the food irradiation industry is looking to make
factory-produced meat even more dangerous by exposing it to
radiation,&quot; said Michael Colby, Executive Director of Food
&amp; Water. &quot;Just as citizen pressure, not government
regulation, has kept the dangers of irradiation at bay for over a
decade, citizens must go directly to meat corporations to demand
a clean and safe meat supply while supporting the development of
safer, sustainable methods of producing meat. This report is an
educational tool for citizens who want to take a critical, active
role in making the food supply safe.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The report also features sections on mad cow
disease, the effects of industrial agriculture on workers,
farmers, and the environment, government&#146;s failed attempts
to make the meat supply safe, background&nbsp;on food
irradiation, and the possibilities of regional food systems to
replace disease-ridden monopolies. If you are interested in

<title>PCB's Affinity 101196</title>

<h2 align=center>Protect Our Children from PCB'S</h2>
<p>Sierra Club today called on Congress and our national, state and local leaders to protect our 
children from PCBs and other toxic chemicals. </p>
<p>Yesterday's report in the New England Journal of Medicine documents that polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs), chemical pollutants found in our air and water, caused lower learning ability in 
children whose mothers ate PCB-laden fish from Lake Michigan. The children were exposed in 
utero and through their mothers' breast milk.</p>
<p>&quot;This report is heart-breaking,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope, &quot;and it is truly 
disgraceful that as we learn more and more about the human consequences of pollution, our 
Congress has been working as hard as it can to weaken the laws that protect our families from 
situations just like this one.&quot; </p>
<p>PCB production was banned in 1977, but according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, 
polluters dumped over 200 pounds of PCBs into the Great Lakes in 1991. That is enough PCBs to 
contaminate over 400 million pounds of fish. In fact, every major harbor in the United States has 
dangerous levels of PCBs or similar toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>&quot;This study is a clear example of the need to strengthen America's environmental safeguards, not 
weaken them, yet that is exactly what this Congress tried to do when it voted to approve HR 961 
'the Dirty Water Act,' and passed the EPA budget riders which would have prohibited the 
Environmental Protection Agency from implementing the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative,&quot; said 
Brett Hulsey, Sierra Club Midwest Regional Representative and Great Lakes Program Director. </p>
<p>&quot;How many children's bright futures will be lost because of the greed and insensitivity of a Congress 
that responds to polluting industries instead of the American people?&quot; &quot;We call on Congress to stop 
these irresponsible attacks and to start protecting America's environment for our families, for our 
future,&quot; said Carl Pope. Ways to protect yourself from PCB exposure:</p>
<p>- Eat a low-fat diet, especially if you are a woman of child-bearing years. Cut out fat. Take the skin 
off fish and chicken, cut off fat from meat, and eat low-fat cheese and skim milk.</p>
<p>- Buy chlorine free paper and clothing because chlorine tends to lead to the formation of PCBs, 
dioxin and other dangerous pollutants.</p>
<p>- Check with your local community or utility to find out if there are any PCB contaminated 
transformers in your neighborhood, or toxic waste dumps w/PCBs. If there are, tell them to clean 
them up.</p>

<title>Affinity - Cuyahoga River Watershed Planning</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Cuyahoga River Watershed
Planning</font></h2>

<h5 align="center"><font size="2">by Janine Rybka, Cuyahoga River
RAP</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">When local residents look into a valley and
wonder what lies on the bottom, when residents within a quarter
of a mile from the second highest waterfall in the county are not
aware of its existence, when local officials are not sure about
the streams that criss-cross their town, you can begin to imagine
how tough watershed planning can be. These are just a few factors
that illustrate the challenges presented to the development of
the Cuyahoga River Remedial Action Plan (RAP). The RAP is an
ecosystem-based plan aimed at restoring the beneficial uses of
the River and nearshore areas of Lake Erie that have been
adversely affected by pollution.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The RAP will address problems in the Cuyahoga
River Area of Concern (AOC). This area falls within the 45 mile
stretch of the River from Akron's Ohio Edison Dam on the south to
the River's mouth in Cleveland's Flats. The nearshore areas from
Edgewater to Euclid Creek are included in the AOC. This is the
most urbanized section of the river and historically the most
polluted. Development patterns are dense and there are large
areas of impervious surfaces that have changed the hydraulics of
local streams which feed into the River and Lake Erie. Poor land
utilization, especially along the stream banks, contributes to a
variety of problems such as erosion and loss of habitat. A
variety of discharges into the river from both point sources and
non-point sources also contribute to the degradation of the water
quality and habitat.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Finding ways to address pollution and
degradation issues has taken significant time and effort. One of
the most important efforts is continually connecting local
stakeholders to their watershed, since their connection leads to
their involvement. Public involvement is the cornerstone of this
community based plan. Continued public involvement will help
ensure the long range success of actions taken to correct the
worst problems affecting the River and Lake Erie.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Cuyahoga RAP planners are continually working
on many levels to develop strategies to correct the worst of the
problems that impact the Cuyahoga River. One strategy is the
Stream Stewardship Project which is intended to provide
opportunities for involvement from local stakeholders.
Stakeholders include everyone who lives and works within the
watershed. Stream stewardship involves getting people to take
responsibility for the streams in their community. Activities can
range from group projects to researching and lobbying for
protective ordinances. The RAP is using stream stewardship as a
means to propel stake holders into developing meaningful local
watershed management plans. These plans would focus the attention
and efforts of the local stakeholders on the stream in their own
backyards.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to the Center for Watershed
Protection, a local watershed plan can be the most comprehensive
tool for protection of urban streams. While there are few, if
any, truly successful models on which to draw, the Cuyahoga RAP
believes it has started to build a model that can be used in the
smaller watersheds around the Cuyahoga Basin.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Watershed planning efforts have begun with an
aggressive stream stewardship program in the Big Creek watershed.
The program has been a great example of community based planning.
Local citizens and officials have had the opportunity to learn of
the connection between Big Creek and the Cuyahoga River. Input
from these stake- holders has been useful in further defining
problems and listening to stakeholder's goals for their
watershed. It has also been combined with tools such as
geographic information systems (GIS) mapping, monitoring, and
modeling to offer more opportunities for involvement on all
levels. Volunteers continue to be involved on projects such as
storm drain stenciling, stream side clean ups, and stream bank
restoration which address some of the &quot;simpler&quot;
problems in the watershed. More importantly, these outreach
programs have helped to elevate Big Creek from its partially
invisible status.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If indeed a local watershed management plan is
to be the best and most comprehensive tool to protect urban
streams, it will need the continued involvement from the stake
holders in the watershed. The Cuyahoga RAP believes a good plan
should focus on a local scale, with an ongoing commitment to
overseeing the plan and monitoring changes in the watershed. When
it comes to the basics of watershed planning, the lack of
excellent watershed plans provides the Cuyahoga RAP with a
challenge to develop the model that will make stream stewardship
a workable goal in each sub-watershed of the Cuyahoga River.</font></p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Population: An Environmental
issue?</font></h2>

<h5 align="center"><font size="2">by Alan Kuper</font></h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2">Long before the word &quot;environment&quot;
carried the meaning it does today the concerns of &quot;nature
lovers&quot; were primarily preservation of scenic values. Those
early outdoors people would probably be surprised at the range of
interests today&#146;s nature lovers pursue, particularly, that
some of them rank population among their top priorities. After
all, John Muir, naturalist and founder of the Sierra Club </font></p>

<p><font size="2">said, &quot;When we try to pick out anything by
itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the
Universe.&quot; And surely just about every &quot;environmental
problem&quot; is traceable to people and their consuming ways.
Muir, a keen observer of Nature, would probably have agreed with
the truism that, &quot;the biotic potential of a species exceeds
the carrying capacity of its habitat.&quot; Numerous examples of
overshoot of carrying capacity followed by population crash, like
harsh winter die-off of over-populated deer, were known to him.
One wonders whether he ever noted that the same law applied to
&quot;Lord Man,&quot; as he disparagingly called humans. He
surely knew that the rapidly rising population of Ireland crashed
to a fraction of its pre-1845 number during the Famine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are those who advocate that the Sierra
Club return to little more than protecting and preserving public
lands, return to its roots. Sierra Club population activists
argue that the root cause of threats to our public lands, water
and air is the existence of so many people with their attendant
needs. We, population activists advocate policies that could
stabilize future population. You can&#146;t be more an
environmentalist than that. If you want to walk in the steps of
John Muir with us, call Alan Kuper, committee Chair, of the
Sierra Club Population-Environment Committee at 229-2413; fax
229-9431 or e-mail: AlanKuper@aol.com</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Footnote: Among the many things we publicize to
help people plan their lives and to help improve communities is
&quot;Emergency Contraception &#139; The Nation&#146;s Best Kept
Secret.&quot; You should have EC in your medicine cabinet. Call

<h2 align=center>City of Cleveland Announces Expansion of Bikeway</h2>
<p>After many years of planning and talking, the first phases have begun for a greenbelt and bikeway 
that will eventually connect the east side of Cleveland and its suburbs to the downtown. The plan, 
which includes a bikepath along the Cleveland section of Lake Erie, finally got funding for the 
section that connects the Inner Harbor with University Circle. </p>
<p>Running along Martin Luther King Blvd. and North Marginal Rd., the route will be used both by 
commuters and recreationists alike. Over 2 million people every year are expected to use the path. 
Nearly twenty years in the making, local cyclists point to momentum created by the opening of the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p><font size="2">Letter to the Editor</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Affinity Personnel:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I really enjoy your paper and the environmental
issues it explores. Per your request, I wrote a letter to Shell
Oil and got back the enclosed response. My questions to you are:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Q: Is this just fancy PR; trying to get out of
moral responsibility?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A: Absolutely. When you read their response
carefully you find many contradicitions. In their response they
mention their concern about many of the grievances felt by the
Nigerian communities effected by the production of oil by Shell.
Then later in the reponse they say &quot;The standard of living
of communities in the oil producing areas is still poor, even
after thirty years of production. Basic amenities are lacking and
opporutinities for employment are few.&quot; So why is it that
now, after 30 years, they are expressing their so called
&quot;concern?&quot; It is obvious that the hugh outcry by
citizens and environmental and human rights groups concerning the
execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight co-defendants have triggered
this response by Shell International Limited.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Q: Is this factual?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A: I am sure some of what they say if factual.
But they reveal these facts without telling the whole story. They
never express the Ogoni&#146;s, one of the communities severly
effected by Shell&#146;s oil operations, concerns and the
tremendous environmental impact this land has suffered for
decades and how it has affected many communities of Nigeria. They
also neglect to mention what the Ogoni people want. They only
express what they think the Ogoni people need. Other information
they give in their response is definetly stretching the truth.
They had to come up with some response to the many inquires they
have received from citizens all over the world and make sure they
come out looking good. They know there are boycotts on their
products all over the world and they need to be sure their
profits are effected as little as possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Q: Is this a combination of the above two
questions?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A: Yes. I encourage anyone concerned about this
issue to write the president of the Shell Oil Compnay, Philip J.
Carroll, P.O. Box 2463, Houston, TX 77252 or call (800) 248-4257
or fax (713) 241-4044, and express your concerns about this
issue. You will also receive their response and you can read for
yourself their defense on the issue. If readers are unfamiliar
with this issue call the office, (216) 383-9985, and we will send
you the many updates we have run in past issues.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Q: Is this something we truly don&#146;t or
can&#146;t know here in America?</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A: Americans have been very well informed on
this issue. The Sierra Club has taken a major interest in this
issue and would be the best group to contact for more
information. You can visit the Sierra Club&#146;s Web Site at
http://www.sierraclub.org or you can call Stephen Mills at (202)
675-6691.</font></p>

<title>Ohio Citizens Protest Against Logging in the Wayne</title>

<h1 align="center"><font size="2">Ohio Citizens Protest Against
Logging in the</font></h1>

<h1 align="center"><font size="2">Wayne National Forest</font></h1>

<h5 align="center"><font size="2">by Susan M. Heitker</font></h5>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">A peaceful protest against
    logging in the Wayne National Forest on Wednesday, November
    13 at the Wayne National Forest Headquarters in Athens, Ohio
    ended with 21 individuals arrested for criminal trespassing,
    two of whom received an additional charge of resisting
    arrest.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">At 4:00 p.m. approximately 45
    people from Ohio University&#146;s Campus Greens and the
    Athens community, determined to stop logging of the Wayne
    National Forest in southeastern Ohio, entered the lobby of
    the headquarters and proceeded to the office of Eurial
    Turner, Forest Supervisor. Once everyone was in the office
    Chris Crews of the Campus Greens approached Turner with their
    single demand of zero cut&#151;absolutely no logging in the
    Wayne. Turner explained that the Wayne, as a National Forest,
    is open for multiple use, including timber extraction.
    However, Matt Peters pointed out that &quot;timber extraction
    is an option as a use for the Forest but, the Forest Service
    is not mandated to log the forest. Studies conducted in
    Indiana and Kentucky found 69 percent to 82 percent of the
    people in the Midwest are opposed to logging of National
    Forests,&quot; challenging Turner to explain why the
    interests of the 18 to 31 percent who want logging have
    priority.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">At 4:30 p.m. Turner announced
    the office was closing and asked the protesters to leave.
    &quot;We do not want cutting on our public lands and will not
    leave until you concede to our demand of zero cut,&quot; said
    Crews. Turner informed the group that if they did not leave
    the police would be called and they would be arrested.
    Standing their ground, the protesters patiently awaited the
    arrival of the Athens City Police, all the while chanting
    slogans such as &quot;The Wayne is not for sale&quot; and
    &quot;The forest can manage itself&quot; as well as holding
    up signs with similar slogans in the windows so the media and
    other protesters outside could see.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The police arrived shortly
    before 5:00 p.m. and gave the protesters the option of
    leaving the office or being arrested. At this time about half
    of the protesteres opted to join the small group of
    protesters outside the Forest Headquarters while 21 continued
    their occupation of Turner&#146;s office. The police arrested
    the 21 protesters, escorting them to police vehicles via the
    Forest Headquarters garage at the back of the building. For
    the most part the police had little trouble with the arrests.
    However, two individuals passively resisted arrest with one
    actually being carried to the police vehicle. The arrestees
    were taken to the Athens Police Station, charged with
    criminal trespassing, a fourth degree misdemeanor, and
    released. The two individuals who passively resisted arrest
    were given an additional charge of resisting arrest, a second
    degree misdemeanor, and released.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The 21 protesters were
    arraigned on Tuesday, November 19 and Wednesday, November 20.
    One pledguilty and 20 pled not guilty. The pretrial for the
    20 is scheduled for Friday, January 10, 1996.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">This protest was by no means
    the first step taken by those opposed to the logging of the
    Wayne National Forest. Previous to this action numerous
    attempts had been made to persuade the Forest Service not to
    log in the Wayne. In addition to letters, petitions, and an
    administrative appeal from individuals and environmental
    groups concerned with the Forest Service&#146;s mismanagement
    of the Wayne, the Buckeye Forest Council (BFC) of Athens,
    Ohio filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service this past
    summer. They staged a rally in early September outside the
    Forest Headquarters in which they presented the Forest
    Service a list of demands and a Rusty Scalpel Award for
    forest health malpractice. In late October the Campus Greens
    organized a rally. Approximately 120 people marched two miles
    from the Ohio University campus to the Forest Headquarters.
    Interspersed throughout these events were numerous meetings
    between the Forest Service and environmental groups. Despite
    these efforts, logging in the Wayne is underway on the
    Bluegrass Ridge Timber Sales near Ironton, Ohio.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The partial select cutting and
    partial thinning of 300 acres of Bluegrass Ridge that has
    begun marks the first time in three years that logging has
    occurred in the Wayne. Originally, the Bluegrass Ridge Timber
    Sales comprised 442 acres, but some of the areas marked for
    cutting did not appear in the Environmental Assessment. The
    BFC&#146;s lawsuit against the Forest Service resulted in the
    150 acres of contested tracts being removed from the timber
    sale.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">In addition to the Bluegrasss
    Ridge Timber Sales, the Forest Service has proposed three
    other logging projects, two of which are small scale. The
    third, the Dorr Run Timber Sales in the Athens district, is a
    5000-acre area of which 2000 acres are scheduled for logging.
    The method of logging has not yet been determined but the
    Forest Service preference is select cutting. The objective is
    to thin out the oaks in preparation for the gypsy moth
    invasion in six to twelve years. Gypsy moths defoliate oak
    trees and can cause premature death. The Forest Service
    claims the logging will lessen the impact of the gypsy moths.
    Although there is a newly-introduced fungus, Entomophaga
    maimaiga, that is killing the gypsy moth and could prevent it
    from reaching southeastern Ohio, the Forest Service wants to
    proceed with logging instead of waiting to see what outcome
    the fungus has on the gypsy moths.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">To show your opposition to the
    logging of Dorr Run contact Rosemarie Boyle at 219 Columbus
    Rd., Athens, OH 45701. The BFC and other groups will be doing
    whatever is necessary to prevent this area from being logged.

<title>Affinity - no to Clinton</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<h2 align=center>Why I Won't Vote for Clinton</h2>
<h5 align=center>by David Brower</h5>
<p>Over the past three years, I have become increasingly distressed by President Clinton's 
environmental record. While I certainly would expect no better from Bob Dole, I think it is time to 
examine where we are going as a movement and as a civilization. My personal assessment has led 
me to support Ralph Nader's presidential campaign. Briefly, let me recount the reasons for my 
disaffection with the president. His administration is responsible for: </p>
<p>- The passage of the &quot;salvage logging&quot; rider that is causing the destruction of ancient public forests 
and critical watersheds.</p>
<p>- The signing of the Panama Declaration, which undermines protection or marine mammals 
including dolphins and whales. </p>
<p>- The continuation of the use of methyl bromide, a highly toxic pesticide known to destroy the 
Earth's ozone layer. </p>
<p>- The weakening if not the gutting, of the Endangered Species Act through administrative changes in 
its rules and regulations. </p>
<p>- The passage of NAFTA and GATT, international trade agreements that represent the biggest 
sellout of American workers in U.S. history and effectively remove environmental protections 
passed by Congress because any legislation deemed to &quot;restrain free trade&quot; can be declared illegal 
by international tribunals dominated by large-scale corporate interests. </p>
<p>- The lowering of grazing fees on public land, despite promises by candidate Clinton to raise those 
fees. As a result, Clinton is subsidizing the cattle industry while overtaxing people and land.</p>
<p>- Continuing to subsidize the sugar industry in Florida, which is poisoning the Everglades and 
diverting large amounts of water needed by wildlife. </p>
<p>- Opening wildlife refuges to hunting and fishing by presidential decrees. </p>
<p>- Weakening the Safe Drinking Water Act by allowing increased levels of lead and arsenic in 
drinkingwater supplies. </p>
<p>- Reversing the ban on the production of and importation of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), 
which may cause more than 40,000 fatalities in the Great Lakes region alone. </p>
<p>- Increasing our dependence on Middle East Oil by breaking the promise to not allow the export of 
Alaskan oil.</p>
<p>President Clinton has done more to harm the environment and to weaken environmental regulations 
in three years than Presidents Bush and Reagan did in 12 years. After an interim of reading lips, we 
have seen the regimes of environmental destruction move from the Great Communicator to the 
Great Capitulator. Even so, Clinton has tried to &quot;greenwash&quot; his record, claiming to be on the side 
of the environment. </p>
<p>Having fought for the environment for more than 50 years, I see planet Earth not only as our father 
and mother but also as our child, demanding our care and nurture. Neither of the major parties 
comprehends the seriousness of this responsibility. In response, I am supporting a real alternative in 
1996. I have known Ralph Nader for nearly 30 years, and in that time, he has never let me or the 
environment down. He is properly described as an idealistic if modest Spartan. Nader understands 
that until we rein in the far-flung empires of multinational corporations and subject them to 
international sustainable environmental standards, the planet will continue to suffer.</p>
<p>This op/ed piece first appeared in the Commentary section of the <u>Los Angeles Times</u> on July 21st. 
David Brower is a longtime environmentalist and a board member of the Sierra Club. He is one of 
the preeminent U.S. environmentalists of the 20th century. Brower, now in his early 80's, is a past 
president of the Sierra Club, founded Earth Island Institute and Friends of the Earth, and is on the 
boards of a variety of environmental organizations around the U.S.</p>

<h2 align=center>Facts About Urban Sprawl</h2>
<p>&#128; In 1950, two-thirds of the population of Cuyahoga County (914,808 people) were living in the 
city of Cleveland.</p>
<p>&#128; By 1990, only a little over one-third of the county's population (505,616 people) were left in the 
city.</p>
<p>&#128; 71% of the homesellers in Cleveland move farther out from the center of the region when they 
buy a new house.</p>
<p>&#128; In 1990, 50% more people commuted to work in Cuyahoga County from outside the county 
than in 1970.</p>
<p>&#128; In 2010, the population of Northeast Ohio is projected to occupy 30% more residential land 
than it did in 1980.</p>
<p>&#128; By the year 2011 there will be more cars than people in Northeast Ohio, if present trends 
continue.</p>
<p>&#128; Within Cuyahoga County, the suburbs increased 18,000 households but the city of Cleveland 
declined 18,000.</p>
<p>&#128; Vacant land for housing development in the suburbs of Cuyahoga County is shrinking. Within 20 
years, the major developing suburbs of Westlake, Strongsville and Solon will be largely built.</p>
<p>&#128; It's economically and environmentally wasteful to abandon existing urban areas and build new 
infrastructure in the country. Our society -- and our planet -- cannot sustain current rates of growth.</p>
<p>&#128; Sprawling development destroys valuable farm land, open space, natural areas and streams.</p>
<p>&#128; Sprawl moves homes, work places and shopping farther apart, so we all have to drive more, 
burn more fossil fuel, create more air pollution, and waste more time in traffic. Children lose 
freedom when parents have to drive them everywhere. Low-density development makes mass 
transit impractical.</p>
<p>&#128; Sprawl exacerbates economic and racial segregation, thus contributing to the dangerous 
polarization of our society. Suburbanites delude themselves if they think they can escape the social 
consequences by moving farther out.</p>
<p>&#128; Sprawl unfairly burdens the central city and county with social service costs.</p>
<p>&#128; Decline from loss of population and tax base does not stop in the central cities. It keeps on 
spreading, ultimately weakening entire regions.</p>
<p>&#128; If we lose central cities, with their public spaces and historic neighborhoods, we begin to lose 
our sense of place and identity. We lose opportunities to interact with others.</p>

<title>Appalachian Affinity -Restoration Campaign Opens Office in Athens</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Appalachian Restoration
Campaign Opens Office in Athens</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">The Appalachian Restoration Campaign (ARC)
opened its central office in Athens, Ohio this week to coordinate
wilderness recovery efforts throughout the Central Appalachian
region. The purpose of the Campaign is to restore and protect
regional biodiversity by developing and forwarding ecological
proposals for wilderness recovery which are grounded in landscape
ecology and conservation biology.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Campaign aims to establish an
interconnected system of buffered ecological preserves in the
Central Appalachians in which human activity is compatible with
ecological restoration. The Athens office will coordinate
wilderness recovery efforts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio,
Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia, compiling
locally-generated wilderness proposals into cohesive proposals
for the region. The opening of the Athens office marks the second
year of the Campaign.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Campaign cites the failure of traditional
efforts to conserve biological integrity through piecemeal
andreactionary attempts at conservation and responds with
landscape approaches to protect biological diversity and natural
evolutionary processes. &quot;If we are interested in preserving
the native biodiversity of the region, we really have no other
choice than to take a landscape approach,&quot; Than Hitt,
coordinator, remarked. &quot;The ecology of the region has been
systematically impacted by large-scale industrial exploitation
which we need to respond to with systematic, large-scale efforts
for preservation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Appalachian Restoration Campaign is a
project of Heartwood, a coalition of groups, individuals and
businesses dedicated to the health and well-being of the Central
Hardwood region. For more information, contact Than Hitt at P.O.

<h3 align=center>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Hours after Vice President Al Gore stated on national television that signing the logging rider was 
the Clinton administration's biggest mistake, White Houseofficials were busy negotiating away their 
last chance to the repeal the devastating law. Congress adjourned without taking action to remedy 
this major environmental blunder and California's forests have been left to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Under the infamous logging rider, the Forest Service is using the guise of&quot;salvage logging&quot; - the 
removal of supposedly dead and dying trees - to cut perfectly healthy old growth forests. In the 
height of irresponsibility, the Forest Service is moving forward with plans to log some of the state's 
last old growth forests despite numerous law violations and the well documented threats 
theseprojects pose to water quality and wildlife. And because the logging rider suspended 
environmental laws, citizens are almost powerless to halt the onslaught.</p>
<p>Congress has left intact this devastating law. Now, only President Clinton can save California's 
forests by cancelling these reckless timber sales. Conservationists have documented twenty logging 
rider timber sales in California containing old growth that will be offered for sale in the coming 
months. If the President does not act immediately to prevent this needless destruction, the ruination 
of some of the state's most precious Ancient Forests will be his legacy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Paul Spitler, Western Ancient Forest Campaign</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>It's a most likely location for a graveyard, between a nightclub and a couple of restaurants, across 
the street from an ultra modern baseball park, smack in the middle of this booming downtown area 
of Cleveland.But the Erie Street graveyard has been in use for most of Cleveland's 200 years and 
was still in use until recently. And quite a few sports fans drawn to Jacobs Field from the suburbs 
spend a few minutes walking among the gravestones and reading what they tell of the people who 
lived and died in this town.</p>
<p>Renate and I passed by on our way to our Habitat II-Revisited/Endangered Spaces Exhibition (the 
United Nation's Second Conference on Human Settlements) located at the Frank J. Lausche State 
Building. And with this exhibition in mind, I came to realize that this graveyard tells much of the 
history of one particular human settlement on the mouth of the Cuyahoga River and, perhaps even 
more forcefully, how the quality of human life has changed for Clevelanders over the past 200 
years.In the 18th, 19th and even the 20th centuries, life in Cleveland was, for most people, short 
and filled with uncertainty. One cannot help but notice the profusion of smaller gravestones 
scattered about the cemetery, each marking the grave of a child who succumbed to some infection 
or other illness.Many of the graves here are filled with the remains of young women who died in 
childbirth. Most of those buried here did not live to see old age. Their lives were cut short by 
sickness or accidents. One tombstone marks the grave of a man who lost his life while working on 
Lake Erie.</p>
<p>Of course, people are still losing their lives on Lake Erie, or to sickness. And maternal mortality 
remains a serious problem in many places. But such premature deaths are no longer commonplace 
in this part of the world. We no longer consider it a special blessing when our children survive into 
adolescence. The death of a young mother is a tragic rarity, not a commonplace occurrence. In this 
prosperous and happy human settlement called Cleveland, at least, life has changed for the better. 
It is longer, more secure, more healthy. And we have every reason to hope that because of 
information obtained from Habitat II-Revisited/Endangered Spaces, quality of life in the upcoming 
21st Century will continue to improve, not only for the people of Cleveland but for people 
everywhere. </p>

<title>MILL CREEK RESTORATION PROJECT</title>

<h1 align=center>MILL CREEK RESTORATION 
PROJECT</h1>
<p>Under Rivers Unlimited's leadership, a Watershed Steering Committee was formed and an 
Intergovernmental Agreement has been signed by 17 cities, townships, and counties in Mill Creek's 
watershed. These communities have committed to develop and support a restoration strategy for 
Mill Creek, which includes improved water quality and protection of aquatic life, environmentally 
sound flood damage limitation, remediation of sources of pollution, expansion of public recreational 
access to the creek, and involvement of the public in improvement activities.</p>
<p><br>
In January of 1994 Rivers Unlimited was awarded $360,000 through an industrial pollution 
settlement. This allowed us to form the Mill Creek Restoration Project, which serves to educate 
students in the Cincinnati area about water quality monitoring. Executive Robin Corathers has 
introduced 500 students 12 schools in 6 districts to the fascinations of water quality sampling and 
analysis. We are also been organizing ten of the watershed communities to work toward reclaiing 
Mill Creek.</p>

<title>Affinity -  How to be a Wise Herbal Shopper</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">How to be a Wise Herbal Shopper</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">Greetings! A few thoughts on the &quot;herbal
correctness&quot; of the times. Put aside the limitations of
herbs as folklore, or a witches brew. Herbs are beginning to hit
mainstream America. Look about and see the &quot;gingko-memory
revitalizing herb&quot; packaged right next to the ex-lax on the
shelves of your neighborhood drugstore. What is this? I ask...
Really what is this? A band wagon approach to herbal healing.
Anyone can just jump on and market anything natural with a few
legal disclaimers on the bottom of the package and have it ready
for Jane or John Doe USA to consume.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A few things to think about when purchasing
herbs or herbal products. First, who are you buying from?
Specifically, do they know their product? Who are their
suppliers? Do you know that the product you are buying is what
the packaging says it is? How fresh is the product? How was the
product packaged? How was it cultivated? And from where? Is it
pure? Read the fine print on packages. Read the labels,
familiarize yourself with the company that is on that label, or
go to a herbalist you trust and let them guide you. If you do
know anyone who is wildcrafting make sure that they are doing it
ethically. A great organization to refer any questions you may
have about wildcrafting is United Plant Savers. Their principles
are solid, and reliable. Their address is at the end of this
column.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Also when purchasing herbs, do you know what to
look for? Color, scent and freshness are the keys. Ask your
friendly herb provider if they can remove a bit of the product so
you can smell it (do not put your nose in the herb jar, it
discourages freshness). As a novice or a veteran herbal user,
questions are always welcomed at point of purchase, or should be.
See if your herb shop has a herbal reference library available.
Remember that the person selling to you is not allowed to
prescribe herbs as medication, or even to make pointed
recommendations. So take the heat off them and be willing to
research a bit on your own. Hopefully, the books available at
your herbal store will add to the information you have already
gathered. Be clear about what it is you are about to ingest and
what your desired results are. It&#146;s your body, mind and
spirit &#139; so learn all that you can about the herbs you are
going to take. It is important to research a recipe for a
specific treatment in a couple different books to be sure that
you are on the right track.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Remember that when using different parts of a
plants there are different ways to prepare the herb. But that is
the start of another topic! Next time we&#146;ll share input on
preparation of herbs. Information is the key to using herbs
properly. If the person who you are buying from has enough
integrity to say &quot;I don&#146;t know,&quot; honor that and
research a bit on your own. Then share with them what you&#146;ve
discovered. That&#146;s a treat for us, all of us, in our
unquenchable desire to learn from the Green world.</font></p>

<title>affinity - Forests & Species Decline</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Forests &amp; Species Declines
Continue</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">A series of recent reports indicate that
forests continue to shrink, more species are being pushed to the
brink of extinction, and not surprisingly, stronger international
action is needed to stem these declines. World Wildlife Fund
released a decade-long mapping project that indicates only about
6 percent of the world&#146;s 13 million square miles of forests
are protected against logging and other development. The U.N.
estimates that between 1980 and 1990 the world lost 13 percent of
its forests to logging, farming, and development. At this pace,
it would take only 76 years to completely eradicate the
world&#146;s natural forests. In the lower 48 states, all but 2
percent of the native forests present around the time of Columbus
have been logged at least once. The report and maps can be viewed
at http://www.panda.org or call (202) 293-4800.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The impact on wildlife from lost habitat,
pollution, and hunting have been severe. The Species Survival
Commission of the World Conservation Union list of threatened
wildlife indicates species continue to decline at an increasing
pace. The list was recently updated using revised criteria for
determining the risk of extinction, and the news is grim: 1,096
mammals, nearly one-fourth of all known species, are considered
threatened, as are 1,108 birds, more than 11 percent of the
world&#146;s bird species. The number of mammals listed as
critically endangered (169), endangered (315) or vulnerable (612)
is startling, since this is the first time that the organization,
formerly known as the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature, has fully assessed the status of each of the 4,630 or so
species in the world&#146;s 26 orders of mammals. In the past
only birds, which number 9,670 species, have been evaluated on a
comprehensive global scale. The three risk categories are based
in large part on the rate of a species&#146; population decline
over the last 10 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Russell Mittermier, a primate expert who is
president of Conservation International in Washington, called the
report &quot;indisputable proof that warnings about global
biological loss haven&#146;t been exaggerated.&quot; More than
500 scientists contributed to the evaluations, which identify
5,205 animals of all kinds as threatened. The document lists 253
reptile, 124 amphibian and 734 fish species as being at risk of
extinction, but it emphasizes that thousands of species in those
taxonomic groups have not been assessed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, a report entitled &quot;Corporate
Power, Corruption and the Destruction of the World&#146;s
Forests&quot; by Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), a
London and Washington, D.C. based group, says only a new
legally-binding global accord could curb the &quot;systematic,
unchecked plunder&quot; of forests by logging multinationals. The
report highlights the activities of 15 of the world&#146;s
leading timber and paper groups, including Weyerhaeuser and
Georgia-Pacific. &quot;The handful of companies controlling the
timber trade have the economic and political might to log
wherever they want. Once forests are exhausted in one region,
companies simply move elsewhere,&quot; says Juliette Williams
EIA&#146;s forest campaigner. A copy of the report is available
from EIA, 15 Bowling Green Lane, London, EC1R 0BD, fax +44 171
490 0436. Or contact Steve Holmer, Campaign Coordinator, Western

<title>affinity - Cow, Water and Cryptosporidium</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Cow, Water and Cryptosporidium</font></h2>

<h5 align="center"><font size="2">by Aaron Lehmer</font></h5>

<p><font size="2">Despite the harsh antiregulatory climate in
Washington, the EPA has embarked on a large-scale project to set
safety standards for cryptosporidium, a potentially deadly
waterborne microbe. In Milwaukee in 1993, a crypto outbreak
caused more than 100 deaths and an estimated 403,000 illnesses.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">While healthy individuals may experience severe
diarrhea and related symptoms for weeks, cryptosporidium
infections can prove fatal for people with compromised immune
systems, such as people with AIDS, transplant patients and
individuals undergoing chemotherapy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">EPA Administrator Carol Browner has stated that
the agency&#146;s new monitoring effort will &quot;result in more
information than ever about drinking water contaminants that have
thus far defied treatment.&quot; But Browner&#146;s statement
largely ignores what may be the largest culprit lurking in the
background - the livestock industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Though it is rarely emphasized, a primary
crypto source is animal waste from cattle production near or
within public watersheds. (Other sources include infectious human
fecal matter deposited in lakes and streams or treated sewage
dumped into public waterways. Waste from calves and human babies
tends to be the most infectious crypto source).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">As early as the 1970s, EPA scientists declared
feedlot wastes to be as much as several hundred times more
concentrated than raw domestic sewage, with soaring rates of
ammonia, nitrates, bacteria and other microbial contaminants.
Frances Moore Lappe, in her landmark book Diet for a Small
Planet, claimed that animal wastes generate more than 10 times
the water pollution produced by human beings.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Crypto is an incredibly resilient microbe,
sometimes evading even the most advanced treatment processes. In
Milwaukee, where scientists linked treatment facilities were
apparently in full compliance with the Clean Water Act, said EPA
toxicologist Bruce Macler.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Massive developments occurring throughout the
animal agriculture industry constitute and ever-expanding threat
to public water supplies. The days of cattle happily grazing in
pastures are all but gone. Today, the vast majority of cattle
spend their lives in crowded industrial feedlots, where they are
fed high-fat diets to ensure maximum weight gain. Such crowded
conditions create a sanitation and waste-disposal nightmare.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Clean Water Action, a 700,000-strong
safe-drinking-water coalition, is urging a ban or sharp
restrictions on grazing around public watersheds. Such a move
would force the cattle industry to internalize some costs (for
cleanup, monitoring and safety research) currently borne by the
public.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">But implementing new restrictions will be a
difficult task - cattle ranchers and animal producers have
enormous political clout, especially at the state levels. Nothing
short of a wholesale downsizing of the animal agriculture
industry is required to ensure a sustainable and healthy
environment. There are not enough resources to accommodate an
ever-expanding nation of meat-eaters, nor are there enough
watersheds or pastures to absorb an ever-expanding reservoir of
animal waste. The U.S. needs a commitment to serious prevention,
not just crisis management.</font></p>

<h3 align=center>Perry County Fights Chemical Sludge</h3>
<p>In the Fall of 1990 Peabody Coal Company locked their gates, taking with them over 500 jobs in 
Perry County, a mid-size Appalachian county in Southeastern Ohio. Citizens of Perry County felt 
they had been through the worst of what the mine closure could do to their community, until the 
mine gates were reopened for reclamation. In 1992, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 
(OEPA) approved Mead Paper Company to distribute what local residents fear was dioxin-laden 
paper by-product waste over former Peabody land now owned by Ohio Mine Reclamation.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1994, Mead's contract expired and the OEPA approved the City of Lancaster, 
Ohio (Fairfield County) to dump Bio-Gro, a mixture of wastewater sludge and lime, on the 
property. In 1996, the City of Lancaster contracted with the City of Columbus to allow them to 
dump on the property under their OEPA approval. The County Health Department was sent a 
copy of the approval; however, no input from Perry County was pursued.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year residents within two miles of the site complained of headaches, nausea and 
a strong odor that burned their eyes. The OEPA blamed the complaints on a sewer leak in the City 
of New Lexington which has not been found. </p>
<p>The Perry County Commissioners uncovered the OEPA Approval which stated that if the dumping 
was a nuisance it would be terminated. The Commissioners immediately passed a resolution that a 
nuisance existed to the residents and demanded the approval be withdrawn. The OEPA defended 
the sludge, maintaining it was not a nuisance in their terms, and the County had no authority to halt 
the dumping.</p>
<p>&quot;We questioned the OEPA on whether they exist to protect the citizens well-being, or if they 
existed to promote products like Bio-Gro,&quot; stated Commissioner President Larry Householder. 
Previously, Perry County sent a resolution to Governor Voinovich denouncing low level radioactive 
waste being brought into Ohio. &quot;We know that Southeastern Ohio will be a prime candidate for this 
waste. Counties should be granted the authority on what by-products are permissible within it's 
borders, not some agency outside the county. Whenever another community produces something 
they don't want in their backyard, they try to put it in ours,&quot; concluded Householder.</p>
<p>As it now stands the OEPA feels that the sludge is a viable source to promote growth, it is not a 
nuisance to them and the County has no authority to halt its use. The dumping will continue, and so 
the citizens of Perry County will continue to fight to stop it.</p>
<p>For more information contact Larry Householder at (614) 342-7055.</p>

<h2 align=center>Write-in Nader for President</h2>
<p>On September 6 the Committee to Draft Ralph Nader for President was informed that the petition 
drive to place Nader on the ballot in Ohio was short 373 valid signatures. A search for signatures 
has not turned up enough errors to anticipate a successful challenge, although it has revealed 
patterns of exclusionary practices and policies and no stone will be left unturned. As this paper 
goes to press the committee is filing an application for a write-in candidacy for Ralph Nader for 
President and Winona LaDuke for vice president in Ohio.</p>
<p>On August 29, 1996 Nader announced his choice of running mate, Native American and 
environmental activist, Winona LaDuke. LaDuke, a 37 year-old graduate of Harvard University, is 
an Ojibwe activist from the White Earth Reservation in Northern Minnesota. She is the founder of 
the White Earth Land Recovery Project, the Indigenous Women&#185;s Network and serves on the 
GreenPeace USA Board of Directors. In 1995, Time Magazine nominated Winona LaDuke as one 
of &quot;50 leaders for the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nader/LaDuke candidacy is on the ballot in at least 20 states and write-in campaigns will be 
conducted in approximately 20 others. Write-in campaigns are famous for never getting more than 
1% of the vote. It may be that there has never been a serious attempt to teach voters how to cast 
write-in votes. It may also be that no president has pissed off so many voters at the same time that 
such an excellent candidate was willing to run. That we were extremely close to qualifying means 
that we did reach a critical mass as a result of the petition drive.Since filing signatures on August 22, 
we have been flooded with calls from people who want to know how they can become involved in 
the next phase. Some of them have said this is a good chance to see how many votes a really good 
candidate with a grassroots base of committed activists can generate.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things that we can still do to make a difference in this election year. Some of 
them are just getting underway. Sooner or later the grassroots will learn how to get its candidates 
elected without the corporate money, the sold out media and the permission of the election 
establishment at the local, state and federal levels. When we do it will be because we have all 
pitched in when an opportunity like this came up. Remember that Jack (of Beanstalk fame) was not 
a member of the privileged class, nor was he particularly experienced or educated or even overly 
endowed with commonsense. Jack possesed the one important quality that counts when presented 
with an extraordinary opportunity. The courage to act without undue hesitation.</p>
<p>Please, if you think it is time to act, call Daryl Davis at 216-236-5801 or e-mail daryl@igc.apc.org</p>

<h2 align=center>Sierra Club Keeps Pressure on Shell</h2>
<p>Nov. 10, 1996 will mark the one year anniversary of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa by the 
Nigerian military government. Saro-Wiwa's campaign against the pollution caused by Shell Oil in 
his community of Ogoniland caused a widespread uprising against Shell and its collusive relationship 
with the military regime which governs the country.</p>
<p>In the wake of the execution, the Sierra Club Board of Directors voted to support a boycott of 
Shell Oil and an embargo of Nigeria. &quot;It's been a year now and no real sanctions have been 
imposed against Nigeria and Shell has not cleaned up its mess,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Human Rights 
and Environment Campaign director for the Sierra Club. To mark the anniversary of Saro-Wiwa's 
death and to keep the pressure on Shell and Nigeria, Sierra Club members and other environmental 
and human rights activists will be holding vigils and protests across the country this fall, peaking on 
Nov. 10.</p>
<p>Saro-Wiwa's brother, Dr. Owens Wiwa, now exiled from Nigeria, is touring the United States 
speaking out against the continuing exploitation of his native Ogoniland. &quot;We have always had a 
bond with our environment,&quot; he said this September in Madison, Wis. &quot;We saw our resources 
being taken away and received nothing in return. People were dying from the pollution. We must 
bring dignity back to our land.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>What you can do:</strong></p>
<p>&#128; Boycott Shell Oil. Contact the president of Shell Oil Company, Philip J. Carroll, P.O. Box 
2463, Houston, TX 77252; (800) 248-4257; fax (713) 241-4044. Tell him you will be boycotting 
Shell's products until they clean up their environmental mess in Nigeria and compensate the Ogoni 
people for past damages.</p>
<p>&#128; You can also circulate a petition supporting the boycott. Copies of the petitions can be found on 
the Sierra Club's Web site at http://www.sierraclub.org, or by calling Stephen Mills

<title>Affinity -Changing Climate Threatens Whales</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Changing Climate Threatens
Whales</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">Aberdeen, Scotland - Whales and dolphins -even
those protected from the harpoon - face new threats in the modern
world.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Scientific research warns of an impending
environmental crisis for marine wildlife as the combined
onslaught of pollution, overfishing, ozone depletion and now, for
the first time, climate change threatens habitat and food supply.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) report - written by more than 2,000 scientists, approved
by the United Nations and endorsed by numerous governments - has
declared that the Earth is heating up and humans are to blame.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The IPCC predicts an average global temperature
increase of 1.5 to 4.0 C (34.7 to 39.2 F) during the next century
- a rate unprecedented in the last 10,000 years. Sea levels will
rise 15 to 95 cm (5.9 to 37.4 inches).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Climate change fundamentally will alter the
underwater world. Shifting patterns of food availability and
diminishing habitat will compound the effects of increasing
levels of pollution and the proliferation of toxic algae blooms.
Unfavorable environmental conditions will foster cetacean
disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">THE PROBLEMS</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&#128; ICE-CAP MELT - As global warming chips
away at the poles&#146; protective covering, it drastically
alters two of the last marine mammal refuges in the world.
Scientists anticipate that Arctic ice coverage will decrease by
one-third, extending the ice-free season from 41 to 100 days. Low
ice levels will open the Northwest Passage (which joins the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans above Canada) and the northern seas
route above Russia and Siberia for much of the year, leaving the
Arctic Ocean&#146;s coastline vulnerable to exploitation by
shipping and extraction industries. Receding Antarctic ice will
shrink krill habitat and populations - the backbone of the
ecosystem and the exclusive food supply for many whale species.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">OZONE DEPLETION - UV-B radiation pouring
        through the polar ozone holes will reduce healthy growth
        of phytoplankton - microscopic food for marine life - by
        as much as 20 percent.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">INCREASE IN POLLUTION - The effect of
        existing pollution levels may intensify as rising sea
        levels increase coastal rainfall and manipulate
        circulation patterns. Surface runoff from heavy rains
        will drag greater quantities of nutrients,
        organochlorines and heavy metals into rivers. Overwashed
        waste sites and sewers will leach toxins, sewage,
        bacteria and viruses into the seas. And the rising ocean
        level will destroy wetlands - Earth&#146;s natural
        water-filtering system.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">INCREASE OF TOXIC ALGAE BLOOMS- Warmer
        water temperatures&nbsp;and nutrient loads will encourage
        red tides - phytoplankton population explosions that
        promote bacterial growth, suffocate fish and potentially
        poison shellfish.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">INCREASE IN DISEASE - Climate change
        threatens to foster novel and existing diseases. New
        viruses, bacteria and parasites will drift to coastal
        areas and tropical viruses will spread northward to areas
        without natural resistance.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">THE OCEAN&#146;S HEART STOPS - Ocean
        currents determine both the amount and distribution of
        cetacean food supply. Ice-cap recession threatens the
        precise balance established over thousands of years as
        water moves from the surface to the sea floor. The entire
        physical system of the marine environment, upon which all
        marine life depends, will change. Scientists expect
        rising cetacean mortalities.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2">In light of these disturbing findings, the
International Whaling Commission must ensure that environmental
upheaval enters the equation when planning the
organization&#146;s program of work for cetacean preservation.</font></p>

<title>Affinity - Breasticides</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Breasticides</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">In late July, San Francisco newspapers flashed
the grim news that the Bay Area had recorded the world&#146;s
highest incidence of female breast cancer. While county health
professionals were at a loss to explain the alarming report, the
local press already had identified a likely culprit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">On June 9, San Francisco Examiner environmental
writer Jane Kay reported that over the last 10 years, the city
had dumped &quot;at least 10,000 pounds and 775 gallons of
powerful pesticides on parks and golf courses.&quot; Many common
pesticides - including endosulfan dieldrin, toxaphene and
chlordane - are known to disrupt the function of the hormone
estrogen and have been linked to breast cancer and the
malformation of male sex organs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">San Francisco uses as many as 32 different
brands of chemicals, including Banvel, Roundup, Ronstar, Trimec,
Turf Supreme and Surflan (all containing 2,4-D, glyphosate,
dicamba and MCPP), Fore, Danconil, Bayleton and Scott&#146;s
Proturf (containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb and PCNB).</font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to a report in the June issue of
Science, pesticides linked to breast cancer and male birth
defects can become more potent when combined with other
pesticides. Tulane University researcher John A. McLachlan
explained that a pesticide&#146;s effects might seem
&quot;inconsequential&quot; when tested alone, but when tested in
combination with other pesticides, their potency can rise
&quot;500- to 1,000-fold.&quot; Instead of one plus one equals
two,&quot; McLachlan observed, &quot;we found, in some cases,
that one plus one equals 1,000.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Lynn Goldman, head of the EPA&#146;s Office of
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, called the report
&quot;astounding,&quot; adding that &quot;the policy implications
are enormous about how we screen for estrogen effects.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Meanwhile, the May issue of the American
Journal of Industrial Medicine reported that golf course
superintendents - individuals who are routinely exposed to common
chemical pesticides and herbicides - showed &quot;significantly
higher&quot; death rates from brain cancer, prostate cancer and
non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There&#146;s no reason to use any toxic
chemical inside a park,&quot; Pesticide Education Center founder
Marion Moses told the Examiner. &quot;Product warning labels...
say: &#145;Wait until it&#146;s dry, then your children can play
on the lawn.&#146; But that&#146;s based on no science
whatsoever. I don&#146;t think children should be exposed to any
avoidable toxic.&quot; Pesticide Watch, a Bay Area environmental
group, has called for a 50 percent reduction in the city&#146;s
use of dangerous chemicals.</font></p>

<h3 align=center>Dishonorable Discharge</h3>
<h4 align=center>Ohio Ranks 7th in the Nation for Toxics to Waterways</h4>
<h6 align=center>By Ohio Public Interest Research Group</h6>
<p>Most Ohio citizens would be surprised to learn that scores of businesses and facilities across the 
state legally dump tons of toxic chemicals into the state's rivers, streams, lakes and bays. Many of 
these same polluters flush millions more pounds of toxic substances down the drain to sewage 
treatment plants that taxpayers pay tooperate and maintain. None of the toxic chemicals sent to 
publicly financed sewage treatment systems are reported as pollution by the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), even though a great deal of the toxic load eventually finds its way to 
Ohio streams and rivers.</p>
<p>The citizens of Ohio have a right to know about any pollution to their water, air or land that may 
pose a risk to human health or the environment. That is why Ohio Public Interest Research Group 
(PIRG) and Environmental Working Group released a report containing first ever river-by-river 
rankings of toxic pollution to Ohio waterways. This report is based on industry generated data and 
contains state rankings and national totals for toxic chemicals released into waterways and sewers. 
It answers the questions of why so many of Ohio's rivers are unsafe to swim or fish in.</p>
<p>Factories and other industrial facilities dumped more than 22.8 million pounds of toxic substances 
directly into Ohio's waters between 1990 and 1994, according to a new analysis of the federal 
Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Ohio ranked 7th among the states in toxic water pollution 
reported over those five years. In addition, almost 103 million pounds of toxic materials were 
flushed to sewage treatment plants in Ohio from 1990 through 1994, 6th in the nation. Because of 
weaknesses and loopholes in federal pollution laws, most, if not all of these toxic discharges are 
perfectly legal.</p>
<p>As large as they are, these figures substantiallyunderestimate toxic releases to waters and the 
environment because the TRI requires reporting of only about 340 of the 73,000 chemicals in 
commerce. The TRI also exempts certain industries from reporting including utilities, sewage 
treatment plants, municipal incinerators and manufacturing facilities with fewer than ten employees.</p>
<p>The Ohio River received the greatest amount of toxic water pollution in Ohio from 1990-1994, a 
total of 16,000 pounds, followed by the Cuyahoga River, the Black River and the Scioto River 
(see chart #1). The ten most polluted waterways in Ohio received 21,400,000 pounds of toxic 
pollution between 1990 and 1994, 94.0% of the total in the State.</p>
<p>The top three facilities reporting the most toxic pollution of Ohio's waters over this period were 
Elkem Metals Company in Marietta, which dumped 13,800,000 pounds of toxic chemicals, 
followed by LTV Steel Company, Inc., and Monsanto Company in the towns of Cleveland, and 
Addyston, respectively (see chart #2 on page 16). The toxic chemicals dumped in the greatest 
amounts were ammonia, a total of 18,300,000 pounds, followed by ethylene glycol and methanol. </p>
<p>Monsanto Company dumped the most carcinogens into Ohio's waters, a total of 106,000 pounds, 
follwed by AK Steel Corporation and Du Pont. The Ohio River received the greatest amount of 
cancer-causing toxic chemicals in Ohio, a total of 106,000 pounds, followed by Dick's Creek and 
the Scioto River.</p>
<p>Elkem Metals Company dumped the greatest amount of persistent toxic metals in Ohio's waters, a 
total of 540,000 pounds, followed by AK Steel Corporation and USS/Kobe Steel Company. The 
Ohio River received the greatest amount of persistent toxic metals, a total of 610,000 pounds, 
followed by Dick's creek and the Black River.Armco Inc. Doyer Operations dumped the greatest 
amount of toxic chemicals that cause reproductive damage or birth defects into Ohio's waters, a 
total of 45,000 pounds, followed by Hobart Brothers Company and Ford Motor Company. The 
Tuscarawas River recieved the greatest amount of toxic chemicals that cause reproductive damage 
or birth defects, a total of 49,000 pounds, followed by Morgan's Ditch and the Schoewe Ditch.</p>
<p>These discharges to Ohio's waters include only those wastes released by companies physically 
located in Ohio. Many waterways receive additional pollution from sources outside of the state. 
Americans have a right to know about any use, transport or release of toxic substance in their 
communities that might pose a risk to human health or the environment. Required reporting under 
the TRI provides only a small portion of this information. Much more complete reporting is needed. 
Americans also have a right to know about toxic chemicals in the products they buy that may pose 
a risk to them and their children.</p>
<p>Data is available for every region of Ohio. For information specific to your region call (216) 
791-1116, (216) 791-3700 or (614) 421-5815. Ohio PIRG is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
environmental and consumer watchdog organization with citizens and student members across the 
state.</p>

<title>Affinity - Big Mountain</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h2 align=center>Help Save Big Mountain</h2>
<p>Today, there are about 1,000 Dineh (Navajo) elders and their families resisting U.S. government 
efforts to forcibly remove them from their ancestral homeland in Big Mountain, Arizona. The reason 
behind the relocation: an estimated 22 billion tons of coal, which Peabody Coal is eagerly seeking 
to stripmine.</p>
<p>The land has been jointly occupied for centuries by the Hopi and Dineh people, who had peaceable 
co-owned the land until the 1950's, when the Atomic Energy Commission and private industry 
interests began surveying the land for mineral wealth and discovered vast reserves of surface coal. 
At that time, Peabody Coal Board Member John Boyden was dispatched to reconstitute the 
defunct Hopi Tribal Council.</p>
<p>The Hopi Tribal Council (HTC) is a puppet government first established by the U.S. in 1934 when 
a new law required tribes to hold &quot;elections&quot; and form governments. The Hopi people already had 
a governing council, one of the oldest continuously functioning governments on the continent, but 
the U.S. government refused to recognize it. Boyden organized an &quot;election&quot; which the majority of 
the Hopi people boycotted. The &quot;elected&quot; council became the body authorized to enter into 
contracts with private interests such as Peabody Coal.</p>
<p>In 1974, the Congress passed PL 93-531 which mandated that all Navajo living on the Hopi side 
of the line, and all Hopi on the Navajo side, had to relocate. The relocation law authorized the 
largest forced removal of a people from their homes since the Japanese-American incarceration 
during World War II.The Dineh people have been steadfast in their resistance to this relocation 
law. </p>
<p>The Dineh people have occupied the land for centuries, and believe that the Creator placed them 
there to caretake the land between the four sacred mountains. If they are forced to leave this land, 
their culture, religion, the very fabric of their being will be forever destroyed. As one resister has 
said, &quot;In our language, there is no word for relocation. To relocate is to disappear and never be 
seen again.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 1974, about 7,000 people have been removed from their ancestral homelands. Many have 
been moved to cities on the edge of the reservation. After living a traditional life of sheepherding on 
vast expanses of land, speaking only the Dineh language, and maintaining their traditional ways, 
relocation to city life has destroyed the spirits of many of the relocates. While some are said to have 
died from &quot;broken hearts,&quot; many have been poisoned by having been moved to relocation districts 
served by water contaminated by radioactive waste prouced by nearby uranium mines. Relocation, 
at a cost of over a billion dollars to the American public, has proved a complete failure.</p>
<p>Those who have remained, many of these elder woman sheepherders and weavers, have been 
subject to intense harassment and intimidation by the HTC and the federal government agents 
pressuring them to relocate. Harassment includes the impoundment of their sheep, on which they 
rely for subsistence, poisoning of the wells from which they get their water, and low overflights by 
federal planes designed to terrorize the aging resisters.</p>
<p>About 1,000 resisters remain on the land, continuing to live in their traditional ways and to maintain 
their religious beliefs. In 1991, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a case called 
Manybeads v. U.S. heard the resisters' argument that forcing them to leave their ancestral lands 
would constitute a violation of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion. The 
Court of Appeals appointed a federal magistrate to mediate among the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribal 
Council, U.S. government and the resisters themselves. The parties were encouraged to try to 
reach a negotiated settlement to the twenty year dispute. </p>
<p>The HTC has recently set out their terms for settlement. These require that the Navajo Nation buy 
and give to the HTC 400,000 acres of prime ranchland located near Flagstaff, Arizona. In 
exchange, the HTC is offering the Navajo families 75 year leases to remain on the land as tenants, 
under the jurisdiction of the Hopi Tribe. Their tenancy could be terminated for a violation of the 
lease agreement or for other enumerated reasons. The resisters would be limited to 25 sheep per 
family (it has been estimated that a family which relies on sheepherding for their livelihood, as the 
Dineh do, need at least 100 head of sheep to survive).</p>
<p>The resisting communities have met separately to discuss the lease proposal and have agreed that a 
lease is unacceptable. As one resisting community, the Dine Bikeya Committee of Teesto, has 
stated, the terms of the agreement must provide for a land exchange. Tenancy under the jurisdiction 
of the HTC is simply unacceptable, based on the harassment the resisters have been subject to 
over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>All the problems at Big Mountain are a creation of private industry interests. For Peabody Coal Big 
Mountain means money. But Peabody Coal means death for the land and the traditional peoples 
living there. Since Peabody moved in sacred springs have gone dry, sacred sites have been 
destroyed, wells have run dry and grass lands have been weakened and eroded. And because they 
have been feeding in a location where soils and plants have a high level of selenium (an effect of 
coal mining) the sheep on which the people depend are suffering from selenium poisoning, causing 
blindness in the sheep and births of deformed and dead lambs. The people of Big Mountain NEED 
YOUR HELP!</p>

taking with them money and food to help the people of Big Mountain. If you want to donate

<h3 align=center>Hempfields</h3>
<p>Hemp is the strongest, most versatile and evolved plant on Earth and is organically grown. George 
Washington grew hemp, Betsy Ross crafted the first American flag out of hemp and Ben Franklin 
opened a hemp paper mill so that America would not be dependent upon British sources of paper.<br>
Hemp has been know to humankind for thousands of years. Hemp has been used for food, fuel, 
clothing, medicine and much more. The use of hemp products have many environmentally and 
economic benefits. Hemp even has the potential to replace more than three-quarters of the nation&#185;s 
fiber needs currently served by logging, and could make the petro-chemical industry virtually 
obsolete.</p>
<p>Hemp is known as our planet&#185;s most prolific plant. It grows more in one season and produces 
more biomass than any other plant. It has the potential to make the U.S. energy independent. 
Because it is an annual plant that breaks down naturally, it fits in well with the many environmental 
cycles and contributes greatly to the CO2, the oxygen balance that all species need to survive.</p>
<p>Hemp could replace 70 percent of the wood-pulp-based paper produced in this country. It is one 
of the first crops ever cultivated (grown since about 8,000 B.C.), is the strongest, most rot-resistant 
natural fiber known, and up until the 1880s, provided 80 percent of all paper. The 1850 U.S. 
Census reported that there were 8,237 hemp farms with over 2,000 acres under cultivation. 
Botanists tell us that hemp also is acomplete protein with eight essential amino acids. The seeds can 
be sprouted or made into a tofu-type curd or margarine.</p>
<p>Helping to increase awareness about hemp and the products that can be derived from this plant is 
Cleveland&#185;s first hemp store HEMPFIELDS. Open for a year now (Happy Birthday Hempfields), 
Hempfields sells an array of hemp products including clothes (jeans, dresses, lingerie), Adidas 
shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, baseball caps, backpacks, food, etc. Hempfields is committed to 
promoting hemp products and making a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Hempfields also has excellent information concerning hemp and they are willing to share their 
knowledge of this important plant. Hempfields is currently seeking a Goddess partner/investor to 
expand this fast growing environmentally friendly business with limitless potential.</p>

<h2 align=center>The Herbal Sage</h2>
<p>United Plant Savers (UPS) is dedicated to replanting endangered and threatened medicinal plants. 
UPS is a newly founded, non-profit organization dedicated to saving endangered and threatened 
medicinal plants. An organization for herbalists and people who love plants, their purpose is to 
ensure the future of our rich diversity of medicinal plants.Vast numbers of plants have been and 
continue to be taken and indiscriminate wildharvesting, deforestation and urbanization have 
devastated many areas of former abundance. Perhaps even more disturbing, native North 
American medicinal plants are being exported to meet the demand in other countries where wild 
plants have already been gravely depleted. UPS was formed in a spirit of hope, as a group of 
herbalists committed to protecting and replanting threatened species and to raise public awareness 
of the plight of our wild medicinal plants.</p>
<p>Fortunately,&#160;The Herbal Sage (located in the Cleveland Shop at 11606 Detroit Ave., Lakewood) 
only sells herbs that can be traced back to the grower. They are accountable for how and where 
the herbs are grown, and assure high quality and chemical-free herbs. The Herbal Sage is 
committed to selling herbs that will not endanger the plant.</p>
<p>Many herbs have been so over-picked that they are now endangered. For example, Golden Seal 
has been picked almost to the point of extinction due to over harvesting of the plant in its natural 
habitat. The Herbal Sage will special order herbs in amounts less than 1#. In the spring, The Herbal 
Sage sells organic plants from the Herbal Sage farm near Athens, Ohio. You can buy herbs dried, 
tinctures, extracts and aroma therapy essential oils.</p>
<p>The Herbal Sage will be conducted workshop series throughout Cleveland expressing the medicinal 
values of herbs. For example, slippery elm bark is great for soothing sore throats, red raspberry 
leaf strengthens womens reproductive systems and cat nip tea soothes the stomach and helps 
colicky babies. Handouts are available at The Herbal Sage. Also, ask for their teas at your favorite 
coffee house.</p>
<p>The Herbal Sage is in the Cleveland Shop which sells vintage clothing and era costume rental since 
1979. For more information call (216) 228-9725.</p>

<title>Affinity - wolves</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<h2 align=center><strong>Wolf Recovery</strong></h2>
<p align=left>Wolves flourished in Colorado through the early 1900's, although they were under increasing 
pressure as their habitat was expropriated for livestock. By the late 1800s, most of the native 
ungulates (buffalo, elk and deer) that were the primary prey of wolves had been wiped-out by 
market hunters and settlers; wolves did what they had to to survive -- they turned to domestic 
livestock. Bounties on wolf and coyote pelts were set at fifty cents/ in 1869, and increased to 
nearly two dollars by the turn of the century. However, the bounty laws failed to exterminate 
wolves because bounty hunters let young wolves live so that they'd have more wolves to kill in 
subsequent years, and because wolves soon became savvy to the ways of the wolfers. Ultimately, it 
took the intervention of the federal government on the behalf of ranchers to wipe-out wolves. The 
feds hired hundreds of men with the specific task of killing wolves and sent them west. These 
federal employees had no economic incentive to let any wolves live. They used traps, guns, shovels 
(to dig pups out of their dens and smash them) and they placed thousands of poisoned carcasses all 
over the place. The toll on &quot;non-target&quot; animals from poison was, of course, very high. Colorado's 
last wild wolf was killed in 1945 in the South San Juan Wilderness, near theborder of New 
Mexico.</p>
<p align=left>Sinapu, a grassroots group dedicated to the recovery of the grey wolf in Colorado, recently won 
their campaign to get Congress to appropriate money to the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS) to 
study the feasibility of returning wolves to the Southern Rockies. The study which concluded that 
Colorado has room for over 1000 wolves, and that 70% of the state's residents want wolves back. 
Unfortunately, the FWS currently refuses to include Colorado in a wolf recovery plan because the 
state's wildlife commission has an official policy renouncing wolf and grizzly recovery. It comes as 
know surprise that four of the eight commissioners are ranchers. Likewise, the FWS appears 
anxious to be done with the whole wolf recovery program.Nearly a year after Sinapu blew the lid 
off of a secret plan to strip gray wolves of their protections under the Endangered Species Act, the 
plan still lurks in the active files of FWS bureaucrats, ready to be molded into public policy. The 
eleven page plan, called A Comprehensive Recovery Strategy for the Gray Wolf in the Contiguous 
48 States, spells doom for the slowly recovering populations of wolves in the lower 48, and 
undermines the chances for wolves to reoccupy more of their ancestral range.Although supposedly 
a scientific document -- the esteemed Dr. L. David Mech has his name emblazoned on the front 
cover -- the strategy is blatantly political in nature. Seeking to wash their hands of the 
controversy-laden responsibility for restoring large carnivores and protecting their habitat, the 
&quot;biologists&quot; and bureaucrats who crafted the strategy came up with a brilliant idea. They decided to 
expand the current recovery plans for Canis lupis that include all of the wolf's former range, but 
mandate that the wolf be de-listed once the current recovery goals are met. For the western U.S., 
that means that once 30 breeding pairs have established themselves in the Northern Rockies (10 
pairs each in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming for three consecutive years), wolves will no longer 
have federal protection under the ESA anywhere in the West. Given that the FWS refuses to 
protect the habitat of wolves under the present recovery plans, 30 breeding pairs hardly constitutes 
a biologically viable founding population. And the situation in the eastern U.S. ultimately could 
degrade to the same level, except for Minnesota where wolf population has finally reached a 
significant size.</p>
<p align=left>What You Can Do: Sinapu and over thirty other organizations across the country have joined 
forces to oppose the FWS plan -- which is why it has not been proposed as official policy yet. 
Sinapu is now laying the foundation for a scientific and legal strategy to put the FWS back on the 
right course. Write to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (1849 C Street, NW, Washington D.C. 
20012) and urge him to send the strategy (see title above) back to the drawing board. Ask him to 
set the stage for wolf recovery in other areas of the lower 48 that still have abundant habitat and 
prey for wolves -- places such as Colorado, Utah, and the Dakotas. Finally, emphasize that the 
present recovery goals are not adequate because the FWS refuses to designate &quot;critical habitat&quot; for 
wolves.</p>
<p align=left>Rob Edward is the Outreach Coordinator for Sinapu, a group named after the Ute word for 
wolves, which is dedicated to recovery of the gray wolf in Colorado, and to the restoration of the 
wild habitat in which all species flourish. For more information contact Sinapu, Box 3243 Boulder,

<title>Affinity Mad Cow Disease</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h2 align=center>The U.S. &quot;Mad Cow&quot; Cover-up</h2>
<h5 align=center>by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton</h5>
<p>For seven years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the multi-billion dollar animal livestock industry have cooperated in a PR cover-up of 
huge health risks to U.S. animals and people.</p>
<p>For ten years preceding the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in Britain, the USDA had scientific 
evidence that a version of the disease existed in U.S. cattle. Yet government and industry have 
failed, even at this late date, to ban the practice of &quot;cow cannibalism.&quot; </p>
<p>The practice, prohibited in Britain for years, continues throughout the U.S. It is, in fact, more 
widespread in the U.S. than in any other country. And, as USDA researcher Dr. Mark Robinson 
points out, &quot;the rendering processes employed in the UK and the U.S. are virtually the same.&quot; The 
USDA confirms that, for decades, scrapie-infected sheep have passed through U.S. rendering 
plants.</p>
<p>After a decade of official denials, the British government finally admitted on March 20 that Mad 
Cow Disease&#139;responsible for the deaths of more than 160,000 British cattle&#139;appeared to have 
migrated into humans who ate contaminated beef and now are dying of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease 
(CJD). </p>
<p>The British government's acknowledgment that infected beef was the likely cause of death for ten 
unusually young CJD victims came as grim vindication to Dr. Richard Lacey, a leading British 
microbiologist whose increasingly desperate warnings that the BSE threat was &quot;more serious than 
AIDS&quot; have been officially dismissed for the past six years.</p>
<p>Dr. Lacey predicts that the government's failure to act sooner, combined with the disease's long 
latency period, could produce 5,000-500,000 human deaths per year in Britain sometime after the 
year 2000. </p>
<p>Internal documents and PR plans obtained by PR Watch, via a Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) investigation, show that the U.S. government has sought to protect the economic interests 
of the powerful meat and animal feed industries, while denying the existence of risks to animals and 
humans. </p>
<p>In a 1991 internal PR document, the USDA advised officials to use the technical name for the 
disease. &quot;The term 'Mad Cow Disease' has been detrimental,&quot; the document explained. &quot;We should 
emphasize the need to use the term 'bovine spongiform encephalopathy' or 'BSE'.&quot; </p>
<p>Mad Cow Disease apparently became an epidemic in England as a result of &quot;rendering plants&quot; &#139; 
factories that melt carcasses and waste meat products into protein used in animal feeds, cosmetics, 
nutritional supplements, medicines and other products. As little as one teaspoon of feed derived 
from infected cattle can transmit the disease to another cow.</p>
<p>In the U.S., plants process billions of pounds of protein from dead cows, sheep, pigs, chickens and 
other animals into animal feed each year.</p>
<p>In 1990, the USDA and FDA convened a committee dominated by the cattle, dairy, sheep and 
rendering industries. They launched a PR crisis-management plan that continues today. </p>
<p>The low point came with a press statement on March 30, 1996. With government blessings, the 
meat industry announced a &quot;voluntary ban&quot; on feeding rendered cows to cows. This was simply a 
PR maneuver. A similar voluntary ban failed miserably in Britain. The feeding of ruminant protein to 
cows continues at a rate of millions of pounds per day.</p>
<p>U.S. government and industry representatives still insist that Mad Cow Disease does not exist in the 
U.S. Unfortunately, this party line is based on wishful thinking, rather than scientific proof. </p>
<p>A major U.S. outbreak seems plausible, even likely unless the U.S. government acts swiftly to 
outlaw the practice of feeding rendered&#160;by-product protein to cows.</p>
<p>Has a meat-borne form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease already spread into the U.S. human 
population? Despite denials from the federal government, a number of statistically alarming clusters 
of CJD already have been reported in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the past, victims of CJD have been misdiagnosed with Alzheimers &#173; a disease afflicting some four 
million Americans. The beginnings of a CJD epidemic could, therefore, already be hidden within the 
country's huge population of dementia patients. </p>
<p>The length of time the government and the livestock industry continue their cover-up depends on 
the American news media and the information they provide to the public. Unfortunately, most of the 
media is merely parroting the official government/industry PR assurances that a Mad Cow epidemic 
can not happen here.</p>

<p align=center><strong>Canoe at CAMP HI Along Upper Cuyahoga Scenic River</strong></p>
<p>Camp Hi Canoe Livery is nestled along the Upper Cuyahoga Scenic River giving canoers an 
opportunity to meander through this beautifully wooded portion of the river.&quot;We have quite a few 
customers this time of year that take repeat trips just to see the fall foliage,&quot; said Kendra 
Hazlett-Becker, who helps her father, George Hazlett, run his Hiram-based canoe livery. The 
portion of the river along Camp Hi has been designated as a State Scenic River since June 26, 
1974. It extends 25 miles from Burton Township to the state Route 14 bridge in Streetsboro.&quot;The 
water quality has been quite good for at least the past 20 years,&quot; said Steve Roloson, the Upper 
Cuyahoga River coordinator for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Roloson 
said that low population, sparse development and an abundance of wetlands along the scenic 
portion of the river all contribute to the high water quality.&quot;Anytime you have a lower population 
base, that helps to reduce the effluent that comes into the stream.&quot; Volunteer stream-banking 
projects are also conducted to maintain the water quality. Groups of ODNR's stream team 
volunteers test the water periodically in order to detect changes in the water. Volunteers are trained 
to look for signs of erosion or sources of pollution along the river banks. Camp Hi employees also 
patrol the river. Hazlett-Becker said they go out in canoes periodically to look for changes in the 
river banks and to clean up litter and debris. And for their efforts, Friends of the Crooked River 
recently awarded Camp Hi with a plaque of recognition at the River Day<font size=2> 1</font>996 festivities. Aside 
from stream team efforts a new conservation easement program was implemented by the ODNR in 
order to help preserve the natural state of the Upper Cuyahoga Scenic River.&quot;What the land 
easements do is they allow the land owner to receive some money for keeping the land natural,&quot; 
Roloson said.&quot;The forest zone along the river is some of the best protection for water quality. 
Although they give up the developmental rights of their land, landowners still retain the deed to the 
property but cannot develop the land or do anything that would destroy its natural state. Anyone 
interested in canoeing along the Upper Cuyahoga Scenic River can contact Camp Hi at (330) 
569-7621. They are located at 12274 Abbott Rd. in Hiram, and they will be open weekends 
through October or by reservation during the week. For more information about the land 
easements along the Scenic portion of the river contact Steve Roloson at (330) 527-4184.</p>

<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<h2 align=center>National Rivers Policy Act Gains momentum</h2>
<p>Movement toward developing a National Rivers Policy gained momentum this month when Rivers 
Unlimited founder and President Mike Fremont released a draft policy statement to the national 
rivers community. Fremont stated that the thrust of a national rivers policy would be based on the 
understanding that natural river systems have significant economic value, in addition to the cultural 
and environmental benefits they provide.</p>
<p>Very few rivers in the U. S. today provide more than a fraction of the functions that they 
could--high quality drinking water, a full range of recreational uses, a diverse collection of aquatic 
species, enhanced property values and thus tax base, and attractive park corridors that attract 
tourists, to name a few. Fremont stated that the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, protecting 
only one out of every 350 river miles in the country, is symbolic rather than consequential.</p>
<p>&quot;The prospect of a national rivers policy could inspire support of river protection groups, 
environmental organizations, and many of the millions of Americans who fish,&quot; said Fremont. &quot;A 
national policy would permit Congress to legally recognize the practical values of rivers and enact 
laws accordingly.&quot;</p>

<p><font size="2">Letter from the Editor:</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Welcome to the Early Winter issue of Affinity.
The cover story discusses the issue of deforestation in Ohio.
Unfortunately, after many years the Forest Service has decided,
against public opinion, to log in the Wayne National Forest. Now
is the time to voice your opinion on logging in Ohio&#146;s only
national forest. Call the Buckeye Forest Council - (614) 594-6400
- if you want to get involved in the zero-cut campaign. YOUR HELP
IS NEEDED!</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another issue that needs immediate attention is
air pollution standards. The U.S. EPA recently revised the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulates
and are ready to set strict standards that should help clean up
our air. The U.S. EPA needs to here from citizens now encouraging
them to go through with setting these standards. Letters need to
be sent to Administrator Carol Browner, Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The center-spread focuses on the meat industry
and how they pose a threat to public health and the environment.
The articles also discuss a recently released report that
explains the highly consolidated U.S. meat industry, detailing
the links between industry concentration and chronic bacterial
contamination of the meat supply that continues to claim
thousands of lives every year.</font></p>

<h2 align=center>Why Worry About Urban Sprawl</h2>
<p>Today, more people in Northeast Ohio drive farther to work than ever before. It's no surprise that 
they often find themselves stuck in traffic. While the overall population of the region declined 
between 1970 and 1990, together we drove 67% more miles. Yet, traffic congestion is only a 
symptom of a larger problem -- urban sprawl. The population of Northeast Ohio is not growing, it's 
spreading. And communities throughout the region are paying a price.</p>
<p>As new homes are built on the urban fringe, people move outward. New suburbs grow and the 
central city declines. As this outmigration process continues, the decline spreads outward, 
weakening the economic health of the region as a whole.</p>
<p>Outmigration is expensive&#160;for everyone -- for communities on the metropolitan fringe and for 
neighborhoods in the urban core. As people move out to newly-developing suburbs, these once 
rural communities struggle to:</p>
<p>&#128; Build new schools, roads and sewer systems.</p>
<p>&#128; Raise tax revenues to provide adequate public services.</p>
<p>&#128; And maintain the rural character that made them attractive in the first place.</p>
<p>At the same time, existing urban areas struggle to:</p>
<p>&#128; Retain population and tax base.</p>
<p>&#128; Maintain existing housing, infrastructure and mass transit systems.</p>
<p>&#128; Redevelop &quot;brownfield&quot; industrial sites.</p>
<p>&#128; Support hospitals, schools, religious and cultural institutions.</p>
<p>&#128; Meet increasing social service demands.</p>
<p>If our goal is healthy , affordable communities where everyone can find gainful employment, breathe 
clean air, and drink clean water, then we need to confront the problem of urban sprawl.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO</p>
<p>Each of us can contribute to the solution, both through our personal lifestyle choices and through 
out participation in community affairs. Because most land-use decisions are made at the local level, 
we have a tremendous opportunity to shape the future of our communities. Here are three things 
you can do:</p>
<p>&#128; Become Informed &#139; read local newspapers and learn how communities throughout the region are 
struggling with growth and decline. Obtain a copy of your community's land-use plan and find out 
how your community is changing.</p>
<p>&#128; Get Involved &#139; Sit in on planning and zoning meetings and express your opinions. Vote for 
politicians who support compact, transit-oriented development where people can travel by foot, 
bicycle and public transportation.</p>
<p>&#128; Educate Others &#139; Discuss the issue of sprawl with your friends, relative and neighbors. If they're 
thinking of moving out, ask them why. Encourage them to work to make their community a better 
place instead of leaving.</p>
<p>In the end, we have two choices. We can eithe continue to consume the countryside, at tremendous 
long-term cost to the region, or we can roll up our sleeves together and reclaim our cities. For more 
information call the Sierra Club Urban Sprawl Committee at (216) 521-2434.</p>

<h2 align=center>Nature's Bin</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Concerned about environmental and health risks from foods treated with agricultural chemicals? 
You are not alone. According to a recent survey done by HealthFocus, environmental concerns 
have surpassed health concerns to become the primary reason consumers buy organic foods. Yet, 
in a poll conducted by Louis Harris and Organic Gardening, 64 percent of those surveyed said that 
long term health benefits are the single most important reason for eating organic food, and 84 
percent would prefer organic food if it was readily available. </p>
<p>Organic farming is done without agricultural chemicals that seriously impact the health of wildlife. 
Pesticides and herbicides used in conventional farming enter the food chain and are believed by 
many to be directly responsible for deformation, cancer and premature death among several animal 
species. Additionally, chemicals that enter the food web through vegetation and water have long 
lasting and cumulative environmental effects.At Nature's Bin they make every effort to assure the 
purity and quality of everything they sell. Nature's Bin is a full service natural food store. Their 
emphasis is on quality fresh produce with a complete organic section.</p>
<p>Nature's Bin also carries Eden Foods which is OCIA certified organic. A long-standing leader in 
the Natural Foods industry, Eden Foods has maintained and enhanced the highest standards for 
organically grown foods. Eden standards reflect their growers' commitment to sustainable, 
non-chemical farming. Nature's Bin recently celebrated the grand opening of their second store in 
Cleveland Heights at 2255 Lee Road - (216) 932-2342. The first store they opened is located in 
Lakewood at 18120 Sloane Ave. - (216) 521-4600. Nature's Bin is operated by Cornucopia, 
Inc., a nonprofit organization founded in Lakewood in 1975. </p>
<p>At their new store they have a juice bar which highlights organic juice. Customers can buy organic 
carrot, carrot &amp; celery, V4: carrot, celery, beet and purple cabbage, and apple juice. They also 
serve smoothies, protein drinks, Kombucha tea, herbal tea and coffee.Nature's Bin provides a &quot;real 
work&quot; training environment. People with mental retardation and developmental disabilities learn 
basic vocational and social skills by playing an active role in produce, grocery, deli/bakery, 
maintenance and customer service department activities. Proceeds from retail sales are invested in 
the training program.</p>
<p>Anyone who has not yet visited either of the Nature's Bin stores is encouraged to do so.</p>

<title>Affinity - outmigration</title>

<h2 align=center>Ohio's Cities Suffering from Outmigration</h2>
<p>A terrible sucking sound can be heard throughout Ohio, and it's not just Ross Perot's sound of jobs 
moving to Mexico. It's the sound of people abandoning the state's major cities. For the most part, 
these people aren't going far. Many of them are just moving out from the central city to the suburbs.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting of the Ohio Planning Conference last year, Thomas Bier of Cleveland State 
University's College of Urban Affairs outlined the problem facing most of Ohio's big cities. 
Outmigration is fueled when more new homes are built in the suburbs of a metropolitan area than 
there are new households to occupy them. The surplus of housing means that less desirable houses 
are abandoned -- usually the older, lower-priced housing in the city.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that the population left in the central city is the population of the metropolitan area that 
does not fit into the suburbs,&quot; Bier says. In the case of Greater Cleveland, he adds, &quot;In another 40 
years, if we keep sprawling the way we are, we will empty the city of Cleveland, and all the inner 
suburbs will be in decline as residents with stronger incomes move farther out. Then the county will 
be in trouble. And if the county is in fiscal straits, the entire region is likely to be worse off.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Bier and his colleagues, suburbanization in Ohio has reached the point where it 
requires immediate, serious attention from all levels of government. In addition to working on the 
urban problems that push people out of the cities (crime, schools, racism, etc.), new housing must 
be built in the central cities to balance suburban construction.</p>
<p>&quot;Central cities need to capture at least 20% of the new housing market...Cities that can't build new 
housing are trapped in inescapable decline,&quot; Bier says. To accomplish this, local governments in 
each metropolitan area need to jointly plan where new housing ought to be built in the coming 
decades. Then they need to develop a strategy for turning the plan into reality. It has to be a 
regional effort.</p>
<p>In addition, the state and federal governments must rethink their role in the shaping of metropolitan 
regions. They must realize how they currently support suburbanization (through road improvement, 
mortgage assistance, school funding and other programs). And they must decide how to support 
more housing development in the central cities. &quot;Government policy is a massive force favoring 
edge development,&quot; Bier adds. </p>
<p>&quot;Currently, there's little balance in government support of edge development and redevelopment in 
the core.&quot;He estimates that the city of Cleveland needs to gain about 2,000 new homes every year 
for the foreseeable future. And some of it has to be higher-priced housing, so people are able to 
move in toward the core when they move up to a better home.</p>
<p>The city of Cleveland and its neighborhood-based housing organizations are working hard to close 
the housing gap. The nonprofit Cleveland&#160;Housing Network&#160;rehabbed 1,000 abandoned homes 
since 1981 and hopes to double that number in the next few years. Another 1,144 units of new 
housing were built in the city between 1990 and 1993, and several major housing developments. 
Cleveland&#160;Mayor Michael White even dreams about 10,000 new units downtown by the year 
2000.</p>
<p>The question will be whether such efforts generates the numbers needed to stem the tide of 
outmigration and urban decline. Can the land be assembled quickly enough? Can the buried 
foundations be cleared away? Can possible environmental contamination be cleaned up? Can the 
financing by found (especially when local governments have been stretched then by Gateway and 
other downtown developments)?</p>
<p>Other major cities in Ohio face similar challenges. By identifying the outmigration trends around the 
state, researches like Bier hope to raise awareness and develop a statewide constituency for 
action.Indeed, this is an issue for everyone -- for residents of the central cities and the suburbs. It's 
an issue that affects our social well-being, economic health and the environmental health of the 
whole region.</p>

<h2 align=center>Philip Environmental Pollutes the Great Lakes</h2>
<h5 align=center>By David Sharp</h5>
<p><em>we ducked in where the woods meet the parking lot. the full blush of fall was around and 
upon us and simon dove into the wood and i followed the trail that butts the ravine. we 
particularly like this space 'cause he can run free, and i can too.</em></p>
<p>There is a multinational corporation, based in Hamilton, Ontario, Philip Environmental. They are 
one of the fastest growing, award winning, corporations on the continent. Three dump sites that 
they control on the Great Lakes are: the Sarnia, Ont. dump, which flows into the St. Clair River, 
through Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, Lake Erie and points beyond. The Brantford, Ont. dump 
sits on the Grand River and flows through the Six Nations Indian Reserve directly into Lake Erie, 
and Stoney Creek, a suburb of Hamilton, Ontario on Lake Ontario.</p>
<p><em>i made my way down through the gorge past where the creek is diverted underground and 
past where the tiger lilies bloomed last june along the remnants of the original creekbed. it 
curves around to the left of a large field.</em></p>
<p>Electric Act Furnace (EAF) dust is a hazardous waste generated in significant quantities by the steel 
industry. The U.S. EPA classifies it as a hazardous waste, because, without treatment, it fails the 
toxicity characterizing leaching procedure (tclp) test for lead, cadmium and chromium. Philip 
Environmental had multi-year contracts with several major steel companies in the hamilton area, 
and had been receiving increasing quantities of EAF dust for a number of years. Philip 
Environmental had a recycling program whereby each ton of EAF dust was mixed with two tons of 
BOF dust and one part millscale. This mixture was to be recycled in cement. In December 1993 
Philip Environmental had approximately 65,000 tons of EAF dust. Over the next two years they 
have acknowledged receipt of approximately 75,000 tons. They also acknowledged that during this 
period virtually no recycling had occurred nor was nay disposed of or used in landfills, yet in 
November, 1995, only 70,000 tons could be accounted for. By my math, that&quot;s about half.</p>
<p><em>simon bolts out from under the canopy of fascias, reds and golds that claim the green from 
the trees and heads off to the right where large masonry blocks mix with fallen oak and 
various bramble rising a hundred or so feet to the ballfields above.</em></p>
<p>The Taro West Quarry Landfill site is owned by Taro Aggregates Construction Company, a 
subsidiary of Philip Environmental. According to local residents, Philip had been secretly dumping 
in the quarry for the past fifteen years. The site was filled past capacity, contoured with more waste 
and converted it into a scenic nature trail. The trail was part of a $40,000,000 compensation 
package received by the Stoney Creek city council, which also passed a second landfill site, the 
Taro East Quarry Landfill without the required Environmental Assessment (EA)</p>
<p><em>today i head off towards the old creek bed. water stands in a few deep pockets and i come 
upon a stump standing about twelve feet high. it is pocked and worn from woodpeckers and 
other insect eaters.</em></p>
<p>Regarding the EA process for Taro East, Philip Environmental representatives have often boasted 
that a hearing is unnecessary because they have spent $8,000,000 to ensure that the EA is 
satisfactory. The Taro East site offers no natural protection to the environment. It is a site in a 
residential area adjacent to the Niagra Escarpment, a unique and precious treasure designated as a 
world biosphere. There is already a landfill site that failed right next door leaking toxins into the 
drinking water of millions of people via the Red Hill Creek.</p>
<p><em>across the field, simon wanders in and out of the brush, sniffing out chipmunks or squirrels 
or some other dog that passed this way. he turns to search for me beside an access road that 
i can only describe as steel grey gravel and mud. once satisfied with my presence he moves 
on towards a thicket i wouldn&quot;t even dream of penetrating and disappears.</em></p>
<p>The hydrogeology13 at and near Taro is incomprehensible. That is, there is no way to predict the 
speed or direction of groundwater flow. In addition, the West Quarry is already leaking which 
means there are no clear benchmarks. The result is that if groundwater contamination is detected, it 
may be impossible to determine where and when it originated. Assuming the liners at Taro East 
function properly, there will be a disruption of natural water flow which will impact vegetation, most <br>
notable on the escarpment face.</p>
<p><em>i whistle a couple times and a few moments later, simon emerges and comes over, burr 
covered but happy. we head back through the field where this summer queen anne&quot;s lace 
and chicory scrabbled with buttercup and cattails amidst patches of grass and old tires.</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that nobody should be trusted to manage our environment without the proper 
checks and balances. Philip advertises that it is a fully integrated waste management company. This 
concept may be great for profitability, but is it in the best interest of the public? Philip Environmental 
operates several hazardous and non-hazardous waste facilities in the Hamilton region. It has a 
diverse transportation fleet. It owns a recently closed leaking industrial waste landfill. It manages the 
regions sewage treatment and water supply and owns the engineering company which monitors the 
performance of the contract on behalf of the region. Having one company responsible for all of 
these activities is not in the public interest.</p>
<p><em>last spring, a botanist and his assistant were down here taking samples of the various flora, 
killdeer skreeed about the place and i looked for frogs or tadpoles or minnows or just about 
any sign of life in the creek. as simon and i head up the hill the only signs of life in the water 
are some slippery algae and beer cans.</em></p>
<p>The levels of EAF dust around the Taro dump are ten times the amount found in the industrial core 
of Hamilton. The natives on the Six Nations Indian Reserve have contaminated drinking water and 
cancer rates comparable to Hamilton, the steel capital of Canada.Philip Environmental has been 
cited at least eleven times int he last two years in the U.S., from North Carolina to California. They 
boast about their operation in Brazil, lord knows what damage they&quot;re doing in a third world 
country given the reckless nature of the operations in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><em>we reach the top of the hill and simon sits for a minute and scratches himself, God, i hope 
it&quot;s just fleas.</em></p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Oberlin College Environmental
Studies Program Earns Award of Excellence </font></h2>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">in Education</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">Oberlin college recently received a $100,000
Award of Excellence in Education from the Consolidated Natural
Gas Company Foundation for its innovative Environmental Studies
Program, which teaches studentshow to apply classroom knowledge
to solve real-world problems.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Environmental Studies Program has evolved
from a single course 17 years ago into the fastest-growing area
of study at Oberlin, one of the nation&#146;s leading
independent, liberal arts colleges. The program helps students
combine critical thinking and practical know-how to develop
solutions to environmental problems. Local environmental projects
blanket Oberlin&#146;s home region in Northeast Ohio&#146;s
Lorain County, while independent research projects have taken
students around the world. The program&#146;s interdisciplinary
approach includes such areas as politics, economics, science and
ethics.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The CNG Foundation established the Award of
Excellence in Education in 1985 to recognize and encourage the
creativity and innovation inherent in independent colleges. Since
the awards inception, the CNG Foundation has presented more than
$1 million to eligible institutions that serve the same
geographical region encompassed by CNG through some of its
subsidiaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York,
Virginia and Louisiana.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The growth of the Oberlin program culminated in
the planning of a 13,000-square-foot Environmental Studies
Center, a demonstration facility to showcase the latest in
ecological design techniques. Construction is slated to begin in
1997. The center, designed as a zero-emissions facility, will
emphasize energy efficiency, advanced materials and designs that
minimize its impact on the environment.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Other program achievements include:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">Black River Clean-up: In the past six
        years, student-led projects have played key roles in
        cleaning up the Black River, one of 43 toxic hot spots in
        the Great Lakes watershed.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Bog Restoration: Students have worked to
        help restore Camden Bog, located eight miles southwest of
        Oberlin. The bog serves as a living laboratory for
        Oberlin students, a feeding area for great egrets and
        their wildlife and a supportive environment for six
        species of endangered plants.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Community Outreach: Students have worked
        with local teachers to introduce environmental education
        into local curricula and prepared audits that led to
        proposals for increased resource and energy efficiency
        for the college and City of Oberlin.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Encouraging Organic Farming: Beginning in
        1988, student research projects have led to a program
        that links campus dining cooperatives to local farmers.
        Today, students are working with local farmers to
        establish Oberlin&#146;s first community-supported
        organic farm.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The Environmental Studies Program has
built a model for 21st century education,&quot; said Oberlin
College President Dr. Nancy S. Dye.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. David Orr, the program&#146;s director
added, &quot;If we are to make the transition to a sustainable
and decent future in a world of 10 to 12 billion people in the
next 50 years, the size of the 'human footprint&#146; must be
reduced by 50 to 90 percent. This transition will require broad
changes in our ideas, perceptions and values -- which makes it,
in large part, a challenge to educational institutions.&quot;</font></p>

<h2 align=center>State Turns Its Back on Clean Water</h2>
<p>Thanks to a new law that went into effect October 1, 1996 the most pristine waterways in Ohio 
may be subject to more pollution, Rivers Unlimited announced. High quality, scenic waters could all 
get further degraded despite assurances to the contrary by the Ohio EPA. This would include such 
Ohio treasures as the Darby Creeks in central Ohio, the Little Miami River in the Dayton area, the 
Chagrin River near Cleveland and Little Beaver Creek in eastern Ohio. This new law will allow 
more pollutants in the 61,000 miles of rivers and streams in Ohio. It is going into effect today even 
though none of these high quality rivers have been classified under the rules for the new system. 
Furthermore, thanks to the new statute and rules there will no longer be any requirement for public 
hearings for most of the requests to dump more pollution into Ohio water.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very sad day for people who care about clean water in Ohio,&quot; Rivers Unlimited President 
Mike Fremont said. &quot;We already knew that these rules stole the public's right to have a voice in 
most decisions to increase pollutants into the water they drink. Unfortunately, we have just learned 
that Ohio EPA is moving forward with this plan despite the fact that they have not yet created the 
water classifications needed to protect our most pristine waterways. Every scenic river in Ohio 
could get trashed because Ohio EPA is rushing this process before any of these rivers have been 
classified under the rules for the new system,&quot; Fremont continued.</p>
<p>Under the new law and rules, known as the antidegradation law, all of the waterways in Ohio will 
be reclassified into six categories. Approximately 95% of the waterways in the state will be 
classified into the bottom two categories -- either as general high quality waters or limited resource 
waters. From now on, when wastewater treatment operators or other industrial dischargers apply 
to dump more toxins into these waters there will no longer be any requirement for public hearings 
or testimony. The remaining 5% of the waterways in the state that are in the top four categories 
would receive additional protections, Ohio EPA has repeatedly assured the public. Unfortunately, 
those classifications are not yet completed. As a result, each waterway is still classified under the 
old system. This could subject even the ten rivers in the state scenic river system to more pollution.</p>
<p>&quot;We are doing everything we can to stop this ill-conceived, polluters protection permitting process,&quot; 
stated Rivers Unlimited executive director Todd Ambs. &quot;Our lawsuit to stop this statute is still 
pending at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. We plan to demand a public hearing for 
every single permit application regardless of the stream category. At those hearings we will insist 
that a comprehensive cost benefit analysis be conducted and shared with the public. Any time there 
is a proposal to add more pollutants to a stream we want detailed information to justify how the 
benefits of more pollution will outweigh the detriments of lower water quality,&quot; Ambs concluded.</p>

<title>Affinity - Great Lakes Water</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<h3 align=center>Great Lakes Water Safety Standard Should Be Set Higher</h3>
<p>Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should set high standards to protect children and 
wildlife fromcancer-causing and endocrine-disrupting chemicals dumped into the Lake Erie 
watershed. By March 1997 the agency must finalize regulations to implement the Great Lakes 
Water Quality Initiative, a federal law passed in 1995 that aims to reduce toxic dumping into the 
Great Lakes.</p>
<p>&quot;All eight Great Lake states are currently working together to upgrade their water quality 
standards,&quot;said Edith Chase, president of the Ohio Coastal Resource Management Project and 
member of an Ohio EPA advisory committee helping to develop the new regulations. &quot;It started 
back in 1988 with the Council of Great Lakes Governors. It was their idea to say, 'Let's work 
together instead of competing for industry among ourselves. If we have consistent standards, then 
industry won't go pollution shopping'.&quot; Toxic chemicals regulated in the new program persist in the 
environment and can cause decreased fertility, birth defects, thyroid problems, and immune system 
damage in birds, fish, shellfish or mammals, according to the International Joint Commission on the 
Great Lakes. The Commission is a U.S.-Canadian agency overseeing Great Lakes protection.</p>
<p>&quot;The particular contaminants they worry about are called bioaccumulative chemicals of 
concern,&quot;Chase said. &quot;These are not only toxic in themselves, but when they are discharged into 
rivers and Lake Erie from a variety of sources, they end up in the sediments. Then the little 
creatures in the sediments munch on them. The bigger creatures, like crayfish and invertebrates, 
munch on the little ones and the fish munch on the invertebrates and it goes on up the food chain. At 
the top of the food web are two, the eagles and humans.&quot; Most eaglets born in the Lake Erie region 
still fail to thrive and live to maturity, according to Ohio EPA sources.</p>
<p>&quot;Mounting published evidence indicates that harm to humans from persistent toxic substances is 
similar to that caused in wildlife...Harm is being caused, at least in part, by in utero exposure to 
elevated levels of environmental estrogens,&quot; according to the International Joint Commission's 
Eighth Biennial Report on the Great Lakes. Children whose mothers consumed Great Lakes 
fishwhile pregnant were found to suffer developmental and behavioral problems. Men may suffer 
testicular cancer, genital tract disorders and lower fertility rates.Ohio EPA Director Donald 
Schregardus could set stringent rules protecting children from exposureto carcinogens in the water 
and fish. Chase and environmental representatives on the advisory committee are urging 
Schregardus to select a protective standard used in many federal programs that limits cancer risks 
to one additional cancer per million people exposed.</p>
<p>Kieth Linn, environmental specialist with the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, and 
municipal and industry representatives on the committee are urging Ohio EPA to select a less 
restrictive one in 100,000 risk level .&quot; Society needs to ask itself what risk is acceptable. We 
encounter risks every day in our lives which are much greater than that,&quot;Linn said. &quot;I think the 
average risk of a person driving a car being in a fatal automobile accident is one in 70. You need to 
put it all into perspective. There really is no scientific basis for choosing an acceptable risk level. It 
is what society deems is acceptable.&quot;Pollution in the sediment, traveling in the atmosphere and 
non-point sources [such as agricultural runoff] contribute more pollutants than discharges do,&quot; Linn 
said.</p>
<p>Industrial discharges of&#160;cancer-causing&#160;and endocrine-disrupting chemicals should be strictly 
regulated while society&#160;tries&#160;to reduce other sources, Chase said. &quot;For years U.S. EPA used to 
consider cancer the most significant endpoint for risk. If they could get the cancer-risk down then 
they figured they could protect the population from other health effects,&quot; Chase said. &quot;The 
developmental and reproductive effects are apparent at much lower concentrations than cause 
cancer. We don't have the numbers to set for these non-cancer effects. If we set the risk level at 
one in a million, hopefully it will be protective of the reproductive and development effects. It is a 
safety margin.&quot;</p>

<h3 align=center>Letter From the Editor</h3>
<h5 align=center>By Stefanie Mugridge</h5>
<p>Citizens should have the RIGHT TO KNOW about all of the chemicals that are discharged into 
their communities. This Mid Fall issue of Affinity informs readers about the Right-To-Know Act 
and the ways in which citizens can obtain records indicating some of the pollutants in their area.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Right-To-Know Act is one of the many environmental laws the Republican 
Congress has tried to deregulate. Currently, only 1% of the 72,000 chemicals that are in use today 
in the U.S. have to be reported by industry under the Right-To-Know Act. Citizens need to speak 
up and let the government know they want to be informed on anything happening in their 
community that may effect their health and that of their children or the environment.</p>
<p>The cover story &quot;Dishonorable Discharge&quot; reveals the rivers in Ohio that are the most polluted and 
the company&#185;s that are responsible for polluting them. Ohio Public Interest Research Group 
(PIRG) has done an extensive job in pin pointing the sources of chemical discharges into our 
waters. The full report, which is available to those interested by calling the Affinity office, goes into 
great detail about all the streams, river and lakes in Ohio that are being polluted by chemicals.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes article on page 3 talks about the need to come up with stronger regulations in 
protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem. The article on page 13 gives information into a specific 
problem on Lake Ontario which is affecting all of the Great Lakes. I learned about this issue while I 
was in the middle of my radio show (Earth Watch Radio, 89.3 fm, WCSB, Friday, 5:00-5:30 pm) 
and a woman came into the station and asked if she could have a few minutes of air time to explain 
what is happening in her home town. She spoke about the cancer rates that have skyrocketed in 
her town ever since Philip Environmental has come to Stoney Creek, Ontario. </p>
<p>She told of how her mom and dad had died of cancer and of her need to tour the Great Lakes in 
Canada and the U.S. to let people know what is happening to the health of her community and the 
Great Lakes Basin.I hope readers enjoy this issue of Affinity.</p>

<h2 align=center>Ohio EPA Favors Parking Lot Over Waterway</h2>
<p>In a devastating decision for the future of waterways in Ohio, the Ohio EPA last week approved a 
proposal for a developer to move 1000 feet of Tinker's Creek in Twinsburg. The developer plans 
to put in a parking lot for a strip mall where this natural stream corridor now exists. Rivers 
Unlimited, the Tinker's Creek Land Conservancy and a host of other organizations all testified in 
opposition to this hair-brained scheme, but Ohio EPA Director Don Schregardus decided that a 
parking lot for a strip mall was more important than the wishes of the overwhelming majority of 
people in the area or the health of the waterway.Theorganizations involved in the fight to stop the 
project are considering an appeal of the decision to the Environmental Board of Review.</p>
<p>The EPA has not resolved issues concerning degradation of water quality, value for enhancement of 
public interest, speculative engineering techniques and cost benefit analysis. This creek relocation 
project is strictly for financial gain. This project will place the entire Tinker's Creek corridor and the 
residents and businesses in and adjacent to the flood plain at risk.</p>

<h3 align=center>Sludge Farming Threatens Cuyahoga Valley</h3>
<h5 align=center>by Marilyn Christian</h5>
<p>This article will come as a shock to some people. For the communities of Boston and Richfield 
Townships, located in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, this article reveals a nightmare come 
true. </p>
<p>Sludge is a black mud which is left over after the liquids have been removed from raw sewage. It 
contains levels of heavy metal, including lead, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, copper, nickel and zinc, 
along with bacteria, dioxins, polychlorinated&#160;biphenyls, pesticides, asbestos and other 
contaminants. </p>
<p>A sludge farm, recently purchased by Kurtz Bros. Compost Services, Inc., has begun operation on 
Major Road in Richfield. Major Road is south off of Streetsboro Road just east of I-271. 
Approximately 1 1/2 miles down Major, at the sharp left turn, you can see and smell the beginning 
of the sludge operation. On the right side of the road is a field where people frequently watch deer 
herds and sun sets. This field has been spoiled by a dirt/gravel road and a gate with an 
unwelcoming sign. This dirt road leads back behind the trees to the now operating Richfield 
Township sludge site.</p>
<p>The 49.9 acres across the street on the left side of Major Road, as well as the 20.7 acres on the 
south side of Major just west of Oakhill Road, are located in Boston Township. The Ohio 
Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) has placed their rubber stamp of approval on all of 
these sites. The sludge that is stored on these lands is from the City of Kent&#185;s Wastewater 
Treatment Plant.</p>
<p>On November 13, 1995, Mr. Dean Stoll, Environmental Engineer for Division of Surface Water at 
the OEPA, wrote a letter to Mr. Bruce Bailey, the environmental coordinator at Kurtz Bros. 
Compost Services, Inc., stating that the Boston Township sites are acceptable locations for land 
application of sludge. He said, &quot;The sites are well isolated from neighboring properties and have 
acceptable soils.&quot;</p>
<p>Well guess what Mr. Stoll, Mr. Bailey and most of all Mr. Kurtz, there are neighboring properties 
and you are not isolated far enough away from us. The properties where these sludge farms exist 
are the headwaters for numerous creeks, streams, ponds and lakes. The fields are at the top of a 
hill with a community down stream that gets their drinking water from wells. </p>
<p>In a society where citizens are more aware of potential health risks and educated on how to avoid 
them, the allowance of sludge farming is not acceptable.</p>
<p>After hours of phone calls to neighbors, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, local and national 
environmental groups, town officials and biologists, to find out more information concerning sludge, 
the result was overwhelming: &quot;Sludge is not risk free.&quot; There is no guarantee that our health and the 
health of future generations is not being jeopardized. </p>
<p>We were not given a choice in this matter. The OEPA and Mr. Kurtz made our choice for us. Now 
we are forced to live with their mistakes. If they would have asked us whether we wanted this 
sludge in our neighborhood they would have found a community of people who desire a clean and 
healthy environment in a sustainable balance with nature. We will have no tolerance for sludge! </p>

the support of her husband Joe, family, community of people and most of all Mother Earth.</p>

<p align=left><a href="#Buckeye Forest Council Stages Rally to Protest Logging "><strong>Buckeye Forest Coucil Stages Rally to Protest Logging</strong></a></p>
<h3 align=center><a name="Logging the Wayne National Forest ">Logging the Wayne National Forest </a></h3>
<p>After four years of virtually no logging on the Wayne National Forest in southeast Ohio, the U.S. 
Forest Service has recently proposed four new logging projects in an effort to jump-start a major 
timber program on the Wayne. One of these logging projects, the Bluegrass Ridge Timber Sale, 
was fought in federal court earlier this summer when the Buckeye Forest Council filed a lawsuit for 
Forest Service violations of the National Environmental Policy Act. Although over 100 acres were 
dropped from the logging project as a result of the suit, more than 300 acres are scheduled to be 
cut sometime this fall. </p>
<p>Another of the four sales, along Dorr Run, is still in the early stages of planning and public 
comment. These sales would allow logging on over 2,000 acres of the Wayne over the next five to 
seven years. These timber sales are being conducted in the name of forest health, although none are 
currently being painted as 'salvage sales' under the Salvage Logging rider. To propose that the 
forests need to be cut in order to save them is like proposing to put someone to death to prevent 
the flu. 'Forest health' is affected by a multitude of stresses, including air pollution, forest 
fragmentation, logging, and other effects, which combine to weaken the 'immune system' of forest 
ecosystems. This makes trees more susceptible to pathogen or insect attacks they normally would 
have resisted. The science behind the solution proposed by the Forest Service (increased logging) 
has been debunked by biologists nationwide.</p>
<h3 align=center><a name="Buckeye Forest Council Stages Rally to Protest Logging ">Buckeye Forest Council Stages Rally to Protest Logging </a></h3>
<p>Continuing the pressure on the Forest Service, the Buckeye Forest Council staged a protest at the 
Wayne Forest Service office in Athens, Ohio on September 12. A black bear presented the first 
annual &quot;Rusty Scapel Award&quot; for forest health malpractice to the U.S. Forest Service. The award 
will be given annually to agencies, corporations or individuals who demonstrate that quack science 
is not dead. &quot;The area where they want to log [Dorr Run] already has 30 miles of ORV trails, 36 
active oil and gas wells, 9.8 miles of oil and gas roads, and 4.7 miles of Forest Development 
Roads,&quot; said Daria Gere of the Buckeye Forest Council at the rally. &quot;In addition, the Dorr Run area 
has been logged, strip mined and deep mined. This is not a healthy forest. It needs time to heal and 
restore to a healthy, wild state. The last thing this forest needs is to be logged! The forest service 
talks about 'forest health.' But this timber sale, and all the others, are really about getting the cut out 
and subsidizing big timber industries.&quot; </p>
<p>Also at the rally, a petition with over 5,000 signatures was presented to the Forest Service, 
demanting that logging end on the Wayne. Six demands were given to Sharon Nyggard-Scott, 
District Ranger for the Athens unit. These demands included zero cutting on the Wayne, more 
wilderness, no new roads/close existing roads, increase land acquisition, stop breaking the law and 
tell the truth. One of the biggest problems with the logging industry, on both public and private lands 
in Ohio, is the waste. To illustrate this, speakers at the rally stood on a makeshift stage constructed 
from pallets. They explained that 84% of the tress cut in the state of Ohio are made into shipping 
pallets. Over two-thirds of these pallets are landfilled after a single use, representing the wholesale 
trashing of Ohio&#185;s forests. Another point that was emphasized was that most timber sales on public 
lands lose money. The U.S Forest Service loses over half a billion dollars annually from below cost 
timber sales, which represents a tremendous waste of taxpayer money. The rally concluded with 
Matt Peters and Than Hitt singing eco-tunes to the crowd, who participated in a rousing sing-along.

<h2 align=center>Closing the Loop of Recycling</h2>
<p>Despite some progress made by cities and towns in recycling, over 78% of the trash in our country 
is still headed to landfills and incinerators. Burying and Burning trash causes air and water pollution 
and other environmental and public health problems besides wasting natural resources. Clearly, the 
need to improve the nation's recycling cannot be overemphasized.</p>
<p>Successful recycling is hampered due to a marked absence of strong markets for materials 
collected in local recycling programs. Manufacturers need to therefore buy recyclables and turn 
them into new recycled products. However, only when there is a strong demand for these new 
products, can the market for recyclables improve. The federal government has already taken the 
first significant step towards &quot;closing this loop&quot; on recycling by passing the &quot;Buy Recycled&quot; 
Executive Order in 1993. The federal offices are now committed to purchasing printing and writing 
paper made of a minimum 20% post-consumer recycled content, which means made of materials 
from local recycling programs. Given the large purchasing power of State and local governments 
and large institutions such as universities, they too need to adopt similar mechanisms to make 
critical and significant improvements to the market for recycled products.</p>
<p>The Ohio Public Interest Research Group (Ohio PIRG) just completed a &quot;BUY RECYCLED&quot; 
campaign in the state of Ohio. Efforts of Ohio PIRG were directed towards urging cities and 
counties within Ohio to adopt a resolution that would mandate buying of recycled paper containing 
20% post-consumer material as long as the price of recycled paper was within 10% of the cost of 
virgin paper. Extensive research during the campaign revealed that good quality recycled paper is 
now available locally and at competitive prices. Scores of cities and counties across the country as 
well as the cities of Mansfield, Lakewood and Cincinnati in Ohio already have a working &quot;Buy 
Recycled Paper&quot; resolution. Last month, Cuyahoga County and Medina County adopted the 
proposed resolution thereby providing a boost to a recycling economy, conservation of resources, 
waste reduction and a cleaner environment.</p>
<p>While these initiatives are exemplary and encouraging, it is imperative for other local governments 
to follow suit and reaffirm their commitment to the environment. Concerned citizens of Ohio can 
play an important role in bringing about this change. One mechanism would be to call local 
governments and urge them to adopt a &quot;Buy Recycled Paper&quot; policy that is as strong as the federal 
government's. Another would be to write a letter-to-the-editor for local newspapers calling for 
&quot;Buy Recycled Paper&quot; policies locally and statewide.</p>

<h2 align=center>Biotechnology: Consumer Beware</h2>
<h5 align=center>by Brian Tokar</h5>
<p>The floodgates are opening this year for the widespread commercial sale of genetically engineered 
foods. After nearly a decade of research in laboratories and experimental farm plots across the 
country, U.S. government agencies have issued approvals for genetically engineered crops to be 
grown in large quantities and offered for sale. Last year, final consent was obtained for engineered 
varieties of corn, squash, potatoes, tomatoes, soybeans, canola and cotton. Many of these crops 
were raised for seed during the 1995 growing season, and may be available in your local 
supermarket later this year. </p>
<p>Since 1990, nearly 3,000 varieties of genetically engineered plants, animals and bacteria have been 
developed and field tested in the U.S. Field tests have occurred in every state except Vermont, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. Plants have been manipulated 
genetically to resist high doses of herbicides, manufacture insecticidal toxins, resist viruses, ripen 
more slowly or more uniformly, and display altered chemical compositions. </p>
<p>Chemical companies such as Monsanto, Ciba-Geigy, DuPont and Upjohn, along with many of the 
largest commercial seed companies, have invested heavily in biotechnologies such as genetic 
engineering in an effort to expand their control over the increasingly monopolized food industry. 
While some of these engineered crops will be marketed as specialty products, others may be 
mingled with the general food supply, making it difficult to distinguish them from non-engineered 
varieties. Only widespread consumer outrage can prevent these giant corporations from 
dramatically increasing their control over our food, and furthering the spread of this dangerous new 
technology. </p>
<p><strong>BRAVE NEW WORLD? </strong></p>
<p>Genetically altered plants have many qualities that distinguish them from their naturally-growing 
relatives. Genes from other plants, bacteria, viruses and even animals are isolated from their original 
sources and spliced into the earliest, embryonic cells of the plant of choice. </p>
<p>However, despite the repeated claims of industry representatives, this is far from a fool-proof 
process. The resulting genetic patchwork, containing genes from a number of completely unrelated 
sources, will often behave in strange and unexpected ways, and can display unpredictable 
nutritional, behavioral and environmental properties. While research aimed at developing new 
genetically engineered crops has proceeded at lightning speed in recent years, research to improve 
our understanding of the possible consequences has crept along at a pace that would embarrass a 
snail.</p>
<p>Thus, the long range effects of these new crops remains largely unpredictable. Only the most 
extreme cases require any special scrutiny by the FDA and other agencies, and none of these 
products will have to be labeled. The ability to provoke an allergic reaction, for example, can be 
accidentally transferred from one plant to another in the course of transferring genes. </p>
<p>Most engineered crops are resistant to antibiotics, which are used as experimental markers to easily 
distinguish altered plant cells from their normal relatives. Antibiotic resistance can be passed on to 
bacteria in the soil or even to organisms residing in or on exposed people and animals. Levels of 
toxic substances ordinarily found at below-detectable levels in foods may be increased, and unique 
combinations of genetic traits might even have an effect on our ability to digest food properly. </p>
<p>Many engineered crops allow increased use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture, and make it 
easier for food processing companies to impose higher standards of uniformity. Farmers producing 
crops under contract to food processors &#139; an increasingly common practice &#139; are often required to 
follow a strict schedule of chemical treatments, even if a particular pesticide treatment might be 
against the grower's own better judgement.</p>
<p><strong>SUPERMARKET INVASION</strong> </p>
<p>Here are some of the items that may be coming to your supermarket this summer, thanks to the 
latest innovations in biotechnology: -</p>
<p>Tomatoes that look fresher, but aren't: Since 1993, Food &amp; Water has been reporting on the 
efforts of Calgene and other biotechnology companies to produce a tomato engineered to ripen 
more slowly for longer shelf life. Calgene's inability to convince anyone to buy these tomatoes 
drove the company right to the edge of bankruptcy last summer. Just when the end appeared to be 
in sight, Monsanto jumped in, purchasing 49.9 percent of Calgene stock, and offering the company 
and its &quot;Flavr-Savr&quot; tomatoes a new lease on life. Monsanto has also purchased the vegetable 
growing and packing company Gargiulo L.P. and merged its operations with Calgene's.</p>
<p>- Soybeans and cotton grown with toxic herbicides: Monsanto will be marketing soybeans 
containing petunia, bacteria, and virus genes that render it resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, 
which Monsanto markets worldwide under the trade name Roundup. The Pesticide Action 
Network reported last August that Monsanto is doubling its production capacity for Roundup, a 
general purpose herbicide which is highly toxic to most plants. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc has obtained EPA approval for an 
engineered variety of cotton that is resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil. The approval was for a 
three year trial, in which Rhone-Poulenc is supposed to submit data on bromoxynil's effects on 
human health. This highly toxic herbicide is known to cause developmental abnormalities in 
laboratory mammals and may cause birth defects and cancer in humans. There is little doubt that 
large increases in agricultural herbicide use would result from the wide-spread use of these 
engineered crops. </p>
<p>- Crops that make their own pesticide: Varieties of corn, potatoes and cotton have been approved 
that incorporate genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a variety of bacteria that is toxic to many 
varieties of crop-damaging caterpillars. But while the natural form of Bt's toxin is only activated 
under special circumstances, making the short-lived bacteria safe for use by organic growers, the 
active toxin released by these engineered plants could impact populations of a wide variety of 
beneficial insects, butterflies and moths. The EPA has projected that widespread use of 
Bt-engineered crops would result in many of the target pests becoming resistant to Bt in three to 
five years. Organic growers would lose one of their safest and most flexible tools, and everyone 
else would either seek higher-potency chemical pesticides, or have to wait for the biotechnology 
industry to produce a yet more potent generation of pesticide-producing strains. The Swiss 
multinational Ciba-Geigy is both a leading pesticide manufacturer and holder of the patent for Bt 
toxin-producing corn. </p>
<p>- Canola that can replace tropical oils: Calgene, in collaboration with Procter &amp; Gamble, has 
produced a strain of rapeseed, source of the ever-popular canola oil, that is high in lauric acid, a 
fatty constituent naturally found in coconut and palm kernel oil. While consumers have widely 
rejected foods containing tropical oils due to their high content of saturated fats like lauric acid, 
such fats are a key raw material in the manufacture of detergents, soaps and cosmetics. Procter &amp; 
Gamble has contracted to buy a million pounds of the high-lauric oil. The rape plant is a close 
relative of the wild mustards that grow abundantly throughout much of the U.S., and these mustards 
could serve as carriers for unique combinations of genetic traits to be passed on in the wild. 
Researchers in Scotland recently reported that pollen from genetically engineered oilseed rape 
escaped and fertilized plants a mile and a half away. The so-called &quot;high lauric&quot; canola will also 
impact the economies of countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia that are highly 
dependent on coconut and palm oil exports.</p>
<p><strong>MAD SCIENTISTS AT WORK </strong></p>
<p>These various developments are only the latest in the long range, global effort by the biotechnology 
industry to supplant natural processes in agriculture, medicine, forestry, and nearly every other 
realm, with their own artificial, costly and ultimately short-term &quot;solutions.&quot; Scientists are isolating 
and manipulating hormones that control the growth and flowering of plants. They are engineering 
animals to produce drugs in their milk, and raising pigs containing human immune system proteins 
that may allow them to be used as sources of organs for transplants. There have been experiments 
involving animal viruses including rabies, as well as deadly rabbit virus that recently escaped from 
an experimental facility on Wardang Island, off the coast of Australia. </p>
<p>Natural processes, and even the genes of human beings are being patented by companies that see 
the entire world as nothing more than objects to be controlled and profited from. These 
developments are merely symptoms of an economic system, and an entire culture, that has fallen so 
far out of balance with the natural world that the survival of complex life on Earth is increasingly 
threatened by its excesses. </p>
<p>But none of these developments are as inevitable as industry representatives would have us believe. 
Just a decade ago, the experts were predicting the Bovine Growth Hormone, genetically 
engineered plants, anti-frost bacteria and many other products of biotechnology would be widely 
accepted by the early 1990s. This has not, for the most part, come to pass, and new developments 
in biotechnology are as uncertain and controversial as ever.</p>
<p>The emergence of militant farmers' movements in India and across south Asia reflects an emerging 
worldwide awareness of the hazards of corporate agriculture, and is an important counterpart to 
our own activism here in the U.S. There is much reason for hope that organized citizens and an 
increasingly educated public will continue to hold back many of the worst consequences of this 
fundamentally life-denying technology. </p>

<p>I am happy to announce that AFFINITY has reached the goals it set out to achieve. The purpose 
of this publication is to provide information that helps citizens take a more active role in protecting 
their environment. In addition, AFFINITY serves as a forum for citizens and environmental activists 
to voice their concerns. </p>
<p>Citizens call in from all over the state to tell their stories. From urban sprawl to sludge farming, 
people are reaching out to AFFINITY for help. They need exposure on their issues and 
information on how to organize in their communities to stop the destruction to the environment and 
their health.</p>
<p>In this issue of AFFINITY, readers will find articles that focus on human health problems resulting 
from chemicals. The cover story focuses on the Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MSC) issue. There 
are countless people suffering from this disorder all over the world. As society continues to 
encourage the use of chemicals we will see tremendous increases in cancer rates and other chronic 
disorders such as MCS.</p>
<p>The article on biotechnology on page three discusses the implications of genetically engineered 
foods. After reading this article, it is impossible not to question whether this world is headed in the 
wrong direction. </p>
<p>On page six of this issue, readers can learn about the struggle of two communities in Ohio fighting 
sludge farming. These articles are perfect examples of citizens fighting to protect their homes. The 
problem now exists in their backyards and they are ready to fight. </p>
<p>Nearing six years of publishing AFFINITY, I am proud of what it has become. Thanks to the 
advertisers who have made publishing possible and to the readers who have expressed their 
appreciation for the paper. </p>
<p>Special thanks to my family who has always been very supportive of my efforts&#139; and to my husband 
who helps out more than I can express. How did I do it all those years without him? He is the best! </p>
<p>I hope readers enjoy this Early Fall issue of AFFINITY. If readers are interested in receiving 
AFFINITY by mail or making a donation to the paper, see the form on page 15.</p>

<title>Affinity - clear cutting in NW</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Clear-Cuts Causing Landslides
in the Pacific Northwest</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">A landslide, originating in a 1987 clear-cut
unit, brought four hard working Douglas County citizens to a
violent, tragic death last week. The Oregon Department of
Forestry claims that the timber company who clear-cut the land
above the destroyed home had followed the regulations under the
Forest Practices Act. If this is true, then the Forest Practices
Act is failing to safeguard the lives of many rural residents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">All over Oregon, landslides occurring in
clear-cuts logged under the Forest Practices Act have damaged
adjoining private property, degraded fish habitat, and fouled the
state&#146;s water. The 1975 US Forest Service study of
clear-cutting in the western Cascade Range in Oregon concludes
that non-road related landslides occur almost 3 times more often
in clearcuts than forested areas. It also concludes that
&quot;most hillslope failures in clearcut areas occurred in the
first 12 years after cutting.&quot; (See USFS study referenced
below.) Other recent surveys of landslides caused by last
year&#146;s heavy rains show an even greater correlation between
clear-cuts and landslides. It is unconscionable that the law
still allows logging practices that are known to increase the
likelihood of landslides.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now that it&#146;s dramatically clear that our
rural neighbors&#146; lives are in danger, we must immediately
re-examine and strengthen the rules that regulate the logging of
timber land. Moreover, we must move quickly to assess existing
clear-cut units for potential slope failure. To prevent any
further danger to human lives, all clear-cut units harvested
under the rules of the Forest Practices Act for the past 12 years
should be immediately examined for indications of possible slope
failure. Where indications of possible failure occur, all
downstream residents must be immediately warned so they can take
measures to prevent loss of life and property. Countless rural
residents live down stream from clearcuts less than 12 years old.
It is imperative that we take immediate action to prevent any
further loss of life.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The clear-cut that produced the fatal landslide
was on rocky, unstable soil with steep slopes that ranged from 60
percent to 120 percent. In addition, the law allowed the
clear-cutting of the entire riparian buffer on the creek that was
the course for the slide. In light of these facts, we call upon
the Oregon Department of Forestry to place an immediate
moratorium on clear-cutting timber on slopes until the current
laws have been reviewed and modified to eliminate landslide
danger and adequately prevent soil disturbance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The people who died from this landslide had
been living in their rural home for many years before industry
clear-cut their watershed. All over the state, large numbers of
rural residents live below industrial forest land. We must take
these tragic deaths as a warning that our forestry laws and
regulations need to be strengthened. It is time for a complete
overhaul of the state Forest Practices Act. We must act now to
prevent any further loss of life.</font></p>

<h2 align=center>Environmentalists Petition to Protect Imperiled Atlantic</h2>
<p>On October 17, 1996, the Biodiversity Legal Foundation (BLF) of Boulder, Colorado filed an 
extensive formal petition with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requesting a 
reduction in the annual total allowable catch for the Atlantic large coastal shark fishery. The petition 
for rulemaking, filed under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), requests a 50% quota 
reduction for the commercial fishery and a reduction from four sharks to one&#160;shark per&#160;vessel per 
day in the&#160;recreational fishery, effective January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>Within the last two decades there has been a large increase in commercial and recreational shark 
fishing within U.S. waters. The increase in U.S. commercial fishing effort is primarily driven by the 
demand for shark fin exports to Asian countries and a growing acceptance of shark meat by U.S. 
consumers. Biologists have estimated that large coastal shark opulations have declined one-half 
totwo-thirds from the mid 1970s to early 1990s.</p>
<p>The&#160;BLF contends&#160;that populations of one or more western Atlantic large coastal shark species 
(the sandbar, dusky, blacktip, and sand tiger) may become biologically threatened in the near future 
if current levels of exploitation and habitat degradation are not dramatically reduced. </p>
<p>The development and implementation of an adequate recovery program for these species has been 
delayed by NMFS foot-dragging in pursuit of needed conservation measures. Priority has been 
placed on short term fishery revenues rather than the long-term health of large coastal shark 
populations. This priority is leading several large coastal shark populations toward eventual collapse 
and is threatening the long term economic viability of the fishery. The Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act requires that conservation and management measures be based 
on the best scientific information available and that such measures prevent over-fishing and initiate 
rebuilding of depleted species.</p>
<p>&quot;The best existing data suggest that a complete closure of the shark fishery is probably warranted,&quot; 
said Jasper Carlton, Director of the Biodiversity Legal Foundation. &quot;However, the petitioned 
actions are seen as a reasonable first step that is required to initiate recovery of these long-lived 
marine predators.&quot; </p>
<p>Delayed regulatory responses by NMFS has served only&#160;to aggravate the&#160;situation by&#160;increasing 
the need for drastic quota reductions which,&#160;in turn, has translated into financial hardship for 
commercial shark fishermen who have invested in the fishery. An editorial in the September, 1996 
issue of National Fisherman stated, &quot;Fishermen would be better off encouraging collaborative 
science and conservation management. It can't hurt to save some sharks for tomorrow. Above all 
we should not carry on the foolishness the feds began when they sold free-for-all shark fishing as a 
bail-out for struggling fleets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NMFS is failing in its mission to recover populations of large coastal sharks despite a full 
awareness that population declines of 50 to 75% have occurred within the last two decades,&quot; said 
Greg Joder, the BLF's Marine Conservation Coordinator. He added, &quot;Several prominent scientists 
recently warned that if the large coastal shark fishery were closed today, it may still require several 
decades for these sensitive species to recover.&quot;</p>
<p>The&#160;requested actions&#160;will significantly contribute to the attainment of the Atlantic shark&#160;fishery 
management plan's rebuilding program and the requirements of the Magnuson Act by initiating 
the&#160;minimum steps&#160;necessary that are required to prevent over fishing&#160;and begin the rebuilding 
process for the depleted populations. The requested actions will also promote continued research 
and data collection programs which will greatly assist NMFS in managing large coastal shark 
populations in the western north Atlantic.</p>
<p>Under the APA, NMFS must promptly consider the petition and the requested actions. NMFS 
may also publish the petition for rulemaking in the Federal Register if the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries determines that public comment will aid in consideration of the petition.</p>
<p>The Biodiversity Legal Foundation is a national, non-profit organization dedicated to the 
preservation of all native wild plants and animals, communities of species, and naturally functioning 
ecosystems. The organization is based in Boulder, Colorado and has been at the leading edge of 
efforts to protect imperiled species and their ecosystems in the United States.</p>

<h2 align=center>EARTH WATCH</h2>
<p><strong>EXTINCTION?</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Nearly one quarter of the world's mammal species are threatened with extinction and about half of 
those may be gone in as little as a decade,&quot; says a report from the IUCN-World Conservation 
Union. An article in the Washington Post says that conservationists called the report &quot;surprising and 
frightening.&quot; Of 4,600 known species of mammals, the report finds 1096 at risk.</p>
<p><strong>MT. SELLMORE</strong></p>
<p>A &quot;late blooming&quot; bill before the House Resources Committee to allow corporations to become 
official sponsors of national parks is a contender for &quot;worst idea of the year,&quot; says the Washington 
Post. The measure would allow sponsors &quot;limited recognition&quot; in the parks and mention of their 
sponsorship in advertisements in return for their financial contributions. &quot;It's precisely to escape the 
world of corporate logos that people go to the parks,&quot; the Post argues. &quot;These are public parks, 
not private billboards, and they ought to stay that way.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ROAD TO RUIN </strong></p>
<p>A taxpayer-conservationist coalition wants to halt 22 &quot;wasteful and environmentally destructive&quot; 
highways, says a release from Taxpayers for Common $ense and Friends of the Earth. &quot;It's time for 
the government to pull over for directions,&quot; says TC$'s Ralph De Gennaro. A national campaign to 
kill unnecessary road projects is planned; among the targets are a $288 million highway &quot;designed 
to ease traffic jams after Penn State football games&quot; and a $750 million road project that would 
&quot;pave through some of South Carolina's last bottomland hardwood forests.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>OCEAN PERIL</strong></p>
<p>&quot;For the first time, some scientists are saying that some species of ocean fish and invertebrates are 
reaching the perilously low levels where extinction becomes a real possibility,&quot; the New York 
Times reported Tuesday. Next month more than 100 species of oceanic fish will be added to the 
World Conservation Union's &quot;red list&quot; of endangered creatures.</p>
<p><strong>EVERY AMERICAN</strong></p>
<p>All citizens have a stake in protecting Utah's wildlands, &quot;since the land in question belongs to the 
people of this nation, not the politicians in Utah,&quot; actor Robert Redford writes in the LA Times. 
Redford defends the designation of the Staircase-Escalante National Monument by President 
Clinton under the Antiquities Act for both economic and environmental reasons. Business comes to 
Utah &quot;because employees want to raise their families in proximity to the region's pure, open 
spaces,&quot; Redford argues. And rural economic growth in Utah is related to &quot;an unprecedented 
increase of tourism,&quot; not extractive industries.</p>
<p><strong>NO REPEAL</strong></p>
<p>Hours avter Vice President Al Gore told a PBS audience that the &quot;salvage&quot; rider was the &quot;biggest 
mistake&quot; of the Clinton administration's four years, the White House abandoned efforts to seek 
repeal of both the logging and the Mt. Graham riders in the Omnibus spending bill. The House 
passed the measure Saturday; the Senate votes today. The Washington Post reports that the White 
House &quot;succeeded in getting practically all of its demands&quot; in the negotiations. &quot;The White House 
tried, but not very hard,&quot; says Connie Stewart of the Western Ancient Forest Campaign. &quot;Now 
everyone can go out and campaign on protecting the environment while the worst law of the 104th 
Congress remains in full force.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ANIMAL LOVE CANAL?</strong></p>
<p>Robert McKinnell, a geneticist and cancer expert at the University of MN, concludes that &quot;we 
should be alarmed&quot; because of the widespread deformities found in frogs at more than 100 sites in 
MN. The Washington Post reported on a conference of scientists held in Duluth MN to study the 
phenomenon. Environmental degradation is considered by many of the scientists to be the reason 
for the deformities, with &quot;some kind of chemical pollutant&quot; the most &quot;probable cause of that 
degradation.&quot; McKinnell says that frogs serve as a &quot;sentinel species&quot; because many of their 
metabolic functions, notably in the liver, &quot;are similar to the same processes in humans.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>ALAR COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>Greenwire reports that a Columbia Journalism Review article about how the news media covered 
the pesticide Alar concludes that mistaken media coverage &quot;has contributed to the public &#140;myth' 
that the pesticide Alar poses no health threat.&quot; Although Alar &quot;has become a favorite media symbol 
for a false alarm,&quot; studies have confirmed that Alar is an animal and &quot;probable human&quot; carcinogen, 
according to EPA sources. A &quot;sophisticated public relations counterattack&quot; mounted by the food 
industry was responsible for erroneous reporting on Alar by major newspapers, says John Stauber 
of the newsletter PR Watch</p>
<p><strong>COLLECT AND PROTECT</strong></p>
<p>New endangered species postage stamps went on sale last week, &quot;intended to promote awareness 
of the hundreds of North American animals currently in danger of becoming extinct,&quot; reports 
Greenwire based on a San Diego Union-Tribune article and a USPS release. Among the 15 
species featured are the black-footed ferret, the ocelot, the Gila trout, the piping plover, the 
California condor, and the Florida manatee. The stamps were unveiled in a ceremony at the San 
Diego zoo.</p>
<p><strong>CORPORATE CLEANUP</strong></p>
<p>December 3 will be observed as &quot;Corporate Cleanup Day&quot; to commemorate the victims of the 
Bhopal tragedy and &quot;bring to the attention of the world the wrongs and injustices being committed 
by powerful corporations all the time.&quot; The event, on the anniversary of the Bhopal incident, is a <br>
&quot;national day of corporate accountability,&quot; says Communities Concerned About Corporations, its 
sponsor. For an information packet write to Nan Hardin, 210 W. Jennings St., Newburgh IN 
47630.</p>
<p><strong>LAX LOGGING</strong></p>
<p>A survey of more than 200 logging operations in Washington state found 68% of them violated fish 
and wildlife rules, and &quot;few violators were cited by regulators,&quot; the AP reports. &quot;It's alarming,&quot; said 
Joseph Pavel from the Northwest Indian Fish Commission and a member of the Timber, Fish, and 
Wildlife group that conducted the survey. &quot;We have regulations on the books . . Basically, they're 
not being enforced.&quot;</p>
<p>PERILOUS WATER</p>
<p>&quot;Without drastic change, the nation's tap water faces an increasingly perilous future,&quot; a Houston 
Chronicle series concludes according to an article in Greenwire. The series reports that one of 
every five water systems in the U.S. violates a health standard, with aging water distribution pipes 
and treatment plants &quot;a large part of the problem. &quot; Legislation passed by Congress this year 
&quot;focuses resources on the most serious water contaminants but is too limited in its scope and 
funding to address many other problems,&quot; the report says.</p>
<p><strong>FROG SLEUTHING</strong></p>
<p>Minnesota scientists are still puzzled by a outbreak of malformed frogs in the upper Midwest. The 
Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that scientists analyzing the frog malformations remain convinced 
that the cause is at least partially environmental, not due to a snake parasite as reported earlier in 
the week. A biologist with the Minnesota Pollution Control agency, Mark Gernes said, &quot;Parasites 
might be one of the contributors.[b]ut I think there might be more than one cause. [Frogs] are fairly 
significant indicators of health in our environment.We ask ourselves what has changed in the 
environment in the last two years.&quot;</p>

<p>The loss of six bald eagles would likely result from dioxin discharges from a Maine paper mill into 
the Penobscot River, according to a Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS) biological opinion issued in late 
August. An article in &quot;Greenwire&quot; from several sources says the FWS &quot;will study the effects of 
dioxin on bald eagles that eat contaminated fish from the river&quot; to determine if the EPA should 
reduce Lincoln Pulp &amp; Paper Co.'s dioxin limit. &quot;Some enviros are demanding that Marine paper 
mill not be allowed to discharge any dioxin into rivers,&quot; the article reports. &quot;These eagles need more 
study of dioxin like they need a hole in the head,&quot;says Peter Washburn of the Natural Resources 
Council in Maine. </p>

<p>A Sierra Club report shows that current Members of Congress took nearly $50 million from 
&quot;polluter PACs&quot;(Political Action Committees) and then voted to weaken key environmental 
protections. The report &quot;confirms a strong and deeply disturbing relationship between 
anti-environmental PAC giving and voting records,&quot; says the Club. The Club's study of Federal 
Election Commission records shows that 660 political action committees associated with anti- 
environmental causes or legislation donated a &quot;whopping&quot;$46 million to Members of the 104th 
Congress since December 1993.</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="MORE FIRES ">MORE FIRES </a></h3>
<p>Experts say the great forests of the West &quot;need more fire rather than less,&quot;reports the Washington 
Post this September. Some scientists argue that this year's &quot;explosion&quot;of fire is the inevitable result 
of &quot;decades of well-intended but misguided fire suppression practices&quot;as well as poor logging 
practices. But in Washington DC, the fires &quot;are also igniting a political debate&quot;with the timber 
industry arguing for more cutting in spite of a recent study of Sierra Nevada forests concluding that 
logging &quot;increased fire severity more than any other human activity.</p>

Congress's assault on the American people's right to a safe and healthy environment.&quot;The timber 
industry has claimed that &quot;salvage&quot;logging is necessary to reduce forest fire danger; a hearing by a

<p>American taxpayers &quot;are being fleeced by the federal grazing fee system,&quot;says an op-ed in the 
Washington Times by Sens. Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Dale Bumpers (D-AR). They say that the 
Domenici grazing bill that passed the Senate in March would set grazing fees at $1.63 per animal 
unit month (AUM), &quot;lower than the lowest federal fee charged between the years 1989-1994.&quot;The 
Senators argue that the current grazing fees, and those proposed in the Domenici bill, &quot;contain 
stewardship disincentives that promote overgrazing and degradation of public land while stripping 
the public of its right to protest federal grazing decisions and allowing private ranchers to sublease 
public lands at high profits.&quot;</p>

<p>Links between algal blooms, threatened wildlife, sewage and hog farms are discussed in an article

epidemic&quot;of marine microorganisms that cause dangerous red tides, the Times says these scientists 
are &quot;urging action to reduce the runoff of sewage and other nutritive substances that seem to 
promote the poisonous blooms.&quot;Reporting research in North Carolina that seems to link phosphate 
enrichment from hog farm sewage to fish kills, the article says that &quot;a growing fear, intriguing but 
unconfirmed, is that nutrient runoff . . is feeding the growth of the marauding [microorganism] 
swarms. Algal blooms affect not just NC: &quot;Every single coastal state has this problem in one form

&quot;a score of proposals that threaten national forests, rangelands and other public spaces,&quot;says the

measures,&quot;the Times says, but they could be attached &quot;like so many freight cars&quot;to various 
legislative &quot;trains.&quot;The Domenici grazing bill, anti-Tongass provisions, and Sen. Larry Craig's &quot;forest

<h2 align=center>The Air I Breathe Makes Me Sick</h2>
<h5 align=center>by Amy Simpson</h5>
<p>Toni Temple suffers from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). MCS is a disorder triggered by 
exposure to chemicals in the environment. Synthetic chemicals are all around us. They are in the 
products we use, clothes we wear, food we ear and air we breathe. Because chemicals are 
everywhere, it is not possible to escape exposure. It is no wonder, then, that many people have 
become sensitized to the chemicals around them. In fact, it is estimated that 15% of the population 
has become sensitized to common household and commercial products. </p>
<p>Toni's illness resulted from her malfunctioning water softner and furnace that releasec zinc chloride 
into the air in her home. Once leading a normal, healthy life - Toni is now legally disabled and on 
social security disability. She suffers from extreme chemical sensitivity, anemia and chronic bolld 
clotting problems as a result of her exposure to chemicals. When Toni ventures outside her home, 
she often wears a respirator with special filters to reduce the amount of chemicals reaching her nose 
and mouth. MCS may result from a single massive exposure to one or more toxic substances or 
repeated exposures to lower doses. On one hand, some people may become chemically sensitive 
following a toxic chemical spill at work or in their community or after being sprayed directly with 
pesticides. On the other hand, individuals may develop this condition from spending forty hours 
each week in a poorly ventilated building where they breathe a mixture of chemicals common to our 
modern way of life. </p>
<p>MCS affects the overall health and feeling of those with the disorder. It typically impairs many 
bodily functions including the nervous system and digestion. People with MCS experience a 
number of symptoms: headaches, asthma, increased sensitivity to odors, bloating short and 
long-term memory loss, dizziness and chronic exhaustion. These symptoms may, at times, seem like 
allergies because they tend to come and go with exposure to chemicals. </p>
<p>WHAT CAUSES MCS? In non-industrial workplaces, a number of common products and 
processes are often identified as contributing to the onset of MCS. These are off gassing of new 
carpets, cleaning supplies, pesticides and wood preservatives, new building materials and 
furnishings, toxic chemicals used in art, photography, printing, etc., formaldehyde in new clothes, 
inks, laser printer toner, house paints and vehicle exhaust fumes, perfumes, detergents, artificial 
colors, flavors and preservatives in food, drink and medicines.</p>
<p>When our bodies are assaulted with levels of toxic chemicals our system cannot safely process, it is 
likely that at some point in our life we will become sick due to the chemicals we are exposed to. 
For some, the result could be cancer or reproductive damage. Others may become hypersensitive 
to these chemicals or devlop other chronic disorders. Some people may not experience any 
noticeable negative health effects. The threshold for toxic injury is not the ame for everyone 
because sensitivity varies greatly among individuals. Most chemcials in consumer products are not 
tested for negative health effects such as cancer and reproductive problems nor for the impact of 
long-term low level exposure. The effects of these substances on women, children and people with 
existing conditions is also untested.</p>
<p>IS THERE A CURE FOR MCS? Though there is no cure for MCS, there are, at the present time, 
several treatment available that seem to improve the baseline health status of some patients. With 
the onset of MCS, a person's health generally continues to deteriorate. Signs of improvement 
usually occur only after the chemical sensitivity condition is uncovered and action is taken to avoid 
the chemical toxins at fault. </p>
<p>THE MCS CONTROVERSY Many traditional allergists and other physicians discount the MCS 
diagnosis. They claim that there is not yet sufficient evidence to substantiate that MCS exists. 
Research efforts regarding the mechanisms that cause MCS have been inadequate and 
unfortunately are often financed and supported by the industries which benefit from chemical 
proliferation. Generally, medical doctors have not yet been trained to understand nor have tehy 
seriously investigated MCS. </p>
<p>Fortunately for those afflicted with MCS, Toni Temple recently published, Healthier Hospitals, an 
MCS disability access manual. It was produced primarily to educate hospital administration, staff 
and medical personnel on proper care and consideration regarding the special needs of MCS 
patients. The 28-page manual is the direct result of the combined efforts of its author, Toni Temple 
and two local hospitals. It is hoped that Healthier Hospitals will improve access issues for those 
hospital patients who suffer from this widespread disability. Patients with MCS may have 
sensitivities to common chemicals. They can experience problems ranging from mild discomfort to 
severe, life-threatening reactions. &quot;This book was written,&#178; said Temple, &quot;because the needs of 
MCS patients were not being met simply because hospitals did not know what those needs were 
or how to accommodate them. This manual simplifies what can be done, how to make it work and 
creates good will and benefits for both the patient and the medical facility at very little or no cost. I 
feel this educational tool will help prevent further misunderstanding of chemical sensitivity disability 
and provide better health care for those with MCS.&quot; People who suffer from MCS typically spend 
most of their time in a &quot;sanctuary&quot; they create in their home which is free of chemical emissions. The 
amount of chemicals in our society is ever increasing. It is time people start using natural alternatives 
to these chemicals that are making people sick. For more information on MCS or to request a 
copy of the Healthier Hospitals manual contact Toni Temple at (216) 230-1985. Some of the 
information in this article was obtained from a booklet written by Tracy Frisch and published by the 
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity in the Workplace Taskforce, 33 Central Ave., Albany, NY 12210; 
(518) 426-8246. </p>

<h2 align=center>Clearcutting and Poisoning the Metroparks</h2>
<h5 align=center>by Kim Wendel</h5>
<p>The battle may be over, but can the war be won?</p>
<p>A group of Cleveland Metroparks users is concerned over the park's new guidelines over trimming 
and vegetative maintenance. Yes, the district's Board of Park Commissioners accepted the 
first-ever written guidelines for such matters, on Aug. 13. However, the commissioners did not vote 
to adopt them and have no plans to do so. </p>
<p>The Metroparks golf courses and the Cleveland Metroparks zoo are exempted from the guidelines, 
and they allow the use of herbicides and pesticides throughout the district. This bothers the park 
users. </p>
<p>&quot;Why should we [vote to adopt them]?&quot; Board President Fred Rzepka said Tuesday. &quot;First of all, I 
do not understand the total story because I am not a scientist. A group of people next year might 
decide that the guidelines are wrong, and I am not going to vote on an issue that may change next 
year. </p>
<p>&quot;Just let it [the guidelines] be there. As long as the staff is happy with it, we don't need to vote on 
it.&quot; </p>
<p>However, the users fear that the new guidelines are too broad to address specific issues&#139;such as 
why areas severely damaged by prior trimming are not being allowed to grow back naturally.</p>
<p>The new guidelines were developed with input from citizens, as well as Tom Stanley, the 
Metroparks' chief of natural resources, and Park Forestry managers. They were developed in the 
aftermath of a protest last March, over Executive Director Vern J. Hartenburg's clearcutting and 
trimming program in several Metroparks reservations, including Rocky River, Mill Stream and 
South Chagrin.</p>
<p>That program eradicated much undergrowth in some forested areas. Hartenburg said he ordered it 
in the name of safety, but the park users said it ruined the parks' natural look and robbed small 
animals of their habitat. As a result of the protests, Hartenburg immediately declared a 30-day 
moratorium on the trimming. The moratorium became permanent in May. </p>
<p>Also, park district commissioners removed Hartenburg from the trimming program and assigned it 
to Stanley. New guidelines were drawn up and accepted Aug. 13. In general, the new trimming 
guidelines give more power to each park reservation manager, who are best able to determine the 
needs of each reservation, commissioners said. The guidelines stress conservation and &quot;the natural 
system&quot; as the main considerations in making vegetative maintenance decisions. </p>
<p>But the angry park users from the South Chagrin Reservation, who launched the protest last 
March, fear that the work orders issued under the new guidelines will &quot;stretch the bounds&quot; of the 
guidelines.</p>
<p>Last month, three of the original 10 who had objected to Hartenburg's program voiced specific 
concerns. Among them, that the previously cleared areas in the South Chagrin Reservation, most 
notable the arboretum, were not being allowed to grow back to their natural state as promised. 
Instead, they continue to be mowed flush to the ground.</p>
<p>Moreland Hills residents Barbara Jung and Hobie Cleminshaw and Solon resident Pat Marshall cite 
loopholes and omissions in the guidelines that might provide a way to circumvent their usefulness. 
They also believe the use of herbicides and pesticides, which is deliberately not addressed in the 
guidelines, may be the next obstacle they have to surmount. </p>
<p>&quot;As the guidelines went through several drafts and revisions, the references to the use of herbicides 
were totally removed,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;They said the reason was because herbicides are too big of 
an issue to deal with in a guideline rundown. But we are seeing them use herbicides where they 
once were cutting underbrush or trimming around posts and trees. So, technically, they aren't 
trimming. </p>
<p>&quot;Although there are general signs posted at the entrances that herbicides are used in the 
reservations, I have never seen any signs to let the public know exactly when the area was last 
sprayed. Your kids and dogs could be rolling around in grass that was treated a half hour earlier 
with herbicides and you wouldn't know it. </p>
<p>&quot;They use it around picnic tables and rest rooms continually. &quot;That's a huge concern in my mind 
because they have been using herbicides in the parks for the past two years,&quot; she said. Marshall is 
strongly against the use of chemical management for control. &quot;The use of herbicides and pesticides 
should be closely examined, whether it is used in a reservation or a golf course,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>Stanley is working on the herbicide issue in each reservation. One suggestion would require park 
personnel to post small white signs after spraying, similar to those used by landscaping companies 
in residential neighborhoods. There is a reason why Stanley is addressing the herbicide issue 
separately. </p>
<p>Two of the areas where herbicides are used extensively are the park district's golf courses and the 
Cleveland Metropark Zoo. Those are also the two areas where extensive trimming and manicuring 
of the facilities are, by his own earlier admissions in April, most desired by Hartenburg. </p>
<p>Between the second draft of the guidelines, dated June 1, and the third draft, dated June 19, a 
section was inserted which stated that the guidelines were for all areas of all reservations, &quot;with the 
exception of golf courses and Cleveland Metroparks zoo.&quot; It is also between those two drafts that 
the reference to herbicide use was removed. </p>
<p>The park users vow to continue to monitor the district. They attend every board meeting and they 
hope they can affect changes in park district policies. They said at least one commissioner seemed 
to take their concerns seriously at the Aug. 13 board meeting. After a short discussion on the 
guidelines spearheaded by Vice President David W. Whitehead, he and the other two 
commissioners&#139;Rzepka and Vice President John K. O'Toole&#139;verbally agreed to &quot;see that the 
guidelines are at least implemented and followed.&quot; For more information call Barbara Jung at (216) 
247-7985. </p>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Our Code of Ethics, comprised of our Corporate Principles
and these Standards of Conduct, governs our business decisions
and actions.  The Code is an expression of fundamental values
and represents a framework for decision-making.  The Code is further
explained and implemented in policy clarification circulars and
policies included in the Corporate Policies Manual.  The integrity,
reputation, and profitability of United Technologies ultimately
depend upon the individual actions of our employees, representatives,
agents, and consultants all our the world.  Each is personally
responsible and accountable for compliance with our Code.  In
addition, any representatives, agents, or consultants utilized
by the Corporation shall be prohibited from acting on its behalf
in any manner which is inconsistent with the standards of conduct
applicable to employees under the Code of Ethics.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>These Standards of Conduct serve to assist in defining
our ethical principles and are not all-encompassing.  The Standards
must be interpreted within the framework of the laws and mores
of the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as in light
of UTC policies and good common sense.  Reasons such as &quot;everyone
does it&quot; or &quot;it's not illegal&quot; are unacceptable
as excuses for violating our Standards.  We must each be mindful
of avoiding at all times, on and off the job, circumstances and
actions that give even the appearance of an impropriety or wrongdoing
which could discredit the Corporation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>These standards of Conduct will be enforced equitably
at all organizational levels.<BR>

<H2>Reaching the global marketplace</H2>

<EM>The following remarks were prepared for delivery by <A HREF="/general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</A>, president and CEO of UT Automotive, at the SAE Global Vehicle Development Conference in Detroit on Thursday, Dec. 5, 1996.
</EM><p>

I'm very happy that UT Automotive was invited to be a part of this conference, and that I can be with you today. <p>
UT Automotive is just one piece of a very dynamic corporation. While most of you know about <A HREF="http://www.uta.com">UT Automotive</A>, I suspect that many of you aren't aware of the worldwide resources that stand behind our company.
Our company builds jet engines by <A HREF="http://www.pratt-whitney.com">Pratt & Whitney</A>, helicopters  by <A HREF="http://www.sikorsky.com">Sikorsky</A>, <A HREF="http://www.otis.com">Otis</A> elevators, <A HREF="http://www.carrier.com">Carrier</A> heating and air conditioning units, and UT Automotive systems.<p>
United Technologies is a company that operates on every continent of the world; a company whose vast global resources provide the service, experience and technology so much in demand by OEMs today. And UTC has products in every country in the world, except one -- North Korea.
<p>Speaking of global reach, more than half of UTC's revenues -- totaling more than $23 billion last year -- are generated outside of the United States.
The reason I'm telling you this is because our connection to United Technologies gives us a huge advantage over most other companies when moving into new markets. In most areas of the world where we want to expand our automotive business, our parent company has already paved the way.<p>
The building industry, for example, is one of the first industries to boom in a developing country. In fact, it's estimated that 30 percent of the world's high-rise building cranes are in China. And Otis and Carrier are building industry leaders.
Fifteen percent of UTC's work force -- or more than 25,000 employees -- are located in the Asia Pacific region. Last year, the company's revenues from that region were $2.7 billion. <p>
Let me use Otis' presence in China as an example. Otis, which entered China in 1900 with the sale of two elevators, established its first joint venture in the People's Republic of China in 1984. Today, Otis has four such ventures and employs more than 4,000 people in China.<p>
The Orient Pearl Television tower in Shanghai is one of Otis' major installations in China. At 1,509 feet, it's the third-tallest structure in the world.<p>
Otis also won the largest contract in China's elevator industry -- a project that involves 54 elevators and escalators and is worth nearly $9 million.<p>UTC as a whole has 16 joint ventures under way in China. Over the last five years company revenues there have totaled nearly $2 billion. In China alone, UTC is forecasting sales of more than $700 million in 1996.<p>
And UT Automotive reaps the benefits of these global resources by hitchhiking off their capabilities, knowledge and experiences.<p>
It's no secret that the greatest incremental growth potential for the automotive industry is in China and other Asia countries -- outside of Japan. Our  OEM customers are focusing on these opportunities.<p>
UT Automotive is moving aggressively into these emerging markets and, whenever possible, we are taking advantage of our position as a member of the UTC family to speed the process.<p>
UT Automotive sales to Asian-based automakers alone have more than tripled over the past four years -- from $70 million to nearly $250 million.
In Asia, we're taking steps to expand our operations through a number of joint ventures and partnerships.<p>

We've signed four such agreements with Asian companies over the past two years, including two in China -- one  to produce electrical distribution systems and engine cooling modules, and the other to produce automotive electrical distribution systems.<p>

And you can bet that United Technologies' past ventures in China and the relationship that has been already established with their government helped smooth our entry into the country.<p>

Our presence in Asia extends far beyond China, however. We're also very proud and excited about our main Asian operation in Cebu, the Philippines.<p>
We began operations in Cebu in May 1990 with only 190 employees. Today, we have 2,500 people in three manufacturing facilities and ship products to customers in Asia, Europe and North America.<p>

I've just returned from the Asia, where we announced plans to invest $5 million to open a new, 60,000-square-foot Engineering and Technology Center in Cebu. The new center will serve the entire Asian region, and will also support our efforts in North America and Europe. The new Philippine Engineering and Technology Center will provide all of our business units with a tremendous opportunity for new ventures in Asia.<p>

Another area of great interest to us is South America, where 30 percent growth in production is expected by the year 2000. To meet our customers' requirements and to successfully continue our global expansion process, we recently acquired a supplier of automotive wire harnesses based in Buenos Aires.<p>

As automakers increase their production of global vehicles, we want our products to be part of what they produce whether it's in North or South America, Europe or Asia. <p>

Our automotive operation is already a global player on its own. UT Automotive has more than 40,000 associates, 90 plants in 18 countries.<p>

And with the worldwide resources of UTC behind us, we're especially well-suited to partner with our customers in China, South America or anywhere else in the world.<p>

In addition to our North American operation, we have an organization in place in Europe that produced about $1 billion in sales last year.<p>
Our headquarters for Europe is in Paris. We have technical centers and sales offices in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Spain; and manufacturing plants in nine European countries that serve OEMs such as PSA, Renault, Volvo, Fiat and GM-Opel. <p>
One of our newest European facilities is in Hungary, which opened in 1991 and doubled its capacity in 1996.<p>

So, when people ask how we're going to execute a product development process outside of North America, I tell them we're already there.<p>

Today, for example, we are designing the wiring system for a  North American global platform vehicle.  That car, however, is being designed in Europe. So, to best service and support our customer's needs, we're designing the wiring system at our European facility in Germany.<p>
That vehicle will be produced in  North America, Europe, Asia and South America. And we're already gearing up to support the customer with wiring systems produced at our facilities in Mexico, Honduras, the Philippines, Portugal, Hungary, Poland and now Argentina.<p>

From our experiences, I can say that growing globally has many challenges. 
The biggest challenge is developing a management team, comprised of people from around the world who are capable of dealing with diverse cultures and are able to treat each individual equally and with dignity.<p>

But with every decision we've had to make, we've reminded ourselves of our goal, which is not necessarily to be the biggest in the world, but to be the best at what we do -- on a global basis.<p>

That means providing our customers with the best technology, the best products and at the lowest possible cost -- anywhere in the world.<p>
Clearly, our industry is faced with major challenges. And it will be interesting to see what additional changes and challenges we'll be facing in the year 2000.
But we at UT Automotive are looking forward to the journey.<p>
Again, thank you for inviting me to be a part of this morning's session. I'm looking forward to our roundtable discussion, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.

<H2>Managing the supply chain<p></H2><BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Following is the text of remarks prepared for delivery by <A HREF="/general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</A>, president and CEO of <A HREF="http://www.uta.com">United Technologies Automotive, Inc.</a> at the Automotive Industries  Executive Management Conference in Detroit on Tuesday, Oct. 29, 1996:
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentleman and thank you David for that fine introduction.
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this afternoon. We are seeing a dramatic change in the way our industry interacts with both its customers and its suppliers.
<p>Historically we've been an industry of evolutionary change . . . But what we are seeing today is not evolutionary . . . it is revolutionary . . . and will have a profound effect on the way we do business from now on.

<p>This revolution is being driven by two things: One, our customers, who are responding to the wants and needs of their customers; and two, by increased competition.
<p>This creates intense pressure on OEMs to develop new models faster, with higher quality and at lower costs than the competition.

<p>As a supplier we are under the same pressure to improve quality . . . reduce product development time . . . increase the services we provide to our customers    . . . and continually lower our costs.

<p>At UT Automotive we understand the ever increasing competitive environment we're in.
It's our intent to work harder and closer with the car companies, as well as our suppliers, to ensure future prosperity for all of us.

<p>Managing the supply chain means that as a Tier 1 supplier we no longer can mind only our own business -- we now need to have an understanding and knowledge of the process improvement actions of our suppliers.
How do we do that?

<p>We can't run their businesses for them . . . and we don't want to.

<p>The solution is in managing the process.

<p>At UT Automotive we intend to accomplish this task by building stronger relationships with, and becoming closer to our suppliers than ever before. And the reason is simple.
We cannot expect to operate effectively if we work independent of each other. We have to remember that our parts do not stand alone, they're all inter-related.

<p>We're much more interdependent than we are independent. The products we build interface with each other. We're all participating in putting the chunks of a vehicle together.  
For example, our company's electrical system is linked to other Tier 1's safety systems . . . to air conditioning and heating units . . . to the drive train and instrument panel . . . to interior trim    . . . and to braking systems.

<p>Our electrical system is linked to all other electrical components on a car or truck today.
All of these linkages require suppliers to interface with each other. Therefore, if we intend to provide our customers with the quality they're looking for, we will need to understand how our systems work together.    

<p>We'll only accomplish this task by building and establishing strong relationships with each other.
It will be through these relationships that we'll be able to talk to each other and share quality information . . . as well as acquire the knowledge necessary to become the world's best producers.					


<p>We all know our own products, designs and processes better than anyone else in the industry. Therefore, we need to share this information and make sure it flows through the system.

 <p>	So how are we going to do this? We have to work more openly and truly become partners with our suppliers.
We need first to build trust and a mutual understanding so that we both know where we are now . . . where we want to be in the future . . . and what we need to do to get there.

<p>We must change from the  past . . . change from the traditional way of managing suppliers to managing the process.

<p>And managing that process takes, again, trust, understanding, strong communications and training. But most of all, it takes time.

<p>We must learn to work out our problems as a team, not as adversaries searching for blame.
We must create an open environment where we all feel free to tell each other what's wrong . . . this is the only way we're going to understand problems and figure out solutions.
And the way to do this is to start communicating. The communications channel is the key to getting the quality our customers want. It will allow us to focus on getting the job done. 
It will help us to get accurate information . . . get the truth, even if it's painful . . . so we can make high quality decisions.

<p>At UT Automotive we are working hard to create an open communications environment with our suppliers.

<p>We're  asking our suppliers to take a chance with us. We want them to challenge us . . . to test us . . . to see if our word is good.
At our company we're really trying to do this. We've recognized this issue . . . we understand how important it is . . . and we're doing something about it.

<p>The following are just some of the programs we're putting in place to support our efforts: 

<p>First, we're training our management . . . we're teaching them to be responsible for creating an environment that encourages trust and open communications.

<p>So far, we've put about 1,500 people from our organization through this training session. And I personally participate for two hours in every training session we conduct.
In these training sessions, we're instructing our managers how to communicate to our suppliers . . . and how to get feedback from them that will help improve our products.

<p>We believe it's our responsibility as a Tier 1 supplier to make this happen. It's not the responsibility of our Tier 2 or 3's. We, as Tier 1 suppliers, need to take the lead on this.

<p>A second initiative, which our company introduced earlier this year, is our new product development launch process.

<p>One of our objectives is to bring our suppliers in on the ground floor. We believe it's very important to get them involved in the process right from the beginning.
We want to make sure that necessary changes and fixes are made early in the process . . . at little or no cost . . . rather than later at a higher cost.  

<p>This means we have to be able to share process information with our suppliers. 
This is one of the things we do differently than other Tier 1's. We share our product development process details with our suppliers. Our manual is at their disposal. We did this because we value the communication opportunity more than we value the secrecy of the process.
In order to get the quality we want, we must share information.  Our suppliers have to know everything we know.  

<p>Third, we've developed the UT Automotive Road Show program, where we visit a number of our suppliers and provide them with an opportunity to hear directly from their customer -- us --what's expected of them. 	

<p>At these Road Shows we present a basic message: If our suppliers don't have quality products, we won't have quality products . . . and if we don't have quality products, neither will our customers.

<p>The message is simple: Produce high quality products or we will find someone else who can.	
Fourth, we implemented a Partners in Excellence program, which we started in 1992, and is worldwide.

<p>This program identifies basic standardized principles, guidelines and performance expectations of UT Automotive suppliers.
It challenges our suppliers to be the best they can be . . . and it helps us recognize those suppliers who help us attain our goals.
In order for our suppliers to qualify for a Partners in Excellence Award, they must achieve quality levels equal to or less than 50 parts per million for a minimum of six months . . . a continuous delivery rating equal to 100 percent . . . and commercial, technological and system ratings of 85 percent or better.

<p>And fifth, we're inviting suppliers to attend our Kaizen programs, so together we can find new ways to improve our processes and our performance.
The programs I mentioned are just some of the processes we're implementing at UT Automotive to ensure that our customers receive products that are high quality, exciting and add value.
The suppliers who help us reach our aggressive goals will be the ones with whom we'll build our future relationships.

<p>We want suppliers who will take on the responsibility of bringing ideas to the table . . . who design and build products that work . . . have zero defects . . . and are inexpensive.
The suppliers that can do this will be the suppliers that will be with us for many years to come.
One thing is clear -- the playing field is much larger, it's global, it's more competitive, faster changing, and more complex than businesses have ever had to play on.
Playing successfully on such a field will not be easy.  It will require OEMs and the total supply chain to work effectively together as a team. 

<p>Again, this means cleaner lines of communications, higher quality products and trust.	

We must not be afraid to change . . . and we must not be afraid to do the things we need to do to assure we're one of the players in the future. 

Remember what FDR said: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

Thank you very much.

<H2>Conference on Improving Trade Relations
Between Italy and Michigan
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Following is the text of remarks prepared for delivery by <A HREF="/general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</A>, president and CEO of <A HREF="http://www.uta.com">United Technologies Automotive, Inc.</a> at the Conference on Improving Trade Relations
Between Italy and Michigan on Monday, September 23, 1996:


</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><p>




Grazie Signore Infusino, per la gentile presentazione.<p>

E buonigiorno Signore e Signori. Un rigraziamento particolare al Dottor Quaroni, il nostro Console Italiano, e all'lngegner Alberto Negro, dal Fiat, che risiedono entrambi qui a Detroit. Vorrei dare inoltre un benvenuto specials a tutti I visitatori italiani present) in sale . . .<p>

and good morning ladies and gentleman. My special thanks to Dr. Quaroni, our Italian Consul, and to Mr. Alberto Negro who are both located here in Detroit. I'd also like to extend a special welcome to all of the Italian visitors in our audience. <p>



Our thanks also to Mr. Wagner of Macomb Community College, and Congressman Bonier for putting this program together.<p>

Italy is an important cornerstone in the global business operations of both United Technologies and UT Automotive. And you'll frequently hear Italian spoken at UT Automotive facilities in Dearborn and throughout our operations in European.<p>

And I'm pleased United Technologies could be part of today's program.<p>


In fact, worldwide Italian is the fourth most widely used language among UT Automotive employeesafter Spanish, English and Portuguese. <p>





Before going any farther I'd like to give you a brief overview of UTC and UT Automotive. UTC:<p>

Ranks among the top 150 companies on Fortune Magazine's Global 500 list.

 We operate on every continent of the world.<p>

 And UTC generates more than half of its $23 billion in annual revenue outside of the United States. Very few U.S. companies can make that claim today.<p>



Some of the exciting products UTC builds include:

<ul><li>Jet engines


<li>Helicopters


<li>Elevators


<li>Heating and air conditioning units


<li>and, automotive systems</ul>


 



In terms of global reach, UTC has products in every single country in the world, but one.<p>

Now let's turn to UT Automotive. Our company has $3 billion in revenues or 14% of UTC. We have more than 40,000 employees worldwide, located in more than 90 plants in 17 countries. And we are among the world's 25 largest suppliers of systems and components for the auto industry.<p>

We deal in huge volumes....for example, we deliver more than 200,000 wiring harnesses with more than 7 million terminals per day to our OEM customers.<p>




We supply components for seven of the world's 10 best-selling vehicle platforms.<p>

In Europe, which accounts for 30 percent of our business, we employee about 11,000 people and have 21 manufacturing plants in nine countries.<p>

Our European operations is a leader in motors and electrical systems.<p>



Our electric motors are an important and growing part of our business, especially in Italy. Our motors business:<p>

 Increased 50% in North America in the last five years<p>

		Is expected to increase 10-15% by year 
2000<p>

 Accounts for 25% of our European sales, and is
expected to increase significantly by the end of the
decade.<p>


Fiat and PSA are UT Automotive's largest motors customers in Europe.<p>



Now let's talk just about Italy. In Italy alone, UT Automotive, together with the other divisions of UTC generate more than $650 million...or 991.6 billion lira...and we employ more than 5,300 people.<p>


Our company does many things in Italy, but one of the most significant is the Sistine Chapel, where our Carrier division installed and maintains the air conditioning and air handling system that protects Michelangelo's frescoes.<p>



Our relationship with the Italian automotive industry is mutually beneficial. Our Pratt & Whitney division's PW4000 engines . . .<p>

. . . and Boeing's new 777 uses a gear box made in Italy by Fiat.<p>


Located in Asti, Italy is UT Automotive's motor operations, called Gate. They are a leading European manufacturer of:<p>

 Electric motors and<p>
 Electromechanical components for the auto industry<p>





Gate was acquired by UT Automotive in 1983, and has more than 1,000 employees and generates nearly $200 million ...or 305.1 billion lira...in revenue annually.<p>
On Fiat's new Bravo. . .<p>

. . . and Brava car lines, we supply 100% of the:  Washer assemblies  Wiper motors  And radiator cooling modules<p>





We've been very successful and have had a wonderful experience working with the Italian people. We have found them to be: Team-oriented Cooperative Highly skilled, and Easy to build relationships with.

In summary, gliItaliani sono molto sinpatico.<p>
In the future, our primary competitive challenge as a Tier One supplier is becoming global, capable of supporting vehicle platforms like the Fiat Brava and Bravo worldwide.<p>




We at UT Automotive are moving aggressively into emerging markets to meet this challenge. Last year, we established two new joint ventures in China, and this year we announced entries into Thailand and Argentina.<p>


As we continue to grow, we look forward to supporting and building stronger relationships with our Italian partners in Italy, here in Michigan as well as around the world.<p>

Grazie, and I'm looking forward to your questions later in the program.

<H2>Challenges for Success
</H2><p>
	
<IMG SRC="/media/1996/sep_oct/aiag2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="286" BORDER="0" HSPACE="2" VSPACE="2"> 
<EM>Following is the text of remarks as prepared for delivery by <A HREF="/general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</A>, president and CEO of United Technologies Automotive, Inc. at the <A HREF="http://www.aiag.org/">Automotive Industry Action Group's (AIAG)</A> annual Achievement Awards dinner in Detroit on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 1996:
</EM><p>

	<p>Thank you Derryl, and good evening ladies and gentlemen.
	<p>It's a real honor for me and for United Technologies to have a part in tonight's tenth annual AIAG Outstanding Achievement Awards program.
	<p>As many of you know, Derryl is one of the chief architects of  AIAG's new strategic plan. He's been active in AIAG for a number of years and has been instrumental in marshaling the resources of <A HREF="http://www.gm.com/">General Motors</A> behind the organization.	
	<p>Tonight's a special night for AIAG and the winners of the organizations Outstanding Achievement Award.
	<p>Like the industry it serves,  AIAG has undergone a tremendous amount of change and growth in the past several years. 
	<p>Change brings challenge and tonight I'd like to discuss some of the challenges that I see facing our industry ... and  AIAG and Tier One suppliers like UT Automotive.
	<p>Most of you know about UT Automotive, but I suspect that many of you arent aware of the worldwide resources that stand behind our company.
	<p>As you saw in the video, our company builds jet engines ... helicopters ... elevators ... heating and air conditioning units ... and automotive systems.
	<p><A HREF="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies</A> is a company that operates on every continent of the world ... a company whose vast global resources provide the service, experience and technology so much in demand by OEM manufacturers today.
	<p>Speaking of global reach, did you know that more than half of UTC's revenue,  totaling more than &#36;23 billion, is generated outside of the United States&#63;  Very few U.S. companies can make that claim today.
	<p>UTC also has product in every country in the world, but one.
	<p>UTCs <A HREF="http://www.otis.com/">Otis</A> operation alone has offices in nearly 2,000 cities around the world. And they have the largest number of employees in the former Soviet Union of any foreign company, with nearly 14,000 in Russia and the Ukraine.
	<p>In fact, the majority of Otis employees speak Russian, not English.
	<p>Our automotive operation is a global player on its own, and with the worldwide resources of UTC behind us, we're especially well-suited to partner with our customers anywhere in the world.
	<p>To point out just how truly international we are,  the most commonly spoken language by the people of UT Automotive isn't  English . . . it's Spanish.
	<p>UT Automotive has more than 40,000 associates, 90 plants in 17 countries around the world. About 30 percent of our business in Europe.
	<p>Last year our revenues topped the &#36;3 billion mark for the first time -- up 14 percent  from the previous year.  
	<p>Our people, however, are our most important assets. I'd like to take a minute to tell you about what were doing to invest in our people right here in the United States.  We offer our employees a scholar program that:
	<UL>
<LI>Covers 100 percent of all tuition costs.
<LI>Pays for 100 percent of all course-required books and fees.
<LI>Grants 50 percent of all classroom hours as paid time off for degree courses.
<LI>Places no limits on the number of courses taken or what courses are taken . . . it can be in any field. And,
<LI>Awards employees with 50 shares of Company stock, currently selling at about &#36;115 a share, for the completion of any undergraduate or graduate degree program.
</UL>
<p>	UT Automotive's primary products are electrical systems and automotive interior components and systems. We supply parts for seven of the world's 10 best-selling vehicle platforms.
	<p>And as you might suspect, we deal in huge volumes.
	<p>For example, we deliver more than 200,000 wiring harnesses with a total of more than 7 million terminals to our OEM customers on a daily basis.
 <p>	If stretched end to end, the wiring harnesses we produce each day would circle more than 75 percent of the world. 
	<p>We're also optimistic about our future ... as well as the future of our industry.
	<p>We expect light vehicle production and sales in both North America and Europe to remain relatively stable over the next two to three years, though we expect some moderate slowdown in U.S. vehicle sales as we move into 1997.
	<p>At the same time, we expect trucks -- thank goodness for those minivans and SUVs -- to continue their record sales pace.
	<p>New vehicles planned by Japanese automakers in North America will provide some of us with additional growth opportunities as well. Our sales to the Japanese now account for more than 10 percent of our U.S. revenue and those sales will continue to grow.
	<p>In a relatively flat market with some incremental vehicle capacity, OEMs will place more and more emphasis on cost-cutting ... which in turn will place added pressure on all of us who are Tier One suppliers.
	<p>Vehicle production in emerging markets such as China, Thailand and South America, on the other hand, is growing at a relatively strong pace of about 16 to 20 percent annually.
	<p>With that in mind, we're moving aggressively into emerging markets.  Last year, for example, we established two new joint ventures in China, and  we recently announced entries into Thailand and Argentina.
	<p>Our sales to Asian-based automakers alone have more than tripled over the past four years, from &#36;70 million to nearly &#36;250 million last year.
	<p>One of the biggest unknowns facing our industry today, of course, is the outcome of the UAW negotiations, especially as those talks relate to outsourcing.  
	<p>Outsourcing decisions will have a major impact on our entire industry.  We're all hopeful that contract issues can be resolved without a major shutdown. With today's reliance on just-in-time delivery systems,  a labor dispute could have a serious impact on all of us.
	<p>But outsourcing and labor disputes aren't the only challenges facing our industry today.
	<p>Its no secret to any of you that our industry is undergoing dramatic change ... especially as it relates to the cost and capital structure of Tier One suppliers.  
	<p>Some of that change may not be for the best.  Stock analysts are warning investors about companies:
	<ul><li>That increase revenue without regard to prudent capital utilization.
		<li>	That show rapid revenue growth that might mask internal cost problems. Or
	<li>	That fail to fully integrate new business or acquisitions into day-to-day operations.</ul>
	<p>As suppliers and OEM manufacturers, we need to ask ourselves some fairly tough questions in todays rapidly changing business environment.  Here are some at the top of my list
	<p>For starters, there's a feeling that we need to be "big" to survive.  But, do we really believe that growth by merger or acquisition is the best course of action for Tier One suppliers&#34;  
	<p>For the past several years, the news has been filled with stories about automotive-related acquisitions and mergers ... and you can be sure more are in the works.  
	<p>But interest in mergers seems to run in cycles and this particular cycle may run its course sooner than we think. Some analysts already have pulled out their yellow caution flags.
	<p>At UT Automotive our goal is not necessarily to be the biggest, but to be the very best at what we do ... on a global basis.
	<p>That means providing our customers with the best technology, the best products, at the lowest possible cost ... anywhere in the world.
	<p>We're also asking ourselves what the OEMs will want or need in an "integrated systems" supplier. And, perhaps more importantly, what is the definition of an integrated system&#63; We think
each OEM customer describes it differently. UT Automotive was one of the first suppliers to provide its OEM customers with integrated systems in the early 1990s.
	<p>But I believe our customers will be better served if we offer quality systems that perhaps dont provide everything in one bundle, but are better suited to their special product wants and needs.
	<p>We're now doing market research, providing design support and developing new technologies and products.
	<p>In addition, Tier Two and Tier Three suppliers will have to assume some of that responsibility in the relatively near future, particularly for product quality.  And that will be a major challenge for all of us.
	<p>Along with the challenge of providing full systems support come the issues of accountability, product reliability and warranty costs.  We have a tremendous opportunity here. 
	<p>I believe the first step in being responsible and improving vehicle quality is to improve communications on the performance of vehicles in the field.
	<p>We must set up systems and processes between OEMs and suppliers that will provide this information exchange. 
	<p>Our company has taken the lead on this in many respects. We were the first supplier to deliver report cards on ourselves to our customers on field reliability.
	<p>This is one of the biggest opportunities we have to improve quality and cost.
	<p>Our plates are fuller than they've ever been before.  We have more responsibilities.
	<p>Our programs are more complex and they're becoming more difficult to manage. And we're being held more and more accountable for the final product.
	<p>And make no mistake, OEM pressure to reduce cost will continue and even increase in years to come.
	<p><A HREF="http://www.chryslercorp.com/">Chrysler</A>, for example, recently announced that its SCORE -- Supplier Cost Reduction Effort -- had shaved &#36;1 billion off the company's 1996-model &#36;35 billion parts bill.
	<p>And both <A HREF="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</A> and Chrysler are on record with plans to reduce their parts costs five percent annually over the next several years.
	<p>That brings me to our final challenge -- the challenge of going global.  For Tier One, Two and Three suppliers, the ability to support global OEM sourcing requirements is becoming the "price of entry" for some, if not all, OEM business.  
	<p>But should or can every Tier Two or Three supplier develop an international presence&#63;  It's not really a question of desire or interest.  Its a question of financial ability. 
	<p>In many cases, "going global" can stretch a companys financial and human resources to the breaking point.
	<p>Clearly our industry is faced with major challenges.  Were fortunate, therefore, to be part of an organization like AIAG ... and organization that helps each of us meet and manage those challenges.
	<p>And by the way, don't think of AIAG as a separate staff or organization. As Ray Mitzel likes to point out ... the members <EM>are</EM> the organization. We ... you and me ... are AIAG.
	<p>During any given month of the year, more than 1,000 volunteers from 1,200 member companies are involved in meetings aimed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness of our industry.
	<p>As our industry changes, I see new challenges for AIAG as well. First, as we go global,  we'll need to have AIAG go global with us.  
	<p>The entire industry, car makers and suppliers, need AIAG's support more than ever to establish standardization and put systems and processes in place as we enter overseas markets that will help us to be more effective and meet our just-in-time objectives.
	<p>I also challenge AIAG to place more emphasis on computer standardization.
	<p>Today,  processing an order or exchanging product information can be a needlessly complicated process.
	<p>For example, the person at the parts plant who is processing a shipment for Ford enters the information into his computer using one process. If the next order is for a GM or Chrysler customer,  he has to use a totally different process to enter the same basic information. That means he has to start from scratch. All of that takes time, and it also increases the possibility of error.
	<p>Earlier this summer, AIAG sent out a survey to the CEOs of nearly 700 companies that manufacture automotive parts. Only 32 percent responded.  And that's clearly not enough.
	<p>UT Automotive was one of the companies that is involved. <A HREF="/general/people/lloyd.htm">Jim Lloyd</A>, our vice president for Information and Network Resources, recently was elected to AIAGs Board of Directors.
	<p>And Jack Tyson,  a UT Automotive manager for business improvement systems and process management, co-chairs AIAG's QS-9000 Sub-Tier Deployment effort.
	<p>If you and your company aren't actively involved in AIAG's day-to-day business, you should be.  Here are four AIAG initiatives that warrant your immediate attention:
	<ul><li>AutoSTEP is a program that you should know about by concept if not by name. Its mission is to eliminate redundant CAD systems along with associated maintenance and training costs. If successful, the program could  save our industry hundreds of millions of dollars.
	<li>	The QS-9000 Sub-Tier Deployment project is designed to extend QS-9000 beyond Tier One to Tier Two and Three suppliers. A number of UT Automotive associates are involved in this  effort. Is there a need?  </ul>
	<p>AIAG surveyed  Tier  Two and Three suppliers in Michigan earlier this year and 61 percent said they needed QS-9000 training and 47 percent said they were operating without a QS-9000 quality manual.
	<ul><li>	MAP, which I referred to earlier, is another program that deserves your attention. The Manufacturing Assembly Pilot is an effort to develop EDI (electronic data interchange), e-mail and standardized business processes to move scheduling information through the supply chain, from OEMs down through Tier 4. The estimated savings for North American OEMs and their suppliers could exceed &#36;1 billion per year, or more than &#36;70 per car when fully implemented.
	<li>ANX, or the Automotive Network eXchange project, is a fourth program that deserves your attention.  Its goal is to develop a single electronic network and standard for supply chain communications.  A pilot program will begin shortly with a full rollout planned for 1997.  As suppliers, however,  we each need to ask ourselves:
	<li>	Does my company have the ability to connect to the new Auto Industry Internet when the time comes. And,
	<li>	Does my company have the skilled personnel and technology to support access to the new network? </ul>
<p>As OEMs outsource more, links needed to exchange data become more and more critical. To succeed in these initiatives, AIAG needs your active participation.  Tonight's program honors companies and individuals who have made exceptional contributions to AIAG and to its programs -- programs which each and every one of us benefits from.
	<p>So if your company and its employees aren't already involved, decide to do something about it tonight.  
	<p>A lot still needs to be done. Despite the fine work AIAG has done to develop standards for our industry, there are far too many exceptions to standards that already exist.
	<p>AIAG needs to revisit and tighten those standards. And AIAG needs to help us go global with them as well.
	<p>In just the last four years.  AIAG has grown by nearly 75 percent. With your active participation we can continue that growth rate through the year 2000 ... put life into important projects like AutoSTEP, MAP, ANX and QS-9000 Deployment ... and meet the new challenges of a global marketplace. 
	<p>It will be interesting to see what the future holds ... and what additional changes and challenges we'll be facing in the Year 2000.
	<p>We at UT Automotive look forward to the journey ... and hope that all of you in this room will be there with us.
	<p>Thank you, and now let's get on with the Outstanding Achievement Awards program.

United Technology Automotive and Planar Systems Inc. have jointly developed a prototype electroluminescent display (ELD) for automotive applications.</p>

ELD, unlike liquid crystal display, does not require a supplemental light source. It also has a wider viewing range and a broader temperate range for operation.</p>

Applications range from dashboard display to radio/CD tuner readouts.</p>

The technology was developed from military technology. A spokeswoman says in the military application the screens could literally be hosed down along with the vehicle without ill effect.</p>

UTA also has developed a new concept called "Smart" Junction Box (SJB) technology.</p>

The SJB concept integrates electronic functions and existing power functions into a single unit. The SJB requires fewer interconnections, smaller packaging, fewer parts, faster design and other advantages, the company says.
In another consolidation, UTA also unveiled its new integrated liftgate multiplexed module.</p>

The module incorporates controls for liftgate lock/unlock, release, wiper, heated backlight, license plate lamps and center, high mounted stop light. The six operations previously required three motors and a series of wires, relays and electronics.</p>

The Geneva mechanism, the heart of the new liftgate module, consists of a central cam and three shafts that turn using a series of cam followers. Each shaft controls one of three mechanical functions. The mechanism is driven by a single, permanent-magnet DC motor. 	Jeff Green<!--footer begins here-->

                            IOWA CITY, Iowa -- One day last winter Bill
                            Kubik parked outside the guard shack, passed
                            through the gate in the barbed wire fence, walked to
                            his big office and sat at the desk under the framed
                            sign that said Sweat the Details.</p>


                            He was on edge. Understandably so.</p>


                            The new boss was coming. Direct from Dearborn.
                            And Kubik, general manager of a United
                            Technologies Corp. plastic auto parts plant
                            supplying Chrysler Corp. and Toyota Motor Co.,
                            knew the new boss' reputation:</p>


                            Turnaround expert. A regular Mr. Fix-it. Full of
                            Japanese business buzzwords. Harvard Business
                            Review even had praised the guy as an efficiency
                            expert when he ran UTC's Pratt & Whitney turbine
                            airfoil plant.</p>


                            Now he was Kubik's boss. His name was Ed
                            Northern. A short block of a man with thick black
                            hair and a trace of native Kentucky in his accent, he
                            walked into the Iowa City plant and asked a blunt
                            question.</p>


                            "What the hell's the fence for?" </p>


                            An anxious Kubick wasn't sure. </p>


                            No one knew why a fence surrounded the factory.
                            It always had been there.</p>


                            "I didn't understand why it was up here either,"
                            Kubik said. "I always wanted to take it down."</p>


                            So the fence came down. Along with the guard
                            shack. It was only the start.</p>


                            Mr. Fix-it had arrived.</p>


                            To improve, not sell</p>


                            Northern intends to push his 6,000-employee
                            enterprise, a UTC auto parts division considered
                            ripe for the sales block by some financial analysts,
                            into the top tier of parts makers in America and the
                            world.</p>


                            "I was sent here on a mission to fix it. Not sell it.
                            Anyone can sell it," Northern said.</p>


                            He's starting with Iowa City and a handful of the
                            other plants in his domain, the Interiors division of
                            United Technologies' Automotive division. </p>


                            With 40,000 employees in 89 plants worldwide,
                            Dearborn-based UT Automotive ranks among the
                            nation's 25 largest auto parts makers in terms of
                            annual sales of $3.06 billion.</p>


                            Today, however, even $3-billion parts suppliers are
                            vulnerable as takeover targets. Big parts makers are
                            buying smaller ones. It's happening because car
                            companies want parts makers to cut costs. The Big
                            Three want entire component systems delivered
                            ready for installation on the vehicle assembly lines. </p>


                            UT Automotive President Norman Bodine, a
                            physicist in charge of UTC's automotive business
                            since 1992, has staked out a strategy at odds with
                            industry consolidation.</p>


                            Rather than buy, say, a seat maker in a quest for
                            economies of scale, or sell off a so-so division,
                            Bodine said UTA can thrive if it focuses on higher
                            quality and lower production costs. First, though, he
                            has reshuffled the executive ranks.</p>


                            Bodine created the position of technology director
                            to stimulate research and development. He filled it
                            with Masazumi Sone of Nissan Motor Co.
                            New managers head three of UTA's five divisions.
                            They include Edwin Buker, a former BMW
                            manufacturing executive now at the Wiring division,
                            and Kathleen Ligocki, who came to the Motors
                            division from UTC's Carrier subsidiary in Paris.</p>


                            Nowhere has the new strategy been more stark than
                            in the Interiors division. </p>


                            Interiors are key</p>


                            "For UTA to win, Interiors needs to win. My job is
                            to come here and get Interiors to be a world-class
                            business," Northern said. "But first we had to put
                            lean thinking into Automotive. Our philosophy is
                            small is better. Lean is better. Simple is better."</p>


                            Since Northern arrived in January, Interiors has
                            stepped up research on future products such as a
                            table that folds out from tailgates of sport-utility
                            vehicles, to make tailgate parties more fun.</p>


                            Aiding the research effort, Northern said, are about
                            200 engineers and technical employees hired in
                            recent months. Plans call for hiring another 150, a
                            move that would increase Interiors' salaried staff by
                            more than 20 percent in one year.</p>


                            And the division has tried to pare costs. Kevin
                            Smith, an ex-Toyota Motor Co. purchasing
                            executive joined as purchasing manager. Smith
                            intends to slim Interiors' list of 1,400 suppliers to no
                            more than 140.</p>

                            In the plants, starting in Iowa City, Northern
                            emphasized lean manufacturing, a concept that
                            seeks minimum waste to maximize profits. He
                            brought in as head of manufacturing Garrett Mikita,
                            an engineer who made his mark as a cost-cutter at
                            Pratt & Whitney.</p>


                            Northern figures lean manufacturing techniques soon
                            will leave him with surplus factory capacity. UTA
                            Interiors plants already are set to close in Howe,
                            Ind., and Morganfield, Ky., although Northern
                            expects no wholesale shutdown among Interiors' 19
                            remaining plants.</p>


                            R&D efforts soon can help fill the surplus capacity
                            with new products like the fold-out table and
                            instrument panels with built-in road maps, he said.</p>


                            "We need to be the best of the best at what we're
                            doing," Northern said.</p>


                            Write it here</p>

                            Small. Lean. Simple. It sounds easy.</p>


                            Bill Kubik found otherwise.</p>


                            Automotive engineers talked for years about getting
                            efficient. Really efficient. Tradition always interfered.</p>


                            What it came down to was this: You bought the big
                            plastic injection molding machines and stamping
                            presses. Then you ran them flat out. </p>


                            Boxes of raw material piled up everywhere. Pallets
                            of finished products filled the warehouse. That was
                            tradition.</p>


                            Everyone had heard of lean manufacturing. Iowa
                            City managers and their bosses in Dearborn even
                            tried a few lean steps, like just-in-time delivery. But
                            the steps were small. Cautious.</p>


                            "The guys at Interiors hadn't really done this before,"
                            Kubik said. "That causes you to struggle with it a bit
                            more."</p>


                            Then came Northern. He knew money was wasted
                            in the fence and the guards and especially in the
                            traditions: unopened boxes of raw material, stacks
                            of warehoused auto parts, design engineers who
                            barely consulted with toolmakers and manufacturing
                            engineers.</p>


                            And he knew who could scrub away Iowa City's
                            traditions: Shingijutisu, pronounced
                            shing-uh-juh-its-sue.</p>


                            Today, the name rolls off the tongue of workers in
                            Iowa City as smoothly as if they were saying,
                            "Budweiser." No wonder.</p>

                            Shingijutisu is a consulting firm formed by a band of
                            retired Toyota manufacturing executives. They've
                            put on nine Iowa City workshops, using Toyota's
                            efficient production system as a model for cutting
                            waste.</p>


                            "Ed had worked with the Shingijutisu people, who
                            are the key to this whole thing," Kubik said. "They
                            live the manufacturing experience."</p>


                            The 850-employee Iowa plant makes instrument
                            panels, arm rests, center consoles, door trim and
                            covers for passenger air bags. Under the Toyota
                            system, that's thought to be excess variety. Workers
                            can't focus on one part long enough to get good at
                            making it.</p>


                            So Iowa City was designated UTA's center of
                            excellence for instrument panels. The plant received
                            an instrument panel order scheduled for future
                            production at Bay Valley, Mich. It sent some door
                            panel production to Wauseon, Ohio.</p>


                            The supervisory staff was reorganized. Before, a
                            process engineer was like a firefighter, working
                            Monday on a problem on the instrument panel line,
                            Tuesday on the arm rest line.</p>


                            Now, each product line is assigned a permanent
                            engineer, accountant and manager. Instead of only
                            fighting daily fires, they can think ahead. "Probably
                            the biggest benefit is it allows you to focus
                            resources," Kubik said.</p>


                            Simple recommendations emerged. To streamline
                            manufacturing, crews moved more than 250 pieces
                            of equipment, including a 3,000-ton stamping press.
                            The work stunned some Iowa City engineers.
                            Relocating the machinery was a long task. The
                            engineers doubted Dearborn ever would have
                            permitted it in the old days.</p>

                            "People will say you don't have time to do this. I say
                            you don't have time not to do it," Northern said.
                            "My job is to be a change agent."</p>

                            Take the 34,000-square-foot welding shop at Iowa
                            City. It ran full bore as long as the machinery was up
                            to it. Shingijutisu advised otherwise.</p>
 

                            If Chrysler installs an instrument panel every 69
                            seconds in a car in Belvidere, Ill., then weld a
                            crossbeam every 69 seconds in Iowa City. Don't
                            weld as many crossbeams as you can. Weld as
                            many as you need.</p>


                            More common sense prevailed. Workers on the
                            two long welding lines worked 10 hours a day.
                            After meeting with Shingijutisu, one line was looped
                            into a tight horseshoe and the second will be.</p>

                            On the shorter line, work stations are spaced close
                            so a worker can do two or three jobs instead of the
                            one dictated by the longer welding line. Looping the
                            second line will let the shop get by with three fewer
                            welders and, at production speeds geared to
                            Belvidere, end the overtime.</p>

                            "We can reduce the cost of components by 25
                            percent for the car companies," Northern said.</p>


                            The fence and guard shack are gone. And
                            something else has changed since Mr. Fix-it arrived.</p>


                            The Sweat the Details sign disappeared.</p>


                            "Ed said, 'That's a good poster but it's not good for
                            you. What you need is something about leadership,'
                            " Kubik said.</p>


                            So Kubik found a new sign. It shows charging
                            horses and the legend: The speed of the leader
                            determines the rate of the pack. <!--footer begins here-->

    <H2>A brief history of UT Automotive</h2>

    <p>
    The roots of UT Automotive go back to 1930, when Essex Wire Corp. was founded in
    Detroit, Mich. Essex formed its automotive division the same year and began
    manufacturing and selling automotive wire assemblies. At the time, the
    company's only manufacturing facility was located in a leased section of the
    Ford Motor Company Plant in Highland Park, Michigan. Essex was limited to
    one product - electrical wire harness for the Ford Model A.
    <p>
    In 1965 Essex became a publicly held company with its shares listed on the
    New York Stock Exchange, and in 1968 the company name was changed to Essex
    International, Inc. It was acquired by United Aircraft Corp. in 1974. In
    1975, UAC changed its name to <a href="http://www.utc.com/"> United
    Technologies Corp.</a>
    <p>
    United Technologies Automotive was formally founded in 1979, when
    <a href="http://www.utc.com/">UTC</a> combined the automotive operations of
    Essex with its Ambac subsidiary.
    <p>
    UT Automotive boasts the broadest product line of any tier-one supplier. We are the
    only major supplier capable of producing an entire interior system, from
    switches to molded components to headliners and steering wheels. This
    capability makes us uniquely suited to provide a system that guarantees
    the fit and finish of components.

<P>
The Partners in Excellence Supplier Management Policy was developed
through the cooperative efforts of all UT Automotive's
business units, in order to standardize and communicate the methods
by which UT Automotive manages its supply base.  The ultimate responsibility
of the Supplier Management Policy rests with UT Automotive's
Purchasing Council and is administered through corporate Quality
and Supplier Development.  Management reviews are conducted periodically
to ensure the effectiveness of the program.e program.<BR>

<P>
UT Automotive has implemented its supply management policy in the spirit
of continuous improvement, and is confident that the requirements
set forth will enhance quality systems, improve process efficiencies,
and ultimately reduce total costs for the design and manufacture
of our automotive products.  UT Automotive encourages suppliers to strive
for advancements in technology, quality, and service beyond the
requirements set forth in this document.<BR>

<P>
The concepts of the Partners in Excellence Supplier Management
Policy were developed around UT Automotive's
Quality Policy, which has been endorsed by UT Automotive's
president and the senior executive of each UT Automotive business unit.
 The policy is as follows:<BR>


<UL>
<LI><I>Make our customer our focus.  Provide continuous improvement of the quality   of
      products and services to our customer.</I><BR>

<LI><I>Design and produce a product that fulfills the needs of our customer.</I><BR>

<LI><I>Eliminate waste and produce our product at the lowest cost.</I><BR>

<LI><I> Every person must fully understand their role on the team in producing a  quality
       product.</I><BR>
</UL>

<P>
The Partners in Excellence Supplier Management Policy, with its
associated documents (see Appendix D), establishes the minimum
requirements for UT Automotive's
supplier quality systems.  The Quality System Requirements QS-9000,
and all documents referenced within it, as well as ISO 9001 and
various customer requirements, form a part of this Partners in
Excellence policy.  This manual is considered incomplete without
the associated documents.<BR>

<P>
The topics covered in this policy establish requirements that
are specific to UT Automotive, and may not be currently covered in QS-9000,
or further emphasize or clarify an existing requirement.  References
to QS-9000 are made throughout this policy =  "Apply
QS-9000 ..." These references are offered to assist in the application of the policy
and are not meant to be exclusive of any part of QS-9000.  There
may be procedures issued from individual UT Automotive facilities, to accompany
this policy in directing the interface between a supplier and
a UT Automotive manufacturing facility.  UT Automotive plant procedures are in accordance
with the requirements of QS-9000, and in line with the concepts
of this policy.<BR>
<P>

<U><B>Revisions<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
This is the October, 1995 edition of the Partners in Excellence
Supplier Management Policy.  All previous editions, including
the system, commercial and technology surveys, are obsolete. 
Updates to this policy, including associated appendices, will
be made and reviewed by management periodically.  Direct comments,
suggestions and requests for additional copies to:<BR>

<b>1.1.1   Mission Statement </b><P>
UT Automotive is committed to the attainment of the highest standards of quality in all purchased products and services.  It is UT Automotive policy to purchase all equipment, supplies and services on the basis of merit.  We emphasize fair competition without discrimination or misrepresentation, in a manner consistent with long term business relationships.<br><p>
<b> 1.1.2  Purpose </b><p>
UT Automotive's Partners in Excellence are intended to communicate the initial and on-going requirements for supplier quality systems and performance.  UT Automotive relies on suppliers to continuously improve performance, engage in joint sharing of information, and develop productive, long-term relationships with UT Automotive.  The importance of the Partners in Excellence program is emphasized by its inclusion as a requirement within the UT Automotive purchase order terms and conditions.<br><p>
<b> 1.1.3  Scope</b><p>
This policy applies to suppliers of products, materials and services who are, or propose to be, in business with UT Automotive.  However, instances where a UT Automotive customer has an approved subcontractor list, UT Automotive shall purchase relevant materials from subcontractors on the list.<br><p>
<b> 1.1.4  Responsibility</b><p>
The Partners in Excellence supplier quality system requirements incorporate the global requirements of the QS-9000.  UT Automotive encourages and recognizes suppliers who have attained ISO 9001, 9002, 9003 registration, as well as suppliers who have met the requirements of QS-9000 and all standards specified within.

<H2>Corporate Ethics Policy</H2><p>
<B>2.1.1 Purpose<br>
</B>
<P>
This policy clarification is intended to inform UT Automotive suppliers
of UT Automotive policy regarding the acceptance of gifts or social amenities
from suppliers or potential suppliers.  It defines the limits
that are generally acceptable.  It should not, however, be used

<B>2.1.3 General Policy Regarding Business Gifts<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.3.2   Gifts<BR>

<P>
UTC policy prohibits the request or acceptance of gifts by UT Automotive
associates.  This includes use  of property or facilities, gift
certificates, gift selection catalogs, food baskets, alcohol,
cash,  or favors extended to associates or their families.  The
only exceptions would be unsolicited  gifts of a promotional nature,
such as pens, calendars, or similar items, which bear a company
 logo or advertisement.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.3.3   Discounts<BR>
</B>
<P>
If a supplier offers a discount on services or products, it may
be accepted by a UT Automotive associate  only if the discount is made available
to employees of all customers of the supplier, or to the  public
generally.<BR>
<P>
<B>2.1.3.4   Prizes</B>
<BR>
<P>
At some events conducted by suppliers such as golf outings, dinners,
etc., door prizes or other  prizes are provided by the supplier.
 Employees approved to attend these events may accept  prizes
under the following conditions: all participants must be eligible
for the drawing or prize,  and any gift accepted must be disposed
of, in accordance with the UTC Corporate Policy.<BR>

<P>

in advance by a UT Automotive  associate's
supervisor, in writing.  Business related entertainment shall
be limited to athletic,  theatrical or cultural events when accompanied
by an employee of the supplier.  Frequency  shall not be more
than once a year, with any one supplier, and not more than once
per  calendar quarter with all suppliers in aggregate.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.3.6   Company Events and Activities<BR>

a supplier, or potential  supplier, for any UT Automotive sponsored organization
social, athletic, or recreational activity, such  as golf outings,
picnics, Christmas parties, etc.<BR>

<B>2.1.3.7   Travel and Lodging<BR>
</B>
<P>
UT Automotive associates must have approval of the UT Automotive President before
accepting the provision of  air travel or lodging by a customer
or supplier.  This applies to private aircraft or commercial 
airlines for business or non-business travel.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.1.4 Conflicts of Interest<BR>
</B>
<P>
UTC associates must deal with suppliers, customers and others
doing business with the Corporation in a manner that avoids even
the appearance of conflict between our personal interests and

<B>3.1.3 Procedure<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Supplier Business Profile (Appendix E) is to be completed
and delivered to UT Automotive Purchasing, at a minimum, during the program
Request for Quote phase.  Additionally, the Supplier Business
Profile should be completed and delivered to UT Automotive Purchasing any
time the suppliers'
address, key contacts, UT Automotive manufacturing plants supplied, or minority
business enterprise information changes.  All data fields are
to be completed, unless they are not applicable; in such a case,
"N/A" should be indicated.  Supplier Business Profiles allow purchasing
representatives to investigate the centralized database for potential
sources of new contacts.<BR>

<P>
<B>3.1.4 Minority Business Enterprise Certification<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is the policy of UT Automotive that minority business concerns shall
have equal opportunity to complete for the company's
products and service needs on a competitive quoting basis.  Purchases
of goods and services shall be made from such concerns to the
fullest extent possible, consistent with this policy and prudent
business practice.<BR>

<P>
A minority owned business is one in which at least 51% of the
business is owned and controlled by the minority principal.  The
minority principal shall control the daily business operations
and management decisions.  Each Minority Business Enterprise shall,
on an annual basis, submit a copy of their minority certification
issued by a registered certifying board, along with their completed
Supplier Business Profile to the following UT Automotive office:<BR>

<H2>Contracts</H2>
<BR>
</U></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>4.1.1 Purpose<BR>
</B>
<P>
To identify the various types of contracts, as well as the governing
terms and conditions, that may be utilized by UT Automotive's purchasing community.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.2 Scope<BR>
</B>
<P>
Contracts for services or products will be required of any supplier
or potential supplier to UT Automotive.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.3 General<BR>
</B>
<P>
A contract is a legal obligation between a buyer and a seller
to perform certain duties.<BR>

<P>
Formal agreements should be used when the terms and conditions
involved in a commitment are such that a standard purchase order
is not adequate.  In addition, a formal agreement should be used
when:<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The purchase period extends beyond one year;
<P>
<LI> The value of the commitment exceeds the limits of authority granted the purchasing   manager.
</UL>

<P>
Apply QS-9000, Element 4.3.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.4 Blanket Orders<BR>
</B>
<P>
A blanket order is a contract covering one or more commodities
for one or more locations and is usually formalized by a purchase
order document.  After supplier bidding/negotiations on item(s)
predetermined by the buyer to be repetitive/small order buys,
the selected supplier(s) will be issued a blanket order(s).<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.5 Construction Contracts<BR>
</B>
<P>
Construction contracts cover the construction of a plant or unit
of equipment and usually includes a labor factor.  To prevent
possible losses associated with these types of contracts, construction
contracts are developed with assistance from UT Automotive's
legal department.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.6 Firm Fixed Price Agreements<BR>
</B>
<P>
The supplier agrees to supply goods or services for a firmly committed
amount that is not subject to adjustment by reason of unforeseen
costs experienced by the supplier in the performance of the agreement.
<BR>

<P>

<B>4.1.7 Long Term Agreements<BR>
</B>
<P>
Long term agreements can serve to increase a supplier<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</FONT>s
total volume of business, thus reducing unit costs and permitting
the supplier(s) to sell at lower prices.  Long term agreements
can be written from one to three years and eliminate duplicate
yearly supplier investigations and purchasing administrative efforts.
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.8 Professional Services Agreement<BR>
</B>
<P>
Architects, engineers, lawyers, consultants and educational specialists
are representative of individuals and firms which provide professional
services.  Professional services agreements are developed with
assistance from UT Automotive's legal department.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.9 Purchase Orders<BR>
</B>
<P>
Purchase orders should clearly describe the product and/or service
ordered, and include where applicable:<BR>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Part number and revision level;
<P>
<LI> The type, class, grade or other specific identification;
<P><LI> The title or other positive identification, and applicable issues 
of specifications,  drawings, process requirements, inspection instructions and
other relevant technical   data, including requirements for approval
or qualification of product, service,   procedures, process equipment
and personnel;
<P>
<LI> The title, number
</UL>

<P>
<B>4.1.10 Purchase Order Amendments<BR>
</B>
<P>
Purchase order amendments are issued as a result of changes and/or
cancellations to the original order.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.11 Spot Buy Purchase Orders<BR>
</B>
<P>
One time purchases for which a purchase order is prepared and
issued to the supplier.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.1.12 Time and Material Agreements<BR>
</B>
<P>
Time and material agreements provide for the procurement of supplies
or services on the basis of payment for a composite hourly rate
or rates which include all elements of cost, factory burden, general
and administrative expenses, the supplier's profit, and material at cost.<BR>

<P>

<B>4.1.13 Customer Verification</B>
<P>
Where specified in the contract, UT Automotive's customer or the customer's
representative shall be afforded the right to verify at the supplier's
premises and UT Automotive's premises and UT Automotive's premises that
the supplier's product conforms to specified requirements.<BR>

<H2>Request for Quotation Guidelines</H2>
<BR>
</U></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>5.1.1 Purpose<BR>
</B>
<P>
To communicate UT Automotive's position on the request for quotation process.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.1.2 Scope<BR>
</B>
<P>
This policy applies to all suppliers and/or potential suppliers
of products, materials and/or services to UT Automotive.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.1.3 General<BR>
</B>
<P>
Requests for Quotations are expected to be returned to UT Automotive within
the allotted time given by the buyer.  All aspects related to
the commodity should be defined in the Request for Quotation
response.  Suppliers are encouraged to provide a total cost breakdown,
ensuring a more competitive bid process.  Requests for Quotation
may also include cost saving suggestions in all areas of the
commodity, such as material substitutions, packaging, design and
service requirements, etc.  Cost saving suggestions are expected
from the supplier at the initial quote stage and during the product/service
life cycle.  All suppliers of products or materials requested
to bid must be determined in advance to be qualified suppliers,
per the requirements of the Partners in Excellence program, for
the commodity in question.  Additionally, to ensure an efficient
and effective quoting process, suppliers should follow, but are
not limited to the following guidelines:<BR>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Suppliers shall respond
to Requests for Quotation, manufacturing problem or other such
 requests in a timely manner, and information supplied to UT Automotive
must be complete and accurate.
<LI>Suppliers shall meet, maintain and improve established and required quality levels and are expected to lend technical advice and support during initial and on-going phases of programs.
<LI>Suppliers should never commit to a project unless compliance to the specified terms and conditions are assured.
<LI>Suppliers should be sufficiently aware of UT Automotives leadtime inventory to ensure timely arrival of partial/complete deliveries to avoid "stock outs".
<LI>Suppliers should avoid dependence on contingencies as a means to inflate a deliberately low quotation.  The absence of complete specifications from UT Automotive can cause the submission of an unintentional low quote, therefore, suppliers should question completeness of specifications from UT Automotive to avoid upward cost adjustments as a response to specification additions.
<LI>Suppliers should keep UT Automotive informed of new product/service information, process improvements, cost savings, price changes, etc., to keep the buyer abreast of opportunities for better buys, changing market conditions and requirements.
<LI>Suppliers should assist in locating alternate sources for "hard to get" items and assist in standardization efforts by suggesting suitable and appropriate item, service or product substitutions.</ul><p>

<H2>F.O.B. Terms</H2>
<P>
<B>6.1.1     Purpose<BR></B><P>
To identify the various transportation terms as they relate to ownership, risk of loss and payment of transportation expense.
<P>
<B>6.1.2     Scope</B><P>
Applicable to all raw and/or finished goods purchased by UT Automotive; specific terms negotiated between UT Automotive and the supplier.
<P>
<P><B>6.1.3 General - Domestic Terms</B><P>
The shipping terms included in a purchase order of sales contract determine who has the legal right to specify the carrier and the routing of the goods being purchased.  Shipping terms define the point at which a buyer takes title to the goods.  This, in turn, defines who is responsible for payment of freight charges, for handling negotiations with the carrier, and for filing necessary loss or damage claims.  The "owner" of the material holds all rights and responsibilities that accompany ownership.
<P>
     <UL><B>F.O.B. Origin, Freight Collect<BR>
F.O.B. Origin, Freight Prepaid<BR>
F.O.B. Origin, Freight Prepaid and Charged Back<BR>
F.O.B. Destination, Freight Collect<BR>
F.O.B. Destination, Freight Prepaid<BR>
F.O.B. Destination, Freight Collect and Allowed<BR></B>
</UL>
<P>
At the request for quotation stage of procurement, suppliers should quote their pricing based on F.O.B. (Named) Origin, Freight Collect and F.O.B. Destination, Freight Prepaid Terms.  Freight charges under the F.O.B. (Named) Origin, Freight Collect should be obtained from the third party logistics management suppliers representative (or source identified by the business unit).  The most cost advantageous terms should then be specified.
<P>
<B>6.1.4     General - International Terms</B>
<P>
The two ways of transporting overseas material are via ocean liners and air freight.  The trade-off between the two is in time and freight rates.  Ocean vessels offer the lowest rates but transit times are longer; the opposite is true for air freight.  If the commodity has a high unit cost and it is desirable to keep inventory to a minimum, then air freight is the viable approach.
<P>
Some of the common freight terms are:
<UL>
<B>F.O.B. (Named Inland Carrier at Named Inland Point of Departure)<BR>Freight Prepaid to (Named Point of Exportation)<BR>
F.O.B. (Named Inland Carrier at Point of Exportation)<BR>
F.O.B. (Named Inland carrier at Inland Point of Departure)<BR>
F.O.B. (Named Inland Point in Country of Importation)<BR>
F.O.B. Vessel (Named Port of Shipment).</B> </ul> <p>

Under this system, the suppliers price covers all expenses up to, and including, delivery of goods on the overseas vessels provided by the buyer at the port of shipment.<p>

Under F.O.B. Terms, excepting named inland point in country of importation, the obligation to obtain ocean freight space and marine insurance rests with the buyer.  Despite this obligation, in many trades, the supplier performs this service for the buyer.
<UL>
<B>F.O.B. Airport (DAP).</B>  The supplier is required to deliver the goods to the airport.  Title passes to the buyer upon completion.<BR>
<B>Ex-Works.</B>  Under these terms, the buyer bears all risks and costs from the point of origin.  The extent of the suppliers responsibility is in obtaining documents issued in the country of origin, which may be required by the buyer for purposes of exportation or importation at destination.<BR>
<B>FAS.</B>  The supplier bears all risks until the merchandise is placed within reach of the ships tackle.  Thereafter, all transportation risks and expenses are the buyers.<BR>
<B>CIF.</B>  Under such terms, the supplier is responsible for all costs and risks until the ocean vessel ties up to the dock at the point of importation.<BR>
<B>C & F.</B>  This term is similar to CIF, except the supplier does not provide insurance or bear the risk of loss of merchandise while at sea.<BR>
</UL>
Shipping rates in international transportation are determined  in two basic ways:
<P>
<OL><LI>Conference rates are uniform, established in conferences of international carriers.  The rates quoted by these carriers are the same, or uniform, and the buyer is assured that certain routes will always be traveled, regardless of freight volume;<BR>
 <LI>Charter rates are established by independent conference carriers, usually for single movements utilizing all or most of a vessel or air carrier.  Such rates are negotiable with individual carriers and will typically be lower than conference rates.<BR>
</OL>
Similar to the domestic purchasing criteria, at the time of the request for quotation in the procurement process, suppliers should show F.O.B. Origin (Ex-Factory) and F.O.B. Destination.  This allows purchasing to evaluate the price of the material only (F.O.B. Origin), and the cost of transporting that material.<br>

<H2>International Purchasing</H2>
<P>
<B>7.1.1     Purpose</B>
<P>
UT Automotive, as a global corporation, strives to meet the requirements of the market under which it is operating.
<P>
<B>7.1.2     Scope</B>
<P>
When operating in an international marketplace, UT Automotive associates and suppliers should be familiar with certain issues and/or requirements of the market.
<P>
<B>7.1.3     General</B>
<P>
There are many items which may be reviewed prior to purchasing goods outside the United States.  it is difficult to predetermine which items will be of most relevance in each transaction, but the following is a list of issues that may be consulted.  There may also be changes to laws and regulations in each country.  UT Automotive may consult its legal, finance and tax departments about particular countries prior to any significant purchasing negotiations or commitments.
<P>
<B>7.1.4     Legal Issues</B>
<P>
<B>7.1.4.1     U.N. Convention of the International Sale of Goods (CISG)</B>
<P>
a.  Applies automatically to transactions between parties in countries that have ratified it.<BR>
b.  The U.N. Convention of the International Sale of Goods is generally very similar to the Uniform   Commercial code Article 2.<BR>
c.  The CISG applies to an international and a commercial sale of goods.<BR>
d.  Applicable place of business is one which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance.<BR>
e.  Differences between UCC and CISG
<UL><LI>If the price terms are not specified, or provided for, no contract is made.
<LI>Irrevocable offers can remain open even if they are not in writing.
<LI>A contract is created at the time the acceptance is received by the offeror.
<LI>There is no battle of the forms under the CISG - acceptance should mirror the offer or it is a counteroffer.
<LI>Few formalities of the statute of frauds are required to have a binding contract.
</UL><P>
<B>7.1.4.2     Protection of Information</B>
<P>	
Patent systems in many countries are not as protective as those of the U.S., and it is, therefore, possible to lose rights to valuable information.  Prior to release of proprietary information (material specifications, designs, process know-how, etc.), a written agreement protecting UT Automotives proprietary information may be required.
<P>
<B>7.1.4.3     Alternative Dispute Resolution</B>
<P>
In a large scale purchase contracts, a clause outlining a dispute resolution procedure, such as arbitration, avoiding a court system and allowing for a quicker settlement of issues, may be included in the contract.
<P>
<B>7.1.4.4     Local Content requirements</B>
<P>
Many countries have requirements as to the percentage of a product that must be produced locally.  This may alter sourcing requirements for UT Automotive or our customers.  Sellers should include duty free status, etc., on all documents related to purchasing material or services.
<P>
<B>7.1.5     Payment</B>
<P>
<B>7.1.5.1     Currency Exchange</B>
<P>
When products are purchased outside the U.S., a determination must be made regarding the currency of payment.  Wherever possible, contracts should be denominated in the U.S. dollar if being purchased for shipment to the U.S.
<P>
<B>7.1.5.2     Letters of Credit</B>
<P>
Suppliers are discouraged from utilizing letters of credit when doing business with UT Automotive.
<P>
<B>7.1.6     Practice</B>
<P>
<B>7.1.6.1     Quality</B>
<P>
Specifications and procedures vary in different parts of the world.  Instructions should be explicit and no assumptions made in the area of terms of art translating accurately across the borders.  Material standards are also different; quality requirements, defect parameters and warranty responsibility should be explicit.  The Partners in Excellence supplier quality system requirements incorporate the global requirements of the QS-9000.  UT Automotive encourages and recognizes suppliers who have attained ISO 9001, 9002, 9003 registration, as well as suppliers who have met the requirements of QS-9000 and all standards specified within.
<P>
<B>7.1.6.2     U.S. Regulation</B>
<P>
Products must meet OSHA space, consumer safety specifications, environmental requirements or other state or federal requirements.  Requirements should be outlined and the products inspected prior to use.
<P>
<B>7.1.7     Shipment</B>
<P>
<B>7.1.7.1     Customs</B>
<P>
U.S. Customs requires labeling for country of origin, and payment of duties, depending upon the source country and type of product.  Suppliers should be made explicitly responsible for shipment of products to the U.S., unless there is a practical reason for UT Automotive to have control.
<P>
If UT Automotive exports technology to assist the supplier in producing the product, there may also be a license required in order to export the technology.

<H2>Early Product Development Launch</H2>
<P>
<B>9.1.1     Purpose</B>
<P>
To integrate supplier involvement into the business decision process throughout the entire product development launch for new, modified carryover, or carryover programs.
<P>
<B>9.1.2     Scope</B>
<P>
In the Product Development Launch process, there are going to be certain suppliers that will be incorporated into the process.  These suppliers can fall into one of several categories as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Selected to support the strategic objective of the business unit by creating, through the relationship, competitive advantages in time, cost, delivery or quality.
<LI>To create or gain access to critical product and/or process technology.
<LI>Support areas of non core-competency.
<LI>UT Automotive is required to deal with them such as customer source or proprietary products or processes.
</OL>
<B>9.1.3     General</B>
<P>
Selected suppliers will be expected to participate at various times throughout the typical phases of UT Automotive product and process design development, manufacturing feasibility review, production launch and post launch performance.  Suppliers should expect to provide cost saving suggestions, target cost estimates, manufacturing feasibility, timing and capacity to support alternate and preferred design concepts.
<P>
During the process design development phase, a full level production proveout may be required that will satisfy the intent and be representative of production capacity.  Occasions may arise which require suppliers to be co-located within UT Automotive during the pre launch and UT Automotive launch phase.<p>

<H2>Sample Submission Requirements</H2><P>
<B>11.1.1     Purpose</B>
<P>
To establish guidelines for production sample submissions to United Technologies Automotive.
<P>
<B>11.1.2     Scope</B>
<P>
Sample submission requirements apply to all UT Automotive suppliers of production materials and parts.
<P>
<B>11.1.3     Responsibility</B>
<P>
Suppliers shall perform sample submissions for each part number and engineering change level revision, unless otherwise specified by UT Automotive.  Suppliers shall also perform sample submissions for changes in manufacturing processes, manufacturing location, etc., as required by UT Automotive Purchasing after providing advance notice of the change to UT Automotive, (see PIE Section 4.1.7).  UT Automotive Buyers may request Special Samples as defined in section 7.1.4.  Suppliers shall insure that sample submissions include appropriate paperwork as outlined in the Production Part Approval Process guideline, and completely conform to UT Automotive requirements on the first scheduled submission.  UT Automotive requires that initial samples be produced form production tooling and processes.
<P>
<B>11.1.3.1     Sample Submission Deviation</B>
<P>
Suppliers are responsible for investigation and correction of component discrepancies, prior to sample submission. <B> If discrepancies to sample submission requirements are detected, suppliers shall initiate corrective action prior to sample submission.</B>  In the event that all viable corrective actions have been pursued and exhausted without success, the supplier shall obtain approval of a deviation, PRIOR to the buyer sample submission deadline date.  A requested deviation does not relieve the supplier of the responsibility to meet the original sample submission date and to continue to take corrective action to meet specifications by the expiration date of the deviation.  Apply documents:
Production Part Approval Process and QS-9000, Section II, 1.1, 1.2.
<P>
<B>11.1.4     Special Samples</B>
<P>
These samples consist of component parts that are not completely fabricated on production tooling and/or not to the current print revision level (e.g., require secondary or special manual operations).  Special sample pieces shall be identified as Special Samples on the Part Submission Warrant form, in the Production Part Approval Process guide.  Special samples do not necessarily require paperwork such as layouts, material certifications, and capability studies, and therefore, CANNOT be used as salable units.  UT Automotive Purchasing or a designee may request 100% dimensional layouts to comply with customer requests.  Additional special sample submission requirements of the UT Automotive business unit may also apply.
<P>
<B>11.1.5     Production Part Layout</B><P>
Suppliers shall perform and submit full part layouts and material certifications at initial sample submission.  Requirements for layout and material certification plans shall be designated in the product control plan, and approved by UT Automotive.
<P>
<B>11.1.6     Sample Submission Identification</B><P>
Suppliers shall include the following on the packing list with all sample submissions and special sample submissions:
<UL>a)  Type of sample<BR>
b)  Quantity submitted<BR>
c)  Engineering change level of submission<BR>
d)  Tooling purchase order number<BR>
</UL>
<B>11.1.6.1     Sample Submission Shipping Labels</B><P>
Sample submission and special sample submission containers shall have a label attached with the following information indicated:
<OL>a)  Type of submission:  (buyer samples, production evaluation samples, prototype samples, special samples)<BR>
b)  Date<BR>
c)  UT Automotive part number<BR>
d)  Part name<BR>
e)  Engineering change level<BR>
f)  Quantity<BR>
g)  Lot number<BR>
</OL>
Additional sample submissions of the UT Automotive business units may also apply.
<P>
<B>11.1.7     Common Stock Components</B><P>
Suppliers who sell off the shelf components (tooling has not been specifically built for UT Automotive or its customers), and who cannot comply with the Partners in Excellence sample submission requirements may be exempted from sample submission requirements if they maintain, on file, a letter of compliance on their company letterhead stating that the component sold to us conforms to the dimensions and material certifications, given in the companys catalog or brochure, and that the letter includes both the UT Automotive and supplier part number.  Also, the UT Automotive component drawing shall be included with the submission.  These documents shall be available upon request.  <B>This is the exception and not the rule; full documentation should be procured if it is available.</B><p>

<H2>Supplier Performance Evaluation</H2><P>
<B>16.1.1     Purpose</B><P>
UT Automotive evaluates the individual performance of its suppliers to insure compliance to UT Automotives quality, delivery and continuous improvement expectations, as outlined in this policy guide and the QS-9000 standard.
<P>
<B>16.1.2     Scope</B><P>
Supplier performance evaluations should be conducted for UT Automotive material, production and service suppliers.
<P>
<B>16.1.3     Supplier Evaluation Elements</B><P>
The effectiveness of the suppliers quality systems will be evaluated per QS-9000, with an emphasis in defect prevention and commitment to continuous improvement.  UT Automotives Partners in Excellence supplier performance evaluation consists of four basic elements:
<P>
<B>16.1.3.1     Purchasing Measurement</B><P>
a)  Profile data (Form, Appendix E)<BR>
b)  Quality and cost improvements as supported by the financial and technical aspects of the suppliers business plan.<BR>
c)  Timelines and accuracy of product deliveries.<BR>
d)  Responsiveness to engineering changes.<BR>
<P>
<B>16.1.3.2     Quality Measurement</B><P>
a)  Ability to conform to and/or exceed UT Automotive product quality requirements, including product quality requirements of UT Automotives customers.<BR>
b)  Compliance to QS-9000 (which includes ISO 9001) and/or other UT Automotive customer specific requirements, as evidenced by a supplier self-assessment, third party audit or an on-site assessment performed by a UT Automotive representative.<BR>
<P>
<B>16.1 3.3     Technology Measurement</B><P>
a)  Product design and development<BR>
b)  Applied research and development<BR>
c)  Testing capabilities<BR>
<P>
<B>16.1.3.4     Cost Improvement</B><P>
Cost improvement suggestions provided by the supplier resulting in product/process savings.
<P>
<B>16.1.4    Methods of Supplier Performance Evaluation</B><P>
All current material and production suppliers to UT Automotive shall be evaluated by any combination of the performance evaluation measurements below.  The supplier performance evaluation may be used in making sourcing decisions for existing and future purchased material.  The elements of the UT Automotive supplier performance evaluations are as follows:
<P>
<B>16.1.4.1    On-Site Supplier Evaluations</B><P>
UT Automotive Engineering, Purchasing, Quality and manufacturing facilities should jointly decide which suppliers require on site assessment.  On-site evaluations will be led by UT Automotive associates who have successfully completed QS-9000 Lead Auditor training, and will be governed by Quality System Assessment guidelines for auditing and this policy section 16.1.4.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.2     Quality and Deliver Rating Report</B><P>
UT Automotive Purchasing shall periodically provide performance reports to each major supplier.  Typically, major suppliers are those which, ranked by purchased product dollar volume, contribute to approximately 80% of a UT Automotive business units total purchased product dollar volume.
<P>
The quality performance rating (parts per million (PPM) is compiled by summing non conforming quantities for each component from all UT Automotive manufacturing locations within a business unit, and dividing by the total number of components shipped, times 1,000,000.
<P>
<B>PPM = (å PiecesNon-conforming ¸ å QuantityReceived) x 1,000,000</B>
<P>
Product will be considered non-conforming if it does not meet UT Automotives requirements for product specifications, labeling, packaging or part sample warrant approval.
<P>
The delivery performance rating is the percent of compliance to release.  Performance is compiled by summing all on time received quantities for each component part from each supplier at all UT Automotive manufacturing locations within a business unit, and dividing by the sum of all parts released by all UT Automotive manufacturing locations, times 100.
<P>
<B>Delivery (å PartsReceivedOnTime ¸ å RartsReleased) x 100</B>
<P>
<B>16.1.4.3     QSA Assessment</B>
Suppliers shall submit QSA self-assessments when requested, to both the requestor and UT Automotive Quality & Supplier Development, with the initial submission date agreed upon by UT Automotive purchasing.  This assessment, with corrective action plans, will be used to evaluate the suppliers continuous improvement activities.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.4     Cost Deviation Factor</B><P>
The cost deviation from the quoted piece price may be utilized to assess additional expenses incurred by UT Automotive.  External expenses or charges imposed directly to UT Automotive from UT Automotive customers may also be evaluated, if the charges are found to be directly related to the suppliers quality performance.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.5     Total Cost</B><P>
This is a sum of all costs that are realized in the procurement of product form a supplier.  This includes, but is not limited to:  shipping, handling, delivery, quality, inspection, corrective action, and piece price.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.6     Total Piece Price</B><P>
This is calculated by multiplying the annual total received quantity, by the negotiated piece price per part number.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.7     Rejection Notification Cost</B><P>
This is calculated by multiplying the number of rejection notifications, by a cost factor, (defined by the receiving facility).  Suppliers may be charged with this cost, as defined on the rejection notification form.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.8     Material Handling Cost</B><P>
This is calculated by multiplying the number of shipments in excess of the release schedule, by a cost factor (defined by the receiving facility).
<P>
<B>16.1.4.9     Prototype/Part Sample Warrant</B><P>
Suppliers may be reviewed for product adherence to specification, sample submission accuracy and conformance to sample schedules.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.10   Incoming Inspection</B><P>
Suppliers are evaluated on their ability to ship materials that do not require UT Automotive to perform incoming inspection.  The method for determining inspection requirements is outlined below.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.10.a     Skip Lot Sequence</B><P>
The following is a guideline only.  The actual lot quantity that results in inspection free status may vary, based on historical evidence or other rationale (e.g. new technology) to ensure defect free material entering the manufacturing system.  Each supplier part number will be measured by Receiving Inspection for six (6) successive shipments (Inspection Status), then placed on Skip Lot Status provided no manufacturing or receiving rejections occur.  The next five shipments will not be inspected.  The sixth lot will be inspected for verification, and if accepted, the supplier part number will be placed on Certified Status.  The next ten shipments will not be inspected.  The eleventh shipment will be inspected for verification, and if accepted, the supplier part number will be placed on Inspection Free status.  No shipments will be inspected for the remaining life of the program, unless significant product concerns develop.  If rejections occur at any status, the supplier part number returns to Inspection Status, and begins the skip log sequence again.  See Appendix F for a visual depiction of the skip lot process.
<P>
<B>16.1.4.10.b     Parts Free of Inspection Status</B><P>
UT Automotive Purchasing evaluates the inspection status of each suppliers part on a periodic basis.  The total quantity of a suppliers parts on Inspection Free status will be divided by the total quantity of parts supplied to establish the percent of supplier parts on Inspection Free status.
<P>
<B>16.1.5     UT Automotive Conducted Assessments</B><P>
Under certain circumstances, a trained UT Automotive QS-9000 lead auditor shall conduct a QSA assessment at the suppliers facility.  UT Automotive assessments are conducted, as outlined in QSA, Process for Second Party Assessments.  The on site assessment process includes a documentation review, on site assessment, and verification of corrective actions.  Scoring will be conducted utilizing the zero to three (0-3) point rating variable score method.  In developing suppliers, UT Automotive will conduct supplier assessments should any of the following issues arise:
<UL>
a)  Recurring relationship and/or communication concerns<BR>
b)  Consistently high number of defects (PPM)<BR>
c)  Less than satisfactory delivery performance<BR>
d)  High number of quality rejection notices<BR>
e)  New supplier<BR>
</UL>
In addition to the above criteria, consideration of the following will be weighed in the decision to conduct  an on-site assessment:
<UL>
a)  Purchased dollar volume<BR>
b)  Low percentage of parts on Inspection Free status<BR>
c)  Self-assessment and/or action plans not submitted to UT Automotive<BR>
d)  Suppliers self-assessment score does not correlate to the PPM and Delivery ratings<BR>
e)  Suppliers components and/or materials are critical to the production process.<BR>
</UL>
<B>16.1.6     New Supplier Criteria</B><P>
New supplier candidates will be evaluated, per section 16.1 of this policy guide, prior to an award of business.  An on-site facility review may be conducted with participation from UT Automotive Purchasing, Engineering and Quality representatives.
<P>
<B>16.1.7     UT Automotive Performance Awards</B><P>
Performance awards are presented annually to suppliers who demonstrate the best value to UT Automotive.  New suppliers may be eligible for the preferred supplier or Partners in Excellence award with a minimum one year history.  Two levels of nomination may be awarded to a supplier, based on the following measures of quality, delivery, and QSA point award.  Special consideration can be given for suppliers to receive a preferred status, providing they have obtained significant and consistent continuous improvement objectives related to quality, delivery and cost outlined by the nominating business unit.  All sourcing UT Automotive manufacturing facilities must concur with the award nomination.
<UL>
<U><B><I>Preferred Supplier Award</I></B></U><BR>
Compliance rating level of ³ 80%, PPM defects £ 100, and delivery ³ 98%.<BR>
<U><B><I>Partners in Excellence Award</I></B></U><BR>
Compliance rating level of ³ 85%, PPM defects £ 50, and delivery = 100%.<BR>
</UL>
<B>16.1.8     Unsatisfactory Supplier Performance</B><P>
UT Automotive is unwilling to accept poor product, service, delivery and/or relationship quality from its suppliers.  Individual concerns shall be addressed with corrective action reports.  Chronic problem suppliers (high PPM defect rate, poor delivery performance, unresponsiveness to concerns, etc.)  will be governed by the UT Automotive sourcing facilitys supplier corrective action procedure and may be desourced.

<P>
Buyers and Buyer's customers shall have access to Sellers premises and records during normal business hours, prior or subsequent to payment, to inspect work performed and to verify charges submitted with respect to any Equipment acquired or constructed for Buyer.

Seller further agrees to retain all of the above records for a period of three years after receiving final payments of such charges.  Buyer shall have the right to review Sellers applicable costs.
<P>
<B>16.  TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE</B>
<P>
A.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer may, by giving written notice to Seller, terminate this Agreement, or any Purchase Order issued pursuant hereto, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason.  Buyer shall have the right to terminate any purchase obligation in the event of an excusable delay.
<P>
B.  After Sellers receipt of such notice of termination, Seller shall, unless otherwise directed by Buyer, immediately terminate all work under Buyers Purchase Order and shall (i) terminate all orders relating to the performance of the work terminated by Buyers notice of termination; (ii) settle all claims arising out of such termination of orders; (iii) transfer title and deliver to Buyer (1) all completed work which conforms to the requirements of Buyers orders and/or releases, and (2) all reasonable quantities of work in process and materials produced or acquired in respect of the performance of the work terminated which are of a type and quality suitable for producing supplies which conform to the requirements of Buyers orders and/or releases and which cannot reasonably be used by Seller in producing supplies for itself or for its other customers; (iv) take all action necessary to protect property in Sellers possession in which Buyer has or may acquire interest; and (v) submit to Buyer promptly, but not later than twenty days from the effective date of such termination its termination claim.  Sellers termination claim shall be comprehensive, and shall contain sufficient supporting data to permit Buyers audit.  Seller shall thereafter promptly furnish such supplemental and supporting information as Buyer shall request.  Buyer, or its agents, shall have the right, prior or subsequent to payment, to audit and examine all books, records, facilities, work, material, inventories and other items relating to any termination claim of Seller.
<P>
C.  Upon such termination, Buyer shall pay to Seller the following amounts without duplication: (a) the order price for all Equipment or services which have been completed in accordance with Buyers order and/or releases and not previously paid for; (b) the actual costs of work-in-process and raw materials incurred by Seller in furnishing  the Equipment or services under Buyers order and/or releases; (c) Sellers actual cost of immediately terminating orders and settling claims with its vendors; and (d) Sellers actual costs of protecting Buyers property that is in Sellers possession.  The costs referenced in this Subparagraph C shall be allowable only to the extent that such costs are reasonable in amount and are properly allocable or apportionable under generally accepted accounting principles to the terminated portion of this order, and such costs shall be reduced by the reasonable value or cost (whichever is higher) of any Equipment or materials used or sold by Seller with Buyers written consent, and the cost of any damaged or destroyed Equipment or material.  Buyer will make no payments for Equipment, work-in-process or raw materials fabricated or procured by Seller in amounts in excess of those authorized in deliver releases nor for any undelivered Equipment which is in Sellers standard stock or which are readily marketable.
<P>
Payments made under this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate price payable by Buyer for Equipment which would be produced by Seller under delivery or release schedules outstanding on the date of termination.  Except as provided in this paragraph, Buyer shall not be liable for and shall not be required to make payments to Seller, directly or on account of claims by Sellers subcontractors, for loss of anticipated profit, unabsorbed overhead, interest on claims, product development and engineering costs, facilities and equipment rearrangement costs or rental, unamortized depreciation costs, and the general administrative burden changes resulting from termination of this order.
<P>
D.  If the Seller fails to submit its termination claim within such 20-day period, or such longer time as it is mutually agreed upon in writing, the Buyer may, notwithstanding paragraph (B) above, determine on the basis of information available to it the amount, if any, due Seller with respect to the termination and such determination shall be final.
<P>
E.  Buyer shall have no obligation to Seller if Buyer terminates its purchase obligations because of Sellers default in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 12 hereof.
<P>
<B>17.  CUMULATIVE REMEDIES</B>
<P>
The rights and remedies afforded Buyer by this Agreement shall be cumulative and additional to any other or further rights and remedies provided in law or equity.  Buyer will make reasonable efforts to minimize any applicable damages.  Seller, however, agrees to pay to Buyer the amount of any claims for payment made to Buyer by Buyers customers as well as any applicable costs of Buyer associated with Sellers breach of the Agreement and any Purchase Order issued pursuant hereto.
<P>
<B>18.  PRICE WARRANTY</B>
<P>
If Seller shall sell the same, or substantially similar, Equipment in similar quantities to any other customer at a lower price than the price in effect for Buyer, the purchase price in effect hereunder shall be reduced to such lower price.  Such reduction shall apply to all unshipped orders hereunder and all orders which were shipped subsequent to the effective date of such lower price.
<P>
<B>19.  CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE</B>
<P>
Seller shall protect as proprietary and keep confidential all proprietary information including, but not limited to, designs, processes, drawings, specifications, reports, data, terms and conditions and other technical or business information and the features of all parts, equipment, tools, gauges, patterns, and other items furnished or disclosed to Seller by Buyer (Proprietary Equipment).

<h2>Wire Harnesses</h2>

UT Automotive is an industry leader in the production of automotive wire harnesses. We design and build
everything from one-piece harnesses to multiplex systems, and our extensive testing and prototype
facilities ensure the highest quality products.
<P>
UT Automotive has automated its production processes and created synchronous manufacturing cells in many
of its operations to increase flexibility, reduce costs and accommodate just-in-time
manufacturing. 
<p>
We are leaders in automated production of modular harness subassemblies. Individual circuits are
cut, stripped, terminated and plugged into a hard-shell connector to form the subassembly.
Advanced sensing devices ensure components are built to exact specifications and standards.
<p>
Our ability to produce custom-built vehicle wire harnesses in accordance with individual feature
content of a vehicle eliminates unused circuits and improves just-in-time delivery.
<p>
And UT Automotive's warranty analysis program ensures continuous improvement of our products, and has
resulted in lower warranty expense for our customers and "best-in-class" warranty performance for
many car lines.

technologies.
<p>
Printed circuit board technologies include hard, flexible and combination boards with flexible
circuits.
<p>
UT Automotive has product design, engineering and manufacturing facilities for junction boxes in the United
States and Spain. In developing new junction boxes, UT Automotive uses advanced quality planning tools
such as quality function deployment, design failure mode effects analysis, design verification
planning and report, and process failure mode effects analysis.
<p>
Such tools help UT Automotive define customer requirements and develop plans to meet those requirements.
UT Automotive also conducts continuous benchmarking of competitive products to ensure that any new
product we develop utilizes best-in-class design practices.
<p>
Other tools used in the development of junction boxes include:
<ul><li><strong>3-D computer aided design</strong> - This provides our designers with the
ability to examine the part more completely in the areas of form, fit and function.
<li><strong>Finite element analysis</strong> - This ensures that the mechanical latches and
mounting features will perform as required for the life of the product, and provides a tool to
evaluate the thermal electrical performance of the circuit inside the junction box.
<li><strong>Mold fill analysis</strong> - This allows UT Automotive to test mold design and material
fill processes to ensure high product quality and performance.
</Ul>
<p>
UT Automotive's product development laboratories verify performance of our junction box designs, provide
state-of-the-art equipment for testing junction boxes for complex environmental exposure,
thermograph mapping of circuits to determine hot spots, and computerize high pot testing across
circuits to guarantee isolation of circuits.
<p>
UT Automotive uses state-of-the-art, automated manufacturing processes to ensure consistent high quality.
For example, stamped metal frets are brought into assembly with plastic insulators using precise
pick-and-place machines. Robotics systems are used to load components onto printed circuit
boards and to install fuses and relays to the boxes. Advanced color recognition systems are used in
the process to ensure that parts/components are in their correct location.
<p>
Some of our advanced research in junction box technology has helped in the development of
intelligent boxes, which combine circuit protection, low current switching, multiplexing and
integration with vehicle functions.

<h2>Modular Power Network Boxes</h2>

Unlike today's other modular components, UT Automotive's modular power distribution
systems offer a choice: pieced-together modules and mounting brackets that form
a fuse and/or relay center; or modules assembled in a frame to construct a
power distribution center.
<p>
UT Automotive modular components improve flexibility when packaged for circuit protection
and low current switching, and also provide electrical system designers a
product that is flexible enough to meet the power distribution needs of
different car lines.
<p>
The products are available today and can be used immediately to solve your
application needs.
<p>
UT Automotive modular power distribution systems:
<ul>
<li>Can be used with a power distribution center frame to create a large
variety of fuse panels or power network boxes.
<li>Can be built into arrays to form a custom configuration of fuses and relays.
<li>Can be used with an assortment of snap-on mounting brackets.
<li>Can be located almost anywhere in a vehicle.
<li>Accept standard autofuse, minifuse, maxifuse, ISO relays and half-ISO
relays.
<li>Offer increased packaging flexibility.
<li>Are pre-assembled according to customer specifications.

<h2>Headliners and Sun Visor Systems</h2>

<p>
UT Automotive provides a complete range of standard and modular headliners and is the largest
independent producer of headliners for the automotive industry.
<P>
With our experience in materials research and manufacturing processes, UT Automotive can deliver
headliners that provide optimal structural and acoustic performance. And an intensive research
program is working to develop new, environmentally safe substrates for use in headliners and other
products.
<P>
UT Automotive also designs and manufactures a full range of sun visors to meet our customers' cost and
styling requirements. Visors can integrate many components, including lamps, mirrors and
sunshade extensions.
<P>
UT Automotive is working to move vanity lights from the sunshade to the headliner for more natural
lighting and to lower costs. And our new concealed sunshade slides into the headliner, offering
improved adjustability and more headroom.

<h2>Remote/Keyless Entry Systems</h2>

<p>
UT Automotive is one of the world's largest providers of remote entry systems. Now in the third generation
of design, our remote entry systems use surface acoustic wave transmission, serial data bus, all
surface mount construction and proprietary encryption algorithms. We offer a number of features,
including:

<ul>
<li><strong>Illuminated Entry</strong> - Interior lights are activated by any remote control
function and operation of outside front-door handles, and deactivated by ignition or a certain
period of time.
<li><strong>Automatic Lock/Unlock</strong> - All doors lock when the transmission is shifted
out of the park position. The user may program this feature to unlock the doors or leave them
unlocked when the transmission is shifted back into park.
<li><strong>Automatic Unlock Upgrade</strong> - An additional feature that allows the user
to unlock the driver's door only when the transmission is shifted back into park.
<li><strong>Automatic Lock (Last Door Closed)</strong> - A delayed door lock operated
when the ignition is off and all doors are closed.
<li><strong>Lock-out Prevention</strong> - Door locking is inhibited if key is left in ignition.
<li><strong>Key Option</strong> - Door locking is prohibited if key is left in ignition.
<li><strong>Audible Feedback</strong> - A signal from the module may be used to activate a
horn to indicate a valid transmitter signal has been received or a specific remote control function
has been completed.
<li><strong>Remote Alarm (Panic)</strong> - Horn or siren may be activated remotely.
<li><strong>Theft Deterrent</strong> - System is armed by a proper locking sequence (remote
or manual) and disarmed by proper unlocking (remote or key). Improper unlocking, ignition or
entry causes alarm (flashing headlights and pulsing horn). Alarm stops after 3 minutes but system
remains armed and will reactivate if another improper action is detected. Alarm can be shut off
by remote unlock or key unlock.
<Li><strong>Changing Code and Encryption</strong> - Transmitted code changes after each
use to prevent playback. Encrypting algorithm prevents prediction of the next code.
<Li><strong>Personalization</strong> - Signal from module indicates which of four
transmitters was used to unlock vehicle. Other vehicle systems may use this signal to
accommodate individual setting and preferences such as memory seat and mirror positions,
climate control and radio station.
<li><strong>Seat Easy Entry and Anti-theft Positioning</strong> - When door is opened,
driver's seat moves downward and rearward to provide easy entry. Seat is positioned in fully up
and forward position when theft deterrent is activated.
<li><strong>Fuel Door Release</strong> - Fuel door can be released by remote operation.
<li><strong>Post Crash Unlock and Illuminate</strong> - Module, using a signal from a
vehicle crash sensing system, will unlock all doors and illuminate the interior lights after a fixed
delay time.
<li><strong>Retained Accessory</strong> - Accessory power remains on after ignition is turned
off to allow continued operation of power windows, radio, etc. Power is deactivated by opening
the driver's door or after a certain period of time.
<li><strong>Battery Saver/Upgrade</strong> - If a door is left open, this feature deactivates
interior lights after 10 minutes. The upgraded feature provides monitoring of trunk, glove box and
underhood lamps and limited their activation time to prevent battery from running down.
<Li><strong>Serial Data Bus</strong> - A diagnostic link for assembly plant testing,
verification and troubleshooting.

<h2>Planning makes DN-101 GEM of opportunity for electronics teams</h2>

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/mod1.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="194">
<P>	Input Controls has several products on the Taurus/Sable, including a generic electronics module (GEM) developed by UTA's advanced engineering team.  The module controls 14 separate functions in one box connected to and mounted on the car's junction box (also a UTA component).  The 14 functions were controlled by eight or nine different modules on earlier versions of the Taurus/Sable, so, in addition to being a tremendous technical achievement, the GEM represents a significant cost savings for the customer.
<P>	Some of the 14 functions controlled by GEM are familiar, such as warnings for safety belts.  Others are new for the Taurus, such as a battery saver feature which will protect the car from battery current drain while the engine is shut off.  If there are no inputs to the GEM after 40 minutes, the GEM shuts off any accessories or interior lamps left on. (See below for full description of functions)</P>
<P>	Service workers can ask the GEM for system conditions or can run tests on the GEM to verify the integrity of the system and its connections.</P>
<P>	The Tampa, Fla.-built GEM will handle 14 separate electrical activities for the new Ford Taurus/Sable, including:</P>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
		<LI>Battery Saver - protects car from inadvertent battery drain by turning off accessories and interior lamps after 40 minutes of inactivity.
		<LI>Illuminated Entry/Courtesy Lamps - anytime a door is opened, interior lamps will go on and remain on for 25 seconds after all the doors are closed.
		<LI>Safety Belt Warning - if the driver's safety belt is not buckled when the ignition is turned to RUN, a lamp will light up in the instrument panel for 60 seconds and a chime will sound for 6 seconds.
		<LI>Key-In-Ignition Warning - if the key is in the ignition and not in the RUN position, a chime will sound when the driver's door is opened.
		<LI>Headlamps On - if the headlamps are on when the driver's door is open, a chime will sound continuously.
		<LI>Door Ajar Warning - if the ignition switch is in RUN, the GEM will sound a chime when any door is open and light up the Door Ajar lamp in the instrument panel.
		<LI>Front Wiper/Washer Control - the GEM decodes inputs from the multifunction switch (made by Input Controls in Traverse City, Mich.) and controls the low and high speed wipers, front windshield washer and seven pulse wipe intervals.
		<LI>Heated Backlight - activates the rear window and side mirror defrosters; turns off after 10 minutes.
		<LI>One Touch Down Power - the driver's side window down switch is momentarily pressed, the GEM activates the relay and lowers the window (motor by UT Automotive).
		<LI>Delayed Accessory - allows power windows and moonroof circuits to be closed for 45 seconds after the car is turned off.
		<LI>Steering System (VAPS II Variable Assist)-closed loop control of the current to the variable assist power steering actuator based on speed of car.
		<LI>Driver Door Lock Disable - prevents the driver's door from being locked if the key is left in the ignition.
		<LI>Central/Two-Step Unlock - allows all door locks to be unlocked form the driver's or passenger's key cylinder by turning the key to the unlock position twice.
		<LI>Low Coolant Level Indication - if coolant level drops below a preset level, the GEM will light up an indicator on the instrument panel and sound a chime.

<h2> Instrument Panel Ergonomics: <br>Designing Beyond Accessibility</h2>
<h4>by <a href="obrien.htm">Timothy O'Brien</a></h4>
<p> </P>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When most people think of ergonomics, the first thing they usually visualize is the "Oscar Layout" or "SID" the crash test dummy. We think of designing an instrument panel (I/P) so that most drivers - from the ninety-ninth-percent male through the third-percent female - can comfortably fit behind the wheel and easily access all vehicle controls. Total ergonomic design, however, goes beyond accessibility to include functionality and aesthetics.</P>
<p>Several real-world examples come to mind when we consider this concept of total ergonomic design, such as the annoyance of driving at night with the constant reflection of cluster lights hitting the driver's eyes from the windshield or side window, or the sound of that cold-weather squeak between the trim bezel and
<p><cite>"We must bear in mind that the object we are working on is going to be ridden in, sat upon, looked at, talked to, activated, operated or in some other way used by people.</P>
<p>"If the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, the designer has failed.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, if people are made safer, more efficient more comfortable or just plain happier - by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded."</P></cite>
<p>To succeed with an automotive instrument panel design, all forms of driver contact, desires or expectations must be considered. Controls mounted on the I/P must be visible; be located where expected, and function according to the operator's preconceived method. Matching the customer's perceptions with this given expectations will create perfect harmony between man and machine.</p>

<h3>Ergonomics' Basic Aim</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>The basic aim of ergonomics is to measure the capabilities of the man and then to arrange the environment to fit such abilities. An attempt to "fit the job to the man" rather than to "fit the man to the job." These measured capabilities are more than simply dimensional and size constraints.</P>
<p>We receive information from the outside world from our senses - sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. The sensory system receives stimuli and send information along the particular sensory system. This is the process. On entering the brain these nerve impulses are interpreted to produce recognizable patterns of sight, smell, sound, etc. This process is influences greatly by the individual's past experiences and expectations. This process of perception, however, is entirely subjective in nature.</P>
<p>The design criteria of an instrument panel can be considered to fall into two general areas. The first are requirements associated with the actual measured capabilities of the man. These are such items as accessibility, efforts of controls, and all safety-related items, whether federal regulations or strictly occupant protection criteria. These "hard" design criteria items make up the sets of standards for most instrument panel design requirements. Standards are required to verify that the occupant can physically, comfortably and safely operate the motor vehicle. This part of the design phase is of most interest to the engineering and design team. The actual operator, however, assumes the majority of these items to be a given. He expects to be able to see and reach all controls, to fit comfortably behind the wheel and to know that he is safe.</P>
<p>A second area of I/P design criteria may have more to do with the operator's perception of design rather than the actual standard design requirements. For starters, before anyone even touches a product, an opinion is formed based solely upon its appearance. Many people feel as though they're "looking at what they paid for" while driving down the road. The visual quality of an I/P is one of the most important features of an automobile. Obtaining consistent color and gloss, as well as maintaining excellent fit and finish between components, gives the operator that good feeling about the car. Of equal importance is that vehicle controls must function in the manner the operator expects. He finds controls located where he thinks they should be and they look and function as expected.</p>
<h3>Instrument Panel Design</h3>
<p>The instrument panel design process takes us from the styling clay model through final production drawing release (or CAD tape). A packaging drawing is constructed around three major I/P sections. First is through the steering column center which is used to verify driver fit and sight requirements. A section through the center line of vehicle is used to package all center stack controls, A/C outlets, ash receiver etc. Finally a third section through the P.A.B. door and glove box opening is used to package the airbag canister, verify glove box opening is used to package the airbag canister, verify glove box swing and evaluate fit of the passenger.</P>
<p>The starting point for any instrument panel design is the orientation of the driver and passenger relative to the vehicle interior. In Figure 2 we see the start of an I/P packaging layout showing the 95th percentile driver. The mannequin is placed in the rearmost "H" point or seating position marked "Hr." The "eyellipse," shown in Figure 3, is a standard SAE tool used by the industry to indicate the range of drivers eye location. It is designed such that any line of sight tangent to this ellipse defines a boundary that accommodates 99 percent of the drivers. In addition to verifying unobstructed viewing of all controls, the line-of-sight studies are used to predict any unwanted reflections off the vehicle windshield. Figure 4 shows a line-of-sight study predicting veiling glare, a phenomenon usually seen as an inverted ghost-like image of the I/P surface and any surface features present such as defroster grilles.</P>
<p>In addition to these dimensional and visual requirements for the I/P, there are several safety criteria. Occupant protection is a critical feature of every instrument panel design. Such requirements as head impact (FMVSS 201), knee impact (FMVSS 208) or homologations must be designed into the system. Each OEM has a set of standards (typically beyond that of the federal requirements) used to verify maximum occupant safety during a potential accident.</P>
<p>The ergonomics of physical size, shape and strength abilities of the occupant generate these sets of "hard" design criteria. Standards are created to accommodate the full range of the population relative to these physical parameters. Although of great importance, most operators of vehicle actually are unaware of these designed-in features. Again, the driver expects to be comfortable behind the wheel, to be able to see and reach all controls and generally be happy driving his new vehicle. Beyond the accessibility of all controls are the ergonomics: their movement, locations and looks.</P>

<h3>Ergonomics of Controls</h3>
<p>The number and complexity of automotive controls is increasingly dramatically as features and functions for safety, comfort and convenience are added. Cruise controls, power windows, locks, mirrors and power seat adjustments are just a few of the added features available in most cars today. These additional controls obviously result in instrument panels that are more intricate and crowded than ever before. The issues of control design, placement and looks thus presents a challenge to I/P design teams.</P>
<p>When expectancies for the preferred direction of control operation are found to be the same in a large percentage of people, the expectancies can be termed "population stereotypes." Several direction-of-motion stereotypes are shown in Figure 5. These are the SAE findings for "on" or "increasing" directions. Some of these stereotypes come from associations to controls found in the home - light switches, appliances or volume buttons on a TV, for example. Rather extensive surveys and experimentation are required to obtain these population stereotypes. Some evolve slowly as the general population becomes more familiar with a type of control. See, for example, the left and right stalk controls shown in Figure 6. People are becoming more familiar with using the steering wheel stalks to control such features as high beams, wipers and washers. Consistency in design is crucial for this type of control.</P>
<p>The general location of certain controls is another expectancy of drivers. The high-beam control, for example, previously was a foot switch and now, as mentioned, has been moved to the left stalk. The power-mirror switches shown in Figure 7 are being evaluated for door- versus console-mounting locations. Again, consistency creates location as well as direction-of-motion stereotypes.</P>
<p>The look of a particular control - or more specifically the symbol representing it - has become a standard set by SAE (J1048). The International Standardization Organization (ISO) has created 25 automotive "ISO" symbols used in the automotive interior to identify certain controls and displays. The chart in Figure 8 shows the result of a recent survey relative to ISO symbol recognition. The percentages of correct recognition, shown at the top of the chart, indicate that there are several symbols which do not yet have strong stereotypes.</p>
<p>The determination of tendencies for any of these forms of stereotypes is an ongoing study. As the direction of motion, location or symbolic look of controls becomes more and more consistent across vehicles from around the globe, these particular stereotypes will be converted into additional I/P ergonomic design standards. With new features will come new controls requiring additional surveys to establish the next evolution of stereotypes.</P><p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The complexity of future instrument panel designs increasingly will be steadily as the number of additional features become standard equipment. Such techniques as head up displays (HUD) where controls are projected onto the windshield, will definitely become standard. The focused image just over the hood can contain all control displays and symbols. just as with the manual controls, these types of controls also will require extensive customer evaluations. Looking for any advanced stereotype tendencies will help design the system so that the customer is comfortable with it.</P>
<p>Another technique to be used in future I/P designs will be the use of "virtual reality." In this totally simulated world, a designer (or potential customer) can completely drive the vehicle, operating all controls and evaluating comfort, convenience and the actual look of the vehicle interior. All of this can be accomplished through computer simulation techniques without investing the time and money required to produce prototype mock-up systems. The entire interior environment can be designed, simulated, evaluated and changed before any tooling has been started.</P>
<p>The instrument panel design, obviously, must continue to accommodate all constraints and capabilities relative to the varied population of intended occupants. To obtain the highest degree of quality of an I/P design, however, we must go beyond mere accessibility. Designing an extremely user-friendly environment will generate the greatest customer perceptions of quality, comfort and enjoyment. True customer focus is the only way to approach the perfect match of man and machine.

<h2> Photonic Displays</h2>
<h3>Take to the Road<br>
<I>New flat-panel technologies chase liquid-crystal displays for automotive applications.</I></h3>
<p>by Silviu Palalau
as published in <cite>Photonics Spectra</cite>, April, 1996
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/fig1.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="491" HEIGHT="244">


<br><hr>
<strong>Figure 1. </strong><em>Flat-panel displays: not your father's dashboard.</em>   <hr>             
<p>Automobiles have undergone some remarkable changes since their inception. They no longer are 
just a means of transportation; they have become a home away from  home with all of the creature 
comforts to which we are accustomed. Even navigational aids, including digital maps and orbital 
satellites that monitor the precise location of a vehicle, have come of age.</p>

<p>Map navigation systems show the driver's position on a map, the route to a selected destination,
 and, if an Information Traffic System is implemented, traffic-jam areas and alternate routes. The 
 technology is mature enough to be accepted in the automotive world; several map navigation systems
  already are on the market. </p>

<p>There is an increasing number of high-information-content systems in a car (e.g., map navigation,
 collision warning/avoidance, rearview camera, etc.). These high-information-content systems have a 
 common thread: the need for a high-resolution flat-panel display.</p>

<p>In late January, UT Automotive and Planar Systems entered into a series of 
agreements focused at jointly developing electroluminescent display products for the automobile market.
 The systems could provide navigation, vehicle tracking, function controls, security, trip computing,
  mapping/routing and other features (Figure 1). The decision to focus on electroluminescent displays 
  was based on a study of mature and emerging display technologies and the specific properties needed 
  for automotive applications.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<strong>What car-makers need</strong>

<p>Flat-panel display requirements are related to the application and location in the car. The
applications include the information center in the console area shared by the driver and passenger, 
the instrument panel in front of the driver (and which the passenger may view), and so-called "head-up" 
information projected directly onto the windshield so the driver need not look down to access the 
information. The challenging automotive goal for the first two categories is high optical 
performance and automotive compliance at low cost ($2 or less per square inch of display).</p>

<p>The contrast ratio in low and high ambient light is the most important measure of optical
 performance and is measured as follows:</p>

<em>Contrast ratio = (brightness of image + reflected light)/(brightness of background + 
reflected light).</em>

<p>The brightness level specified by many display manufacturers is inadequate for use in 
automotive applications because of the ambient sunlight environment. It is generally accepted 
in automotive human-factors studies that a contrast ratio of 1.2 is the lowest value that provides 
legibility. High-contrast and low-reflectivity values are needed within the driver's optical cone 
and the passenger's field of vision.</p>

<p>Another measure of optical performance is the number of colors or hues. Full-color capability 
should be considered if the display is a TV/video monitor. However, US safety regulations prohibit 
drivers from watching TV while driving; therefore, multicolor displays with a limited number of 
colors and shades per color may be considered for information centers or instrument panels if 
they are more cost-effective.</p>

<p>Each car manufacturer sets its own environmental conditions and guidelines for testing
 electromechanical or optical parts, but they share almost the same philosophy in considering 
 environmental factors. The environmental working conditions depend on the display's mounting
  place and position in the car. Typically, the operational temperature range is from -30&#186C 
  to +80&#186C, but they may be up to +92&#186C on some of the instrument panel surfaces exposed
   to sun.</p>

<p>Temperature cycle and temperature shock tolerance (to simulate opening the car door on a very 
cold day or a very hot day) are also tested. The operational voltage range is from 9 to 16 V with
 some variations (reverse voltage, load dump fluctuation, low-voltage and high-voltage conductive 
 and inductive noise). Electromagnetic interference is another environmental condition that should
  be considered at high and low frequencies (i.e., the audio spectrum) so that the display will 
  not interfere with other electronics circuitry placed nearby.</p>

<p>The current technologies of choice for automotive applications are liquid-crystal displays
 for high-resolution needs (because of their availability) and vacuum fluorescent displays for
  low-resolution needs (because of their low price). Competing technologies for this market 
  include electroluminescent display, plasma displays and field emitter displays.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<strong>The old stand-by</strong>
<p>There are several categories of liquid-crystal displays, but the common denominator is a 
substance called liquid crystal, which maintains its properties within a temperature band between
 solidified and liquefied points.</p>

<p>Liquid-crystal displays have some basic problems, including limited operational temperature 
range, low response time, low contrast, limited viewing angle, need for an external light source,
 need for polarizers, flickering, crosstalk, and a trade-off between brightness and lifetime 
 (the higher the brightness, the shorter the lifetime). Also, like any organic material, these 
 displays need an ultraviolet- and infarred-blocking layer to protect them from sunlight and external 
 light sources.</p>

<p>Attempts to correct these problems have made the liquid-crystal display (LCD) family a tree 
with many branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>In polymer-disperse LCDs, the passage of light is controlled by the electric field without 
the use of polarizers. In polymer-stabilized cholesteric-texture LCDs, the cholesteric liquid 
crystal display reflects the light. There are two stable states (or textures): the reflecting
 planar state and the nonreflecting focal conic state. This provides a high-contrast display in 
 sunlight and does not need polarizers. Its bistability enables it to retain images without any 
 power. Disadvantages include very long response time (about 5 seconds) and only monocolor 
 (no shades).</li><p>
<li>Active-matrix LCDs have a switching element for each pixel. The active element may be either
 a two-terminal, diode kind (metal isolated metal) or a three-terminal-element thin-film transistor 
 on amorphous silicon or ploy silicon. These displays overcome the flickering problem by isolating
  each pixel in the matrix. The pixel is activated during each refresh cycle and remains activated 
  due to a stored charge.</li></ul>
<p>The main problems with active-matrix displays are their complex structure and the number of parts
 included in the display system. (Figure 2)
<P><IMG SRC="images/fig2.gif" ALT="figure 2"  ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="422"><hr><strong>Figure 2.</strong><em> The active-matrix 
liquid-crystal display comprises many layers of materials and optical elements.</EM><hr>
 These result in the high manufacturing costs. The only 
 advantage of the simple-matrix LCD (or "passive" LCD) vs. active-matrix LCD is lower manufacturing 
 costs (about one-third of the active-matrix displays).</p>
<ul><li>Ferroelectric LCDs maintain their orientation without an applied voltage, so the inherent 
memory of the ferroelectric materials allows simpler drive electronics than an active-matrix LCD 
(i.e., no refreshing of the screen is needed). These crystals also switch more quickly and provide
 higher contrast. They are difficult to manufacture, however, because of the photosensitivity of
  the ferroelectric crystal and the very narrow spacing and tolerances of the liquid-crystal cell.</li><p>
<li>Twisted nematic molecules twist 90&#186 and use polarizers to block the light. Supertwisted 
nematic molecules twist 180&#186 to 270&#186 (typically 240&#186) and use the twisted crystals 
as a light-frequency retarder. The transmission/voltage characteristic has a much steeper slope; 
therefore, much greater contrast can be achieved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<strong>Competing technologies</strong>
<p>Vacuum fluorescent technology comes in three basic types: character display or 5 x 7-matrix dots;
 custom-designed characters and symbols; and large, high-resolution matrix dots (300 x 200). The first
  two are low-resolution displays (about 3 x 3-mm dot size) already in use in cars. Despite their high
   brightness, the contrast is not very good in ambient sunlight. Increasing the brightness can 
   increase contrast, but this produces some temperature dissipation problems, especially for large 
   displays. Another disadvantage is the lack of shades and colors.</p>
<p>Some display manufacturers offer highly integrated, low-resolution, custom-designed displays and
 driving electronics at a very low price. But high-resolution vacuum florescent displays are still
  in the prototype stage, struggling with driving electronics and temperature dissipation problems.</p>
<p>A less-developed technology, the field-emitter display, is struggling to find a good manufacturing
 process for sharp tips or diamond layers. Also, field emitters have trouble with high operating 
 voltages and accidental discharges between pixels; this technology is not yet mature enough for 
 automotive application.</p>
<p>Another contender, the electroluminescent display, looks more promising. It offers a robust solid-state
 structure, (Figure 3) the ability to operate in harsh environments and a wide viewing angle. 
 <P><IMG SRC="images/fig3.gif" ALT="figure 3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="235" HEIGHT="204">
 <HR><STRONG> Figure 3.</STRONG><EM>Multicolor electroluminescent display structure developed by Planar Systems</EM><hr><p>
 An emissive display, it does not need an external light source. The displayed information can 
 be multicolor (multiple shades of red and green), with high contrast in high ambient light, so 
 it is readable in sunlight.</p>
<p>Unlike the liquid-crystal display, the electroluminescent display has a quick response time 
independent of temperature.(Figure 4)
<p><IMG SRC="images/fig4.gif" ALT="figure 4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="504" HEIGHT="216">
<hr><STRONG> Figure 4.</STRONG><EM>Electroluminescent displays respond more quickly then thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal displays, especially in cold weather.</EM><hr>
 Consequently, electroluminescent displays do not require 
extra components (e.g., heaters) to support display startup in cold weather conditions. In addition,
 electroluminescents do not require protection, as liquid-crystal displays do, from overheating in 
 direct exposure to sunlight, which can wash out the screen. The electroluminescent display also has
  a wider viewing angle than the LCD (Figure 5).</p>

 <strong>Figure 5.</strong><em>Contrast is more stable across all viewing angles in electroluminescent displays than in thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal displays.</em><hr>
<p>
<strong>Color still a concern</strong>
<p>Electroluminescent technology lags behind liquid crystals in one significant area: It lacks 
full-color capability on electroluminescent displays is still complicated from a manufacturing 
standpoint (and thus costly), and full-color technology has reached only the prototype stage. 
Consequently, it is not yet an option.</p>
<p>In comparison to vacuum florescent display technology, electroluminescent technology has 
fewer problems with temperature and power dissipation in larger sizes (e.g., 300 x 200 pixels, 
where vacuum fluorescence is in prototype stages). Electroluminescent displays also offer higher
 resolution and more colors and shades per color than vacuum fluorescence.</p>  
<p> In comparison to plasma display technology, electroluminescence has a higher resolution, 
a higher contrast and more shades per color. Also, plasma displays are much larger (i.e., the 
electroluminescent is more compact) because of the size of glass required and the barrier ribs
 that are required to isolate each individual pixel.</p>
<p>The next generation of cars will need flat-panel displays. The choice of a technology will
 be determined by application, price and performance. From a technical standpoint and based 
 on its inherent characteristics, electroluminescent display technology is the most feasible 
 option for automotive high-resolution displays. Because of its simple structure, manufacturing 
 costs should be lower than those for liquid-crystal, which is by far the most significant 
 competitor.<p>

<h2> Energy Storage Technologies and Their Benefits to Hybrid Vehicles</h2>
<h4>by Evan C. Polley and Thomas W. Grudkowski <BR>United Technologies Research Center</h4>

<p>
<h3>HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES</h3>

<P>Concern over the environment effects of mobile source air pollution (especially CO, NOx, and volatile organic compounds) has caused various forms of government regulation during the past twenty years.  Recently state governments in the United States, most notably, California, have begun to mandate the use of "zero-emissions" or all-electric vehicles (EV) to concentrate air pollution at more easily managed electric utility power plants.</P>
<P>To maintain customer satisfaction, automobile manufacturer must respond to these environmental concerns without substantially increasing the cost or reducing the performance (range, acceleration, availability of auxiliaries such as heat or air conditioning) of their products.  As will be developed below, there no energy storage technologies that appear to offer the ability to completely and cost-effectively replace conventional heat engines with battery-powered electric motors.  This technological limit will likely continue well into the next decade.</P>
<P>A potentially viable alternative is the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), which combines a heat engine with electric drive and some on-board electric energy storage.  HEV's offer the opportunity to substantially reduce emissions of pollUT Automotivents while maintaining current performance.  The existing refueling infrastructure is also maintained. An additional benefit that can be expected is a significant improvement in fuel efficiency. The United States' Partnership for New Generation Vehicle (PNGV) goal is roughly 3 liters per 100 km, a level likely to be very attractive to automobile drivers and buyers.</P>
<P>Comparisons among the power train systems for a 1500 kg passenger car are shown in Table 1.</P>

<h3>HYBRID VEHICLE TYPES</h3>
<P>	HEV's  are typically divided into "parallel" and "series" types.  Parallel HEV's have both mechanical and electric drive capability, often linked by clutch mechanisms.  Serial HEV's have only electrical drive.  Here, the hear engine is employed only to power a generator to create electricity.  Both types must have electric energy storage and electric drives both are capable of using regenerated braking energy to extend range and enhance efficiency.  HEV's can be further divided by their mode of operation.  They can be either "dual mode" permitting zero emission, pure electric operation or "power assist" where both battery and heat engine power are typically applied together.
<P>	Given these system-level differences and the number of major powertrain subsystems (heat engine, generator, electric energy storage, fuel storage, mechanical drives, electric traction drive, controller (s), interfaces, etc.), the challenge of optimizing HEV designs is significant.  Bradford Bates of Ford Motor Co. has created a useful framework for discussing these design trade-offs.<B>[2]</B>. Figure 1 is adapted from his recent use of three-dimensional design space that demonstrates the variations in heat engine size, electric drive capability and electric energy storage. Fuel storage is not a design limiting factor in most cases. In Fig. 1, designs for series HEV's can be placed on the top surface of the cube. Parallel HEV's occupy the interior of the cube. Conventional vehicles and pure electric vehicles occupy the limit powers at the two of the cube's corners.</P>

<HR>
Figure 1. HEV Design Trade-off
<HR>
<p>
<BR>
<P>	Figure 1 highlights some of the key issues facing HEV designers. For both parallel and series HEVs, choice of dual mode (such as points A or B in Fig. 1) operation requires equipping the vehicle with electric and heat engine drives that are each fully capable of powering the vehicle.  The on-board energy storage requirement is significant. Power-assist operation (as at point C or D in Fig. 1) sacrifices the ability to operate in pure electric mode but enables reduction in both electric drive and heat engine capability.  Modern, high efficiency components and controls are required in both cases.  However, careful energy and power management can allow smaller less capable sub-systems 
to combine to provide performances similar to conventional vehicles.  Figure 2, adapted from BMW., shows the parallel and series HEV operating strategies in power assist mode <B>[4]</B>.</P>
<P>	Figure 3 shows a specific example of each of the four possible combinations of parallel/series and dual mode power assist. The notional vehicle is a 1500 kg passenger car of approximately model year (MY) 2004. Performance should be, in general, equivalent to current conventional designs, with typical accessories. Although lighter vehicles and specific purpose vehicles may be possible, the vehicle target should embody the mainstream, high volume and low-cost technologies that provide today's high levels of customer satisfaction. For comparison, the four examples of Fig. 3 have been plotted on Fig. 1 at the point A, B, C, and D.</P>

<P>	All the electro-chemical batteries fall short of the HEV requirements in two areas: specific power and cycle life. Although there is sufficient energy storage available for reasonable battery weights, these batteries will neither provide sufficient power not last the lifetime of the vehicle. The 60 kW or 80 kW traction motors of Fig. 3 will be uselessly oversized unless sufficient electric power is available. Conversely, low powered vehicles that require customers to repeatedly buy expensive replacement batteries will be unresponsive to customers needs.  Further, a lack of power density will greatly reduce the energy efficiently impact of regenerative braking. Note that no battery technology promises performance equal to the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) Long-Term EV Goal. Together, with the absence of an electric vehicle recharging infrastructure, this lack of an appropriate energy storage technology will undermine any regulatory effort to use pure electric drive systems in mainstream vehicle applications.</P>
<P>	Two alternative to electrochemical batteries are now under development:  flywheel energy storage and ultracapacitors.  Both promise ample power and cycle life, but are challenged by store energy in a polarized liquid layer which forms when an electric potential is created between two electrodes in an electrolyte, seem unlikely to be developed to a level of energy density that would be useful in a vehicle. Flywheel energy storage, where energy is stored in a rotating mass of composite material connected to a motor/generator, seems most likely to find an application in HEV's. Flywheel devices can be scaled for different power requirements (by changing the motor/generator) separately from scaling for energy storage requirements through changes in the rotating structure.  
This flexibility is responsive to the large number of potential designs in Fig. 1. Additionally, unlike many chemical batteries, flywheel devices are environmentally benign and pose no disposal problems at the end of their useful life. A pre-prototype flywheel surge power unit, under development by UT Automotive with BMW A.G., is shown in Fig. 4 <B>[5]</B>.</P></P>

<p>

<H3>DESIGNING ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM FOR HEV'S</H3> 
<P>The target 1500 kg passenger car with conventional vehicle performance and accessories shall require energy storage of at least 25 kWhr to operate pure electric. If electric operation range is 4 km/kWhr for typical drive cycles, a rather limiting 100 km range between recharging results. Unfortunately, any battery technology that will be available in the foreseeable future will require a tremendous mass of batteries to store this much energy and also deliver adequate power. Limiting the battery mass to a more realistic 200 kg provides insight into design possibilities that are more likely to be practical. </P>
<P>The electric power requirement placed on the energy storage system depends on the heat engine power available and the choice of dual mode vs. power available and the choice of dual mode vs. power assist operation. For the example power systems of Fig. 3, this electric power requirement is 50 kW to 80 kW.</P>
<P>Figure 5 applies the specifications of Table 2 to the two relevant axes of the design space cube of Fig. 1. In each case, the candidate energy storage technology is plotted for a range up to 200 kg of energy storage mass. The PNGV and USABC energy storage goals are also plotted,</P>
<P>Limitations on the design space are caused by the limitations in the energy storage technologies. Practical general use of pure electric vehicles are shown unlikely. Allowing 500 kg of the nickel metal hydride batteries may yield 40 kWhrs of energy storage and 100 kW electric power output. The cost of such a mass of batteries, and the impact on the design of the vehicle's structure, are likely to be unacceptable. Even among HEV design option, energy storage limitations will reduce the options available. Practical design points exist around the PNGV goals of 2 kWhr to 5 kWhr for energy storage and 60 kW to 80 kW electric power output. Flywheel technology is responsive here. However, flywheel technology, especially for the 5 kWhr device, is unlikely to fully meet PNGV goal for energy storage mass.</P>
<P>Advance electrochemical batteries may prove useful in providing limited range or low-power zero-emissions operations for dual mode HEV's. But unlike flywheel device where energy storage and power output are independent parameters only specific ratios of energy storage to power are available to HEV designers using electrochemical batteries.</P>
<P>Ultra capacitor applications are more limited. They are most likely to be useful for very high power output power needs that do not have substantial energy storage requirements. An example would be pre-heating of emissions-controlling catalysts to reduce start-up on conventional vehicles.</P>
<p>
<H3>KEY ISSUES: COST AND DEVELOPMENT</H3>

<P>The PNGV cost challenge for HEV energy storage technologies is significant. The 2 kWhr, 60 kW device is targeted at $1000 for MY 2004 with the 5 kWhr, 80 kW drive at $2000 ($20/kg and $27/kg respectively).  These challenging cost goals will constrain designers of electric energy storage devices to avoid exotic materials and manufacturing processes.  Designs at the limit of material allowable or with overly precise tolerances or construction techniques will be most unlikely to succeed. The PNGV goals are most likely to be met in the high-volume production environment that characterizes most automotive manufacturing.  This is a key reason for focusing development efforts on applications that are likely to be broadly appealing to customers, rather than on limited or specialty markets.</P>
<P>With the early involvement of high volume automotive manufacturers, design evolution can be undertaken now that will result in HEV's that are both environmentally beneficial and genuinely desired by the driving public early in the next decade. </P>

UT Automotive expands electronics in Europe</H2>
<P>
<P><STRONG>
KRONACH, Germany Jan. 27, 1997</strong> - UT Automotive, a United Technologies company, signaled its expansion in the automotive electronics industry in Europe by signing an agreement to form a joint venture with Loewe Opta GmbH, a German electronics company.<p>

"This joint venture demonstrates our commitment to supporting our global customers," said Norm Bodine, president and chief executive officer of UT Automotive. "Loewe has been an excellent supplier of automotive electronics to the European automotive industry. This joint venture supports our company's efforts to quickly expand our electronic capabilities in the European market with established, high-quality products and name recognition."<p>
UT Automotive is the majority owner of the new venture, named UT Loewe Automotive, and the company will continue to operate in Kronach. Loewe Opta will concentrate on its commercial operations. 
Bodine said the joint venture with Loewe provides UT Automotive with a key opportunity to build and grow its electronics business throughout Europe, and is consistent with the company's strategy to focus on globablization, technology and focusing on its core businesses.<p>
"This acquisition in Europe is a major step in our ongoing strategic plan to further develop our capabilities in electronics and expand our technology base around the world," Bodine said. "It also offers us an opportunity to expand and grow our customer base."<p>
"With UT Automotive as a partner, we strengthen the international aspect of automotive electronics," said Dr. Rainer Hecker, Loewe manager. "It thus becomes easier to be a systems supplier for the automotive industry. Additionally, the cooperation extends our customer base and guarantees a larger volume of orders."<p>

Gunter Mecklinger, who has been responsible for Loewe's automotive electronics business, will be the head of the new company. He is one of about 180 employees who will switch to UT Loewe Automotive from Loewe Opta. Mecklinger will report to Richard Sloan, president of UT Automotive - Europe.
"Loewe will support our efforts to strengthen our relationships with key customers such as BMW, which they have had a long-term relationship with," Sloan said. "In addition, not only does this give us worldwide production of electronic components, but the sharing of technologies among our operations will make us a better supplier of innovative products and high-quality electronic components to our present and future customers."<p>

Automotive electronics that had been produced by Loewe Opta and will be produced by UT Loewe Automotive include electronics for the control of heating and air conditioning systems; power switching electronics; electronic modules to control seats, mirrors and instrument clusters; electronics for anti-lock braking systems and chassis controls; analog and digital audio amplifiers; and video modules.<p>

UT Automotive is a $3.1 billion tier-one supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Based in Dearborn, Mich., the company has 40,000 employees and 90 manufacturing plants in 18 countries.<p>

UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <A HREF="http://www.utc.com">United Technologies Corp.</A>, which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.<p>

UT Automotive to discontinue operations in Thomson, Ga.</H2><P>
<P><STRONG>THOMSON, Ga., Jan. 7, 1997 </strong>- UT Automotive, a United Technologies company, today informed employees of the company's intention to discontinue its operations in Thomson, Ga.<p>
The company plans to move production of acoustical products from Thomson to a                UT Automotive facility in Holland, Mich., during the second quarter of 1997. Approximately 175 employees are expected to be affected by the move.<p>
UT Automotive made the announcement today to provide as much advance notice as possible to its employees.
"We regret these changes will result in a downsizing of our work force, and in the closing of our Thomson facility," said Ed Northern, vice president and general manager of UT Automotive's Interiors operation. "But unfortunately, in order to survive in our highly competitive automotive business, these very difficult decisions had to be made."<p>
In June 1996, the company announced one of Thomson's product lines would be moved to the Holland facility.
"Our intent was to allow the Thomson plant the opportunity to return to profitability," Northern said. "Unfortunately, the business and the plant's financial performance has remained at an unacceptable level."<p>
In an effort to support its work force in Thomson, UT Automotive is developing plans for its associates that include some special separation and insurance coverage benefits.
UT Automotive, with headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.<p>

<h2>UT Automotive to build new engineering/technology center in the Philippines</h2>

<STRONG>CEBU, Philippines, Nov. 22, 1996</STRONG> - UT Automotive, a United Technologies company, today announced plans to invest $5 million in the construction of a 60,000-square-foot engineering and technology center in Cebu.
The new Philippine Engineering and Technology Center will replace a 13,000-square-foot facility currently located in a UT Automotive manufacturing facility in Cebu.<p>
UT Automotive expects the number of employees at the center will grow from 93 to more than 250 over the next five years. The new facility will accommodate the anticipated growth in personnel, as well as expand the laboratory and development areas.<p>
The center also will strengthen UT Automotive's commitment to serving customers in the Asia-Pacific region.<p>
"Although the Philippine Engineering and Technology Center has seen steady growth over the past four years, we have only scratched the surface of its potential," UT Automotive President Norm Bodine said. "The use of the Philippine Engineering and Technology Center by all UT Automotive business units provides a tremendous opportunity for business synergies through the sharing of information, pooling of resources on common projects, and development of systems proposals for new business ventures."<p>
"The Philippine Engineering and Technology Center will truly be a resource shared by all of UT Automotive."
<p>UT Automotive first established a Philippine Engineering and Technology Center in 1992 to provide engineering support to the Cebu manufacturing facilities, to establish design and quoting capability in Cebu, and to enhance UT Automotive's business presence in Asia-Pacific.<p>
The center initially supported UT Automotive's Wiring Systems business unit, but has provided support to the company's other business units - Input Controls, Interiors and Motor Systems - since 1995.<p>
The center, which is linked to other company engineering centers in North America and Europe, helps UT Automotive provide its customers with round-the-clock engineering capabilities throughout the world.
Operations at the Philippine center include computer-aided design (CAD), testing, modeling, warranty and reliability, parts-submission warrant (PSW) dimensional layout, and benchmarking.<p>
The center supports all quoting of new business proposals for Asian/Pacific customers, provides product engineering liaison to manufacturing operations, and conducts value-engineering/value-analysis (VE/VA) activities to ensure competitive quotes.<p>
UT Automotive, with headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.<p>
UT Automotive is a unit of Hartford, Conn.-based <A HREF="http://www.utc.com">United Technologies Corp.</A>, which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

(313) 593-9672</h5><h2>UT Automotive Develops Advanced 'Smart' Junction Box Technology 
 </h2><p>
 
                                 
  <strong>DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 21 </strong> - In an effort to increase efficiency
and improve upon today's automotive electrical distribution systems (EDS), UT
Automotive, a United Technologies Company, has developed an advanced concept
called "Smart" Junction Box (SJB) technology. <p>

  Thanks to the high level of integration found in SJB technology, engineers
 will soon be able to develop EDS with reduced wire harness bulk, less
complexity and fewer interconnections.  SJB.0 technology offers automakers a
fully integrated, multifunctional, electronic and electromechanical management
system.<p>
 
  The UT Automotive SJB completely integrates current systems through its
advanced design and integration and consolidation of 14 separate electrical
modules. <p>

  "SJB technology represents an evolutionary step in the development of
junction boxes because we can integrate both the electronic functions and the
existing power functions into a single unit," said William Floyd, manager of
electronic products for UT Automotive's Input Controls business unit. "Another
important advantage of SJBs is the ability to make quick and less-costly
design changes when necessary." <p>
  SJBs can provide a number of benefits in control and performance improvement
functions within the EDS.  Among these are:  <ul>
  <li>a reduced number of interconnections 
<li>reduced packaging size and weight 
  <li>a decreased amount of parts to assemble 
  <li>shorter design and lead times 
<li>elimination of additional electronic modules 
 <li>improved reliability  </ul><p>

  UT Automotive's SJB technology utilizes printed circuit boards (PCB) instead
of traditional metal fret assemblies.  An advantage of this technology is its
ability to create very complex circuit interconnects through the use of
photo-lithographic processes.  UT Automotive's SJB consists of two PCB layers
covered by copper traces and separated by a plastic isolator.  Current
junction boxes require as many as 13 separate layers that must each be custom
stamped or molded and assembled. <p>

  "With SJB technology, a microcontroller can be integrated with the junction
box to offer programmable options that can expand the EDS functionality with
minimal additional hardware," said Floyd.  "It also supports expanded
diagnostic capability that will enhance the serviceability of the EDS." <p>

  UT Automotive is a $3.1 billion tier-one supplier of electrical, electronic
and interior trim systems and components to car and light-truck manufacturers.
 Based in Dearborn, Mich., it has 40,000 employees at 90 manufacturing plants
in 17 countries. 
<p>
  UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies
Corp. (NYSE: UTX), which provides a broad range of high-technology products
and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

<h2>UT Automotive Develops Integrated Liftgate Multiplexed Module</h2>

<p>
<strong>DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 21 </strong> -- Teamwork among three units of UT
Automotive, a United Technologies Company, has resulted in a new product that
consolidates parts, cuts cost, reduces weight and puts control of six separate
functions into one component. <p>
 
  The integrated liftgate multiplexed module -- designed for vans, wagons and
sport utility vehicles -- incorporates controls for liftgate lock/unlock,
liftglass release, liftgate wiper, heated backlight, license plate lamps and
the center high-mounted stop lamp.  <p>

  The module uses electronics, multiplexing, a small motor and a special
device called a "Geneva mechanism."  Operation of the six functions previously
required three motors and a series of wires, relays and electronics.  <p>

  "The new integrated multiplexed module is the result of combining research
and technology from three of UT Automotive's product areas -- motors, wiring
systems and electronics," said Masazumi Sone, UT Automotive's director of
technology.  <p>

  "This cross-functional system design and development strategy is being
increasingly utilized at UT Automotive to combine technologies and add value
for our customers."  <p>

  The Geneva mechanism, a key to the module's operation, consists of a central
cam and three shafts that turn using a series of cam followers.  Each shaft
 controls one of three mechanical functions: the liftgate wiper, the
lock/unlock and liftglass release.  The mechanism is driven by a single,
permanent-magnet DC motor.  <p>

  UT Automotive projects significant vehicle manufacturer cost-saving
opportunities with the new mechanism and improved end-user satisfaction.  Some
of the cost-saving advantages, according to Sone, include weight reduction,
reduced customer assembly labor, improved reliability, system integration and
parts consolidation.  <p>

  The systems approach is a key part of the company's long-term new product
development and business strategy.  That strategy is led by UT Automotive's
Technical Council, comprised of company technical leaders, under the direction
of Sone.  <p>
  "Our expertise in electronics, DC motors, wiring systems and interior trim
positions UT Automotive as a strategic partner in developing future systems
for the auto industry," said Norm Bodine, UT Automotive president.  <p>

  UT Automotive is a $3.1 billion tier-one supplier of electrical, electronic
and interior trim systems and components to car and light-truck manufacturers.
 Based in Dearborn, Mich., it has 40,000 employees at 90 manufacturing plants
in 17 countries.  <p>

(313) 593-9672</h5><h2>UT Automotive and Planar Systems Announce Development of Fully
Integrated Flat-Panel Display Systems</h2>

<p>
<strong>DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 21, 1996</strong>-- UT Automotive, a United
Technologies Company, and Planar Systems, Inc. have jointly developed a
prototype electroluminescent display (ELD) for automotive applications.  The
announcement was made today at the Convergence '96 Automotive Technology
Exposition. </p>

  The UT Automotive/Planar flat-panel display, which is intended to replace
conventional instrument clusters, can provide all pertinent driver control
information, such as vehicle speed, engine RPM, fuel level and other
information in one convenient location.  The display can also be used as a
stand-alone information center for specific features such as a navigation
system. </p>

  "We partnered with Planar to develop these products for the automotive
market because of the unique attributes of their electroluminescent technology
for this difficult environment," said UT Automotive President and CEO Norm
Bodine.  "In Planar, we have a partner that has a proven capability of moving
core display technologies into high-quality products." </p>
  ELDs offer automakers several advantages, including wide viewing angle,
operation over broad temperature ranges, low electromagnetic interference and
high reliability.  And ELDs do not require a supplementary light source.</p>
Current liquid-crystal displays have been criticized for their limited
operational temperature range, low contrast, need for external light source
and flickering. </p>

  A key advantage of the UT Automotive/Planar flat panel display is the
potential for enhanced driver safety and convenience, and improved
accessibility to other features and information.</p> 
  "One important aspect of our ELD flat-panel display is its quick response
time, regardless of ambient temperature," said Masazumi Sone, UT Automotive's
director of technology.  "Consequently, our unit does not require additional
components, such as heaters, to support display startup in cold weather
conditions." </p>

  According to Sone, this application will revolutionize the concept of
man-machine interface and demonstrate the system's integration of UT
Automotive's interior trim, electrical distribution system, electronics and
other products. </p>

  "Planar is pleased to be teamed with UT Automotive in this effort," said Jim
Hurd, Planar's President and CEO.  "UT Automotive brings a great deal of
experience in dealing with the automakers and has been tremendously helpful in
navigating this partnership as we engage in this new and exciting market
opportunity." </p>

  UT Automotive is a $3.1 billion tier-one supplier of electrical, electronic
and interior trim systems and components to car and light-truck manufacturers.
 Based in Dearborn, Mich., it has 40,000 employees at 90 manufacturing plants
in 17 countries. </p>

  UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United
Technologies Corp.</a> (NYSE: UTX), which provides a broad range of high-technology products
and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries. </p>

<h2>
UT Automotive to close facility in Niles, Michigan</h2><P>	<STRONG>NILES, Mich., Sept. 20, 1996 </STRONG>- UT Automotive today informed employees of the company's intention to consolidate its Steering Wheels operations in Grabill, Ind., and to discontinue operations at its plant in Niles, Mich. <P>The closing of the Niles facility, which will be completed in the first quarter of 1997, will affect approximately 290 employees.The closing is part of ongoing cost and productivity improvement activities throughout the company. The company made the announcement today to provide as much advance notice as possible to its employees.<P>We regret these changes will result in a downsizing of our work force, and in the closing of our Niles facility,said John Lahiff, vice president of UT Automotive's Steering Wheels business unit. "But unfortunately, we are faced with excess manufacturing capacity. In order to survive in our highly competitive business, these very difficult decisions had to be made.<P>The manufacture of steering wheels at Niles will be consolidated at the UT Automotive facility in Grabill over the next several months. During that time the company will determine the size of the work force needed in Grabill.<P>In an effort to support its work force in Niles, UT Automotive is developing plans to offer some special services to employees affected by the change. Employees will be informed of such services as they become available.<P>UT Automotive, with headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.<P>UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.<!--footer begins here-->

          Automotive Thomas C. Wolanzyk (<I>Business Day</I>, Thailand, 1996)</h6>

<P>	<STRONG>DEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 21, 1996 </strong>- To support its strategic expansion into the Asian automotive components market, UT Automotive today announced it has signed an agreement with Siam Motors Company (SMC) to form Siam UT Automotive Co., Ltd.  The joint venture company will manufacture electromechanical and electronic components for the Thai domestic market and for UT Automotive's global customers.
<P>	"SMC and UT Automotive established this joint venture in Thailand to support the rapid growth of the automotive industry in the region, and especially Thailand," said Thomas C. Wolanzyk, vice president and general manager of UT Automotive's Input Controls business unit. "Currently, Thailand and much of the ASEAN automotive market depend on electromechanical and electronic components imported primarily from Japan."
<P>	The new joint venture, to be located near Bangkok, will manufacture heater fan switches, relays, multifunction switches, door lock switches, remote entry systems and door lock control modules.  UT Automotive is the majority partner in the venture.</P>
<P>	"Entering Thailand demonstrates our commitment to and support of our customers in the Asian region," said Norman R. Bodine, president and chief executive officer of UT Automotive. "We view Thailand as an excellent manufacturing location, offering opportunities to establish UT Automotive as a key supplier to other southeast Asian markets.  It also will allow UT Automotive to participate more quickly and with lower investment to support our automotive customers."</P>
<P>	Lower shipping costs, other economic incentives offered by the government of Thailand and strong partners like SMC will help UT Automotive realize many opportunities to pursue additional business in the future, he added. </P>
<P>	SMC, founded in 1952, is one of the major conglomerates in Thailand.  It has grown significantly, due to a strong demand for motor vehicles in the country.  Its 26 joint ventures include automotive engines, spark plugs, batteries, automotive air conditioners and elevators.  It manufactures Nissan motor vehicles through a joint venture, Siam Nissan Automotive Co., Ltd., with Nissan Motors of Japan.</P>
	<p>UT Automotive, based in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America, Europe, and an increasing number in Asia.	</P>
	<p>UT Automotive is a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies Corp.</a> of Hartford, Conn. (NYSE: UTX), which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

<h2>UT Automotive Enters Argentina</h2>

<P>	<STRONG>DEARBORN, Mich., July 17, 1996 </strong>-  UT Automotive recently closed an agreement to acquire an Argentine supplier of automotive wire harnesses, Talleres Electricos San Isidro (TESI), beginning the company's expansion process into South America. 
	Conversion of the plant, located in Buenos Aires, into a UT Automotive facility is under way and is expected to be completed by the first of  the year. 
	<p>"South America is one of the fastest growing markets in the world," said Ed Buker, UT Automotive's vice president of wiring systems. "In order to successfully continue our global expansion process, UT Automotive had to become part of that viable market."
	<p>UT Automotive acquired the existing 48,000-square feet plant because of  TESI's strong management team and their understanding of the government and the marketplace.  The company plans to keep the current management and 130 line workers in place.
	"The existing asset of the work force was a prime reason for acquiring the facility," Buker said. 
	<p>UT Automotive's Argentine expansions will meet the needs of key customers who presently have automotive assembly facilities in South America. Every major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is present or in the process of establishing itself in the flourishing country. 	
	"OEMs are focusing on these opportunities - and we must do the same. We must follow our customers to these new markets," said UT Automotive President Norm Bodine. 
	<p>UT Automotive, which has operations in Europe, Asia and North America,  is continuing to expand in locations around the globe.  
	"This move firmly establishes UT Automotive as a global player ready and able to move into emerging markets in the world," said James Garcia, director of South American operations. 
	"We hope to be able to serve 25 percent of the total market in the region," Buker said.
	<p>UT Automotive expects its expansion will continue throughout South America. 
	 "Once we are established, we will pursue other expansion possibilities in the region," Buker said. 
	UT Automotive, based in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America, Europe, and an increasing number in Asia.	
	<p>UT Automotive is a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies Corp.</a> of Hartford, Conn. (NYSE: UTX), which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

<h2>UT Automotive 'Steers' Automakers Toward Consumer Preferences</h2>
<IMG SRC="../images/steer.gif" ALT="steering wheel" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="252">
	<P></P>
<P>	<STRONG>DEARBORN, Mich. July 15, 1996 </STRONG>- When it comes to pleasing its automaker customers, UT Automotive's Steering Wheels group is taking a turn in the right direction. 
	The group has accepted UT Automotive's role as an OEM supplier whole heartly by assuming some of the automakers' consumer research burden.   <p>Engineers from the group have created a traveling display of steering wheels and developed a comprehensive survey to learn more about consumers' opinions of  steering wheel features.
	"Our main goal is to say to our customers, 'We've studied car buyers and - when it comes to steering wheels - we know what automotive consumers want," said Steering Wheels Engineer Kevin Nehilla, who created and administers the survey.
	<p>In June, Nehilla took the display containing a variety of Ford, Chrysler and other steering wheels to Fairlane Ford, an auto dealership in Dearborn, Mich., to survey consumers on their preferences.
	Those surveyed were asked for their preferences on wheel features such as rim thickness, leather wrapping, speed control design and placement, horn switch design and actuation and overall appearance.  Customers were encouraged to take a "hands-on" approach -- to touch and examine the different wheels to determine their favorite features.
		"Most people had a definite opinion on what they liked and what they did not," Nehilla said. "Surprisingly, one man we surveyed said he just hated leather wrapped steering wheels."<p>
		The survey conducted at Fairlane Ford is the first of many to be administered throughout the metro area, he said.  Plans are to conduct additional polls at shopping malls, car washes and other dealerships.
		"The ultimate goal is to design steering wheels with the features customers prefer," Nehilla said.  "Accumulating this information shows automotive consumers their opinions matter and makes automakers aware that we are willing to take on a larger role as a supplier."
		<p>In early 1996, UT Automotive became the world's first steering wheel supplier to receive Ford Motor Company's Full Service Supplier designation.  In attaining this status, UT Automotive underwent a rigorous, nine-month evaluation during 1994 and 1995, to prove it could meet Ford's high standards.
		UT Automotive is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe, and an increasing number in Asia.

<H2>UT Automotive to consolidate operations at Holland, Mich., facility
</H2><P><STRONG>HOLLAND, Mich., June 27, 1996</STRONG> - UT Automotive 
 today informed employees of the company's intention to continue operation of its Holland, Mich.,
  facility.</P>
<P>The company last December told employees it planned to discontinue operations in Holland by the 
third quarter of 1997. Mike Ryan, director of manufacturing for UT Automotive's Interior Systems operations, 
said the company's strategy changed because of the cost of moving some of the operations out of 
Holland, and because of improved performance and strong technical resources at the Holland facility.
</p><p>"This decision is part of ongoing cost and productivity improvement activities throughout the 
company," Ryan said. "We decided it would be best to continue operations in Holland after closely
 examining all of the issues, including the improved performance of our Holland facility."</P>
<P>UT Automotive plans to consolidate production of its acoustical products, moving some operations to Holland 
from UT Automotive facilities in Indiana and Georgia. In addition, production of some headliners may move 
from Holland to a UT Automotive facility in Port Huron, Mich.</P>
<P>UT Automotive, with headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim 
systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are part of nearly 
every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe.

<H2>UT Automotive, West Virginia University 'Charged Up' for the Cleveland Grand Prix's Formula E Race
</H2>
<IMG SRC="../images/wvirginia.gif" ALT="electric car" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="313" HEIGHT="214">
<HR><EM>UT Automotive is charging ahead to provide automakers with innovative but cost efficient products for their 
electric vehicle.  And what better venue to test new products than on the road - in race cars. 
 UT Automotive is one of the sponsors of the race car developed and built by students at West Virginia 
 University's college of engineering and Mineral Resources.  Dave Berels, content leader, 
 UT Automotive's global electric vehicle programs, takes a seat in the Formula E race car, which will
  make its debut at the Cleveland Grand Prix next month.  </EM>
<HR>
	<STRONG>DEARBORN, Mich., June 27, 1996</STRONG> -   UT Automotive (UT Automotive) and 
	<A HREF="http://www.wvu.edu/" NAME="West Virginia University">West Virginia University</A> are teaming up to create a successful Formula E (electric) car for the Cleveland
	 Grand Prix. UT Automotive has donated $10,000 to West Virginia University to help sponsor an electric car that 
was designed and built by over 20 students and three faculty members.	</P>
<P>	The school's car, named Formula Lightening, is a high-performance race vehicle that is scheduled 
to compete in five races this year.  The car, which is driven by a professional driver, is capable of
 traveling up to 140 m.p.h. West Virginia University's electric car will compete against 12 American universities in 
the Cleveland Grand Prix's Formula E car race at the Burke Lakefront Airport June 28-30.
</P>	
<P>	The Formula E racing series was created to encourage the development and increase public
 awareness of electric vehicles. Students who participate in the races gain valuable, hands-on,
  educational experience while advancing the technology of electric vehicles. 
	"It is widely understood in the automotive industry that racing provides one of the best test 
	beds for product development," said Ted Bott, manager of UT Automotive's global electric vehicle programs. 
	"The demands of racing have helped to produce some of the lightest, most efficient, 
	highest-performing systems found on today's passenger cars and trucks."</P>
<P>	"UT Automotive plans to continue the partnership with West Virginia University next year," Dave Berels, content leader, UT Automotive global electric vehicle programs said.  "We will be working with 
the students to 
incorporate our electrical distribution system components in their race 
car this fall." West Virginia University's car will be on display at UT Automotive's Dearborn headquarters July 
8-15 for both visitors and employees to get an up-close look at the electric car. 
<P>	UT Automotive is a major supplier of electric, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car
 and light truck manufacturers.  Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in

<H2>Ford Names UT Automotive World's First Full Service Supplier for Steering Wheels</H2>

<P>	<STRONG>DEARBORN, Mich., June 24, 1996</STRONG> - UT Automotive (UT Automotive) is the world's first steering wheel supplier to receive Ford Motor Company's Full Service Supplier (FSS) designation.
<P>	In attaining full-service supplier status, UT Automotive underwent a rigorous, nine-month evaluation process in 1994 and 1995 that required it to meet Ford's high standards in areas such as product design, development, product testing, manufacturing engineering, manufacturing support, service support and CAD/CAE data capability.</P>
<P>  	A steering wheel system includes a die-cast or steel-stamped armature molded in eurethane or PVC (sometimes leather wrapped); air bag cover, horn, speed control and other switches; and electrical slip rings.</P></P>
<P>	"This designation as a Ford Full Service Supplier recognizes the years of dedication that our team has invested in setting and meeting customer satisfaction and quality goals," said John Lahiff, vice president and general manager of UT Automotive's steering wheel group.  "We're as proud of this high accomplishment as we are of the world-class-quality steering wheel systems we provide daily to Ford."</P>


<P>	Attaining FSS status was no easy task, according to Leo Hagan, program manager for UT Automotive's Ford steering wheel business.  The effort involved hundreds of UT Automotive associates across our Steering Wheels organization.  
	"We fundamentally reinvented our business," Hagan said.  "Our associates had to change the way they think, from a supplier's frame of mind to a customer's.  An associate in charge of a certain responsibility now had to act as 'Mr. Ford' would."</P>
<P>	Hagan said a recent restructuring of the Steering Wheels organization in which associates and departments are now aligned along customer lines enables associates to act as the customer's advocate.  Customer teams now set targets in areas that matter most in developing, defining and validating the product, he added.
<P>	UT Automotive provides a variety of steering wheels and steering wheel systems for Ford vehicles worldwide.  These include the new 1997 F-Series pickup trucks, Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, Thunderbird, Cougar, Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans and a variety of Ford medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks.</P></P>
<P>	UT Automotive is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe and an increasing number in Asia.
UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based

<H2>UT Automotive reduces work force at Newton, Ill., facility

</H2><P><STRONG>NEWTON, Ill., June 20, 1996 </strong>- UT Automotive earlier 
this week informed employees of the company's intention to reduce its work force by about 150 
employees in Newton, Ill. </p>
<P>UT Automotive's Newton plant, located on Marshall Drive, manufactures wiring harnesses for cars, trucks and
 sport utility vehicles. Production at the facility is being reduced because the company is 
 consolidating production of one of its lines of wire harnesses at a UT Automotive facility in Mexico. </P>
<P>This consolidation is part of ongoing cost and productivity improvement activities throughout 
the company. The work-force reduction in Newton was based on the need to realign the facility's 
work force to meet its production requirements, said Greg Clark, plant manager.</P>
<P>The layoffs will occur in two phases; the first will take place in early August and the second 
about a month later. Approximately one-third of plant's current work force will be affected. </P>
<P>UT Automotive, with headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim 
systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are part of nearly every 
passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe.
UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies Corp.</a>,
 which provides a broad 
range of high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive
 industries.

<h2>Honda of America Mfg. Presents UT Automotive With Quality Performance Award</h2>		
<P></P>
<P>	<STRONG>DEARBORN, MICH., June 17, 1996</STRONG> - The associates of UT Automotive's (UT Automotive) electronics plant in Tampa received a supplier award for outstanding achievement in Quality Performance from officials of <A HREF="http://www.honda.com/" NAME="Honda">Honda America Mfg.</A> (HAM) today. 	
<P>	UT Automotive was one of 13 of HAM's 353 North American suppliers to receive the Quality Performance Award at the company's 14th-annual Supplier Conference in April. UT Automotive's Tampa plant manufactures numerous components for the Honda Civic, Accord, and the Odyssey mini-van. UT Automotive began supplying parts to HAM in Oct. 1991.		</P>
	"The quality level, competitiveness and development capability of suppliers is an essential part of Honda's growth in North America," said Dave Nelson, senior vice president of HAM Purchasing and Corporate Affairs. "That's why we honor companies like UT Automotive. Their commitment and quality focus is absolutely critical to our future success together. As we 
develop and manufacture new products for new markets, we plan for our suppliers to play an ever-increasing role in their development."</p>
<P>	The Quality Performance award places UT Automotive in the top 8 percent of its commodity type for all Honda suppliers, said Chris Saleski, senior sales engineer for UT Automotive. "This is the most coveted award a supplier can win from Honda."
<P>	"We have an unprecedented number of active development programs for exclusive new North American vehicles and powertrains," added Nelson.  "It's a very full plate - one rich in opportunities for suppliers to provide new parts and increase their production volume with Honda in North America.</P></P>
<P>	Honda also emphasized its plans to increase exports of finished vehicles, as well as parts and components for other Honda manufacturing facilities in the Americas.  Exports of U.S.-built cars will increase by 50 percent to 150,000 in 1999.  HAM and its suppliers also will begin shipping their engines and other parts to the Honda do Brazil auto plant in Brazil for production of civics in 1997. "We must continue to think globally and act locally," said Nelson.
<P>	To qualify for the Quality Performance Award, a supplier must be in the top 15 percent of their commodity type, as measured by quality rejects in parts per million (PPM) and meet the Delivery average.</p>
	UT Automotive is a major supplier of electrical, electronic, and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North 
America, Europe, and an increasing number in Asia.</P>

<H2>UT Automotive and Lawrence Tech Are Racing Ahead Together</H2>

<P>	<STRONG>Dearborn, Mich. June 14, 1996</STRONG> -  UT Automotive and Lawrence Technological University in Southfield Mich. have teamed up in developing a hybrid electric vehicle that Lawrence Tech will enter in the Future Car Challenge, sponsored by the United States Council for Automotive Research and the U.S. Department of Energy.</P>
<P>	UT Automotive contributed $15,000 and 200 hours of engineering to Lawrence Tech for preparation of its hybrid electrical vehicle for the competition on June 17-24 at the Ford Motor Co. proving grounds in Dearborn, Mich.
<P>	"Lawrence Tech has earned great respect in auto engineering, so it made perfect sense to collaborate with this group on its hybrid electric vehicle," Ted Bott, manager UT Automotive global electrical vehicle programs said.</P>

<P>	Lawrence Tech's team of 60 students has converted a conventional Ford Taurus into a hybrid electric vehicle.  The hybrid electric car combines an electric motor with a combustion engine.
<P>	UT Automotive will supply some of the components to make the car perform successfully.  A high voltage electrical distribution system, connectors, 
and prismatic mirrors made by UT Automotive will all be part of the car.
	"By participating in electric vehicle racing, we have the advantage over our traditional competition in experiencing what works and what doesn't work in more than a lab environment," Bott said.
<P>	Last year, the Lawrence Tech team won the "Greatest Range," award and finished fifth overall at the Hybrid Challenge against 11 other colleges. </P>
<P>	In addition, the 1995 Lawrence Tech hybrid vehicle was featured at the White House during an energy efficient vehicles presentation. "These students are the brightest and most motivated budding automotive electrical engineers in the United States," Bott said.</P></P>

    <h2>United Technologies Automotive Reduces Workforce by 80 at Newton,
    Ill, Plant</h2>

    <strong>NEWTON, Ill., Jan. 8, 1996</strong> - United Technologies 
    Automotive's Newton manufacturing plant reduced its workforce of 558 by 80
    employees today. The reductions, which were communicated to the plant's 
    workforce last week, will affect production and production support 
    positions, largely in the plant's rotary (assembly) and indirect labor 
    areas.
    <p>
    The workforce reduction was based upon a need to realign the plant¹s 
    workforce to efficiently meet its production/plant load requirements, said
    Greg Clark, plant manager. The reduction mostly will affect employees with
    the shortest terms of service.
    <p>
    UTA¹s Newton plant, located on Marshall Drive, manufactures wiring 
    harnesses for trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars.
    <p>
    UTA, headquartered in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical,
    electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck
    manufacturers worldwide. UTA is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based

    <h2>
      United Technologies Automotive to Reduce Plymouth, Ind., Operations
    </h2>

    <stron>DEARBORN, Mich., January 19, 1996</strong> - United Technologies
    Automotive (UTA) today informed employees at its operations in Plymouth,
    Ind., of the company's intention to significantly reduce and consolidate
    manufacturing operations by mid-May 1996. The S. Liberty wire harness
    assembly plant will be phased down during this period and consolidated into
    UTA's Plymouth Industrial Park warehouse facility, affecting 190 employees.
    <p>
    The Plymouth plant was originally scheduled to close in late 1991; however,
    it remained open because of an unexpected increase in business at that time.
    The decision to close the plant now is based on a softening automotive
    market due to lower than anticipated auto sales, combined with the age and
    condition of the plant, said Art Nelson, UTA's director of North American
    wire assembly operations.
    <p>
    "We regret the need to reduce operations in Plymouth," Nelson said.
    "However, we're currently faced with excess manufacturing capacity and
    rising maintenance costs for the 104-year-old facility. In an ever-changing
    and challenging automotive supply market, these measures are necessary to
    continue to be competitive."
    <p>
    The manufacture of wire harnesses for Ford Motor Co. at Plymouth will be
    transferred to UTA facilities in Newton, Ill., and Chihuahua, Mexico.
    Warehousing and distribution operations will remain in the Industrial Park,
    along with a limited amount of wire harness production for the North
    American automotive market. "The high quality of work at Plymouth is a
    credit to all of the plant's employees," Nelson said. "It's only through
    their hard work that we were able to open a warehouse facility in mid-1994
    and can now retain 130 jobs in Plymouth. We'll continue to look for other
    work that fits into Plymouth's competitive position and place it there."
    <p>
    The 190 affected employees will be from all levels of the hourly and
    salaried work force. "This is not an easy action to take and the company
    will do all it can to help find employment for the displaced employees,"
    Nelson added.
    <p>
    UTA, headquartered in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical
    and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck
    manufacturers worldwide.
    <p>
    It is a unit of <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies Corp.,</a>
    based in Hartford, Conn., which provides a broad range of high-technology
    products and support services to the aerospace, building systems and
    automotive industries.

    <h2>
      United Technologies Automotive, Ford Develop Innovative New Steering
      Wheel
    </h2>

    <strong>DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 22, 1996</strong> - A new, state-of-the-art
    steering wheel, that utilizes advanced materials technology to minimize
    cost, reduce weight, and improve steering performance, has been developed by
    United Technologies Automotive (UTA) and Ford Motor Company. 
    <p>
    The new wheel, which was developed for the new F-Series pick-up, Bronco
    truck and Econoline van, provides significant cost savings for both Ford
    and UTA and is half the weight of the wheel it will replace. 
    <p>
    The new wheel is manufactured by UTA from soft feel urethane over a
    magnesium base, which makes it lighter and helps it meet steering column
    objectives, while allowing the support structure to be minimized. 
    <p>
    "I believe this wheel will become popular because of its light weight, cost
    effectiveness, and the way it performs by minimizing steering column
    vibrations," said John Lahiff, UTA's vice president and general manager,
    steering wheels. "Our customer also tells us the new wheel also rates
    extremely well in terms of overall steering wheel performance. 
    <p>
    "The wheel not only met all performance requirements, but its aesthetics
    also were well received."
    <p>
    UTA also developed the airbag cover to match the wheel, allowing for easier
    assembly at the plant.
    <p>
    The new wheel was recognized recently through Ford's annual internal
    Truck Achievement Award. The award was in recognition for the wheel's light
    weight, cost effectiveness, and technological innovation.
    <p>
    "The genuine partnership, as displayed by UTA lead engineer Scott Dershem
    and the Ford styling group, made this program a success," said Leo R. Hagan,
    UTA's sales manager, steering wheels. "The combination of UTA's program
    management, design capabilities and manufacturing leadership has served as
    an example for all future steering wheel programs."
    <p>
    UTA is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems
    and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are part
    of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe, and a
    growing number in Asia.
    <p>
    UTA is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based
    <a href="http://www.utc.com/"> United Technologies Corp.</a> (NYSE:UTX),
    which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the

    unique attributes of the technology for this difficult environment," said
    Norm Bodine, president and CEO of United Technologies Automotive. "Wide
    viewing angle, the ability to operate in a wide range of temperature and
    light environments and the inherent ruggedness of Planar's thin film EL
    technology make it ideally suited for these applications. In Planar, we
    have selected a partner that has a proven capability of moving core display
    technologies into high quality products," he said.
    <p>
    "We are very pleased to be a part of the UTA team," said Jim Hurd, president
    and CEO of Planar." UTA has a well established track record of supplying
    electronic subsystems to automobile manufacturers worldwide, and there is a
    very large additional potential for systems with displays in passenger cars.
    We are convinced that these systems will need the kind of high performance
    visual and environmental display attributes that are inherent in Planar EL
    display technology."
    <p>

      United Technologies Automotive Reduces Workforce by 95 at Newton,
      Ill., Plant
    </h2>

    <strong>NEWTON, Ill., Jan 26, 1996</strong> - United Technologies
    Automotive's Newton manufacturing plant reduced its workforce today by 95
    employees. The reductions, which were communicated to the plant's in-house
    union committee Wednesday, are the result of a reduction in production
    releases from the plant's major automotive customer. "It's unfortunate that
    we had to lay off these associates at this time," said Bob Smith,
    manufacturing manager for UTA's Newton plant. "We're in the process of
    setting up new lines for some incoming wiring harness business and hope to
    be able to call back most of them over the next few months."
    <p>
    UTA's Newton plant, located on Marshall Drive, manufactures wiring harnesses
    for trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars. 
    <p>
    UTA, headquartered in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical,
    electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light truck
    manufacturers worldwide. UTA is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based
   <a href="http://www.utc.com/"> United Technologies Corporation</a>

    <h2>United Technologies Automotive Develops Rear Integrated Liftgate Node For
Vans and Sport Utility Vehicles</h2>

    <strong>Dearborn, Mich., Nov. 14, 1995</strong> - A revolutionary, 
    state-of-the-art, rear integrated liftgate node for vans and sport-utility 
    vehicles, which cuts cost, consolidates components and reduces weight, has 
    been developed by United Technologies Automotive.
    <p>
    The multiplexed liftgate node incorporates six separate functions, including 
    liftgate lock/unlock, liftglass release, liftgate wiper, heated backlight, 
    license plate lamps and center high-mounted stop lamp, all into a single 
    unit. By using sophisticated electronics, multiplexing technology, a single 
    DC motor and a special device called a "Geneva mechanism," the node is able 
    to perform functions that previously had required three separate motors and a
    series of wires, relays and electronics. 
    <p>
    The Geneva mechanism, the key to the node¹s integration, consists of a 
    central cam and three shafts that turn using a series of cam followers. The 
    unit is powered by a single, permanent-magnet motor. Each section of the 
    mechanism is responsible for one of the three moving functions: liftgate 
    wiper, liftgate lock/unlock and liftglass release.
    <p>
    "The Geneva mechanism is an integration of research and technology from three
    of UTA's product areas - Motor Systems, Wiring Systems and Input Controls," 
    said Masazumi Sone, UTA's director of technology. "This cross-divisional 
    system development is a strategy being increasingly utilized at UTA to 
    integrate technologies and add value for our customers." 
    <p>
    UTA projects significant cost-saving opportunities with the new mechanism and
    improved customer satisfaction. Some of the cost-saving advantages, according
    to Sone, will include weight reduction, reduced customer assembly labor, 
    improved reliability, system integration, robust design and part number 
    reduction. 
    <p>
    UTA President <a href="/people/norm.html">Norm Bodine</a> believes that the 
    rear integrated node is an example of the technology and system-integration 
    capabilities automakers expect from their tier-one, full-service suppliers.
    <p>
    "Our experience in electronics, DC motors, interior trim and wiring systems 
    positions UTA as a strategic partner in developing future systems for the 
    auto industry," Bodine said. "I believe this and similar projects will result
    in new business opportunities for UTA with customers worldwide."
    <p>

<h2>UT Automotive Reduces Work Force by 52 at Peru Plant</h2>

<p>
<strong>Peru, Ind., Aug. 9, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive (UT Automotive) is
reducing its work force by 52 salaried and hourly associates at its Wiring
Systems facility in Peru.

<p>
Plant Manager Greg Comoglio said the reductions affect 12 salaried and
40 hourly associates and are the result of decreased production volumes
at the plant. The plant had reduced its work force by 60 associates in
June.

<p>
The Peru facility still employs more than 300 associates. 
The plant manufactures terminals, conductors and connectors. Its
primary customers are two North American automakers.

<p>
The 150,000-square-foot facility is one of the oldest manufacturers of
plastic products in the United States. It opened in 1941 as Bryan
Manufacturing, producing wire harnesses for World War II aircraft. It was
acquired by Essex in the late 1940's, switched production to plastic
components in the early 1950's and was acquired by <a href="http://www.utc.com/">
United Technologies Corp.</a> in 1974. It became part of UT Automotive in 1979.

<p>
UT Automotive, headquartered in Dearborn, Mich., is a major supplier of electrical,
electronic and interior trim systems and components to car and light
truck manufacturers worldwide.

<h2>United Technologies Automotive's Tampa Electronics
Facility Had Hand in Redesign Of Popular Ford Taurus/Sable.</h2>

<p>
<strong>TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 14, 1995</strong> - The all new 1996 Ford Taurus and 
Mercury Sable models started rolling off assembly lines June 19 in 
Atlanta, packed with sophisticated features and state-of-the-art 
technology.

<p>
United Technologies Automotive's Tampa facility had a hand in
the completely redesigned models by supplying a sophisticated generic 
electronic module (GEM).

<p>
UTA's GEM is a revolutionary electronic module that is
responsible for a remarkable 14 separate electrical activities. One of the GEM's 
features includes Battery Saver, which protects the car from
inadvertent battery drain by turning off accessories and interior lamps after 40 
minutes of inactivity. Another feature, Driver Door Lock Disable,
prevents the driver's door from being locked if the key is left in the ignition. 

<p>
"The GEM has been a key project here in Tampa," Dan O'Dell,
plantmanager, said. "We've spent over two years preparing for the GEM
and have installed world-class manufacturing equipment to make it to
the highest quality standards. It is a real honor for the GEM to be such an 
integral part of the '96 Taurus/Sable programs.  I believe this is a
fine example of teamwork between UTA and <a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a>."
 
<p>
Ford will honor associates at UTA's Tampa facility today by 
giving them a preview of the 1996 Taurus and Sable models. The
visit will be part of Ford's Supplier/Ford Plant "Appreciation Tour." 

<p>
This summer's tour began June 16 at two Ford plants in
Michigan and will wrap up Sept. 18, in Boston.     

<p>
"This tour is our chance to say thanks in a personal way to our 
suppliers, who have the same pride in producing quality products as
our employees all over the globe." Richard Landgraff, Taurus and Sable 
Vehicle Line Director, Ford Motor Company, said . "They are big 
contributors to Taurus being the top-selling car three years
running."
                
<p>
A large percentage of components in the 1996 models were
designed and manufactured by UTA. 

<p>
UTA was responsible for the complete electrical distribution
system, the power network box and 80 percent of the wire harnesses. UTA
also will supply components that include the keyless entry switch,
multifunction turn signal and ignition switch. 

<p>
In addition, UTA will provide exterior mirrors, the rear sail patch 
and steering wheels. UTA also is supplying four windowlift motors
per car. The Taurus/ Sable models will contain more UTA components
than any previous vehicle.

<p>
UTA is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim
systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers. Its products are
part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe.

<p>
UTA is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United
Technologies Corp.</a>, which provides a broad range of high-technology products and 
services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive
industries.

<h2>UT Automotive Names Edwin L. Buker to Head Wiring Systems</h2>

<p>
DEARBORN, Aug. 28, 1995 - Edwin L. Buker, a former
manufacturing executive with BMW and Honda of America, has joined
UT Automotive (UT Automotive) as vice president and general
manager of UT Automotive's wiring systems business.

<p>
Buker's appointment  was announced today by UT Automotive President
<a href="/../general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</a>.   

<p>
"We are very fortunate to have Ed join us. He is an experienced
industry leader," Bodine said, "and the manufacturing knowledge he
brings with him from the OEM-level will help UT Automotive to become more
keenly focused on serving our customers' needs."

<p>
Buker has been associated with BMW for three years, most
recently as vice president-Munich Office for BMW Manufacturing
Corp. in  Germany.  Before that he was vice president-Manufacturing
at BMW's U. S. vehicle plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, during its startup.

<p>
Prior to joining BMW in 1992, Buker worked eight years in
various executive-level positions with Honda of America
Manufacturing, Inc.  He joined Honda in 1984 as manager of its
motorcycle plant, and in 1985 was appointed manager of Honda's
auto assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio.  He subsequently held the
positions of vice president and plant manager for the East Liberty
assembly plant, and vice president-Auto Quality.

<p>
Buker received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
in 1976 from Tri-State University, Angola, Indiana, and his master
of business administration degree from <a href="http://www.ohiou.edu">
Ohio University</a> in Athens.
<p>
Buker succeeds Richard L. Barrett, who has been appointed vice
president, Worldwide Manufacturing and Technical Integration.  In
this new position, Barrett will direct and coordinate the global
integration of advanced manufacturing processes and new
technological capabilities.

<p>
"Barrett's experience and knowledge of North America, Europe,
Latin America and the Pacific Rim make him ideally suited to lead
UT Automotive's global manufacturing planning effort, so necessary in serving
our customers' global needs," Bodine said.	  

<p>
UT Automotive is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim
systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its
products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North
America and Europe.

<h2>UT Automotive Named Remote Entry Supplier 
for Acura TL Luxury Sedan</h2>

<p>
<strong>DEARBORN, Mich., July 12, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive has been named by Honda as
supplier for remote entry systems for Acura's TL luxury sedan, announced
<a href="/general/people/wol.htm">Thomas C.  Wolanzyk</a>, vice president and general
manager, Input Controls for UT Automotive.

<p>
The remote entry systems, manufactured by UT Automotive in Tampa, Fla., are
supplied to Honda's Acura manufacturing plant in Sayama, Japan.  The TL
currently is sold both in Japan and in North America.

<p>
"We've shown that we can compete with Japanese suppliers - even
in electronics - in supplying feature-rich, quality components at
competitive prices to Japanese assembly plants," said Wolanzyk.  "Our
full-service, global approach to component supply has helped establish
UT Automotive as an important supplier to Honda." 

<p>
The TL's UT Automotive-developed remote entry system, comprising an
electronic receiver module and two remote transmitters (key fobs),
permits keyless entry by unlocking the vehicle's doors with a single press
of a key fob button.  For security, the driver can lock all doors with a
single touch of a second button.

<p>
UT Automotive's relationship with Honda began in 1987, when the company
began manufacturing switches and relays for the Honda Accord.  Soon, UT Automotive
began supplying components for Honda's popular Civic model.  Currently,
UT Automotive also supplies remote entry systems, electrical distribution systems
and other components to Honda for other car lines that are manufactured
in Japan for the Japanese domestic and export markets.  UT Automotive began
working with Acura on development of the TL remote entry system in
1993.

<p>
UT Automotive is a full-service supplier of electrical, electronic and interior
trim systems and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its
products are part of nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America
and Europe.  

<p>
UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">
United Technologies Corp.</a>  (NYSE:UTX), which provides a broad range of
high-technology products and services to the aerospace, building systems
and automotive industries.

<h2>UT Automotive Expands Interior Trim Plant</h2>

<P>
<strong>BERNE, Ind., July 18, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive (UT Automotive) has expanded
its interior trim facility in Berne, Ind., by 65,000 square feet. The expansion was 
made to accommodate UT Automotive's growing business in injection molded, painted and 
assembled exterior automotive mirrors and grilles. 

<P>
The new building will house mirror assembly, incoming material, and 
finished goods. 
       
<p>
"This expansion provides tremendous opportunities for cost 
savings," said Mike Talaga, Berne's plant manager. "We've consolidated
four warehouses that were spread over a 40-mile radius down to two buildings 
operating side by side. This has simplified our inventory management and 
reduced transportation cost."

<p>
UT Automotive obtained the Berne plant from Sheller-Globe in 1989.
With its product line constantly increasing, the existing facility became too 
small to meet the volume demands of its customers.

<p>
"Our mirror business has experienced phenomenal growth over the last
18 months," said Leon Goolsby, UT Automotive's vice president and general manager,
mirrors. "We anticipate further growth in the near future."           
  
<p>
UT Automotive's Berne and Dayton, Tenn., plants currently supply mirrors and
other trim products to <a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a>, General Motors, 
<a href="http://www.chryslercorp.com/">Chrysler</a>, Nissan, Toyota, NUMMI, 
Diamond Star and Saturn.

components to car and light truck manufactures. Its products are part of nearly
every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe.

<h2>UT Automotive, Southern Development to Develop Advanced Flywheel
Storage Battery</h2>

<p>
<strong>Dearborn, Mich., July 25, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive and
Southern Development and Investment Group have agreed to develop and distribute an advanced
electricity storage device. The announcement was made today by <a
href="/general/people/norm.htm">Norman R. Bodine</a>, president, UT Automotive, and Kevin Fletcher,
president, Southern Development.

<P>
The storage device, which is a mechanical "battery," is based on more than four years of flywheel
development by United Technologies for automotive applications. Southern Development will
use the prototype flywheel energy storage system for power quality, uninterruptible power supply
and load management applications.

<P>
The two companies hope that flywheel devices eventually will provide customers with
uninterruptible power for sensitive electronic equipment, as well as the storage of low-cost
electricity at night for next-day use.

<P>
"With this advanced flywheel system, The Southern Company will be able to offer its customers
enhanced service and greater control," Fletcher said.

<P>
"We believe that the synergistic effect of the automotive and commercial/utility programs will
greatly reduce time to market for both," said Bodine. "We also expect that lessons learned in
developing both systems will lead to more economical, lower-cost systems for both markets."

<p>
Southern Development is a subsidiary of The Southern Company (NYSE:SO), which is the parent
firm of five electric utilities: Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power
and
Savannah Electric. Other subsidiaries include Southern Electric International, Southern Nuclear,
Southern Communications and Southern Company Services. The Southern Company's common
stock is one of the 20 most widely held corporate stocks in America.

<P>
UT Automotive is a full-service supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components

<h2>United Technologies Automotive Wins Honda Award</h2>

<p>
<strong>Zanesville, Ohio, June 13, 1995</strong> - Associates at United Technologies
Automotive's Linden Avenue plant in Zanesville really deliver, and as a result, today were
presented with a supplier award for outstanding delivery from Honda of America Manufacturing
(HAM).

<P>
UTA was one of only 38 of HAM's 322 North American suppliers to receive a delivery award at
the company's recent annual supplier conference. To earn the award, the plant had to achieve 100-
percent on-time delivery of all components (none early, none late) and meet the quality average.

<P>
UTA's Linden Avenue facility supplies relays, door-lock switches and fan switches for Honda's
Accord and Civic models, which are manufactured domestically at the automaker's Marysville
and East Liberty, Ohio manufacturing plants.

<P>
"This award to our associates illustrates their absolute commitment to serving our customers in a
very competitive industry," said Jeff Lunsford, plant manager of UTA's Linden Avenue pant. "The
depth of this customer commitment is evidenced in the continued growth of our business with
Honda, a very demanding customer and a recognized leader in building quality vehicles."

<p>
"UTA's commitment to outstanding performance is an important part of increasing our
competitiveness in the global marketplace," said Dave Nelson, vice president of purchasing for
HAM. "Achieving the level of performance reached by UTA and its associates is possible only
when there is management commitment, associate involvement and dedication to continuous
improvement by the total team."

<h2>UT Automotive Signs Licensing, Supply Agreements with Korean
Engineering Company</h2>

<P>
<strong>Dearborn, Mich., June 30, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive has
licensed its new patented mirror actuator technology to Jaeil Engineering, a Korean based
manufacturing company, located in Seoul. The company also signed a supply agreement with Jaeil
for future automotive models.

<P>
With the agreement, Jaeil will use UT Automotive's patented design to manufacture mirror actuators and
will have restricted distribution rights for passenger car and truck mirrors.

<P>
"The key difference in the UT Automotive design, when compared to existing mirror actuators currently
available in the market, is the geometric positioning of the pivot, allowing less vibration," said
Michael D. Faloon, UT Automotive's director of research and development, mirrors. "The new feature will
virtually eliminate all vibration when the vehicle is in motion, enabling the driver to make more
precise mirror adjustment."

<p>
Jaeil's main products include precision tools, automotive parts, radio and telecommunications
products, and precision and insert molding. Jaeil currently supplies both Korean based and foreign
companies, including Samsung, Gold Star, Eaton, Siemens and Daewoo and Packard Electronics.
Jaeil recently purchased Daeseung Mirrors, one of only three mirror companies in Korea, to expand
its business into the automotive field. Daeseung is a supplier to Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia and Ssang
Yong auto companies in Korea.

<P>
"Jaeil is an excellent technology partner for the commercialization of this new design," said Leon
Goolsby, UT Automotive's vice president and general manager, mirrors. "The combination of UT Automotive's world-
class technology, and Jaeil's manufacturing expertise, promise outstanding global growth
potential."

<p>
UT Automotive is a major supplier of electrical and interior trim systems and 
components to car and light truck manufactures. Its products are part of nearly
every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe. 
      
<p>
UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford, Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United
Technologies Corp.</a>,
which provides a broad range of high-technology products and services to the 
aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

<h2>UT Automotive Named Full-Service Supplier 
for Switches by Ford Motor Company Body, Chassis Engineering
Groups</h2>

<p>
<strong>DEARBORN, Mich., April 3, 1995</strong> - UT Automotive 
has been named a full-service supplier for switch products by both the Body
Engineering and Chassis Engineering organizations of <a href="http://www.ford.com">Ford Motor Co.</a>  UT Automotive is the
first switch supplier to simultaneously receive the designation from two Ford
engineering organizations.

<p>
In attaining full-service supplier status with Ford, UT Automotive underwent a rigorous
13-month evaluation process that required it to meet Ford's high standards in
areas such as product design, development, product testing, manufacturing
engineering, manufacturing support, service support and CAD/CAM data
capability.

<p>
"Ford's recognition of UT Automotive as a full-service supplier acknowledges our
world-class concept-to-production capabilities for switch products," said <a href="/../general/people/wol.htm">
Thomas C. Wolanzyk</a>, vice president and general 
manager of UT Automotive's Input Controls business
unit, which manufactures electromechanical switches and electronic components
for light vehicles.  "We look to automakers such as Ford, who recognize our full-
service capabilities, to increasingly utilize them as competition in the global
automotive marketplace becomes more fierce."

<p>
Ford's full-service supplier certification is built on the requirements of the
automakers's Total Quality Excellence program.  Its goal is to increase product
quality and customer satisfaction, improve engineering and manufacturing cost
efficiencies, minimize engineering changes, shorten product development time and
increase advanced technology development.

<p>
"A key outcome of our full-service supplier status is that UT Automotive's product
development cycle for switches now is synchronized to Ford's program model,"
said William Floyd, engineering manager for electromechanical switches for UT Automotive,
who managed a cross-functional team appointed to oversee the certification
process.  "That model is driving how Ford develops its products into the future, so
this recognition will help us compete for future development opportunities."

<p>
UT Automotive manufactures a broad range of electromechanical switches and
electronic modules for the automotive industry.  These include multifunction turn
signal switches, ignition switches, keyless entry switches, brake shift interlock
solenoids, headlamp switches, relays, transmission connectors, rheostats, transfer
case modules, seat switches, memory modules, wiper modules, keyless entry
modules and other instrument panel switches.

<p>
UT Automotive is a major, full-service supplier of electrical and interior trim systems
and components to car and light truck manufacturers.  Its products are part of
nearly every passenger vehicle built in North America and Europe.

<p>
UT Automotive is a subsidiary of Hartford Conn.-based <a href="http://www.utc.com/">United Technologies Corp.</a>
(NYSE:UTX), which provides a broad range of high-technology products and
services to the aerospace, building systems and automotive industries.

Berg, manager,	 marketing, advanced technology, Interior Systems & Components for UT Automotive.</P><P>"This innovative technology promises a wider range of styling and design freedom, while incorporating all of the functionality found in today's mirrors."</P><P>	"Prismatic mirror technology, with its many advantages over conventional mirrors, is the first	 step in a new generation of vision systems that will increase visibility and enhance the safety 	 of vehicles into the 21st century," said Michael D. Faloon, director, research and development, Mirrors,	  for UTA.</P><P>	The technology's performance advantages over traditional exterior side-view mirrors include:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>		<LI>Improved aerodynamics - In wind tunnel testing, the low profile of the prismatic mirror, 		which protrudes 60 percent less than conventional mirrors, virtually eliminates mirror and 		wind drag. It also eliminates wind noise caused by turbulent air passing by the mirror at 		high speeds.		<LI>Improved side vision - the stabilizing action of mounting the mirror over the door's 		center line reduces vibration, contributing to improved side/rear vision for the driver.		<LI>Ease of use in inclement weather - because the reflective surface of the mirror actually 		is located inside the vehicle, the driver does not look through a dirty side window to see 		images in the mirror.		<LI>"Driver friendly" performance - Has the look, feel, and function of a traditional side 		mirror to the driver.		<LI>Increased safety - Because the mirror does not protrude, it does not present an injury 		hazard to pedestrians or bicyclists.		<LI>Reduced mirror damage - The mirror's low-profile design greatly reduces incidents of 		mirror damage that can occur while the vehicle is parked or in automatic car washes.</UL><P>	The prismatic mirror's wedge-shaped design offers numerous advantages to automakers, as well 	as motorists. Because the mirror eliminates coefficient of drag penalties associated with 	conventional designs, it can help OEMs meet federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) 	standards. The cost of the prismatic mirror is expected to compare favorably with foldable 	mirrors currently on most upscale car and light truck models.</P><P>	Styling flexibility also is improved. The mirror can be designed into the window area 	traditionally used for side-view mirror placement or in the door panel below the vehicle's 	belt line.</P><P>	According to Leon R. Goolsby, vice president and general manager of UTA's Mirrors group, the license	 agreement allows UTA to use all levels of de Montfort's Milner prismatic technology to produce 	 side-view exterior mirrors for North American-made domestic and export vehicles.</P><P>	Based in Lichfield, England, de Montfort is an international automotive consultancy with clients 	that include governments, vehicle manufacturers and distributors and component suppliers. The 	company also develops innovative automotive products for licensing to others.</P><P>		UTA is a major supplier of electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components		 to car and light truck manufacturers.

<h1>Sloan seeks growth in European market</h1>

<p>


In a recent interview, Dick Sloan, president of United Technologies Automotive (Europe) cited the challenges 
of working with and among several trade regulations, cultures, languages and currencies. With a presence in 
every major European market, Sloan's operation must maneuver among various customer needs while 
meeting governmental and geographic requirements.<P>

<STRONG>Q.  Recently, United Technologies Automotive (Europe) has implemented 
the "lead-unit" concept. What is this?</STRONG> <BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG>  Since we powered up this concept in 1993, our penetration in Europe has increased 
dramatically. Because we service so many automakers in Europe -- which has many different requirements, 
cultures and languages -- we developed the lead-unit concept where engineering, product, finance, quality 
and sales responsibilities are directed from a single operation. This concept supports our efforts to provide the best 
customer service. It's similar to the product development teams concept in the U.S.<p>

<STRONG>Q. Who are our key customers in Europe?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Our customer base has really grown. PSA, Fiat and Renault have always been our 
key customers, but we have added GM Opel, Saab and Jaguar. We are the first outside supplier Opel has 
contracted. And we are a key supplier for GM's new Astra and Omega car programs.
PSA continues to be our No. 1 customer. We supply two products to PSA -- cooling fans and electrical 
distribution systems.  We supply 75 percent of the wiring for the new Citroen Saxo, which produces 
about 1,250 cars a day. We also supply cooling fans and 75 percent of the wiring system to Citroen 
for the  Xantia; 100 percent of wiring systems to SAAB; and 100 percent of the junction boxes and 
some wiring systems for the Land Rover.<p>

<STRONG>Q.  How do you plan to grow United Technologies Automotive (Europe) business?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Our long-term goal is to increase our market penetration and assume the leadership 
position with all of the major European product lines. There are two ways we will accomplish this:  first, by being awarded 
new contracts for new products with our present customers, as well as acquiring new customers and second, by actively pursuing acquisitions and joint ventures. <P>

<STRONG>Q. Quality is a major issue today.  How is United Technologies Automotive (Europe) doing in this area?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Overall, our quality levels in Europe are very good. Our plants in Hungary and Portugal
 have the best customer PPM records.  We recently implemented a new and innovative automated quality 
system throughout Europe. This is a computer data base that allows us to input information from the plant's 
first-run capability to facts about customer rejects, warranties and reliability.<p>

<STRONG>Q. What are some of your future challenges?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Western Europe will continue to be a competitive fight.  For the first time, European car makers are 
dealing with a world-class pricing structure. The pressure is on for European automakers to lower car prices, 
and as they lower their prices, they come to us to lower our prices. <p>

<STRONG>Q. What are some of the opportunities you see?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Our real opportunities will be in Eastern Europe, where the industry is growing 
at a rapid rate. There will be tremendous growth in vehicle sales in that market, and we want to be part of 
that growth.  We're getting organized to support our automotive customers in that market.  
We already have operations in Hungary and Poland. <p>

<STRONG>Q. How do you see the business changing?</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> In Europe, car companies are doing more outsourcing. This offers us an opportunity to grow our business. 
Europe is ahead of the U.S. in moving in the direction of suppliers providing car makers with 
integrated systems and external modular assembly.<P>

<h1>Wiring Systems makes cost-cutting changes</h1>

<p>


Wiring Systems on Oct. 3 announced a series of changes in an effort to cut costs and consolidate work. 
The company will discontinue operations at its Newton, Ill., and North Manchester, Ind., facilities.  And some work produced at 
the Zanesville, Ohio, plant will move to Mexico.

<p>The closing of the Newton facility, which will be completed in the first quarter of 1997, will affect 450 associates.  
Production of wire harnesses at Newton will be transferred to UT Automotive facilities in Mexico and the Philippines.  

<p>Operations at the North Manchester plant also will be discontinued in the first quarter of 1997.  The closing, which was originally 
announced two years ago, will affect about 170 associates. Production of battery cable harnesses and related 
business will be consolidated at Wiring Systems facilities in Zanesville, Ohio.

<p>And production of some select wire harnesses will move from Zanesville to company facilities in Mexico. Work-force requirements in Zanesville are still under consideration because of the production changes 
at the plant. 

<p>The changes are part of ongoing cost-improvement activities throughout the company, said Ed Buker, vice 
president, Wiring Systems.

<p>"We regret these changes will result in a downsizing of our work force, and in the closing of our Newton and North Manchester facilities," he said.  "But unfortunately, in order to compete in our highly competitive business, these difficult decisions had to be made."

<p>In an effort to support associates in Newton and North Manchester, the company is developing plans to offer 
special outplacement services to associates affected by the change. Associates will be informed of such services as they 
become available.

<h1>Juarez earns ISO-9000</h1>

<p>


Plant 042 in Juarez, Mexico, has earned ISO-9002 certification -- the first UT Automotive  plant in 
North America to earn such distinction. ISO-9002 is step one in a two-step process required to achieve 
QS-9000 registration.<p>

The Input Controls plant, which employs 1,000 associates, manufactures switches for Ford, Chrysler, General 
Motors, Mazda and Nissan. <p>

Plant manager Jeff Moore said "there's no magic involved" in obtaining the 
certification.  "You have to make QS-9000 a way of life, a routine," Moore said. <p> 

"And, just as important, you have to do what you say you're going to do."<p>

Associate teamwork and ownership, as well as upper management support, also were key to the plant's 
success.<p>

"We have had great support from our management," Moore said. "You can't get done what needs to be 
done without the person power, and our management made sure we got what we needed."<P>

Tom Wolanzyk, vice president and general manager, Input Controls, applauded the effort.<p>

"What Plant 042 has done is highly commendable," Wolanzyk said.<p>

"In spite of tremendous influx of new work, associates were still able to pursue certification."<p>

Plant 042 subscribes to the 5 "S's" and conducts exit interviews with every visitor for feedback as well as ideas
for improvement, Moore said. <p>

"We try to manage by reflection over here," he said.

<h1>Interiors' Women's group asks the question: 'What if?'</h1>

<p>


What does a woman look for when buying a new car?<p>

This is the question a group of UT Automotive associates -- specifically, female associates -- 
is trying to answer.<P>

The Interiors' Women's Advisory Committee, a diverse group of 30 female associates -- including managers, 
secretaries, technicians and financial analysts -- meets at least once a month to discuss women's 
concerns about vehicle interiors.<p>
 
"Since approximately 78 percent of vehicle purchases are influenced by women, it quickly becomes 
evident why so much emphasis should be put on addressing women's concerns," said Gloria Lara, strategic 
planning and marketing, Interiors, who founded the women's group. <p>

"We go after the 'unobserved' needs, such as vanity mirrors that are inadequately lit, and the lack of storage 
compartments suitable for cellular phones, purses, shoes or baby bottles.  We discuss these ideas and then 
let our designers come up with the solutions."<p>

A recent meeting of the committee, attended by members of the Detroit media, demonstrated how the 
"what if?" brainstorming sessions work.  Participants discussed potential new products designed to 
stow trash and women's purses.<p>

Since the group was formed roughly four months ago, new product ideas have increased 
by more than 15 percent, according to Lara.  Some of these enhancements will be 
incorporated into prototype vehicles for presentation to OEM customers in the fourth quarter -- 
an idea-to-prototype time improvement of at least 20 percent.<p>

"Vehicle interiors are taking on greater importance with consumers, since vehicles are becoming an extension 
of a person's lifestyle," said Lara.<p>

Lara said she hopes the Interiors' women's committee is just the beginning. <p>

"We're hoping to deploy the concept of women's groups UT Automotive- and UTC-wide," she said.  <p>

Associates who have an idea for a vehicle's interior should  E-mail Lara at <A HREF="mailto:glara@uta.com">glara@uta.com</A>.

<STRONG>Chihuahua, Mexico</STRONG><BR>
UT Automotive last month participated in the first Maquiladora Industry Parts & Components Trade Show 
in Chihuahua, Mexico. The trade show attracted more than 7,000 visitors and 330 exhibits.  United Technologies Automotive Electrical Systems de Mexico in Chihuahua 
displayed its wares in an effort to solicit potential suppliers, according to Max Vargas, manufacturing director, |
Chihuahua and Honduras operations.

<br>

"We attended the trade show in an effort to increase 
our Mexican supply base," Vargas said.  "Part of our business strategy is to develop local vendors who 
can provide quality materials at a competitive price."<p>

<STRONG>Columbus, Mississippi</STRONG><BR>
United Technologies Motor Systems in Columbus donated $10,000 to the Plymouth Bluff Center, a teaching, 
conference and environmental center operated by the Mississippi University for Women.

<br>

"Companies that 
are going to be successful in the future must have a work force that is exceptionally well trained in world-class 
practices and techniques," said Johnny Davis, director of  operations in Columbus.

    <p>
    From initial concept through production and beyond, UT Automotive carries projects
    through all stages of development using the most modern design and
    engineering tools and techniques.
    <P>
    UT Automotive can provide a full range of design and styling capabilities, including
    concept development through sketches and renderings, and full-sized styling
    models, graphic design and layout design.
    <P>
    Our designers and engineers are experts in their fields. When involved
    early in the concept phase, UT Automotive often has introduced new ideas and options
    to customers that add value or lower the cost of products and streamline the
    manufacturing process. In fact, UT Automotive has the capability to work as a
    customer's engineering and design department, providing cost-effective
    program management and allowing customers to devote more time to final
    vehicle assembly.
    <P>
    UT Automotive uses such engineering hardware and software as advanced Catia and PDGS
    computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering (ACD/CAE) systems. We
    emphasize the exchange of design and process technology and information
    among our U.S., European and Japanese engineering centers to better serve
    our customers' needs. To further improve this exchange, all of UT Automotive's
    engineering centers are linked via global satellite.
    <P>
    In addition, UT Automotive draws on the knowledge and expertise of nearly 1,000
    engineers and scientists at the <a href="http://www.utrc.utc.com/">United
    Technologies Research Center</a>. Many dedicated research projects -
    including rapid prototyping, materials testing and composites testing - are
    under way there and at local universities.
    <P>
    We're also working with other United Technologies divisions to transfer
    their technology to automotive applications. For example, UT Automotive is teaming
    with Carrier, the world's largest manufacturer of heating and air
    conditioning systems, to develop air distribution systems that route air
    through a vehicle's headliner and door panels.
    <P>
    UT Automotive continues working to reduce design and engineering time, accommodate
    changes easier and decrease concept-to-market cycle time. Through
    innovation, technology transfer and extensive research and development,
    we're constantly finding ways to improve our products and introduce new
    concepts to the automotive industry.

    <h2>7. World-Class Quality</h2>



    <p>
    UT Automotive recognizes that a companywide commitment to quality is required to be a
    world-class supplier.
    <P>
    Our quality support system utilizes statistical process control, design of
    experiments, failure mode effects analysis and other continuous quality
    improvement techniques.
    <P>
    At our European facilities, we offer real-time data collection of
    significant characteristics, which is shared on line directly with our
    customers.
    <P>
    UT Automotive continues to find new ways to deliver world-class quality to our
    customers. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concurrent design and engineering</strong>, which builds in
      quality earlier in the process and reduces design-to-product cycle time.
      <li><strong>Cell manufacturing</strong>, which combines people and
      equipment in smaller manufacturing groups (cells) to reduce set-up time,
      accommodate smaller lot sizes and provides just-in-time flexibility.
      <li><strong>Bar coding</strong>, which facilitates communication between
      departments and suppliers and, in turn, improves productivity and
      delivery.
      <li><strong>Partners in Excellence</strong>, which enables UT Automotive to
      recognize our best suppliers and helps us more effectively control
      quality, time and costs. UT Automotive also participates with its suppliers in a
      joint materials development program.
      <li><strong>Regularly scheduled preventive maintenance</strong>, which
      minimizes downtime, increases production and improves just-in-time
      capabilities.
      <li><strong>On-site representation in customer plants</strong>, which
      ensures better coordination and flexibility.
      <li><strong>Continuous training</strong>, which ensures better
      decision-making skills.
      <li><strong>Participatory management</strong>, which enables employees at
      all levels and stages to find opportunities for continuous quality
      improvement.
      <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong>, which uses Kaizen principles
      and our own production systems such as UT AutomotivePS and flexible manufacturing to
      produce higher quality and productivity.
    </Ul>
    <p>
    UT Automotive's goal is to deliver the highest quality product possible. But ensuring
    product quality does not stop when it is delivered to the customer. UT Automotive is a
    leader in tracking reliability of products in the field. Warranty data is
    analyzed and corrective action in design and/or assembly is taken to provide
    a trouble-free product. The result has been lower warranty expenses for our
    customers.

    <h2>8. Program management</h2>


    <p>
    Many suppliers can manufacture products. But UT Automotive also excels in managing the
    process, which is critical to the success of a program.
    <P>
    UT Automotive manages the entire process to ensure timeliness, cost control and
    quality. By forming cross-functional management teams, UT Automotive is able to
    streamline the process and improve communications, and the result is better
    design and tooling, improved timing, continuous improvement and controlled
    costs.
    <P>
    UT Automotive teams work directly with OEM designers, engineers and platform teams,
    and customer plants, and coordinates efforts with other suppliers.

    <h2>9. Systems Integration</h2>


    <p>
    UT Automotive's complete understanding of the various components and systems in a
    vehicle and how they interact is unmatched among automotive suppliers. More
    importantly, it offers our customers potential savings in vehicle assembly
    and improved product quality and reliability.
    <P>
    Examples of UT Automotive's systems integration abilities include:
    <ul>
      <li>Modular instrument panels or door panels with built-in wiring,
      switches and electronics, which can reduce cost, simplify vehicle assembly
      and improve reliability.
      <li>Door panels that include wiring, windowlift motors and door lock
      assemblies.
      <li>Modular headliners that integrate substrate, sunshades, switches,
      lamps, assist handles and other components into one tool-free, snap-in
      system.
      <li>A steering wheel system that incorporates the wheel and air bag module
      with a stub shaft containing redundant radio controls and other input
      switches.
    </Ul>
    <p>
    UT Automotive is heavily involved in the area of "mechatronics" - the integration of
    mechanical and electronic systems into one unit. This capability optimizes
    performance characteristics and can provide more efficient packaging,
    increased functionality and higher reliability.
    <P>
    UT Automotive has used mechatronics in creating a generic electronic module and
    junction box, a four-wheel-drive shift-on-the-fly transfer case, a smart
    windowlift motor system and a transmitter fob for remote entry systems.

    <h2>10. Research and Development</h2>

   

    <p>
    UT Automotive constantly is finding ways to improve our products and develop new
    automotive applications through innovation, technology transfer and
    extensive research and development.
    <P>
    To provide our customers with the best technology in the world, technology
    transfer and information exchange occurs regularly among our operations in
    North America, Europe and Asia. We also are working with many other renowned
    private, government and university laboratories.
    <P>
    In addition, the <a href="http://www.utrc.utc.com/">United Technologies
    Research Center</a> has been a leading initiator of technical change
    throughout <a href="http://www.utc.com/">UTC</a>. Central to the
    <a href="http://www.utrc.utc.com/">Research Center's</a> technical
    leadership are innovations that enable change, like computer-aided design
    systems; innovations that drive product change, like advances in digital and
    power electronics in photonics and magnetics; and process innovations that
    are essential to maintaining competitive advantage, like rapid prototyping
    and integrated product development.
    <P>
    For example, the <a href="http://www.utrc.utc.com/">Research Center</a>
    helped UT Automotive apply surface acoustic wave technology to develop hand-held
    remote vehicle entry systems, a first application outside of the aerospace
    industry.
    <P>
    The ingenuity of <a href="http://www.utc.com/">UTC's</a> engineers and
    scientists is represented by the 12,000 patents held by the company
    worldwide.  Strong research and development investment - about $1.8 billion
    annually in company, customer and government funds - helps assure
    <a href="http://www.utc.com/">UTC's</a> continued technology leadership.

While European automakers introduced their 1997 models at the Paris Auto Show in October, UT Automotive 
unveiled two new technologies currently under development to business and automotive journalists.
Silviu Palalau, along with Winston Maue, demonstrated the flat panel display system and liftgate module to 
more than 400 potential customers and automotive reporters during a hotel reception.

On Sept. 23, United Technologies Automotive Systems, Inc. announced it agreed in principle to sell its 
Steering Wheels operation to BREED Technologies, Inc.  The proposed acquisition is expected to be completed 
as soon as possible following any required regulatory reviews.  Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.<p>

The sale includes UT Automotive's steering wheel manufacturing facilities in Grabill, Ind., and Birmingham, England, 
as well as its leather wrap capabilities in Interiors' Monterrey, Mexico, facility.  The Niles, Mich., Steering Wheels plant 
will close in early 1997.<p>

"Our customers are moving quickly toward sourcing the steering wheel, air bag module and cover as a complete,
integrated system," said President Norm Bodine. <p>
 
"After carefully examining the possibilities, we concluded that systems integration should best be managed by the 
combination of an air bag manufacturer with a steering wheel manufacturer."<p>

BREED, which employs more than 7,000 people in 42 locations, provides a complete range of occupant safety 
systems and other components to the world's major automotive manufacturers.  Headquartered in Lakeland, Fla., 
BREED manufactures electronic and electromechanical sensors, air bag modules, steering wheels, bumpers, instrument 
panels, interior and exterior trim and inflators.<p>

BREED operates 24 manufacturing and 18 engineering and sales facilities 
in England, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico and the United States.<p><p>

<h1>QS-9000: It's your job</h1>

<p>


How do you spell quality?  For automotive suppliers who wish to remain suppliers in the next millennium, 
it's spelled QS-9000. <p>

QS-9000 is an industrywide quality system encompassing the fundamental quality expectations of 
automakers, truck manufacturers and other subscribing companies.  <p>

The system is a tool designed to provide the discipline required to effectively manage quality throughout business while eliminating redundant requirements and their 
associated costs.<p>

"QS-9000 is the way we're expected to run our business," said Ray Colley, corporate manager of quality 
systems, who was brought to UT Automotive from Carrier last year to spearhead the company's QS-9000 
certification effort.<p>

All Tier 1 suppliers to the automotive industry are required by their customers -- 
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- to obtain QS-9000 certification.  While each customer has its own deadline, 
the expectation is the same.<p>

In fact, Ford set the tone regarding the importance of achieving quality standards recently when it removed 
44 component supplier plants who had not earned Q1 status from its list of suppliers. Losing the Q1 
designation means losing Ford's business.<p>

Ed Hagenlocker, Ford Automotive Operations president, said this marks the first withdrawal in Q1's history.
"It's one example of what our higher expectations are," said Hagenlocker, who was quoted in a 
Detroit Free Press article.<p>

Colley put it this way.  "If we don't achieve QS-9000 status, then we won't be able to quote on new 
business.  It's that simple," he said.<p>

<IMG SRC="graph2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="340" HEIGHT="196" BORDER="0" HSPACE="6" VSPACE="3">

Achieving certification in all of the functions a company's employees perform -- in the office to the 
plant floor -- is not simple.  The first step involves documenting procedures and agreeing on how current 
business procedures are performed.  Then, further reviews of every process and procedure determine if the 
work is done in the most efficient or effective manner. If  associates determine if the function can be improved,
the appropriate changes are made. <p> 

<HR>
<I>The chart, right, illustrates the months in 1997 that UT Automotive needs to achieve QS-9000 status for various OEMs.</I><p>
<HR>

An audit process follows in which processes or procedures  not in conformance with sound business 
practices are identified and corrective action suggested.  A  corporate audit and/or a third-party audit by an 
outside, objective source followed by a third-party initial audit is required.   Management reviews the suggested 
action, then assigns personnel, machinery and materials -- whatever it takes -- to make the necessary 
improvements.<p>

The real "value added" part of the process comes during implementation of QS-9000, according to Colley.  
"The part I like most is taking off my auditor's hat and putting on my 'how can I help' hat.  This is where 
working together with people, sharing best practices, and re-audits will assist in improving our overall 
business systems."<p>

Many work groups throughout UT Automotive are in the process of achieving 
QS-9000.  Some are in the audit stage, while others are in the corrective action phase.<p>

While plants and offices are busy assessing their processes and procedures, Colley and his staff -- 
Karen Dupon and Mike Thomas -- have been busy spreading the QS-9000 word.  To date, more than 
2,500 employees worldwide have been trained on QS-9000.  <p>

As deadlines near for QS-9000 certification, Colley's staff is working hard to turn the goal into reality.<p>

"We have put out a call for qualified auditors through our UT Automotive QS-9000 Forum and from 
all over UTC to assist in our overall audit efforts," Colley said.  "This will help us share best practices while 
allowing qualified associates to obtain auditor days required for their registration as an auditor or lead auditor 
with the Registration Accreditation Board."<p>

Qualified associates needing audit assistance or wishing to participate in audits should obtain approval 
from their supervisors, and contact their QS-9000 management representative and Colley.<p>

"If we are to achieve QS-9000 registration in 1997, we must have management 
support of this audit activity," Colley said.<p>

Meanwhile, associates can expect to live QS-9000 in the coming months, Colley added.  
Even after initial certification, third-party audits will be repeated every six months to ensure quality systems 
remain in place.<p>

"Our customers are requiring that we establish, document and implement effective quality management 
systems based upon QS-9000," he said. <p> 

"We must learn the art of 'saying what we do and doing what we say.'  This new process may be more 
work initially, but in the long run it will pay off.  As we continue along the path of 
continuous improvement, the quality systems we set in place today will become the 
foundation we build upon tomorrow."<p>

<H4>Zanesville, Ohio</H4>
Some 20 employees from the Zanesville, Ohio, Input Controls plant are hitting the books 
to earn their MBAs. Students attend the University of Findlay via video conference technology.  
The program, consisting of 33 credit hours, will take roughly two years to complete.
Jeff Lunsford, plant manager, said the on-site educational program is a first for the plant.  
"We're used to making switches here, not MBA graduates," he said.

Car enthusiasts at the  Porter Street office didn't have to walk too far to catch a glimpse of some hot rods.  
The first annual Porter Street Auto Show was held in the building's 
parking lot. Associates who own treasured vehicles drove them into work for a day to share their passion with 
fellow workers.  The cars -- ranging from a 1966 AC Cobra 427 and Triumph Spitfire to a 1985 SS Monte Carlo -- 
were parked outside the building's front door so associates could browse during their lunch hour.
Peter Raciti, product engineer, Steering Wheels, who spearheaded the show, said the event provided associates 
with the opportunity to share their passion. "It was a great networking opportunity," he said. <p>

<h1>UT Automotive enters Thailand market</h1>

<p>

<IMG SRC="thai.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="209" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="2">

To support its strategic expansion into the Asian automotive components market, United Technologies 
Automotive, Inc.  has signed an agreement with Siam Motors Co., Ltd. (SMC) to form Siam UT Automotive Co., 
Ltd.  The joint venture company will manufacture electromechanical and electronic components for the Thai 
domestic market and for UT Automotive's global customers.  UT Automotive is the majority partner in the 
venture.<p>

"We established this joint venture with SMC in Thailand to support the rapid growth of the automotive industry 
in the region, and especially Thailand," said Tom Wolanzyk, vice president and general manager, Input Controls. 
"Right now, Thailand and much of the Asian automotive market depend on electromechanical and electronic 
components imported primarily from Japan."<p>

The new joint venture, to be located near Bangkok, will manufacture heater fan switches, relays, multifunction 
switches, door lock switches, remote entry systems and door lock modules. <p>

"Entering Thailand demonstrates our commitment to and support of our customers in the Asian region," 
said  President Norm Bodine. "We view Thailand as an excellent manufacturing location, offering opportunities 
to establish our company as a key supplier to other southeast Asian markets.  It also will allow us to participate 
more quickly and with lower investment to support our automotive customers."<p>

Lower shipping costs, other economic incentives offered by the government of Thailand, and strong partners like SMC will help us realize many 
opportunities to pursue additional business in the future, he added.<p>

SMC, founded in 1952, is the largest automotive components manufacturer 
in Thailand.  It also manufactures Nissan motor vehicles through a joint venture, Siam Nissan
Automotive Co., Ltd., with Nissan Motors of Japan.<p>

<h1>Bodine: Auto Suppliers Facing Major Challenges</h1>

<IMG SRC="aiag2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="286" BORDER="0" HSPACE="2" VSPACE="2"> 


Automotive suppliers -- UT Automotive included -- are facing major challenges in today's rapidly changing business 
environment.<p>

That's the message UT Automotive President Norm Bodine told a crowd of some 600 at the Automotive Industry Action 
Group's (AIAG) annual Achievement Awards dinner Sept. 17 in Detroit.<p>

"Our industry is undergoing dramatic change, especially as it relates to the cost and capital structure of major tier one 
suppliers," said Bodine, who was the keynote speaker. <p>

Bodine preceded his remarks to automakers and suppliers with a two-minute videotape illustrating the technological 
resources of United Technologies Corp., including visual highlights of UT Automotive, Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, Hamilton 
Standard, Otis and Carrier.<p>

Bodine cited several issues facing auto suppliers in today's marketplace.  For example:<p>


	<LI>Tier one suppliers, in general, think they need to be big in order to survive.  Should this growth be accomplished by 
	merger or acquisition?  Bodine said UT Automotive aims "not necessarily to be the biggest, but to be the very best at 
	what it does . . . on a global basis."<p>

	<LI>Systems integration is the future, but do the automakers want or need an integrated systems supplier in every case, 
	and how much of an integrator should suppliers be?   "I believe our customers will be better served if we offer quality 
	systems that perhaps don't provide everything in one bundle, but are better suited to their special product wants and needs," 
	Bodine said.<p>

	<LI>The increased challenges to meet accountability, responsibility, product reliability and warranty costs demands. 
	Bodine said UT Automotive was one of the first auto suppliers to deliver report cards on itself to customers on field 
	reliability.<p>

	<LI>Should or can every tier two or three supplier develop a global presence? According to Bodine, "going global" can stretch a company's financial and human resources to the breaking point.
Bodine praised AIAG as "an organization that helps each of us meet and manage challenges that face our industry."<p>

AIAG assists automakers and suppliers in their cooperative effort  to increase productivity, reduce costs, improve 
quality and make the U.S. industry more competitive in the global marketplace.<p>

Examples of AIAG efforts are programs to eliminate redundancies in computer-aided design systems and to implement 
deployment and training programs for quality systems.<p>

<IMG SRC="plant222.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="209" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4">

Plant #222 in Cebu, Philippines, has been selected to receive UT Automotive's President's Award for 
Environment, Health and Safety for 1995.<p>

The annual award is presented on a worldwide basis to the operation that has
demonstrated excellence in environmental, health and safety performance.<p>

Frank Macielak, director, Environment, Health and Safety (EH&S), said the President's Award is intended to 
acknowledge sustained significant improvement in the environmental, health and safety performance over the 
most recent three-year period.<p>

"This award is our way of acknowledging exceptional 
performance in the protection of the environment and our associates' health and safety," 
he said<p>

Plant #222's environmental, health and safety performance was evaluated in the following areas:  
occupational injuries and illnesses, air emissions, hazardous waste and regulatory compliance.<p>

Jon Villaflor, Plant 222 manager, said the success of the plant can be credited to 
associates' commitment to EH&S programs.<p>

"We believe that in order for each  individual to work safely and be safety conscious, he or she must be properly trained," he said.
Cebu reported a low number of lost work days due to job-related incidents in 1993 and 1994 and improved on that record by reporting zero lost work days in 1995.<p>

"To obtain and, more importantly, maintain the level of performance that Plant #222 has is a reflection of the 
commitment to and the involvement of everyone in the pursuit of environmental, health and safety 
excellence," Macielak said.

<h1>Around UTC</h1>

<IMG SRC="pratt.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="37" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Pratt & Whitney has apparently won a sizable contract -- perhaps worth $500 million -- from United Airlines.  
United has placed a $2.5 billion order for an unspecified 
number of Boeing 747s, 757s and 777s.<p>

<IMG SRC="pratt.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="37" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Pratt & Whitney has been selected by the U.S. Air Force to supply engines to power four new C-32A 
executives and Congressional transport aircraft.  The total value of the order, including installed engines and 
spares, is $534 million.  The equipment will be delivered in 1998.<p>

<IMG SRC="otis.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="35" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Otis has introduced its new worldwide integrated building transit 
system called "Odyssey," which will make possible the next 
generation of high-rise building design.  The system will use vehicles 
capable of moving people horizontally and vertically; whether in a super-tall 
or very wide structure.  By integrating horizontal and vertical movement in a single design, 
Odyssey will make it possible for passengers to travel from a remote parking lot to the very
top of the adjacent tall building in the same cab.<p>

<IMG SRC="otis.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="35" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Otis Elevator hopes Beijing's plans to increase the supply of low-cost housing will reignite flagging 
sales growth in China.  This, combined with the government's plans to direct about $602 million toward 
housing loans during the second half of the year, will change the market for elevators and 
escalators significantly.<p>

<IMG SRC="carrier.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Carrier has penetrated deeply into the Chinese air conditioning market and was one of the biggest 
exhibitors at this year's China Refrigeration Show in Shanghai.  Carrier-China is developing the largest 
operation outside of the United States, and Carrier's global strategies place its 
Asia-Pacific operations side-by-side with its North American operations.<p>

<IMG SRC="sikor.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="35" BORDER="0" HSPACE="3" VSPACE="0">
Sikorsky may be among the bidders when Turkey makes its expected purchase of 145 assault helicopters 
worth $3 billion over the next 10 years.

<h2>Aspen Internet Services Adopts Watkins Mill High School</h2>

Aspen Internet Services has volunteered its expertise and services
to Watkins Mill High School (WMHS), located in Montgomery Village,
Maryland, in the development of a World Wide Web site for its
teachers and students. As more schools are being connected to
the Internet, its value as an educational resource that is available
24 hours per day, 7 days per week is being recognized.
<p>
The Watkins Mill Web site, currently in development, will serve
as an <i>educational resource</i> for students, a <i>communications
tool</i> for faculty and parents, and an <i>information dissemination
vehicle </i>for the school. Aspen will help guide teachers and
students in the creation of the site. Major content areas planned
for the WMHS Web site include school news and activities; study
assignments and resources; information for parents; and information
for students, including an online newspaper.
<p>
"Aspen is pleased to volunteer its services to the community,
especially for such an important project as the WMHS Web site,"
said Scott Crocket, Vice President of Aspen Internet Services.
"Watkins Mill has recognized the value of the Internet as
an educational resource for its students, and we are pleased to
help the school achieve its goals in this area."
<p>
The Watkins Mill Web site is expected to be completed in early
1997.

<h2>Aspen-Developed Site for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Business Responds to AIDS and Labor Responds to AIDS Programs (BRTA/LRTA) Now On the Web</h2>

The <a href="http://www.brta-lrta.org">BRTA/LRTA site</a> gives an overview of BRTA/LRTA programs that help
businesses and labor organizations meet the challenges of HIV/AIDS in the workplace and in the community. Among the site's features are timely information and recent publications on issues related to HIV/AIDS in the workplace; actual statements from business and labor leaders
detailing successful workplace programs; real life scenarios addressing HIV/AIDS issues that
may arise in the workplace; and an extensive list of links to related Web sites. The site also
features several animated GIF (graphic interchange format) images and a QuickTime clip of a
TV Public Service Announcement.
<p><br>

<h2>Kudos for the CDC NAC Web Site</h2>

"Your Tax Dollars At Work . . . The <a href="http://www.cdcnac.org">National AIDS Clearinghouse</a> is just what it says -- a thorough, well-organized site for HIV news, research, funding sources and databases."<p>

-- <i>Reprinted from</i> Fast Forward, The Washington Post's <i>monthly guide to video, music, and computers</i><p>

"On sci.med.aids, one of the most important regular posts is the AIDS Daily Summary from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National AIDS Clearinghouse makes available this information as a public service, and it is definitely worth a look."<p>

-- <i>Reprinted from</i> Yahoo! Internet Life<p>

"The Internet has a vast array of sites that help in keeping up with study findings, medical conferences and policy matters. A good place to start is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National AIDS Clearinghouse . . . it is the most reliable source of accurate and up-to-date information on AIDS research."<p>

-- <i>Reprinted from the</i> Atlanta Journal/Atlanta Constitution, Living <i>section</i> 

<p><br>

<h2>Aspen Completes First Year of Operating The FEMA Map Service Center</h2>
On October 1, 1996, Aspen completed the first full year of operation for the Map Service Center (MSC) under a 4 option year contract from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The MSC was designated a "Reinvention Laboratory" under the National Perfor
mance Review (NPR) prior to the procurement.  MSC supports the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) by providing one-stop service for all NFIP-related material.  This support includes a customer service center to receive orders for products and provide
 technical assistance for flood concerns; processing orders, collecting payments, distributing map products and NFIP materials; providing customer follow up; and implementing a new inventory management system utilizing commercial off-the-shelf software.<p
>
Aspen continually seeks to implement performance improvements that are consistent with the MSC's concept as a "Reinvention Laboratory."  For example, customer service performance at MSC was established to conform to NPR's "equal to the best in the busines
s" standards.  Call wait time has been reduced by 150 percent, and the abandonment rate has been reduced by 50 percent over prior contract performance.  Customer Service Representatives also have become very knowledgeable in their subject matter through t
raining from many supporting FEMA representatives; this has further enhanced the quality and accuracy of information provided to callers.  The call center operates from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. with 8 to 10 operators and receives approximately 100,000 calls
 annually. 
<p>
During the first year of operation, the MSC distributed over 7.8 million products, an increase of 88 percent over the prior year's rate. Despite this significant increase, Aspen maintained order delivery times at 40 percent less than in the prior year. Fu
rther, we have maintained this performance even though the number of flood disaster orders increased by an unprecedented 524 percent during the first half of FY 1996 and required the shipment of more than 500,000 map panels to flood disaster sites. <p>
For more information about the MSC, contact Linda Kiess at <a
href="mailto:lkiess@aspensys.com"><b>lkiess@aspensys.com.</b></a>
<P><BR>

<h2>Aspen Wins National Health Information Awards</h2>
In October it was announced that Aspen won one silver and one bronze National Health Information Awards. In 1994 this program was initiated to recognize the nation's best consumer health information programs and materials. This recognition program is pres
ented by the Health Information Resource Center, the only private sector clearinghouse for consumer health information. More than 700 entries for the 1996 National Health Information Awards were judged by a specially selected panel of health information e
xperts during this past July and August.<p>

The projects awarded are as follows:<p>
<UL>
<LI>For a total Health Information Program in the category of Consumer Decision-Making Information (Silver):  <i>HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials: Knowing your Options</i> (video,discussion guides and brochures) funded by NIAD/FDA/NLM/CDC.<p>

<LI>For a World Wide Web/Internet Page in the category of Health Promotion/Disease and Injury Prevention Information (Bronze):  <a href="http://www.cdcnac.org"><i>CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse</i></a> WWW Site Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</UL>  
<P><BR>

<H2>HCC Begins Operating IVR System for HUD</H2>
On October 25, the <a href="http://www.aspensys.com/hcc"><i>Housing Counseling Clearinghouse</i></a> (HCC) began operating the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Counselor Referral System for HUD. With this technology, callers seeking the names of local age
ncies to help them with housing questions and problems just enter their zip code and a code for the type of counseling they desire. The system automatically searches HCCs database and supplies the caller with at least three appropriate local agency names
 and phone numbers. HCC currently maintains a database of over 1,200 pre-purchase, rental issue, default foreclosure, and home equity conversion mortgage counselors.<p>
During the first week of operation, 9,319 individuals were helped by this system and the numbers are expected to grow. The IVR technology could potentially be used to help other Aspen-run clearinghouses handle higher volumes of calls without increasing st
aff size or the workload for current staff.<br>

<FONT SIZE=4>Information is the cornerstone of any organization's existence.
Information is used daily to
make key decisions about products and services, costs, and
productivity -- factors that
influence success. An ongoing challenge for all organizations is
the sheer volume of
information that must be identified, gathered, managed, and
disseminated. Staff resources,
technology, and deadlines also affect the ability to maximize the
use and value of
information.<P>

Aspen Systems Corporation offers solutions to help manage
information for success. We
have the experience, staff, and technology to make information
work to your benefit. Over
the past three decades, we have pioneered many of the information
management standards in
use today. Our <!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="timel2.html">timeline</A> shows just a few of these major achievements.<P><BR>


<H2>About Aspen</H2>

Identifying, gathering, and analyzing information is critical for
effective decision-making.
Aspen converts information into a valuable resource that supports
your organization's
objectives. We achieve this transformation by offering a full

<IMG WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="Sysph.gif">
Effective information management is critical to provide relevant
information to the right
people in the most appropriate format. For example, government
agencies need to provide
timely information to their constituency audiences. Policymakers
need detailed analyses to
make more informed decisions, researchers require
government-compiled data to identify
new solutions to common problems, and the general public needs
practical,
easy-to-understand information. Aspen is skilled in maximizing
the value of information
through the design and management of information centers. This
includes:

<FONT SIZE=3><P>Estimates for electronic commerce transactions in the year 2000 are as high as $5 billion, up from less than $500 million today.  It is no longer a question of whether the Internet will become a viable market for conducting business, but more a matter of when you will start conducting business on the World Wide Web.</P>


<P>The advent of electronic commerce necessitates secure transaction capabilities to protect your customers' privacy.  The availability of a secure transaction feature allows organizations to safely transmit credit card numbers, application forms, confidential documents such as financial statements, employee records, and product ordering information across the Internet.</P>


<P>Electronic commerce and secure transaction capabilities will enable you to:</P>

<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>increase your market recognition and penetration
<LI>provide around-the-clock operations and customer service
<LI>expedite delivery of products and services
</UL>


<P>Aspen Internet Services continually monitors emerging technologies in electronic commerce and secure transactions so that our clients benefit from the most up-to-date, technically advanced solutions available.  Our secure transaction features include:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><I>CyberCash</I></B>. This option provides merchants with the opportunity to offer goods and services over the Internet through the use of CyberCash software, which directly connects the customer transaction to the merchant's bank.  Customers simply download the software and establish an account with CyberCash by providing a credit card number across the Internet only at the initial installation.  Once customers have established an account, they can order products without sending their credit card information over the Internet.  Because there is no credit card information stored on the merchant's server, the liability and need for a secure server are reduced.</P>



<P><B><I>Secure Server Encryption</I></B>. Secure server environments allow for transmission of encrypted data packets via the TCP/IP communications protocol.  Using widely accepted standard security technologies, including RSA encryption keys and SSL protocol, the server receives and transmits information that is only viewable by the sender and/or receiver.  A secure server eliminates the possibility that such sensitive information is captured or viewed during transmission.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>For further information on these technologies call our toll-free number at (888) 851-7472 or e-mail us at <!-- MailTo Tag -->

<P>Aspen Internet Services offers three hosting plans that take into account various Web site factors such as disk space, amount of traffic or "hits", and the number and complexity of interactive features.  As a result, customers benefit from the most cost-effective solution for their site, paying only for the services they need. We will assist clients in determining which service level is most appropriate and cost-effective, based upon current Web site requirements.</P>



<P>Features of the pricing structure include:</P>


<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>a one-time fee for basic server set-up
<LI>an optional service for registering a Web site domain name with InterNIC 	
<LI>a basic monthly hosting fee that is based on disk space and number of hits
<LI>add-on fees for storage and traffic once a predetermined level is reached
<LI>low fees for additional hosting services, such as databases, forms, discussion 	forums, and secured access
</UL>


<P><B>Our guarantee</B></P>


<P>Aspen offers the highest-quality hosting services available, with around-the-clock  monitoring of disk space usage and processor load.  Web sites are placed on our corporate server,  a Sun Microsystems SPARCStation 20 Unix server.  A 1.5 MB T1 line connects our system directly to our Internet provider, BBNPlanet. Aspen's high-end corporate Internet infrastructure enables us to offer maximum accessibility to the Internet. If you have any questions about our hosting rate structure, please contact Gary Downs at (301) 251-5370 or via e-mail at <!-- MailTo Tag -->

<FONT SIZE=3><P>Today, companies are seeking to develop intranets at a faster rate than they are establishing an Internet presence. The result of this trend will be a revolution in the way organizations do business.</P>



<P>In the past, private information management networks were often beyond the resources of most organizations.  However, through today's rapidly evolving technologies and the development of intranets, companies are now able to afford the benefits of a comprehensive information management system.  By using common Internet technologies, in conjunction with their own business applications, organizations can communicate, distribute information, and facilitate project collaboration and management across their entire enterprise, including remote locations. The results include:</P>

<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>increased employee productivity 
<LI>reduced costs
<LI>less paperwork
<LI>higher profit margins
</UL>

<P>Additionally, organizations are finding intranet development both easy and inexpensive.  Intranets are user-friendly, platform independent, and universally accessible, and most important, the technology is readily available.</P>


<P>Among the information resources and management tools organizations are placing on their intranets are:</P>

<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>collaborative groupware applications
<LI>legacy databases and systems
<LI>computer-based training
<LI>electronic and database publishing
<LI>e-mail
<LI>management resources
</UL>



<P>Aspen can help your organization develop an intranet by providing support in the following areas:</P>


<P><B><I>Consulting</I></B>. Aspen can assist in all phases of intranet development, including site planning and design, content development, and implementation of interactive features and new technologies.</P>

<P><B><I>Production</I></B>. Aspen can provide page production support, including HTML coding, data conversion, scanning, document imaging, proofreading, and editorial support.  </P>



<P><B><I>Programming and Networking</I></B>. Aspen's technical staff can provide systems development support including database design and programming, development of specialized intranet features requiring CGI scripting or Java/Javascript, network design and integration, and requirements analysis.</P>


<P><B><I>Staff Training</I></B>. Aspen can provide your staff with training in intranet server set-up and HTML and other programming languages used to develop and maintain your intranet.</P>


<P><B><I>Internal Promotion</I></B>. Aspen can provide consulting services to assist with promoting the use of the intranet among your organization's employees.</P></FONT>

<h3>

<a name=10>What is ERIC?</a>

</h3>

<p>

<dl>The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) is a national information system designed to provide users with ready access to an extensive body of education-related literature. ERIC, established in 1966, is supported by the 

<a href="http://www.ed.gov">U.S. Department of Education</a>, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, and the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/NLE/">National Library of Education</a>.

</dl>

<P>

<h3>

<a name=20>How do I get to the education-related literature?</a>

</h3> 

<P>

<DL>Through the ERIC database, the world's largest source of education information. The database contains more than 850,000 abstracts of documents and journal articles on education research and practice. You can access the ERIC database via the internet through <A HREF="http://ericir.syr.edu/ERIC/eric.html">World Wide Web</a>, via <a href="gopher://vmsgopher.cua.edu.:70/11gopher_root_eric_ae:[_search]">Gopher</a> or via commercial vendors and public networks. You can also access ERIC abstracts in  the printed medium, <i>Resources in Education</i> and <i>Current Index To Journals in Education.</i> The database is updated monthly (quarterly on CD-ROM), ensuring that the information you receive is timely and accurate.

</dl>

<p>

<h3>

<a name=30>Where can I get the full-text of ERIC Documents (ED)?

</a>

</h3> 

<p>

<DL>If a publication has an ERIC Document (ED) number, you can find a copy at any one of the more than 900 libraries that have the ERIC microfiche collection, or you can purchase a microfiche or paper copy from the ERIC Document Reproduction Service (1-800-443-ERIC), or <a href="mailto:edrs@inet.ed.gov">e-mail</a> them.   For publications that are not available from ERIC, the abstract will include information on where you can obtain a copy.

</dl>

<p>

<h3>

<a name=40>Where can I get the full-text of ERIC Journal (EJ) articles?

</a>

</h3> 

<P>

<DL>Copies of journal articles can be found in library periodical collections; through interlibrary loan; from the journal publisher; or from article reprint services such as  the <a href="http://www.umi.com/infostore">UMI/InfoStore</a>, 1-800-248-0360, or Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), 1-800-523-1850.

</DL>

<P>

<h3>

<a name=50>Does ERIC have plans to become a full-text database?</a>

</h3> 

<p>

<dl>With the expansion of computer access to information, there has been increasing interest in full-text electronic access to ERIC documents and articles, which would allow you to print or download the complete text of the ones you want.  The ERIC System is exploring ways to make more of the database available in full-text and has made the popular ERIC Digests available through the <a href="gopher://gopher.ed.gov:70/11/programs/ERIC/searchs">ERIC Digests Online File</a>.  You can get complete copies of ERIC Digests from many electronic sources, including most CD-ROM versions of ERIC, and through the online vendors.

</dl>

<p>

<h3>


<a name=60>What are</A> <a href="gopher://gopher.ed.gov:70/11/programs/ERIC/searchs">ERIC Digests</a>?</h3>

<DL>

<a href="gopher://gopher.ed.gov:70/11/programs/ERIC/searchs">ERIC Digests</a> are two-page research syntheses, which are among the ERIC system's most popular offerings. There are currently more than 1,000 Digests, and approximately 100 new titles are produced each year.  

</DL>

<p>

<h3><a name=65>What are the</a> <a href="barak.html">ERIC Components</a>?</h3>

<DL>There are three ERIC Components that comprise the ERIC System: ERIC Clearinghouses, ERIC Adjunct Clearinghouses, and ERIC Support Components.  See below for a brief description of each of these components.</dl>

<p>

<h3><a name=70>What is an</a> <a href="barak.html#1">ERIC Clearinghouse</a>?</h3>

<DL>The ERIC Clearinghouses collect, abstract, and index education materials for the ERIC database; respond to requests for information in their subject specific areas; and produce special publications on current research, programs, and practices.</DL> 

<p>

<h3><a name=80>What is an </a> <a href="barak.html#2">Adjunct Clearinghouse</a>?</H3>

<DL> Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouses are associated with the ERIC  Clearinghouse whose scope overlaps the narrower scope of the  adjunct. Each adjunct identifies and acquires significant literature within its scope area. The clearinghouse with which the adjunct is associated then catalogs, indexes, and  abstracts the documents for inclusion in the ERIC database.  Like the larger clearinghouses, the adjuncts provide free reference and referral services in their subject areas.</dL> 

<p>

<h3><a name=90>What is a</A> <a href="barak.html#3">Support Component</a>?</h3>

<dl>ERIC Support Components produce, publish, and disseminate systemwide ERIC products and services.</dL>

<p>
<h3><a name=95>Why is the ERIC system </A><a href="anniv.html">celebrating</a>?</h3>

<dl> In the school year 1996-97 the ERIC system is will celebrate its 30 year anniversary.  For more information see our <a href="anniv.html">press release</a>.

</dl>

<p>If you have a question about ERIC that is not addressed above send it to <a href=mailto:acceric@inet.ed.gov">acceric@inet.ed.gov</a>, and we will answer it.  Also check here next week,  you never know, it could be a FAQ.</P>

 Centers</EM>, a <EM>Directory of ERIC Resource Collections,</EM> and
 an <EM>ERIC Calendar of Education-Related Conferences</EM>. 
 <P>
 You can find the information included in the <EM>ERIC Directory of
 Education-Related Information Centers</EM> and the <EM>Directory of
 ERIC Resource Collections</EM> online in the <A

The Educational Resources Information Center, a nationwide education information network sponsored by the <A HREF = "http://www.ed.gov/">U.S. Department of Education</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.ed.gov/NLE/">National Library of Education</A>, turns 30 years old in Fall 1996. As part of the year-long anniversary commemoration during the 1996-97 school year, plans are under way to:

<ul><p>

<li>Produce a special anniversary issue of the ERIC Review featuring system highlights, photoreproducible training materials, and thoughtful discussion of the uses of education information.

<p>

<li>    Administer a treasure hunt (with prizes) on the World Wide Web.

<p>

<li>   Distribute premiums, including posters, bookmarks, folders, and other goodies.

<p>

<li>Premier full-text delivery of ERIC documents via the Internet in Spring  1997.</ul>

<p><p>


<quote>"We want to make sure we celebrate ERIC's 30-year mark with a substantive gift to the education community," said Blane Dessy, Director of the National Library of Education, ERIC's organizational home within the Department of Education. "That's why we're focusing resources on developing materials that will help people understand and use ERIC more effectively. Full-text, in particular, will help our customers and ensure that ERIC continues to harness technological advances to support education at all levels." </quote>

<a href="defabs.html">Abstract</a>:This book examines issues in designing coherent education policy for public 

elementary and secondary schools.  It seeks to expand the policy discussion by 

refining the definition of coherence and considering a number of complex 

questions raised by the notion of coherent policy.  The book offers an in-depth 

look at systemic school reform and offers a variety of ideas as to how 

educators at the district, state, and federal levels may coordinate the various 

elements of policy infrastructure around a new set of ambitious, common goals 

for student achievement.  Chapters include the following: (1) "The Politics of 

Coherence" (Susan H. Fuhrman); (2) "Policy and Practice: The Relations between 

Governance and Instruction" (David K. Cohen and James P. Spillane); (3) "The 

Role of Local School Districts in Instructional Improvement" (Richard F. 

Elmore); (4) "Systemic Educational Policy: A Conceptual Framework" (William H. 

Clune); (5) "Student Incentives and Academic Standards: Independent Schools as 

a Coherent System" (Arthur G. Powell); (6) "New Directions for Early Childhood 

Care and Education Policy" (W.  Steven Barnett); (7) "How the World of Students 

and Teachers Challenges Policy Coherence" (Milbrey W. McLaughlin and Joan E. 

Talbert); (8) "Systemic Reform and Educational Opportunity" (Jennifer A. O'Day 

and Marshall S. Smith); and (9) "Conclusion: Can Policy Lead the Way?" (Susan 

H. Fuhrman.) References accompany each chapter.  (LMI)<BR><BR>

Computer networks change everyday classroom activities into exciting, 
unique projects involving the interaction of students and teachers 
worldwide. For example, students studying the solar system can send 
questions directly to NASA scientists. Teacher educators, student 
teachers, and supervising teachers can exchange ideas through the 
Teacher-LINK. They can also browse through hundreds of lesson plans in the 
AskERIC Virtual Library. 
     <P>
This brochure explores the benefits and applications of computer networks 
in K-12 classrooms. It presents the basics for getting started and 
introduces sample networks.

Interaction through networks helps break down communication barriers and 
connects students and teachers with the outside world. Access to a 
computer, a modem, and phone lines frees students and teachers from the 
physical limits and time constraints of the school environment. Networking 
allows them to send electronic mail, participate in computer conferencing, 
and access information from remote sources. 
     <p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
Electronic mail</b> (e-mail) allows you to exchange information with other 
teachers or students, locally or worldwide. E-mail is like an answering 
machine using text: a sender composes a message which is stored on the 
network; the receiver pulls it up onto a screen and reads it. By talking 
to others across continents, students can continually improve their 
writing and reading skills. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
File transfer</b> allows you and your students to send or receive files 
across networks--referred to as downloading or uploading files. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Computer conferencing/group communication</b> makes it possible for groups 
of teachers and students to work together and share information without 
having to be in close physical proximity. Global classrooms may be created 
where students work cooperatively with other students as if they were in 
the same location. You and your students can join organized discussion 
groups (also called listservs) that focus on a wide variety of topics. For 
more information on education listservs, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:askeric@ericir.syr.edu">askeric@ericir.syr.edu</a>. <p>

Electronic networking enables computers to communicate with each other. To 
network, you will need a <b>computer</b>, a <b>modem,</b> (a device that enables 
computers to communicate with each other), a <b>telecommunications software 
package</b>, and a <b>subscription to a network that allows access to other 
online services or the Internet</b>--a global computer network of computer 
networks. Users connected to the Internet at local sites are able to <i>talk</i> 
to colleagues connected to the Internet worldwide. Some important 
mechanisms that ease navigation on the Internet are: the <b>Gopher</B>, an 
organizing tool for <i>tunneling</i> to different sites on the Internet; <b>Telnet</b>, 
a connection to a host at a distant location; and the <b>World Wide Web</b>, a 
graphic user interface for organizing and presenting text, video, and 
sound electronically.

Computer networking can have both rewarding and trying moments. Although 
user manuals or classes are helpful in mastering the basics, it is usually 
best to have someone show you how networking is done and answer your 
questions. Contact your building or district technology staff, regional or 
state technology centers, or the public library. Local computer stores may 
provide some assistance or the name of a local computer user group. <p>
     <center><hr><FONT COLOR="333333"><b>

finding a connection is not an easy task. Some options are: <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Local bulletin board systems</b> allow users to ask questions, offer ideas, 
and receive feedback from other network users. Local systems are readily 
available, and a free connection can usually be arranged. Computer stores, 
the public library, education agencies, or computing centers at local 
colleges may provide information about bulletin boards in your area. <P>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>College and university computer systems</b> are usually available free or at 
low cost to students. These normally connect to a network that in turn 
provides access to the Internet. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Statewide and regional systems</b> offer opportunities for K-12 teachers and

<html><title>How Can I Be Involved in My Child's Education?</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="66333">   How Can I Be Involved in My Child's Education?<HR><p></CENTER></H3></FONT>
    
    Research studies consistently reveal that high student achievement
and self-esteem are closely related to positive parental participation
in education.  Parents and schools need to work together so all
children can succeed in school.
<P>Almost everyone agrees that parents are, after all, their children's
first and most important teachers.  You, as a parent, have
important knowledge about your child's likes, dislikes, needs, and
problems that the school may not be aware of.  You may also have
ideas for improving your child's school.  But even though studies
show that most parents want to be involved in their children's
education, they may not be exactly sure how to go about it,
especially if, like most parents, they work during the school day.<p>
Parents often ask the following questions:

<H3><FONT COLOR="66333">   What Can I Do To Involve Myself With My Child's School?
<HR><p></H3></FONT>
Some schools value parent involvement by providing numerous
opportunities for parents to interact with each other, with teachers,
and with students.  Your child's school can provide ideas on how
to participate.  One important way you can become involved in
your child's schooling is to exercise any choices available in the
selection of course work, programs, or even schools.  Many
schools are moving toward "school-based management," in which
administrators share the responsibility for operating schools with
teachers, students, parents, and community members.  You can
become involved in committees that govern your child's school or
join the local parent-teacher association.
<p>
The National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education
(NCPIE) says that schools should regularly communicate with
parents about their child's progress and the educational objectives
of the school.  This communication should also include non-
custodial parents, stepparents, and any other adults, such as
grandparents, who are responsible for the child.  If you aren't
receiving such information, ask for it.  Work with other parents
and guardians to be sure that the school understands how best to
keep you informed.
<p>
Some schools send newsletters and calendars home regularly,
alerting parents to school functions and ways they can participate. 
Encourage your school to provide volunteer opportunities for
working parents and to schedule some school events outside of the
school day to increase participation.
<p>
<FONT COLOR="66333"><H4>Here are other ideas:</H4></FONT>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Visit your child's classroom; a visit will give you an idea of
    what your child does at school and how he or she interacts with
    other children.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Volunteer to help in the classroom as an assistant (listening to
    children read, for example, or serving as an aide during
    computer work).<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Support student events and performances by helping with them
    (such as sewing costumes or painting scenery for a school play)
    and by attending them.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">If your school has a Parents' Room/Lounge or Parent Center,
    drop in to meet other parents and teachers there, or to pick up
    information and materials.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Participate in workshops that are offered, such as those on
    child development or concerns that parents have (or help plan
    such workshops).<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Take advantage of parent-teacher contracts (perhaps agreeing
    to read with your child for a certain amount of time each
    night).<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Ask your child's teacher if he or she has materials that you can
    use to help your child at home and to supplement homework.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Be part of decision-making committees about school issues and
    problems, such as a Parent Advisory Committee.<P>

How Can I Help My Child With Homework?</center><hr><P></center></h3></font>
Most teachers assign homework on a regular basis because practice
is needed before children fully understand new skills or concepts. 
Homework also increases the amount of learning time available
and allows students to do more in-depth learning.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="66333"><H4>    Here are some general guidelines for helping with
homework:</font></h4><P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Reward progress; use lots of praise; display good work.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Find out how much and what type of homework is assigned in
    each class, how students are expected to prepare it and turn it
    in, and what students can do when they don't understand
    something; help your child manage the workload by dividing it
    into small doses.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Help your child develop a homework schedule that he or she
can stick to.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Talk to your child each day about homework assignments; go
    over work; see if it's complete; ask questions about it.  But
    don't do your child's homework yourself.
<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Provide a suitable place for study (if possible, make it quiet
    and away from the distractions of TV, phone, and loud music).<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Avoid making homework a punishment.<P>    
<CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="66333"><P><HR>   How Can I Make Our Home a Good Place for My Child To
Learn?</center><hr><P></center></h3></font>


<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Have high expectations for your child's learning and behavior,
    both at home and at school.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Praise and encourage your child. <P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Emphasize effort and achievement, and be a role model for
    getting work done before play.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">   Establish rules and routines in the home.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Monitor television viewing.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Limit after-school jobs and activities.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Encourage your child to share information about school and
    respond with empathy.<P>  

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">If you don't do anything else, read to your young child or have
    him or her read to you every night.  Encourage older children
    to read by reading yourself and by having interesting and
    appropriate materials available.<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="66333"><P><HR>   
What Should I Do If My Child Isn't Doing Well in School?</center><hr><P></center></h3></font>


Contact your child's teacher.  Don't wait for the school to contact
you.  It's important to resolve problems as soon as possible when
they occur.  When parents work with teachers, they are often able
to improve a child's performance in school.  Children also get the
sense that education is really important when they see their parents
involved with their teachers and their school.  Parents feel a sense
of accomplishment, too, when they help their children succeed in
school.  Ask your child's teacher for specific activities you can do
at home with your child and help the teacher better understand
what works best with your child.  Make it clear that if the teacher
sees a problem developing, you want to hear about it immediately. 
Then, meet with your child's teacher frequently until the problem
is resolved.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="66333"><HR>   What If My Child Doesn't Like School?</center><hr><P></center></h3></font>

Using your unique knowledge of your child, try to find out why
he or she seems unhappy with school.  Observe and listen to your
child.  The problem may not lie with school itself, but with peers
or friends.  It may also be a family problem or an issue of self-
esteem.  Arrange for a conference with the teacher or school
counselor.  Work toward being able to discuss problems with your
child openly, and listen carefully to his or her views before you
offer any solutions.
<P>
Children whose parents are involved in their education have better
grades, a more positive attitude toward school, and more
appropriate school behavior than those with less involved parents. 
So don't underestimate what YOU, as a parent, can contribute to
your child's learning experiences, no matter how much education
you yourself have.  Getting involved in your child's education will
make a difference.

Children who are "gifted" demonstrate a high
performance capability in intellectual, creative,
or artistic areas, leadership ability, or specific
academic fields. This brochure discusses early
steps parents and their gifted children can take to
prepare for college and to ensure that the college
experience is positive. 
<center><p><hr><FONT COLOR="333333"><b>
What Characteristics of Gifted Students May Affect
College Planning? 
</center><hr><p></font></b>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
Multiple talents (sometimes called
multitalentedness or multipotentiality).</b> Gifted
students often have a wide variety of interests,
and they may miss opportunities by focusing too
early on one academic area. Encourage your child to
explore all of the possibilities for his or her
talents. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Idealistic thinking. </b>Gifted students often want
to find solutions to global problems and become
deeply invested in exploring ideas to their limits.
To sustain that interest, your child needs strong
academic support. In college, he or she will
benefit from stimulating courses that integrate
disciplines. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
Sensitivity to expectations. </b>Gifted children tend
to be very sensitive to the expectations of their
parents and teachers. To avoid creating feelings of
guilt or underachievement, be sure to give your
child options and a strong say in every
college-related decision that is made. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Isolation from other gifted students. </b>Many gifted
students are not challenged academically by their
peers in high school and enter college unprepared
for competition from other gifted students.
Emphasize that learning--not getting the highest
grades in the class--is what college is about. 
<center><p><hr><FONT COLOR="333333"><b>
When Should Gifted Children Begin Preparing for
College?
</center><hr><p></font></b>
By 7th or 8th grade, many gifted children have
departed from their schools' traditional
age-in-grade groupings. These students need a broad
range of academic options--such as advanced
placement courses--to supplement their high school
curriculum. This is a good time to begin thinking
about and preparing your child for the important
decisions he or she soon will face. 
<p>
Some gifted children are not prepared adequately
for college because counseling programs differ so
much from district to district. To better prepare
every gifted child, a program based on the
following sequence should begin early in
adolescence:

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Seventh and eighth grades:</b> Emphasis on
self-awareness, time management, work/study skills,
and career awareness. Students design a preliminary
academic plan that includes courses required by the
state and those required for college. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Ninth and tenth grades: </b>Emphasis on decision
making and goal setting. Students identify and
pursue their interests and learn how their academic
talents, values, and goals relate to possible
careers. Students begin to recognize that some
talents develop into vocational pursuits while
others develop into leisure activities.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Eleventh and twelfth grades: </b>Emphasis on the
practical aspects of college and career planning,
including the college application process, exposure
to occupations and job internships, and mentor
relationships. 
<center><p><hr><FONT COLOR="333333"><b>
How Can Gifted Children Explore Possible Career
Paths?
</center><hr><p></font></b>
Because they have such a broad range of interests
and abilities, some gifted students have difficulty
deciding on a career path. Most colleges, however,
expect students to decide on a course of study by
their third year. You can help by taking these
steps:

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Expose your child to a variety of work
environments.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Ask open-ended questions when your child mentions
careers and avoid statements that imply
expectations.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Urge your child to explore as many careers as
possible. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Encourage your child to volunteer in your
community.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Encourage your child to join high school
internship programs.
<center><p><hr><FONT COLOR="333333"><b>
How Can I Help My Gifted Child Find an Appropriate
College?
</center><hr><p></font></b>
Having the right kind of information about colleges
will help your child make the best decision about
where to go and what to study. Use the following
suggestions to guide your research:

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Start with information in the school guidance
office and library. Become familiar with college
guides, multimedia resources, and videotapes.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Obtain literature from your top 15 to 20 choices
and read it carefully. Organize important
information, such as the colleges' goals,
recruitment procedures, support for incoming
freshmen, location, size, cost, academic life,
course offerings, honors programs, faculty, grading
policies, selection of applicants, and availability
of financial aid. Narrow your list to 5 to 10
colleges.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Visit campuses and talk to admission personnel,
faculty, and students about academic and campus
life.

Students Prepare for College?

for any student, including those who are gifted.

<html></title>How Can I Improve My Child's Reading?</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="336633">How Can I Improve My Child's Reading?</center>  </h3></font><hr><p>


Parents are more concerned about their child's progress in reading than
in any other subject taught in school, and rightfully so.  In order for
students to achieve in math, science, English, history, geography, and
other subjects, reading skills must be developed to the point that most
of them are automatic.  Students cannot struggle with word recognition
when they should be reading quickly for comprehension of a text.
<p>
Since reading is so important to success in school, parents can and
should play a role in helping their children to become interested in
reading and in encouraging their growth in reading skills.  At the same
time, parents and teachers need to work together.  Many teachers are
now sending home practical ideas for parents to use with their
preschoolers.  As a result, young children are developing some of the
skills at home that will later help them in school.
<P> <hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">
What Can Parents Do To Help their Preschoolers in the Learning-To-
Read Process?</center></font><hr><p>


Research shows that children learn about reading before they enter
school.  In fact, they learn in the best manner-through observation. 
Young children, for example, see people around them reading
newspapers, books, maps, and signs.  Parents can do a lot to foster an
understanding of print by talking with their preschoolers about signs in
their environment and by letting their children know they enjoy reading
themselves.
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">

As I Read to My Preschooler, What Should I Do Specifically?
</center></font><hr><p>

Many parents recognize the value and enjoyment of reading to their
young children, but perhaps they are not clear about the specific skills
that could be enhanced through the process.  Most important, reading
should be an enjoyable experience.  Research reveals that when young
children experience warm and close contacts with their parents when
they are being read to, they develop more positive attitudes toward
reading.
<P>
Run your index finger under the line of print.  This procedure is simple
and helps children begin to notice words and that words have meaning. 
They also gain an awareness of the conventions of reading (e.g., one
reads from left to right and from the top of the page to the bottom;
sentences are made up of words; and some sentences extend beyond
a single line of print).
<p>
One of the greatest advantages of reading to preschoolers (or children
of any age) is the opportunity for vocabulary development.  Children
learn the meaning of words through good literature; words take on rich
meaning when used in an interesting story.
<P><hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">
What Can I Do for My School-Age Child Who Doesn't Like To Read?
</center></font><hr><p>
In the early elementary years, from first through third grades, children
continue learning how to read.  It is a complex process, difficult for some
and easy for others.  Care must be taken during these early years not
to overemphasize the learning-to-read process.  Reading for pleasure
and information develops reading interests and offers children the
opportunity to practice their reading skills in meaningful ways.  Parents
of elementary-age children should provide reading materials in the home
that arouse curiosity or extend their child's natural interest in the world
around them.
<p>
By encouraging and modeling leisure-time reading in the home, parents
take the most important step in fostering their child's reading
development.
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">
How Can Reading Research Information Be Useful to Me, As a Parent?
</center></font><hr><p>

Current research in reading reveals three important considerations for
parents and teachers:
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Children who read, and read widely, become better readers.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Reading and writing are complementary skills.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Parents are important to children both as role models and as
      supporters of their efforts.<p>
<hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">What Does Research Say About Ways Parents Can Help Their Children
With Reading?</center></font><hr><p>

The following suggestions have been beneficial to many parents:<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Provide a good role model-read yourself and read often to your
      child.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Provide varied reading material"some for reading enjoyment
      and some with information about hobbies and interests.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Encourage activities that require reading-for example, cooking
      (reading a recipe), constructing a kite (reading directions), or
      identifying an interesting bird's nest or a shell collected at the
      beach (using a reference book).<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Establish a reading time, even if it is only 10 minutes a day.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Write notes to your school-age child; encourage written
      responses.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Ask your child to bring a library book home to read to a younger
      sibling.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Establish one evening a week for reading (instead of television
      viewing).<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Encourage your child in all reading efforts.<p>
<hr><center><FONT COLOR="336633">

</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >

<CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="6699cc">How Can I Receive Financial Aid For College?</center></h3></font><hr><p>

<p>
  Too many students are denied their chance to go to college
simply because they can't afford the rising costs of higher
education. Unfortunately, many students and parents do not know
that more than $35 billion in financial aid is available each
year, or mistakenly assume they do not qualify. This brochure
suggests steps students and parents can take to secure the
financial help they need. <p><hr><b><CENTER><FONT COLOR="6699cc">
What Types of Aid Are Available? <hr><p></center></b></font><p>
<p>
Aid helps bridge the gap between what students and parents can
afford and what education actually costs. Usually, a combination
of grants, loans, and family funds are necessary to cover the
total cost of a college education. Some major types of financial
assistance are:
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
Grants and scholarships</b> - the best kinds of aid because they do
not have to be repaid. Sources include the federal government,
states, colleges, and private organizations. Most scholarships or
fellowships have conditions of qualification and fulfillment. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Work-study programs </b>- arranged by the school's financial aid
office to provide students with an opportunity to earn income and
gain experience. The award may be provided by private sources
through the school or be part of the Federal Work-Study program,
which encourages community service or work related to the
student's major studies. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Loans </b>- include most assistance that must be repaid by students
or their families. Federal loans are the most common source of
education loans and, with the exception of Stafford Loans, are
based on financial need. Federal loans frequently carry low
interest rates and attractive repayment conditions such as not
charging interest while students are in school. 
<p><hr><b><CENTER><FONT COLOR="6699cc">

How Do I Know if I Am Eligible for Financial Aid? 
<hr><p></center></b></font><p>

Most students qualify for some kind of financial assistance. In
general, you need to: 
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Demonstrate financial need (or merit for some scholarships).
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development
(GED) certificate.
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Be enrolled in an eligible degree or certificate program and be
making satisfactory progress.
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen.
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Have a valid Social Security number.

<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Register with the Selective Service, if applicable. 
<P>
Most financial aid is awarded for a specific period, usually a
semester or an academic year. Students and parents need to be
alert to the qualifications and deadlines for applying and
reapplying.
<p><hr><b><CENTER><FONT COLOR="6699cc">

How Can I Begin Searching for Financial Aid?
<hr><p></center></b></font><p>

Students and parents who plan to seek student financial aid
should keep the following tips in mind: 
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Learn about financial aid. </b>Students who understand the details
of financial aid and the application process reap the most
benefits. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Look into the total costs of each college you are
applying to. </b>  Once you know how much it will cost for tuition,
housing, food, books and supplies, travel, and personal expenses,
you will have a better idea of the financial aid you will need. 

<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Find out if you are eligible for merit-based aid.</b> Financial
awards are based on students' scores and grades as well as how
they spend their free time. Exemplary academic or extracurricular
performances increase your chances of qualifying for merit-based
financial aid. To make yourself eligible for these scholarships,
strive to excel in a variety of school activities and ensure that
your honors and awards are recorded in school files. 

<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Submit applications for aid in plenty of time.</b> Paying for your
education is often a family effort. When students begin working
on their applications, parents should organize their income,
asset, and tax records. Family need will be determined by a
federal formula that considers this information as well as
tuition and other costs. All applicants for federal aid must
complete a need analysis form and some colleges also require that
students submit some type of financial aid form. These forms
cannot be submitted before January 1 or after May 1, and it is
best to submit them as soon after January 1 as possible. The
sooner you apply, the better chance you have of being considered
for aid with early award dates. Always contact the financial aid
administrator at each school to verify specific deadline dates.

<h3><center><FONT COLOR="666600">How Can Parents Identify a High Quality Preschool Program? </h3>      </font>                    
</center><p><hr>
<center><b><FONT COLOR="666600">Choosing a Preschool Program</center></font></b><HR><p>
     
School readiness is the first of the National Education Goals and includes 
the objective that all children will have access to high-quality preschool 
programs to help prepare them for the next level of schooling. The Goals 
also acknowledge the value of parental participation in promoting the 
social, emotional, and academic growth of children. A vital role for 
parents lies in the careful selection of a preschool to ensure that the 
program gives your child the right start. 
  <p>   
Many different types of agencies around the country operate preschool 
programs in a variety of settings. Some programs are operated by local 
schools. Some, like Head Start and migrant programs, are sponsored by 
federal agencies, and others are run by nonprofit groups such as churches 
and charitable organizations. Some are provided by employers while others 
are owned by individuals or franchise chains. The quality of the preschool 
varies from program to program. 
     <p>
As a parent, you will want to assess how well a preschool program will 
satisfy your needs and preferences. When looking for a preschool, you can 
start by contacting a local child care resource and referral agency. 
     <p>
When you choose a preschool program, it is important to consider the 
characteristics of your child, the program, and the preschool staff; as 
well as the preschool's physical environment; and which combination of 
these factors would provide the best experience for your child. 
     <P><hr><center><b><FONT COLOR="666600">
Characteristics of the Child
</center></font></b><HR><p>
     
Some children are more comfortable in large groups and will do well in 
preschools that have large classes. However, if your child is 
uncomfortable in a crowd, look for a preschool that offers small classes 
or consider a family day care home arrangement. A child who is especially 
fond of vigorous physical activities and outdoor play may need a preschool 
that has good outdoor space and equipment and that emphasizes physical 
activities in its schedule. Since children's temperaments vary, each 
child's level of comfort in large or free-play activities should be 
considered when trying to meet his or her special needs. Whereas more 
active, outgoing children may react positively to situations where 
multiple activities are going on within one area, other children may feel 
more comfortable and safe when participating in more structured 
activities. 
 <p>    <hr><center><b><FONT COLOR="666600">
Characteristics of the Program
    </center></font></b><HR><p>
 
The directors of good programs usually encourage parents looking for a 
preschool to visit at any time with their children, but calling ahead for 
an appointment is a courtesy to the staff and will ensure that the 
director has time to talk with you. Parents should visit as many 
preschools as possible before making a choice. If you are making such a 
visit, give yourself time to get a feeling for the classroom's general 
atmosphere and the extent to which children appear comfortable and 
involved. A good educational and organizational climate is usually 
indicated by friendliness among the staff and children. 
     <p>
Children in a good preschool are usually not easily distracted by visitors 
and continue to be absorbed in their work or play. When children rush 
toward visitors and stay close to them, abandoning their activities, it 
very likely indicates that the activities do not stimulate or interest the 
children enough. 
     <p>
You can ask the following questions about the preschool: 
   <p>  
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Does the program have a clear written statement of its goals and 
philosophy? 
<p>

or her social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Does the preschool offer a balance of individual, small-group, and 
large-group activities; and spontaneous play and teacher-guided 
activities? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Is there a balance between rest and quiet periods and vigorous outdoor 
activities? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Do the preschool's activities encourage self-expression; help children 
to develop various motor skills; and regularly expose the children to 
literature, the language arts, music, science, and nature? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Do the staff encourage and respond to children's natural interests in 
reading, writing, and counting? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Does the preschool provide snacks and meals that are sufficiently 
nutritious? 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">

interests in the world around them?

Conclusion
   </center></font></b><HR><p>  
Most preschool programs must conform to state regulations and satisfy 
minimum standards of health and safety. Even so, it is a good idea to ask 
the staff whether the program is up to date with its state license and is 
accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young 
Children. Studies suggest that preschools are more likely to offer 
high-quality programs when the number of children is small enough to allow 
the staff to get to know all the children and their families. Whenever 
possible, it is helpful to speak to other parents who have children in the 
program about their experiences and recommendations.

<HTML><TITLE>How Can Parents Model Good Listening Skills?</TITLE><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="FF3300">   How Can Parents Model Good Listening Skills?</cENTER></h3><hr></font>

<h4><FONT COLOR="FF3300">   Listen Better, Learn More</h4></font>

In one of the Family Circus cartoon strips, the little girl looks up at her
father, who is reading the newspaper, and says:  "Daddy, you have to
listen to me with your eyes as well as your ears."  That statement says
almost all there is to say about listening, whether in our personal
conversations or in learning in school.
<p> <H4><FONT COLOR="FF3300">   

Do Listening Skills Affect Learning?<p></font></h4>
Listening is not a school subject like reading and writing.  Many of us
seem to feel it comes naturally and that as long as we can listen to
directions on how to find the restroom, nothing more needs to be said. 
The latest studies reveal that listening is a very large part of school
learning and is one of our primary means of interacting with other people
on a personal basis.  It is estimated that between 50 and 75 percent of
students' classroom time is spent listening to the teacher, to other
students, or to audio media.
 <p><hr><CENTER><FONT COLOR="FF3300">   
Can Parents Guide Their Children To Better Listening?</center><hr><P></font>

According to research on listening skills, being a good listener means
focusing attention on the message and reviewing the important
information.  Parents can model good listening behavior for their children
and advise them on ways to listen as an active learner, pick out
highlights of a conversation, and ask relevant questions.  Sometimes it
helps to "show" children that an active listener is one who looks the
speaker in the eye and is willing to turn the television off to make sure
that the listener is not distracted by outside interference.
<P>
 <H4><FONT COLOR="FF3300">   Guidelines For Modeling Good Listening Skills</h4></font><p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Be interested and attentive</b>.  Children can tell whether they have
      a parent's interest and attention by the way the parent replies or
      does not reply.  Forget about the telephone and other
      distractions.  Maintain eye contact to show that you really are
      with the child.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
 <b>Encourage talking.</b>  Some children need an invitation to start
      talking.  You might begin with, "Tell me about your day at
      school."  Children are more likely to share their ideas and
      feelings when others think them important.
<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>   Listen patiently</b>.  People think faster than they speak.  With
      limited vocabulary and experience in talking, children often take
      longer than adults to find the right word.  Listen as though you
      have plenty of time.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>    Hear children out</b>.  Avoid cutting children off before they have
      finished speaking.  It is easy to form an opinion or reject
      children's views before they finish what they have to say.  It may
      be difficult to listen respectfully and not correct misconceptions,
      but respect their right to have and express their opinions.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Listen to nonverbal messages.</B>  Many messages children send
      are communicated nonverbally by their tone of voice, their facial
      expressions, their energy level, their posture, or changes in their
      behavior patterns.  You can often tell more from the way a child
      says something than from what is said.  When a child comes in
      obviously upset, be sure to find a quiet time then or sometime
      that day to help explore those feelings.<p>
<p><center><hr> <FONT COLOR="FF3300">   Suggestions For Improving Communication With Children</font></center><hr><p>


<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Be interested.</b>  Ask about children's ideas and opinions regularly. 
      If you show your children that you are really interested in what
      they think, what they feel, and what their opinions are, they will
      become comfortable about expressing their thoughts to you.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Avoid dead-end questions.  </b>Ask children the kinds of questions
      that will extend interaction rather than cut it off.  Questions that
      require a yes or no or right answer lead a conversation to a
      dead end.  Questions that ask children to describe, explain, or
      share ideas extend the conversation.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>     Extend conversation.</B>  Try to pick up a piece of your child's
      conversation.  Respond to his or her statements by asking a
      question that restates or uses some of the same words your
      child used.  When you use children's own phrasing or terms, you
      strengthen their confidence in their conversational and verbal
      skills and reassure them that their ideas are being listened to
      and valued.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Share your thoughts.</b>Share what you are thinking with your
      child.  For instance, if you are puzzling over how to rearrange
      your furniture, get your child involved with questions such as,
      "I'm not sure where to put this shelf.  Where do you think would
      be a good place?"<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Observe signs.</b>  Watch the child for signs that it is time to end
      a conversation.  When a child begins to stare into space, give
      silly responses, or ask you to repeat several of your comments,
      it is probably time to stop the exchange.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Reflect feelings. </b> One of the most rtant skills good listeners
      have is the ability to put themselves in the shoes of others or
      empathize with the speaker by attempting to understand his or
      her thoughts and feelings.  As a parent, try to mirror your
      children's feelings by repeating them.  You might reflect a child's
      feelings by commenting, "It sounds as if you're angry at your
      math teacher."  Restating or rephrasing what children have said
      is useful when they are experiencing powerful emotions that they
      may not be fully aware of.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Help clarify and relate experiences. </b> As you listen, try to make
      your child's feelings clear by stating them in your own words. 
      Your wider vocabulary can help children express themselves as
      accurately and clearly as possible and give them a deeper
      understanding of words and inner thoughts.<P>
<center><HR> <FONT COLOR="FF3300">   
Why Are Parents Important In Building Children's Communication Skills?<hr><p></font></center>
Parents play an essential role in building children's communication skills
because children spend more time with their parents than with any other
adult.  Children also have a deeper involvement with their parents than
with any other adult, and the family as a unit has lifelong contact with its
members.  Parents control many of the contacts a child has with society
as well as society's contacts with the child.  
<P>
Adults, parents, and teachers set a powerful example of good or poor
communication.  Communication skills are influenced by the examples
children see and hear.  Parents and teachers who listen to their children
with interest, attention, and patience set a good example.  The greatest
audience children can have is an adult who is important to them and
interested in them.

<center><hr><FONT COLOR="663366">Drug Prevention Is a Shared Responsibility</center></font><hr><P>

In the 1980s, there was a steady decline in the use
of alcohol and other drugs among 12- to
17-year-olds. After a decade of significant
progress, however, a recent survey indicates that
this downward trend has leveled off for some drugs,
leaving the rate of alcohol and some other drug use
in the United States still high. 
<p>
The reasons for drug use are varied. Children may
use drugs to satisfy their curiosity, conform to
peer pressure, relieve anxiety, or have an
adventure. But, whatever tempts them, we must teach
children to reject drugs because drug use is
illegal, harmful to their health, and interferes
with academic and social 
development.
<p>
Drug information programs, while important, cannot
stand alone as a deterrent to drug use. Current
literature has focused on a "holistic" approach to
preventing drug use. A holistic approach emphasizes
a prevention strategy that takes into account the
wide range of forces that affect children's lives.
Parents, as the prime nurturers of their children's
development, play a prominent role in preventing
drug use. Schools, communities, social service
organizations, religious groups, law enforcement 
agencies, the media, and local businesses also play
vital roles.
<p>
<hr><center><FONT COLOR="663366">How Can Parents Help Prevent Their Children From
Using Drugs?</center><hr><p></font>

Parents have many opportunities to foster healthy,
drug-free lifestyles in their children, playing a
dominant role in their children's emotional and
interpersonal development from infancy. Children
are taught ethical values and responsibility
through what social scientists call "modeling" or
demonstrating acceptable behaviors for children to
follow. Parents who have responsible habits and
attitudes regarding drug use send a healthy message
and strongly influence their children's ideas about
alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Parents are
models for their children, and even the use of
legal drugs may send the wrong signal.
<p>
A basic reality is that children will have to make
their way in a world that is filled with
opportunities to use drugs, but parents can prepare
their children to make positive choices.  High
self-esteem sometimes helps children resist peer
pressure to use drugs, but not always. Research is
unclear about the relationship between self-esteem
and drug use. However, all children need
opportunities to practice decision-making and to
become aware of the consequences of bad decisions.
Parents need to provide clear, factual information
about drugs and their effects. They also need to
supervise their children appropriately. For
example, parents should know their children's
friends and be aware of what their children are
doing. They also need to ensure that there is
proper supervision of after-school and weekend
activities and that all parties are chaperoned by
responsible adults.

<hr><center><FONT COLOR="663366">	How Can Schools Help Prevent Children From Using
Drugs?
</center><hr><p></font>
Schools can add a crucial component to the drug
prevention efforts of parents by incorporating
prevention strategies within the context of health,
science, and family life curricula. Schools also
provide an organized peer group setting in which
children can develop communication and
decision-making skills.
<P>
Schools need to have a clear no-use drug policy.
Some schools require students and parents to sign a
form agreeing that all drug-related offenses will
be referred to the police and that students who use
drugs, including alcohol, will be required to
obtain counseling.
<P>
For schools to respond effectively and complement
the activities of the family, the entire community
must be involved. When community members are asked
to provide input into the school's strategy to
combat drug abuse, they can make valuable
contributions to the effort and, in turn, add
legitimacy to the school's drug prevention program.
<P>
Student Assistance Programs (SAPs) have proven to
be quite successful in combating drug use in many
schools. SAPs involve teams of students, teachers,
administrators, parents, and counselors trained to
recognize causes and symptoms of substance abuse
and provide or recommend appropriate intervention.
Within a SAP, school professionals are able to
refer students confidentially to a "core" or
"impact" team that follows up to determine whether
intervention or further referral is required. These
programs can be tailored to meet the needs of a
particular community.
<P>
In their classroom practice, teachers can exert
significant influence on the beliefs, attitudes,
and opinions of their students and complement other
drug prevention activities. For example, teachers
can hone the problem-solving and decision-making
skills of students by incorporating drug prevention
strategies into daily lesson plans that are geared
toward the social and intellectual needs of their
students. In middle school, for instance, peer
pressure can be intense. Middle school teachers may
use role playing to help small groups of students
practice ways to resist peer pressure to use
alcohol and other drugs.
<P>
The use of "peer leaders" has been successful both
in and out of school. Peer leaders receive special
training to help them develop strong communication
and problem-solving skills. They may lead
discussion groups to give other students a forum to
voice their questions and concerns. The peer leader
strategy provides positive role models for other
students and strengthens the self-esteem of the
peer leaders.<P>

Conclusion</center><hr><p></font>

Parents play an important role in educating their
children about drugs, but they cannot do it alone.
Other groups that strongly influence children
include schools, clubs, and teams. Schools can
increase children's awareness of the negative
effects of drugs and equip them with skills to
resist drug and alcohol use. When parents and
schools work together within the context of the
larger community, they gain the consensus that will
strengthen drug prevention efforts.<P><hr><center><FONT COLOR="663366">

<BODY><CENTER><B>How Can We Help Children Learn Geography</B></CENTER>
<HR><P> 
</P>
<P>A recent survey revealed that one in five Americans between the ages of 18
and 24 could not locate the United States on an outline map of the world.  What
explains this lack of geographic knowledge?  In the United States, geography is
not considered a basic academic course.  Geography content in the middle grades
(5-8) is often integrated into a world history or social studies course, and
only one student in seven takes a high school geography course. </P>
<P> Although courses in geography are indeed crucial to geographic
understanding, students will derive true knowledge of world geography only if
parents and teachers place emphasis on geographic themes through application
activities on a day-to-day basis.  Maps, globes, and atlases should be daily
resources to answer questions about location, regions, climates, movement of
people, and the relationship between places and the characteristics of the
people that live there.  A solid foundation in geography should begin with
preschoolers; five- year-olds can construct three-dimensional maps of the
classroom to begin to understand symbolic representation and spatial
relationships.</P>
<HR><CENTER><b>  What Should Children Learn About Geography? </b></center><HR><P></P> Children should
know the locations of places and peoples.  They should understand why
communities are located in particular places, how people have shaped them, and
how they have affected people's lives.  They also should be able to use their
knowledge of geography to solve problems and make decisions in daily life. <p><P>

Geographers and geography educators across the United States have developed five
fundamental themes to help children learn geography.  These themes have been
endorsed by the Association of American Geographers, the National Council for
Geographic Education, and the National Geographic Society and have been widely
adopted in schools to teach geography.  Each theme is listed and described below
in conjunction with a question to help parents and teachers focus children's
thinking geographically.<P>

Knowledge of Geography?<hr></B></CENTER> <p> If youngsters are to acquire an appreciation of the
physical world in which they live and ultimately learn to think geographically,
schools must restore geography as a prominent course in the curriculum.  Schools
can take the following steps to ensure that students become competent in their
knowledge of the world around them:<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">             Increase coverage of geography at
every grade level of the school        curriculum.  Children cannot achieve
geographic literacy unless they        have ample exposure to the subject.<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  Teach geography as a separate school subject.  In addition, encourage       
teachers to infuse the five geographic themes into other school        subjects,
such as history, economics, and earth science. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">            Add depth to studies of
this subject.  Avoid mentioning many        geographic facts while investigating
few in depth.  <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Use multiple sources and media of instruction, such as
video        programs, primary documents, computer software, wall maps and      
 charts, globes and atlases, and periodicals with numerous pictures and       
maps.  Avoid reliance on standard textbooks. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Emphasize active learning by
applying knowledge to investigate real        geographic problems. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Use
the local community as a resource for examples of the five        geographic
themes.  Involve children in hands-on investigations of        nearby places
such as farms or parks.  <HR><CENTER><B>What Can Be Done At Home?</B><HR></CENTER><P>  Parents can enhance their
child's knowledge of geography by advocating its emphasis in the school
curriculum, but learning should not be restricted to the classroom.  Parents can
do many things to stir their children's curiosity and make geography fun to
learn.  Games, maps, and other activities are informal and easy ways to
encourage geographic awareness and lay a solid foundation.  <p><p>As your child's
first teacher, you can have an ongoing impact on your child's knowledge of
geography by monitoring and reinforcing lessons presented at school.  You can
reinforce school learning by doing the following things at home:  <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Read
stories from or about other countries and books that describe        journeys. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
     Make different ethnic foods or take your child to ethnic restaurants. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    
 Give children an opportunity to travel by car, bus, bicycle, or on foot.       
 If available, try other forms of transportation, such as planes, trains,       
subways, ferries, or horse-drawn carriages. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Teach your child positional
words (above, below) and directions        (north, south, east, west) and use
these words in your daily        conversations. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Use the library to
discover how other cultures celebrate holidays.         Discuss customs, dress,
and food. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Invite friends or neighbors who are from different countries or
who        have traveled or lived abroad to talk with your child about their    
   experiences. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Use maps and encourage your child to make his or her own
maps. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Encourage family viewing of television programs with geographic    
   content and participate with children in post-program discussions of       
geographic themes and issues. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Use pictures from books and magazines to
help your child associate        words such as <I>desert</I>, <I>volcano</I>, and <I>rain forest</i>
with visual images. <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">      Seek opportunities to examine and discuss geographic
themes with        your child as you encounter them in daily activities in your
home and        neighborhood.  <p><p>The above recommendations are firmly rooted in
studies that reveal geography concepts should be taught through concrete
activities, begun early, and applied to everyday experiences.  Schools certainly
have a role to play in developing geographic understanding, but the home is an
ideal setting for applying what is learned in practical ways so children will
realize the importance of geography in their lives.<P>  <hr><B><CENTER>Sources</b><HR></CENTER><p>  Most of the

<center><h3>How Can We Help Children Learn To Be Responsible Citizens?</h3></center>
<p>


Responsibilities of citizenship are obligations to contribute to the

common good by performing duties to benefit the community, such as

becoming informed about public policies, voting in public elections,

serving on a juries, and obeying the laws.

<p>

Surveys of civic knowledge, attitudes, and actions reveal serious

deficiencies in the citizenship education of young Americans.  Reports

on civic learning by the National Assessment of Educational Progress

(NAEP) indicate that the majority of 12th-graders have a rudimentary

knowledge of government and citizenship in the United States. 

However, half the students in grade 12 fail to demonstrate knowledge

needed for responsible participation in the political system.  A disturbing

finding was that high school students did "significantly less well" in civics

in the most recent assessment (1988) than their 1982 counterparts.

<HR><CENTER><b>

What Do Young Americans Need To Learn About Responsible

Citizenship?</b></CENTER><hR>

<P>

Our forebearers fought for the rights that Americans enjoy today.  To

preserve our civil rights, young Americans need to realize the part they

must play: preserving civil rights and liberties is linked to performed

responsibilities.  For example, the right of political participation means

little when most citizens fail to exercise it.  Furthermore, the right to free

expression of political ideas is diminished when individuals do not gain

knowledge about government.  Fulfilling responsibilities, such as

voluntary service to the community, participating in the political system,

acquiring knowledge about civic life, and demonstrating a public

commitment to the values of constitutional democracy (for example,

liberty, justice, and the rule of law) are essential to the health of a free

society.
<P>


Most students acknowledge the importance of voting and campaigning

in public elections, but they also tend to express low levels of political

interest and fail to see that their political actions make a difference.  The

percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds voting in public elections lags far

behind the rate for those over age 25, which also tends to be much

lower than desired by advocates of responsible citizenship.
<P>


Young Americans clearly need to become more attuned to their

responsibilities as citizens of a democratic society.  Parents and

teachers must act in concert to strengthen the desire and capacity of

children to fulfill civic obligations.
<P><HR><B><CENTER>




What Can Parents Do?</B></CENTER>
<HR><P>

Parents are children's first and most influential teachers of civic values

and attitudes.  Lessons learned at home about political participation or

community service are likely to set the tone for later learning about

citizenship responsibilities.

<P>

Parents can help their children learn more about citizenship by:<BR>

<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>Setting a good example.  Participate in the political system and

      volunteer for community service projects.  Invite your child to

      join you.</DL><BR>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>Showing interest in civic affairs and government by initiating

What Can Schools Do?
<HR></b><P></center>

The school also has a major effect on the civic attitudes of children. 

School is the primary agency for teaching about politics and government. 

Schools can enhance education about citizenship responsibilities through

the following activities:
<P>


<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>Increasing the amount of time all students are involved in civic

      education at all levels of school.</dl>

<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>Infusing lessons about the responsibilities of citizenship into all

      subjects in all grades, with special emphasis in social studies

      and literature courses.</DL>

<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>     Requiring students to read, analyze, and discuss cases and

      stories about people involved in the civic life of their

      communities in the past and present.</DL>

<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>     Establishing cooperative learning experiences in which groups

      of students take responsibility for achieving educational

      objectives.</DL>

<title>How Can We Help Make Schools Safe for Children?</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="3300ff">How Can We Help Make Schools Safe for Children?</center></h3></font><p>

The primary cause of anxiety for many parents today is protecting
their children from acts of violence at school. In general, parents
and school officials are concerned about preventing children from
becoming either aggressors or victims. This brochure discusses what
steps parents and school administrators can take to make schools
safer.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">
What Is Being Done To Ensure My Child's Safety in School?
<hr><p></center></font>
Despite the extraordinary media coverage of and public concern over
violence in our schools, students are safer there than in any other
place except their homes. Still, school officials recognize the
potential threats to the safety of children attending school and
school-related activities. Many are seeking ways to help school
personnel control the school environment more effectively and to be
more visible and available to students who need better guidance. In
some districts, for example, drivers of school vehicles must
complete rigorous training in managing student behavior as well as
operating their vehicles safely. In addition, more school districts
are requiring routine drug screening for vehicle operators and are
training school personnel in crisis management and violence
intervention. Other violence-reduction strategies include: 
<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Teaching prevention skills</b>. Students are being taught mediation
skills (problem solving and communication) and ways to handle their
emotions--especially anger--without hurting others. These skills
will help them avoid potentially dangerous situations. Students are
also being taught "safe" behaviors such as doing activities in
groups, alerting school personnel if a stranger is on school
grounds, and reporting situations that threaten other students'
safety. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Providing alternatives to gangs.</b> School districts and communities
are working together to offer students alternatives to gang
membership, including activities that build self-esteem and help
students deal with feelings of powerlessness. Strategies include
providing special assistance to students who are at risk of gang
membership, creating an atmosphere that fosters a sense of
belonging in all students, informing parents and school staff about
gangs and teaching students how to avoid being drawn into them, and
giving students regular opportunities to discuss school experiences
and to plan for future successes and rewards. 

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Improving school designs</b>. As school buildings are constructed and
old ones are renovated, safety has become an essential element of
their design. In new schools, office areas are now centrally
located for easy accessibility from other locations in the building
or campus. Hallways have convenient exits and are well lit. Deadend
hallways and staircase hideaways have been eliminated, and
restrooms are located closer to administrators to prevent students
from hanging out.
 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Monitoring visitors carefully</b>. Schools are becoming more
assertive in screening visitors, requiring them to register when
entering the building or campus and by employing security
personnel. Schools can be both secure and friendly by requesting
visitors to check in rather than report to the office. Registered
visitors are given a pass or badge to display prominently to let
staff and students know that they have been acknowledged by the
administration. Staff and students are instructed to report people
without proper identification to a school administrator. In
addition, many schools now ask that parents give the names of
adults who are allowed to pick up a child, and require those
individuals to show identification to school personnel when signing
a student out. 
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">

How Can I Help My Child Practice Safe Behavior? 
<hr><p></center></font>

Parents can teach their children safe behaviors before enrolling
them in school. Children who know the appropriate action to take in
a given situation are less likely to expose themselves to danger.
Safe behaviors to teach your child are:   

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Not talking to strangers</b>. This warning is more important today
than ever before. Encourage your children to get to know school
staff other than their teachers and get acquainted with them
yourself. Familiarity helps children recognize adults who don't
belong as well as adults who can offer help when needed. As a plus,
children will also learn that the school staff are their friends
and more than just rule enforcers.

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Taking safety in numbers</b>. Encourage your children to stay close
to friends and to walk in groups in school hallways. Suggest that
they limit their restroom visits to recess and breaks and use
facilities located in high-traffic areas or in areas more likely to
be visited by staff. 

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Choosing friends carefully</b>. Encourage your children to avoid
students who do not handle anger effectively. Ask your children to
be particularly careful with classmates who bring weapons to school
and to report any such incidents to their teachers.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">

How Can I Help Ensure Safety In My Child's School?
<hr><p></center></font>

As a parent, make it your responsibility to become as active in
your child's school as your schedule permits. Here are some
strategies you can use:

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Visit frequently, being sure to register with administrative
personnel when you arrive. Volunteer to help in your child's
classroom or elsewhere in the school as often as you can and
encourage other parents to visit and volunteer. The more parents
are involved and visible, the safer their children's schools will
be. 

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Become a member of the school's Parent-Teacher Association (PTA)
or other parent-teacher organization. By attending meetings and
participating in its committees and activities, you'll become
acquainted with other parents and with school personnel. 

 <p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Get to know your child's friends and their families. Productive
friendships and a sense of common purpose among students, teachers,
and neighbors make schools and neighborhoods safer.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">
Where Can I Find More Information About School Safety?
<hr><p></center></font>
In general, school personnel are excellent sources of information
and suggestions. You can also contact your state and national PTA
offices, local or state departments of education, or local public
or school district libraries for publications outlining school
safety practices, legislation, and helpful hints for creating a
safer school environment. The following organizations can also
assist you in locating more information:

<html><title>How Can We Provide Safe Playgrounds?</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
<h3><B><FONT COLOR="996699">   <Center>How Can We Provide Safe Playgrounds?</b></center></h3><hr></font>
<p>Outdoor playgrounds can be exciting places where
children explore their environment while developing
motor and social skills; however, they also can
pose serious safety hazards. With the exception of
those in California, no mandatory state or federal 
standards currently exist regarding the manufacture
or installation of playground equipment or
surfaces. However, the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) has established a voluntary
industry standard for public playground safety (F
1487-93), and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) has established voluntary
guidelines. This brochure discusses common
playground hazards and recommends actions that
parents and others can take to increase playground
safety.
<p>
<hr><B><FONT COLOR="996699">   <Center>What Makes a Playground Unsafe?
</b></center></font><hr><p>
Each year hospital emergency rooms treat an
estimated 200,000 children who have been injured in
playground accidents. About 60 percent of these
injuries are caused by children falling from
playground equipment onto a hard and unyielding
surface such as asphalt, concrete, or even the
ground. Most playground injuries are caused by
preventable hazards. These hazards include:
<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Inadequate fall zones under and spaces between
playground equipment. </b>The area under and around
equipment should be covered with a minimum of 12
inches of protective, resilient surfacing material
(such as wood chips, mulch, or rubber), extending a
minimum of 6 feet in all directions. Fall zones
around swings should extend twice the height of the
swing hanger in front of and behind the swings.
Swings should not be attached to play systems.
There should be a minimum of 12 feet between play
structures.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Absence of guard rails. </b>Elevated surfaces such as
platforms, ramps, and bridgeways should have guard
rails to prevent accidental falls.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Dangerous protrusions and entanglements.</b> Objects
such as nails, screws, bolts, pipe ends, and sharp
or pointed hardware can impale or cut children.
Hooks or parts that catch strings and clothing can
cause strangulation. Open S hooks allow swing seats
to slip off their chains and can cause children to
fall.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Hazardous entrapment areas.</b> Openings between
posts, ladder rungs, deck levels, or entryways are
fine for foot-first entry, but they can also entrap
children's heads. Ideally, openings on playground
equipment should measure less than 3 inches or more
than 9 inches. <p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Dangerous swing seats.</b> Hard wood or metal swing
seats can hit children passing too closely to or
jumping off a swing. Heavy animal-type swings are
particularly dangerous because they act as
battering rams; bumpers attached to these swings do
not reduce the risk of injury. <p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Other dangerous playground equipment.</b> Equipment
such as suspension bridges, merry-go-rounds,
swinging gates, and seesaws (teeter-totters) may
have moving parts that can pinch or crush
children's fingers or other body parts.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>
Age-inappropriate equipment. </b>It is important to
ensure that playground equipment is appropriate to
the age group using it. For example, equipment for
children in preschool should have guard rails on
elevated surfaces higher than 20 inches, and it
should be separated from equipment for school-age
children. Small children may not have the
coordination and balance to climb on equipment
designed for older children.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Inadequate supervision or lack of supervision. </b>It
is estimated that more than 40 percent of
playground injuries are directly related to lack of
proper supervision. Most children are unable to
foresee danger. Parents and school staff need to be
alert to potential hazards.<p>
<hr><B><FONT COLOR="996699">   <Center>
How Can You Help Children Play Safely? </b></font></center><hr><p>


Proper supervision is essential to safe play.
Parents and teachers should ensure that children
observe the following rules:<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Wear shoes, such as sneakers, that do not slide
on wet surfaces. However, check for footwear rules
at indoor play areas. <p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Do not play on slippery or wet equipment or force
body parts through small spaces.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Do not play on hot metal surfaces, such as
slides, that may cause third-degree burns.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Do not cross in front or behind moving swings. <p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Get off a seesaw only when your partner's feet
are on the ground. <p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Do not push or pull others while playing on
climbing equipment.<p>

     <center><h3><FONT COLOR="339933">How Can We Strengthen Children's Self-Esteem?</font></center></h3><hr>
<center><FONT COLOR="339933">Self-Esteem Is Important in a Child's Development</center></font><hr><p>
     
Most parents want their young children to have a healthy sense of 
self-esteem. That desire can also be seen in education--schools around the 
country include self-esteem among their goals. Many observers believe that 
low self-esteem lies at the bottom of many of society's problems. 
     <P>
Even though self-esteem has been studied for more than 100 years, 
specialists and educators continue to debate its precise nature and 
development. Nevertheless, they generally agree that parents and other 
adults who are important to children play a major role in laying a solid 
foundation for a child's development. 
 <p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="339933">    
What Is Self-Esteem?<hr><p></center></font> 
     
When parents and teachers of young children talk about the need for good 
self-esteem, they usually mean that children should have "good feelings" 
about themselves. With young children, self-esteem refers to the extent to 
which they expect to be accepted and valued by the adults and peers who 
are important to them. 
     <p>
Children with a healthy sense of self-esteem feel that the important 
adults in their lives accept them, care about them, and would go out of 
their way to ensure that they are safe and well. They feel that those 
adults would be upset if anything happened to them and would miss them if 
they were separated. Children with low self-esteem, on the other hand, 
feel that the important adults and peers in their lives do not accept 
them, do not care about them very much, and would not go out of their way 
to ensure their safety and well-being. 
     <p>
During their early years, young children's self-esteem is based largely on 
their perceptions of how the important adults in their lives judge them. 
The extent to which children believe they have the characteristics valued 
by the important adults and peers in their lives figures greatly in the 
development of self-esteem. For example, in families and communities that 
value athletic ability highly, children who excel in athletics are likely 
to have a high level of self-esteem, whereas children who are less 
athletic or who are criticized as being physically inept or clumsy are 
likely to suffer from low self-esteem. 
     <p>
Families, communities, and ethnic and cultural groups vary in the criteria 
on which self-esteem is based. For example, some groups may emphasize 
physical appearance, and some may evaluate boys and girls differently. 
Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination are also factors that may 
contribute to low self-esteem among children. 
     <p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="339933">    
How Can We Help Children Develop a Healthy Sense of Self-Esteem? 
     <hr><p></center></font> 
The foundations of self-esteem are laid early in life when infants develop 
attachments with the adults who are responsible for them. When adults 
readily respond to their cries and smiles, babies learn to feel loved and 
valued. Children come to feel loved and accepted by being loved and 
accepted by people they look up to. As young children learn to trust their 
parents and others who care for them to satisfy their basic needs, they 
gradually feel wanted, valued, and loved. 
   <p>  
Self-esteem is also related to children's feelings of belonging to a group 
and being able to adequately function in their group. When toddlers become 
preschoolers, for example, they are expected to control their impulses and 
adopt the rules of the family and community in which they are growing. 
Successfully adjusting to these groups helps to strengthen feelings of 
belonging to them. 
     <P>
One point to make is that young children are unlikely to have their 
self-esteem strengthened from excessive praise or flattery. On the 
contrary, it may raise some doubts in children; many children can see 
through flattery and may even dismiss an adult who heaps on praise as a 
poor source of support--one who is not very believable. 
     <P>
The following points may be helpful in strengthening and supporting a 
healthy sense of self-esteem in your child: <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>As they grow, children become increasingly sensitive to the evaluations 
of their peers</b>. You and your child's teachers can help your child learn to 
build healthy relationships with his or her peers. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>When children develop stronger ties with their peers in school or around 
the neighborhood, they may begin to evaluate themselves differently from 
the way they were taught at home</b>. You can help your child by being clear 
about your own values and keeping the lines of communication open about 
experiences outside the home. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Children do not acquire self-esteem at once nor do they always feel good 
about themselves in every situation</b>. A child may feel self-confident and 
accepted at home but not around the neighborhood or in a preschool class. 
Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in 
school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment 
and feel different the next. You can help in these instances by reassuring 
your child that you support and accept him or her even while others do 
not. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>A child's sense of self-worth is more likely to deepen when adults 
respond to the child's interests and efforts with appreciation rather than 
just praise</b>. For example, if your child shows interest in something you 
are doing, you might include the child in the activity. Or if the child 
shows interest in an animal in the garden, you might help the child find 
more information about it. In this way, you respond positively to your 
child's interest by treating it seriously. Flattery and praise, on the 
contrary, distract children from the topics they are interested in. 
Children may develop a habit of showing interest in a topic just to 
receive flattery. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Young children are more likely to benefit from tasks and activities that 
offer a real challenge than from those that are merely frivolous or fun. </b>
For example, you can involve your child in chores around the house, such 
as preparing meals or caring for pets, that stretch his or her abilities 
and give your child a sense of accomplishment. <p>
     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>Self-esteem is most likely to be fostered when children are esteemed by 
the adults who are important to them</b>. To esteem children means to treat 
them respectfully, ask their views and opinions, take their views and 
opinions seriously, and give them meaningful and realistic feedback. 
<p>     
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<b>You can help your child develop and maintain healthy self-esteem by 
helping him or her cope with defeats, rather than emphasizing constant 
successes and triumphs</b>. During times of disappointment or crisis, your 
child's weakened self-esteem can be strengthened when you let the child 
know that your love and support remain unchanged. When the crisis has 
passed, you can help your child reflect on what went wrong. The next time 
a crisis occurs, your child can use the knowledge gained from overcoming 
past difficulties to help cope with a new crisis. A child's sense of 
self-worth and self-confidence is not likely to deepen when adults deny 
that life has its ups and downs.

Conclusion
         <hr><p></center></font> 
 
Parents can play an important role in strengthening children's self-esteem 
by treating them respectfully, taking their views and opinions seriously, 
and expressing appreciation to them. Above all, parents must keep in mind 
that self-esteem is an important part of every child's development.

How Do I Know If My Child's Teacher Is Qualified?<hr><p></h3></center></font>
If we search our memories when asked to think of a person
who made a difference in our lives, the individual we
remember will, most likely, be a teacher.  Teachers
frequently are remembered as caring and empathetic, as
enthusiastic, positive individuals with a love for learning, as
experts in their subject area, and as believers in the worth
of all students and their ability to succeed.  The qualities
we remember are personality traits teachers need if they
are to help children learn.<P><hr>
 <CENTER><FONT COLOR="333333"> <b>  

What Other Traits Should Teachers Possess?
<hr><p></center></font></b>
Elementary school teachers should have a mastery of
mathematics, science, literature, grammar, writing, spelling,
history, geography, art, and music.  Furthermore, the
effective teacher should know how to teach each of these
subjects to every child.  Teachers need to understand child
development, the importance of motivation, and the role of
reading in the mastery of learning.
<p>
Secondary school teachers should have in-depth knowledge
of the subjects they teach, as well as the ability to transfer
that knowledge to students with diverse needs and
interests.  The ability to motivate students is of prime
importance and requires an understanding of adolescent
psychology and learning theory.
<p>
These skills should be taught in teacher preparation courses
or alternative route programs.
<p>
Qualified teachers also have the ability to identify children
with emotional problems so they can be referred to
someone for help  and to enlighten children about the
hazards of drugs, smoking, AIDS, and sex.  The qualified
teacher should also have the ability to communicate with
parents, work effectively with school administrators, and
accomplish school goals.
<p>
Equipping one individual with all these skills is a 
difficult task.
<p><hr>
 <CENTER><FONT COLOR="333333"> <b>
How Are Colleges of Education Preparing Quality Teachers?

Some of My Child's Teachers Were Certified To Teach
Through An Alternative Certification Program.  Are They
Qualified To Teach? 
<hr><p></center></font></b>

Research shows that teachers certified through an
alternative program are as competent and effective as
teachers certified through traditional education preparation
programs.  A growing number of states and school districts
are using nontraditional means to recruit and certify
teachers.  Presently, 29 states have established some form
of alternative certification to revitalize the teaching
profession.   Universities and public school systems support
these nontraditional means by sponsoring training programs
designed to attract people to the teaching profession who
have demonstrated skills outside of education, especially in
critical-need areas.
<P>
Nearly all alternative certification programs require
candidates to:<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Have at least a bachelor's degree;
<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Show competence in their subject area by passing a
      state or nationally sponsored test;
<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Take professional education courses prior to actually
      taking charge of a classroom; and
<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Work with an experienced teacher who serves as a
      mentor.
<p>
In some states, an individual who has obtained a bachelor's
degree (preferably in a liberal arts area) and wishes to teach
is required to take only those teacher preparation courses
required by the state.  This route is generally not shortage-
driven and requires some professional preparation and an
internship.  In most cases, individuals must pass
appropriate tests, such as the National Teacher's Exam.  
In some states, this route is called a 5th-year program and
may enable an individual to meet requirements for both a
master's degree and a teaching certificate.  In many states,
continuing certification requires that teachers take
additional courses as part of their professional development.

<html><title>How Important Is Homework?</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
<center><h3><FONT COLOR="66333"><b>How Important Is Homework?<hr><P></center></h3></b></font>

Assigning homework serves various educational
needs.  It serves as an intellectual
discipline, establishes study habits, eases
time constraints on the amount of curricular
material that can be covered in class, and
supplements and reinforces work done in
school.  In addition, it fosters student
initiative, independence, and responsibility
and brings home and school closer together. 
<P><hr><center><b>
What Is Homework?<hr><p></center></b>
Homework is defined as out-of-class tasks
assigned to students as an extension or
elaboration of classroom work.  There are
three types of homework:  practice,
preparation, and extension.
<p>
Practice assignments reinforce newly acquired
skills.  For example, students who have just
learned a new method of solving a mathematical
problem should be given sample problems to
complete on their own.  Preparation
assignments help students get ready for
activities that will occur in the classroom. 
Students may, for example, be required to do
background research on a topic to be discussed
later in class.  Extension assignments are
frequently long-term continuing projects that
parallel classwork.  Students must apply
previous learning to complete these
assignments, which include science fair
projects and term papers.
<P><hr><center><b>
Why Is Homework Important?<hr><p></center></b>
Research in the last decade has begun to focus
on the relationship between homework and
student achievement and has greatly
strengthened the case for homework.  Although
there are mixed findings about whether
homework actually increases students' academic
achievement, many teachers and parents agree
that homework develops students' initiative
and responsibility and fulfills the
expectations of students, parents, and the
public.  Studies generally have found homework
assignments to be most helpful if they are
carefully planned by the teachers and have
direct meaning to students.
<p>
<P><hr><center><b>How Can Parents Get Involved?<hr><P></center></b>

How Much Time Should My Child Spend on
Homework?<hr></center><p></B>

According to some researchers, two ways to
increase students' opportunities to learn are
to increase the amount of time that students
have to learn and to expand the amount of
content they receive.  Homework assignments
may foster both these goals.  Reforms in 
education have called for increased homework,
and as a result, reports show that students
are completing considerably more homework than
they did a decade ago.
<p>
According to statements by the National PTA
and the National Education Association (NEA),
the following amounts of homework are
recommended:<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    From kindergarten to third grade, no more
     than 20 minutes per day.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">     From fourth to sixth grade, 20 to 40
     minutes per day.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    From seventh to twelfth grade, the
     recommended amount of time varies
     according to the type and number of
     subjects a student is taking.  In
     general, college-bound students receive
     lengthier and more involved homework than
     students preparing to enter the workforce
     immediately after graduation.<P><hr><center><b>

Why Should Parents Be Concerned About a School
Homework Policy?
<Hr><P></center></b>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    Lack of an established homework policy
     may place either insufficient or
     unrealistic demands on your child. 
     Students may not be expected to work to
     capacity; alternatively, they may receive
     too many assignments from different
     teachers on the same evening.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    Schools with homework policies tend to
     set guidelines for teachers to correct,
     grade, and return homework systematically
     to their students, thus reinforcing
     learning.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    Schools with homework policies generally
     provide specific guidelines regarding
     what is expected from parents.<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">    Schools with homework policies tend to
     carefully design and provide homework
     assignments appropriate to each grade
     level.<P>

Students may not always view homework as a
pleasant experience, but if the assignment
serves a good purpose and parents reinforce
the completion of the tasks, students will
benefit by gaining higher grades, better study
habits, and a more positive attitude toward
school and learning.  Homework assignments
give parents insight into the school
curriculum and offer a greater opportunity for
student learning to occur.

<center><h3>        How To Choose a Community College</center></h3>
<P>
In fall 1993, nearly 6 million students were enrolled in one of
the nation's 1,440 2-year colleges. This enrollment figure is an
increase of approximately 600,000 students over the 1991
enrollment, and community college enrollments are expected to
continue to increase. Why are more and more students choosing
community colleges? What are the advantages of attending
community colleges? What should students consider when
deciding whether to attend a community college?  
<p>
Advantages of Attending Community Colleges
Students attend community colleges for various reasons. Some
choose community colleges because tuition and fees are lower
than at 4-year colleges and universities. The estimated average
cost of tuition and fees at public 2-year colleges nationwide for
the 1993-1994 school year was $1,099 compared to an estimated
average of $2,365 at 4-year colleges.
<p>Students are likely to mention the following advantages of
attending community colleges:<br>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  I like the extra attention I get from the instructors at my
   community college. They are readily available to students
   and seem to care that we do well.</dl> 
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  I need to be able to work to support my family.  I take
   classes at the community college in the morning and go to
   work from there.</DL><BR>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  The money I'm saving by living at home and going to my
   local community college will help pay for my junior and
   senior years at the state university.</DL><BR>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  My community college is helping me get the skills I need to
   qualify for enrollment in the nursing program. In addition to
   the basic skills courses I'm taking in English and science, I
   also receive special one-on-one attention at the Learning
   Resource Center.</DL><BR>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>    I wasn't sure what program I wanted to pursue. A counselor
   at my community college helped me assess my abilities,
   interests, and educational options. With my counselor, I've
   put together a program in computer graphics I'm really
   happy with.</DL><BR>
<P><HR><B><CENTER>

Common Paths of the Community College Student
</b></center><hr><P>
<center><h5>One: Preparing for Transfer to the University</h5></center>

For many students, the community college experience is the first
of several steps in their education after high school. If you think
you might want to continue your education at a 4-year college or
university, you need to plan ahead. You don't want to repeat
courses at a 4-year college if you have already taken them at
your community college. Many community colleges have
articulation agreements with 4-year colleges and universities to
accept courses for transfer credit. Transfer credit means the
courses you took at the community college are recognized as
equivalent to the same courses offered by the 4-year college you
want to attend. Under articulation agreements, you receive full
credit for your community college course work. However, not
all courses offered at your local community college may be
transferable to every 4-year college or university. Contact your
community college guidance and counseling office to find out
which 4-year colleges and universities will accept your
community college course work for transfer credit. 
<p>
<center><h5>Two: Preparing for the World of Work</h5></center>
If you are interested in finding employment after you finish your
courses at the community college, you have the following
options:  
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  You can earn the community college associate in science
   (A.S.) degree or associate in applied science (A.A.S.)
   degree, which usually requires specialized courses (in fields
   such as business, health occupations, and trade and industry
   education) as well as several required general education
   courses (in English, mathematics, and humanities). A.S. or
   A.A.S. degrees require 2 years of study at the community
   college. </DL><BR>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  You can enroll in certificate programs that provide intensive
   training in a specialized field, such as computer-assisted
   drafting, food service technology, or paralegal studies. Many
   A.S. or A.A.S. programs at community colleges have
   certificate options for students who want to take courses in a
   specialized area of study but who don't want to spend the
   time necessary to earn the 2-year A.S. or A.A.S. degree. </dl>
<DL><img src="dot.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10 HSPACE=15>  You can earn an associate of science degree in a specialized
   occupational or technical area of study with the intention of
   transferring to a 4-year university and pursuing further study
   in your specialized field rather than going directly to work.
   Two-year and 4-year colleges often have arrangements so
   their programs are complementary and build upon each other.
   Check with the guidance and counseling department at your
   local community college to learn about arrangements like this
   in your specialized field of study.</DL><BR>
<p><h5><center>
Three: Gaining Job Skills and Personal Fulfillment<p></h5></center>
You don't have to enroll in a specific program at your local
community college. You have the option of simply taking
courses in subjects that interest you. Check with your local
community college for a list of credit and noncredit courses to
see what is offered.
<p><h5><center>
Four: Preparing for College-Level Academics<p></h5></center>

For students who want to pursue college course work but who
lack the basic reading, writing, mathematics, or science skills
necessary to take the courses, the community college offers
developmental education classes as well as learning resource
centers that can provide special one-on-one tutoring. The
learning resource centers have specially trained staff and can
provide assistance on both an individual and small-group basis.
Contact either your counseling office or the learning resources
center at your college to find out what special services are
available to help you attain your education goals. 
<p><HR><center><b>Steps To Take in Choosing a Community College<hr></center></b>
So, how do you choose a community college?  Who will give
you the information you need to make a solid choice?  The
following steps should send you well on your way:
<ol><li> Request a catalog from your local community colleges
   describing the courses and programs they offer. Also ask for
   a "schedule of courses" for the current term.
<li> Once you've reviewed the course schedule and catalog,
   schedule an appointment with a college counselor. Ask the
   counselor how to go about finding the right program for you.
   What type of career guidance can he or she provide? 
<li> Once you identify a program that interests you, ask the
   counselor if the college offers that program. If not, are there
   any colleges nearby that offer it?  Remember, not all colleges
   offer the same programs. Also, if you need to work while
   you are attending school, check to see what time of day the
   courses you need are offered. Is it possible to arrange your
   work schedule to fit your class schedule?  How long will it
   take you to complete the courses you need, given projected
   class schedules over the next few semesters or years?
<li> Find out how much it costs to complete the program that
   interests you. Ask the college counselor if any financial aid is
   available to you that might help defray the costs of attending
   college. Don't forget to ask about any special financial aid
   that might be available to help with child care, transportation,
   or other costs you may incur in pursuing your education.
   Also, check to see if the college has work-study programs or
   actually provides child care or special transportation to
   campus. 
<li> Once you have decided on the courses you wish to take, you
   are ready to enroll.  Ask the admissions office for an
   application. 
</ul>
Community colleges offer students many chances to maximize
their options. Faculty and staff are dedicated to making sure
students achieve their education goals. Even after you graduate
from a community college or if you leave a program without
finishing, you can still choose to return to the college for
additional study. The commitment to openness is one reason
community college enrollments continue to grow.

<head><title>What Do Parents Need To Know About Children's Television Viewing?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >

<center><h3><b>What Do Parents Need To Know About Children's Television Viewing? </b></center></h3><hr>


Children in the United States watch an average of 3 to 5 hours of
television every day.  Parents and teachers are concerned about the
possible effects of excessive television viewing on children.
<p>
There is reason for such concern.  Studies show that extensive
television viewing may be associated with violent or overly aggressive
behavior, poor academic performance, precocious sexuality, obesity, and
the use of drugs or alcohol.
<p><hr><center><b>
How Can Excessive Television Viewing Affect Children's Learning and
School Performance?
</center><hr><P></b>
Research on the effects of television viewing on children reveals a
number of possible problems.
<P>
<i>TV affects social and emotional behavior</i>
<p>
Studies on television viewing reveal that the amount of violence on
television is increasing.  Viewing violent programs can make children
afraid, worried, or suspicious and may increase tendencies toward
aggressive behavior.  Parents should keep in mind that television often
portrays sexual behavior and the use of alcohol, cigarettes,  or drugs in
inviting terms.
<P>
<i>TV affects creativity and language skills</i>
<P>
Children who spend a great deal of time watching television have less
time for playing, reading, doing homework, and talking with other
children and adults.  Language skills are best fostered through reading
and active two-way participation in conversations and play activities.  
Excessive TV watching can interfere with growth in these areas.
<P>
<i>TV affects school achievement</i>
<P>
Research has found that the amount of time  a child spends on
homework is significantly related to how well he or she does in school. 
Since television viewing can interfere with the completion of homework
assignments and reduce the amount of sleep a child gets, excessive
viewing could affect your child's grades and alertness in school.
<P><hr><center><b>
How Can Parents Guide Their Children's Television Viewing?
<hr><P></center></b>
Television viewing can have positive effects, if parents and teachers:
<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Set limits.</b>  Know how many hours of television your children
      watch.  Limit your children's viewing to 1 to 2 hours a day. 
      Watching television is often more habit than choice.  Establish
      good viewing habits for your children.  Suggest and participate
      with your children in alternative activities such as reading,
      sports, conversation, games, and hobbies.   Because children
      model their behavior after their parents, consider your own
      viewing habits:  set a good example.Eliminate some television viewing by setting a few basic rules,
      such as no television during meals, or before completing
      household tasks or homework.

<P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Plan.</b>  Encourage your children to plan their viewing by using a
      <i>TV Guide</i> or newspaper listing rather than flipping channels. 
      Help the children decide which show to see and encourage them
      to watch a variety of programs appropriate for their level of
      understanding.  The television should be turned on only for
      specific programs; it should be turned off when they are over.
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Participate.</b>  Know what your children watch on television. 
      Watch with them and talk about the programs afterward. 
      Explain situations that are confusing.  Ask why any violent
      scenes occurred and how painful they were.  Ask your child for
      ideas about ways the conflict could have been resolved without
      violence.
<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Monitor.</b>Encourage children to watch programs about characters who
      cooperate and care for each other.  Such programs can

 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   What Does School Reform Mean to My Neighborhood School?</center></h3></font>


    Many schools in the United States are in the process of 
education reform. Changes in school policy are being considered 
as economic, social, and technological forces make new demands 
on what students need to know to be successful. This brochure
explains some of the major aspects of education reform and offers
parents guidelines for personal involvement. Parent participation
is an important part of successful education reform--a process 
that will affect both parent and child.
<CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   <p><hr>
    What Is School Reform?
</center></font><hr><p>
School reform is a catch phrase that includes a number of
programs and policies. Reforms usually change some procedure or
rule that affects how the school operates. Terms like "reform" and
"renewal" can be thought of as small steps toward change.
Compared with school restructuring, reform and renewal do not
greatly alter the school's organization.
<P>
There are two distinct types of school reform. The first is related
to the school's subject matter and teaching methods. This type of
reform affects what and how the student is taught in the classroom.
Using computers in the classroom, concept-based mathematics
programs, whole-language instruction, the back-to-basics approach,
and areas stressing multicultural influences on history and
literature are some of the more common reforms. Many
professional organizations are involved in this type of reform. The
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, for example, is
developing curriculum guides that describe what students should
know and be able to do. They are also exploring new ways to
teach and test students. Progress in these areas is influencing
reform on the state and local levels. 
<p>
The second type of reform is related to school administration and
governance procedures. This type of reform affects how schools
are managed and what roles teachers and administrators play. The
more popular changes in this area include site-based decision
making (administrative decisions made at the school level as
opposed to the school board or legislative levels), shared
leadership (involving more staff in school leadership roles), and
community involvement programs.
<p>
Education reform may be started by powers from outside or inside
the school. For example, a perceived need to compete in a
changing world economy--an outside force--has led school
policymakers to reconsider what is taught in the classroom. In
contrast, the move toward flexible school schedules in the late
1960s and early 1970s was a reform that came from inside the
school.
<CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   <p><hr>
     Why Are Schools in the Process of Reform?
</center></font><hr><p>

School reform is nothing new. The school system has undergone
numerous changes in policy and procedure in the past two
centuries. Although the basic structure of education has changed
very little, reforms have had an influence on the direction of
education in America. For example, in the past 100 years, schools
have seen the introduction of the lesson plan, learning objectives,
and student goal setting.
<p>
Today, many school reforms are driven by the idea that U.S.
students need to be more competitive. To retain this country's
international leadership, our schools must prepare all students to
be productive in the world marketplace. University officials
believe many applicants are lacking the skills and competencies
needed to succeed in a tough program of study. In a highly
competitive world economy, business leaders are concerned about
the future of our workforce. Educators think we expect too little
from our children. Basic skills are no longer enough. Students
need not only to have a good understanding of the core academic
subjects, they must also be able to solve problems, make decisions,
and be prepared for responsible citizenship and productive
employment in our nation's modern economy. 
<p>
At the national level, Congress recently passed the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act to reform schools by establishing high
academic and occupational standards and providing support to
states and communities to help students reach those standards. The
Act sets into law the original six National Education Goals, which
address school readiness, school completion, student academic
achievement, leadership in mathematics and science, adult literacy,
and safe and drug-free schools and adds two new goals--one
related to parent participation and the other to professional
development of teachers. Additionally, it will establish a grants
program to create parent information and resource centers that will
assist parents in becoming more involved in their child's
education.
<CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   <p><hr>
     How Will School Reform Affect My Child's Education?
</center></font><hr><p>

How reforms will affect your child will depend on the type of
changes that are made. If reform is related to the subject areas,
your child may be introduced to new content, materials, and ways
of learning. These changes may be made as a result of a particular
education goal or objective. If the reform is related to the
administrative process, your child may not notice any change at
all. Such changes may affect only administrative decision making
or the school-community relationship. 
<CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   <p><hr>
    How Can I Get Involved?
</center></font><hr><p>
The best way to get involved in school reform is to create good
relationships with teachers and principals. The connection between
school and home may be the most important pathway to successful
and cooperative school reform. Just as important is that parents
understand changes being discussed or carried out. The following
suggestions may help parents become better informed and more
involved in the school reform process:

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Ask questions. Don't be intimidated by the school reform
    process. It should include you. A good question to ask your
    school is, "How can I help?"

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Make sure you understand the terms being used. Parents
    need to fully understand the changes schools are considering.
    Ask teachers and administrators to explain any reforms that
    don't seem clear to you.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Take advantage of open meetings. Discussion about school
    reform is often conducted in meetings open to parents and the
    community. Many times teachers and administrators ask for
    ideas from the general public during meetings, parent visits, or
    conferences. Don't hesitate to participate. Your opinion is
    valuable.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Ask for a clear outline of school reform goals and
    objectives. The school that takes reform seriously will be able
    to give parents a clear outline of the what administrators and
    teachers expect to achieve by making proposed changes.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Keep track of the steps your school is taking toward making
    changes. Changes in education may take some time to
    understand and carry out, but parents should keep track of this
    process. Your ideas at each stage of the change are important
    for all involved.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Join community parent support, advocacy, or assistance
    groups. Make sure the changes being discussed include the
    concerns you have for your child's education. Help your
    child's school make decisions about reform by becoming part
    of the process of school reform; for example, volunteer to
    serve in the PTA, Advisory Councils, Chapter 1 programs, or
    other committees or school groups.

<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
Keep students informed and make them part of the process.
    Remember, school reforms aim to make education better for
    students. This means students should be part of the process.
    Help them understand how and why changes are being made.
<CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6600">   <p><hr>
    Conclusion
</center></font><hr><p>
The process of school reform should not frighten or discourage
parents. You can become a partner with the school to help make
changes that will benefit your child. This doesn't mean schools
have all the answers or that school reforms are always successful.
However, the most beneficial reform is the result of people
working together to make positive educational change. The only
way those changes can be successful is if parents become part of
the process.

What Is a Quality Preschool Program?</CENTER></H3></FONT><p>

Increased numbers of working mothers of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds have
created a need for preschools for today's young children and are
concerned about the quality of these preschools.  As a result, parents
are searching for guidelines for selecting a good program for their
children, who may require care for 8 or more hours a day.  Questions
often raised by parents are:
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="0099CC">   
How Do I, as a Parent, Select a Preschool Program?<hr></center></font><p>

First of all, trust your intuitions.  If you feel a specific program is not right
for your preschooler, it may not be.  However, here are some basic
program components to look for when you visit a school or day care
center:<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
 Teachers are questioning individual children, encouraging them
      to expand their thinking and problem-solving skills.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Children are intellectually engaged, eager, and happy; children
      are not bored, tense, or unhappy.  Look at their faces.<p>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Children are working on individual or collaborative projects;
      children are not all doing the same project in the same way.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> Children have physical space to experiment and play, and time
      to be alone; they are not crowded into a confined or restrictive
      area for long periods of time.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Children are creating their own writing or dictating their own
      stories to the teacher; children are not copying or completing a
      worksheet out of a book.<p>
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="0099CC">   
Should I Send My Child To an Academic Preschool?
<hr></center></font><p>

Many early childhood programs in the last decade have reflected a
concentration on basic academic skills-or the proverbial three R's.  The
major reason for this academic thrust has been the perceived need to
prepare 3- and 4-year-olds for the future demands of kindergarten and
first grade.  Early childhood literature has characterized this
phenomenon as the "push-down effect."
<p>
However, preschool programs are in fact changing.  In the last 2 to 3
years (1988-1991), there have been signs of a movement away from the
academic, push-down effect to more play-oriented programs.  This shift
from a strong academic focus to more child-initiated activities has the
endorsement of professionals in the early childhood education field, who
advocate holistic programs for young children.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="0099CC">   

What Has Caused This Shift in Preschool Programs?<hr></center></font><p>

The early childhood profession is speaking out and being heard.  Since
the issuance of two professional statements-one by the National
Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) in a 1988 publication,
Right From the Start, and the other by the National Association for the
Education of Young Children (NAEYC), in the 1987 Developmentally
Appropriate Practices in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children
from Birth Through Age Eight-there has been a renewed interest in and
emphasis on the development of the whole child.   Activities initiated by
children themselves are central to these program goals.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="0099CC">   

What Are Child-Initiated Activities?
<hr></center></font><p>

Child-initiated activities offer a wide range of opportunities for children
to directly experience and manipulate new ideas and objects.  The
following are examples of child-initiated goals:<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Choice making</b>-The curriculum offers children the opportunity to
      choose from a variety of activities throughout the day.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><B>Creating</B>-Activities encourage children to create their own ideas
      for art projects, block constructions, or dance improvisations.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Interacting</b>-Talking with other children and adults fosters a child's
      sense of self and self-esteem.  Through conversation, children
      learn new words and learn to cooperate.  Thus, language skills
      and a positive self-image are encouraged through conversation.<P>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Playing</b>-Creative play materials encourage children to question,
      experiment, and pretend.  A housekeeping area, block area, or
      pretend grocery store provide children "real experiences" to
      develop vocabulary and gain an understanding of the world
      around them.<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Discovering</b>-Real experiences provide children with opportunities
      to exercise their curiosity and discuss events that are relevant
      to their everyday lives.  Visiting grocery stores, farms, and
      hospitals; preparing snacks; and talking to police officers,
      firefighters, and janitors contribute to a child's understanding of
      the real world.  The world can also be discovered through good
      books.  Reading books daily to children is an essential part of a
      quality program.
<P><HR> <CENTER><FONT COLOR="0099CC">   
What Is the Role of the Preschool Teacher?
<hr></center></font><p>

Studies have consistently found that it is the teacher who makes a
difference in whether children profit from preschool activities.  It is the
teacher who plans the activities, listens and talks to children, and
encourages growth in the child's intellectual and social development. 
Thus, the lead teacher in a preschool program should have training in
early childhood education or child development. 
<p>
An effective preschool program reflects a variety of activities:  free-
choice activities and small group times; quiet periods and active times;
short activities and a few longer ones to increase the child's attention
span (e.g., listening to an interesting story); and careful planning to
develop the child socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually.

<html><title>What Should Be Learned in Kindergarten?</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
 <CENTER><H3><FONT COLOR="3300ff">   What Should Be Learned in Kindergarten?</center></font></h3><hr>

Most American children attend kindergarten, and many
participate in all-day kindergarten programs. While recent
reform efforts have focused on extending the kindergarten day,
research suggests that how kindergartners spend their time may
be more critical than the amount of time children spend in
class. In other words, longer kindergarten days in unsuitable
activities yield no educational advantages over the traditional
half-day kindergarten program.  
<p>
 <HR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">   What Are Appropriate Teaching and Curriculum Approaches
for Kindergartners?<hr><p></center></font>

Early childhood and kindergarten specialists have long
emphasized the central role of play in young children's
learning. In the course of day-to-day experience with young
children, it is easy for teachers to see that spontaneous play is a
natural way of learning; observations of children's play reveal
that play provides a wide range and real depth of learning in all
domains of development: physical, emotional, social, and
intellectual.   
<p>
However, it is just as natural for young children to learn
through spontaneous investigation (close observation,
experimentation, and inquiry) as through spontaneous play.
Many observers have noted that young children are natural
scientists and anthropologists. They devote substantial portions
of their seemingly endless energy to learning all aspects of the
culture they are born into: they learn its language, stories,
music, and literature; they investigate with all their senses and
emerging skills what people mean, when things are appropriate
and when they are not, where things come from, what they are
for, how they are made, and how adults and peers respond to
them. They try to make sense of common objects by prying
into them, taking them apart, and manipulating them in a
variety of ways. Appropriate curriculum and teaching methods
include activities and encouragement for kindergartners in these
quests and feature the importance of individual children's
feelings and emotions in group settings.  <p>
 <HR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="3300ff">
The Kindergarten Curriculum  <hr><p></center></font>

The developmental characteristics of children of kindergarten
age call for a curriculum that involves a variety and balance of
activities that can be provided in the context of project work
(Katz and Chard, 1989). For example, kindergarten children
can undertake projects in which they investigate a real event or
object.  In the course  of such projects, the children will
strengthen emerging literacy and numeracy skills and their
speaking and listening skills and acquire new words as they
share their findings with others.    
<p>
A good curriculum provides activities that include:   <p>

children's time in kindergarten is the provision of meaningful
teaching and learning activities.  The wide range of physical,
social, and intellectual characteristics represented in a group 
of contemporary beginning kindergartners makes an informal,
flexible approach to the kindergarten curriculum necessary.

<htmL><title>What Should Parents Know About Performance Assessment?</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" >
<center><FONT COLOR="999966"><h3>What Should Parents Know About Performance Assessment?</center></h3></font><p>
Performance assessment is one alternative to traditional methods
of  testing student achievement. While traditional testing
requires students  to answer questions correctly (often on a
multiple-choice test),  performance assessment requires students
to demonstrate knowledge and  skills, including the process by
which they solve problems. Performance  assessments measure
skills such as the ability to integrate knowledge  across
disciplines, contribute to the work of a group, and develop a
plan  of action when confronted with a new situation.
Performance assessments  are also appropriate for determining if
students are achieving the higher  standards set by states for
all students. This brochure explains features  of this
assessment alternative, suggests ways to evaluate it, and offers 
exploratory questions you might ask your child's teacher about
this  subject. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="999966"><b>
What Are Performance Assessments?</center></font></b><hr><p>

The Office of Technology Assessment of the U.S. Congress
describes  performance assessment <i>as testing that requires a
student to create an  answer or a product that demonstrates his
or her knowledge or skills</i>.  Examples of performance assessments
include: <p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b> Group projects </b>enabling a number of students to work together
on a  complex problem that requires planning, research, internal
discussion, and  group presentation. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Essays </b>assessing students' understanding of a subject through
a written  description, analysis, explanation, or summary. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Experiments</b> testing how well students understand scientific
concepts and  can carry out scientific processes. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Demonstrations</b> giving students opportunities to show their
mastery of  subject-area content and procedures. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"><b>Portfolios</b> allowing students to provide a broad portrait of
their  performance through files that contain collections of
students' work,  assembled over time. 
<p>
One key feature of all performance assessments is that they
require  students to be active participants. They also focus
attention on how  students arrive at their answers and require
students to demonstrate the  knowledge or skills needed to
obtain a correct answer. To illustrate, if  high school juniors
are asked to demonstrate their understanding of  interest rates
by shopping for a used-car loan (i.e., comparing the  interest
rates of banks and other lending agencies and identifying the 
best deal), a teacher can easily see if the students understand
the  concept of interest, know how it is calculated, and are
able to perform  mathematical operations accurately. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="999966"><b>

What Are the Advantages of Assessing My Child This Way?</center></font></b><hr><p>


Instruction in most subject areas is being altered to include
more  practical applications of skills and to incorporate a
greater focus on the  understanding and combining of content and
skills. 
<p>
Performance assessments closely tied to this new way of teaching
provide  teachers with more information about the learning needs
of their students  and enable them to modify their methods to
meet these needs. They also  allow students to assess their own
progress and, therefore, be more  responsible for their
education. 
<P>
Advocates of performance assessment believe these tests will
prompt  educators and school officials to identify the skills
and knowledge they  want their students to acquire and to focus
on teaching students this  information. It also provides
educators with information about what  students have learned,
not just how well they can learn. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="999966"><b>

What Are the Disadvantages of Assessing My Child This Way?</center></font></b><hr><p>

Performance assessments usually include fewer questions and call
for a  greater degree of subjective judgement than traditional
testing methods.  Since there are no clear right and wrong
answers, teachers have to decide  how to grade and what
distinguishes an average performance from an  excellent one.
This potential disadvantage can be avoided if teachers set  up
an evaluation rubric (rating scale with several categories) that 
clearly defines the characteristics of poor, average, and
excellent  performances so teachers can score them in a
consistent manner.       
<p>
Critics argue that performance assessments will not improve
schooling and  could be harmful. The following concerns have
been expressed about  performance-based assessments: teachers
might teach only to the test,  thereby narrowing the curriculum
and reducing the test's value. When using  performance
assessments such as portfolios, teachers and other individuals 
who are grading the work may differ greatly in their
evaluations. Students  may be unintentionally penalized for such
things as having a disability,  being from a certain cultural
background, or attending classes at a school  with limited
resources. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="999966"><b>
How Can I Evaluate Performance Assessments? 
</center></font></b><hr><p>

Parents who wish to evaluate the effectiveness of performance
assessments  should ask the following questions: 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Does the performance assessment cover important skills and
knowledge?       
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Are the test items varied to fairly test students having
different  experiences, backgrounds, and motivations? 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Does the assessment give my child worthwhile educational
experiences?       
<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Does the assessment require my child to use higher level
thinking and  problem-solving skills rather than simply
memorizing to determine the  answer? 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Are teachers receiving training and assistance in designing
and using  performance assessments? 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">How are assessment results going to be used? Are teachers
using the  results to evaluate their student's performance in
their own classrooms  and then tailoring instruction in areas of
weakness? Or are the results  being compared to those in other
classrooms and schools and for evaluating  the teacher or
school? If assessments are going to be used as  accountability
measures, reliability (the degree to which a test can be 
depended on to produce consistent results repeatedly), and
validity (the  extent to which a test accurately measures the
result that it is intended  to measure), become critically
important. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="999966"><b>

How Can I Help My Child Do Well on Performance Assessments?      
</center></font></b><hr><p>

Students who are accustomed to traditional testing will need to
be  carefully prepared for these new approaches to assessment.
Parents can  help their children in the following ways: 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Ask the teacher to explain the types of performance assessment
to be  used so that you can answer your child's questions and
help him or her  decide how to prepare for the assessment. 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Request that the school give a presentation on performance
assessment  for parents. 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">When you talk with your child about what he or she is learning
in  school, ask questions that encourage problemsolving or
creativity.  Help  your child see that learning is a process and
demonstrate how it is  applied to real-life situations. 

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Ask your child if he or she understands what will be expected
on the  assessment. If you notice confusion or anxiety,
encourage him or her to  ask the teacher for help.

<center><h3><FONT COLOR="CC6600"> What Should Parents Know About Standardized Testing in Schools?</center></h3></font><hr><p>

<p>



One tool that schools use to learn about students is the

standardized test.  This brochure explains basic features of 

these tests and suggests questions you might ask your child's 

teacher about testing.  Understanding the role of testing will 

help you to enable your child to succeed in school and to 

develop a better relationship between your family and your 

child's school.<p><hr>

<center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">

What Are Standardized Tests?</center></font><hr><p>



Usually created by commercial test publishers, standardized tests

are designed to give a common measure of students' performance. 

Because large numbers of students throughout the country take the

same test, they give educators a common yardstick or ``standard''

of measure.  Educators use these standardized tests to tell how

well school programs are succeeding or to give themselves a

picture of the skills and abilities of today's students.

<p>

Some popular tests include the California Achievement Tests 

(the CAT), the Stanford Achievement Test, the Iowa Test of Basic

Skills (the ITBS), and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale.

<p>

<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">Why Do Schools Use Standardized Tests?</center></font><hr><p>



Standardized tests can help teachers and administrators make

decisions regarding the instructional program.  They help schools

measure how students in a given class, school, or school system

perform in relation to other students who take the same test. 

Using the results from these tests, teachers and administrators 

can evaluate the school system, a school program, or a 

particular student.

<p>

<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">How Do Schools Use Standardized Tests?</center></font><hr><p>



Different types of standardized tests have different purposes. 

Standardized<i> achievement</i> tests measure how much students have

already learned about a school subject.  The results from these

tests can help teachers develop programs that suit students'

achievement levels in each subject area, such as reading, math,

language skills, spelling, or science.

<p>

Standardized <i>aptitude</i> tests measure students' abilities to learn 

in school-how well they are likely to do in future school work. 

Instead of measuring knowledge of subjects taught in school, 

these tests measure a broad range of abilities or skills that are 

considered important to success in school.  They can measure 

verbal ability, mechanical ability, creativity, clerical ability, 

or abstract reasoning.  The results from aptitude tests help 

teachers to plan instruction that is appropriate for the 

students' levels.  Educators most commonly use achievement and 

aptitude tests to

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Certify student achievement (for example, award high

       school diplomas or promote students from grade to grade).<p>



<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">Can Standardized Tests Alone Determine My Child's Placement in

the Classroom?</center></font><hr><p>



No.  Paper-and-pencil tests give teachers only part of the 

picture of your child's strengths and weaknesses.  Teachers 

combine the results of many methods to gain insights into the 

skills, abilities, and knowledge of your child.  These methods 

include:

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Observing students in the classroom;<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Evaluating their day-to-day classwork;<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Grading their homework assignments;<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Meeting with their parents; and<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Keeping close track of how students change or grow

       throughout the year.<p>



Standardized tests have limitations.  These tests are not 

perfect measures of what individual students can or cannot do 

or of everything students learn.  Also, your child's scores on a

particular test may vary from day to day, depending on whether

your child guesses, receives clear directions, follows the 

directions carefully, takes the test seriously, and is 

comfortable in taking the test.

<p>

<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">How Can I Help My Child Do Well On Tests?</center></font><hr><p>



Here are a few suggestions for parents who want to help their

children do well on tests.

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">First and most important, talk to your child's teacher 

       often to monitor your child's progress and find out what

       activities you can do at home to help your child.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Make sure your child does his or her homework.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Make sure your child is well-rested and eats a well-

       rounded diet.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Have a variety of books and magazines at home to

       encourage your child's curiosity.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Don't be overly anxious about test scores, but encourage

       your child to take tests seriously.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Don't judge your child on the basis of a simple 

       test score.<p>



<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">What Should I Ask My Child's Teacher?</center></font><hr><p>



       Before the test . . .

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Which tests will be administered during the school year 

       and for what purposes?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">How will the teacher or the school use the results of 

       the test?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">What other means of evaluation will the teacher or the

       school use to measure your child's performance?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Should your child practice taking tests?<p>



After the test . . .

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">How do students in your child's school compare with

       students in other school systems in your state and across

       the country?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">What do the test results mean about your child's skills 

       and abilities?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Are the test results consistent with your child's

       performance in the classroom?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Are any changes anticipated in your child's educational

       program?<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">What can you do at home to help your child strengthen

       particular skills?<p>



<hr><center><FONT COLOR="CC6600">What Are My Legal Rights?</center></font><hr><p>



Several precedents and laws define legal rights related to 

taking tests in school:

<p>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of

       1974, also known as the Buckley Amendment, you have a

       right to examine your child's academic records.  If these

       records contain test scores, you have a right to see 

       those scores as well.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Your child has a right to due process.  For example, your

       child must get adequate notice when a test is required 

       for high school graduation and adequate time to prepare 

       for the test.<br>

<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">Your child has a right to fair and equitable treatment. 

       Schools cannot, for example, have different test score

       requirements based on gender or race.<p>



Schools are not, however, necessarily liable for tests and test

results being misused.  Your child's best protection against the

misuse of testing is for you to be knowledgeable about the

appropriate uses of various types of tests.  If you suspect your

child is being tested inappropriately, or is not being tested 

when testing would be appropriate, talk with your child's 

teacher.

<CENTER><H3>              Rights and Responsibilities of Parents of Children
With   Disabilities</H3></CENTER>   
<P>   Parents of children with disabilities have a vital role to play in  the
education of their children. This fact is guaranteed in federal  legislation
that specifies the right of parents to participate in the  educational
decision-making process. As your child progresses  through educational systems,
knowing and following through on  your rights and responsibilities ensures that
you are a  contributing partner with professionals who will influence your 
child's future. This brochure provides you with an introduction  to your rights
and responsibilities in the special education  process.

<CENTER>
       What Are Your Rights in the Special Education Process?  
</B>
</CENTER>
<HR> 
<P>Public Law 101-476 (IDEA) clearly defines the rights of  children with
disabilities and their parents. A basic provision of  the law is the right of
parents to participate in the educational  decision-making process. Your rights,
more specifically, include  the following:   
</P>
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">
<B>  Your child is entitled to a free, appropriate public     education</B>
meaning it is at no cost to you as parents, and it     meets the unique
educational needs of your child.  <P>    
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> 
<B>  You will be notified whenever the school wishes to     evaluate your
child</B>, wants to change your child's     educational placement, or refuses
your request for an     evaluation or a change in placement.<P>  
<IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">

special education or related services.<P> 
</P>
<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> 
<b>  You should be asked by your school to provide &quot;parent     consent&quot;</B>
meaning you understand and agree in writing to the     evaluation and initial
special education placement for your     child. Your consent is voluntary and
may be withdrawn at     any time.<P>   
</P>
<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">

<b>    You may request a reevaluation </B>if you suspect your child's    
current educational placement is no longer appropriate. The     school must
reevaluate your child at least every 3 years, but     your child's educational
program must be reviewed at least     once during each calendar year.<P>     
</P>
<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> 
<b>  You may have your child tested in the language</B> he or she     knows
best. For example, if your child's primary language is     Spanish, he or she
must be tested in Spanish. Also, students     who are hearing impaired have the
right to an interpreter     during the testing.<P>     
</P>
<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">

interpreter if you     are hearing impaired or if your primary language is not  
  English.<P>

of these records, but the school may charge you a     reasonable fee for making
copies. Only you, as parents, and     those persons directly involved in the
education of your child     will be given access to personal records. If you
feel any of     the information in your child's records is inaccurate,    
misleading, or violates the privacy or other rights of your     child, you may
request that the information be changed. If     the school refuses your request,
you then have the right to     request a hearing to challenge the questionable
information in     your child's records.<P>

The IEP and IFSP     are written statements of the educational program designed
to     meet your child's unique needs. The school must make every     possible
effort to notify you of the IEP or IFSP meeting and     arrange it at a time and
place agreeable to you. As an     important member of the team, you may attend
the IEP or     IFSP meeting and share your ideas about your child's special    
needs, the type of program appropriate to meeting those     needs, and the
related services the school will provide to      help your child benefit from

      What Are Your Responsibilities in the Special Education      Process?</b></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
 Parental responsibilities to ensure that a child's rights are being  protected
are less clearly defined than are parental rights. These  responsibilities vary
depending on the child's disabling condition  and other factors. Some of the
following suggestions may be  helpful:   
</P>
<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> 
<b>    Develop a partnership with the school or agency.</B> You are     now

<DL></DL><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15"> 
<b>    Learn as much as you can about your rights and the     rights of
your child.</B> Ask the school to explain these rights     as well as the
regulations in effect for your district and state     before you agree to a
special education program for your     child. Contact disability organizations
for their publications     on special education rights.<P>

       What Can You Offer
the IEP or IFSP Process?    
</CENTER></b>
<HR> <p>
        In the final analysis, parents of children with
disabilities should  be involved in the IEP or IFSP process as much as they want
to  be and as much as they can be. The following are suggestions  for ways
parents can become involved:<P><p><IMG Src="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>Before attending an IEP or IFSP meeting, make
a list of     things you want your child to learn.</b><P><p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>   Bring any information the school or agency may not     already have to the IEP or IFSP meeting.</b>
Examples     include copies of medical records, past school records, and    
test and medical evaluation results.<P><p> <IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>    Discuss what related services your
child may need.</b> Your     child may need to be involved with many other
specialists     and professionals besides his or her teacher, including    
occupational therapists, physical therapists, or speech-     language
pathologists.<p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B> Discuss what assistive technology devices or services your  
  child may need and have these listed in your child's IEP     or IFSP.</b><p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>    Ask what you can do at home to support the program.     </b><P><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>    Make sure the goals
and objectives listed in the IEP or     IFSP are specific and measurable.</b><p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>    Periodically, ask for a report on your child's progress.</b><p><IMG SRC="dot.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10" HSPACE="15">  <B>      Regard your
child's education as a cooperative effort. </b>If,     at any point, you and the
school cannot reach an agreement     over your child's educational and
developmental needs, ask to     have another meeting. Remember, compromise on
your part     and the school's or agency's part may be important in    
resolving conflicts and maintaining a good working     relationship. If, after a
second meeting, there is still a     conflict over your child's program, you may
wish to ask for     a state mediator or a due process hearing.<p>

        What
Resources Are Available?<hr></b><p></center>    Many organizations have information to help guide
you through  the special education process. Since the specific criteria and 
procedures used by school districts vary, it is important to  familiarize
yourself with the information provided by state and  local agencies. You will
find your local school district's director  of special education and his or her
staff helpful in accessing  such information and guiding you through the
process. <p>    Additional resources are available from national disability 
organizations. Some of them have state and local chapters that  can provide more
locally based support. All states now have  federally supported parent
information and training centers. The  contacts cited below may be able to help

<head><title>Should Gifted Students Be Grade-Advanced?</title></head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> 
<center><b>Should Gifted Students Be Grade-Advanced?</b></center><hr><p>
Intellectually gifted and academically talented students are students who can
learn and understand deeply and rapidly.  Keeping them challenged and
learning to capacity can require changes in their regular school programs. 
Across the United States, education programs for children identified as gifted
and talented take many forms"pull-out programs offering educational
enrichment, honors classes, after-school and summer programs featuring
special course work, and mentor programs in which children are matched with
professionals in the community for special learning experiences.  
<p>
Sometimes, gifted youngsters may be so advanced in knowledge and so clearly
operating at an intellectual level beyond that of their age-peers that educational
acceleration is a realistic and desirable alternative to normal grade-level work. 
Educational acceleration, or providing students with academic work they would
not ordinarily encounter until reaching a later grade in school, is usually
considered when no amount of enrichment, individual attention, or special
grouping within a class seems to keep the gifted student engaged in school.
<p>
Educational acceleration is often thought of as simply grade-skipping, or
placing a child one or more grades ahead with children who are one or more
years older.  For instance, a child who has completed the fourth grade may be
double-promoted to the sixth, skipping fifth grade entirely.  Sometimes, if
children are especially talented in one subject area, (most often mathematics,
science, or English), they may be allowed to take advanced courses with older
students in that subject while staying "in-grade" for the other subjects.  An
example is the seventh-grader who travels to a high school each day for
advanced science.  Another alternative is to have gifted children tutored and
advanced in given subjects, either individually or in small groups of children
with similar talents.  For instance, a group of five or ten high school students
might meet for classes in advanced mathematics twice a week with a professor
from a local university.
<p>
These arrangements are all appropriate responses to children who are
intellectually and academically capable of learning at a faster pace and in
greater depth than their same-age peers, and who are motivated to do so. 
Insisting that gifted and talented students remain with their age-mates at all
costs may exact too high a cost from the children.  It may result in boredom
and daydreaming, poor study habits, behavior problems, an unrealistic self-
image, or the avoidance of school altogether.  But the decision to allow a child
to accelerate educationally is one that must be made for each child, taking into
account the intellectual and emotional needs of the child and the services the
school can provide.
<P><center><b><HR>
Is Education Acceleration Harmful To the Child Academically?</center><hr></b>
<p>
The majority of studies have shown that children who have been educationally
accelerated do not suffer academically.  Their grades are higher than those of
their peers who chose not to accelerate; they compare favorably with those of
older students in their classes.  Accelerated students also report heightened
interest in and enthusiasm for school.
<hr><CENTER><B>
But Won't There Be Gaps in the Child's Knowledge?<HR></CENTER></B>
<p>If children skip one or more grades, they may occasionally encounter
unfamiliar material from the skipped grade.  Therefore, arrangements should
be made in advance with teachers to allow the children to cover any such
material without penalty as it is encountered.  Because there is repetition in
normal curricula, such gaps occur less often than one might think and seldom
present a significant problem to the gifted and talented student, who learns
quickly and well.
<hr><CENTER><b>
Is Educational Acceleration Harmful to the Child Emotionally or Socially?
<HR></CENTER></b>
<p>This is the aspect of educational acceleration that seems to worry parents and
educators most.  Generally speaking, children who are well-adjusted and
socially at ease who accelerate report having two groups of friends--they
belong to a circle of older students, but they also retain friendships with
children who are the same age.  Note that children naturally choose to play
with children of all ages in their neighborhoods. 
<P>
Children who are socially withdrawn or who have difficulty making friends
may experience similar problems when placed with older children.  On the
other hand, there are cases in which a gifted child is more at ease socially with
older children than with age-mates.  This may be true more often for girls than
boys.  The receiving classroom teacher in an accelerated setting can be a
valuable ally to the younger student, helping him or her find a niche among
the older students.  
<P><hr><center><b>
What Do Educators Think of the Educational Acceleration Option?
<hr></center></b><p>
Research about acceleration consistently documents positive effects, both
academically and socially, for children who have accelerated, but educators
have been slow to embrace this option.  Fears about social and emotional
development problems for these children are common.  However, people who
specialize in working with gifted and talented children and teachers and
parents who have had personal experience with educational acceleration tend
to be more positive.<P>
<hr><center><b>
How Do Parents Know If Their Child Should Accelerate?
<hr></center></B><p>
If children's standardized test scores, particularly achievement test scores, are
many grades above level or off the charts entirely, they are good candidates
for acceleration.  If a child who was previously an avid student begins to
complain of boredom or starts misbehaving in school, it may be an indication
that he or she needs additional challenges (but remember that any child may
be bored or have behavior problems).  The decision to accelerate ideally
should be mutual"the child, parents, and school officials all agreeing it would
serve the child well.  The school psychologist or Individualized Educational
Plan (IEP) committee should be consulted early in the process.
<P><hr><center><b>
When Should One Be Cautious About Acceleration?
<hr><P></center></b>
If the child under consideration for acceleration is physically or emotionally
immature, is pushed into the process by adults, or receives constant negative
feedback at school from peers or educators, problems could occur.  It helps if

teachers and administrators are supportive, and fellow students are at least
tolerant and preferably friendly.  If the school accelerates students routinely so
that an accelerated youngster does not stand out as peculiar, and moreover, has
a small support group of similar youngsters, then chances for an easy
adjustment increase.
<P>
  A child who has been accelerated may find that he or she
is no longer the best in the class because the peer group is older and more
experienced.  Both parents and the child should be ready for this.  Parents
should be supportive, but never put undue pressure on the gifted and talented
child to perform-certainly not when he or she is adjusting both socially and
academically to a new environment. The decision to academically accelerate a child
may be reversed at any time if it appears not to be working out academically,
socially, or emotionally for the child.  Adults should help children in this
situation understand that the change is not a failure.
<hr><center><b>
What About Acceleration in a Single Subject?
<hr><P></center></b>
This option tends to meet with less resistance from educators than grade-
skipping because children still take most classes with their age-mates,
alleviating concerns about social problems.  Here, continuity is crucial. 
Accelerating students one year, only to have them repeat the material the next
is no solution.  Teachers or curriculum specialists can be helpful in
determining what aspects of a subject are covered in each grade.  Accelerated
students may need to make special arrangements to travel to a junior high or
high school, or even take a college course before high school graduation.  It
is important to obtain the cooperation of the school district's central authority
throughout the child's educational career.  Transportation problems may prove
more difficult to solve than academic or social problems.
<hr><center><b>
What Are the Steps in Making the Decision To Accelerate a Child?
<hr><P></center></b>
Assuming the parents and student first agree to explore this option, parents
might begin by discussing it with the school's coordinator for the gifted and
talented, guidance counselor, or principal"whichever person knows the child
best.  The classroom teachers' opinions also should be sought.  Next, the
child's academic potential and social and emotional adjustment should be
evaluated by a school psychologist.  The final decision will probably be made
by the school's IEP Committee or the principal.  It is important to have the
enthusiastic support and understanding of the teachers who will be working
with the accelerated child, as well as commitments for continuity and
coordination from school authorities.

<center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">What Is Homeschooling?</center></font><hr><p>
Each fall when school begins, a growing number of
school-aged children do not head off to a
classroom. Instead, they learn at home with their
families or with other children in their
communities. Homeschooling takes many forms, from a
daily routine following a scheduled curriculum to
child-led learning in which parents supervise and
help. Choosing to homeschool or to traditionally
educate a child is often a difficult and confusing
decision for parents and guardians. To help them
make the best choice possible, this brochure
answers basic questions about homeschooling and
suggests other useful sources of information. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">
Do Families Have a Right to School Their Children
at Home?</center> </font><hr><p>


All states allow homeschooling. Typically, a
state's statutes, through a court ruling, an
attorney general opinion, or a regulation that
interprets a school attendance law to include
homeschooling, consider homeschooling a legitimate
option for meeting compulsory education
requirements. Because each state regulates
homeschooling differently, parents should examine
local laws and consult with other homeschoolers
before proceeding.
<p>
In every state, parents must, at a minimum, notify
a state or local education agency of their intent
to educate their children at home and identify the
children involved. Several states require the
submission of proposed curricula and tests or have
educational requirements for parents. A few even
test parents. Only Michigan requires certified
teachers to be involved in homeschooling programs,
but the state allows parents to choose a program's
teacher and does not specify a minimum level of
teacher supervision. (Michigan courts have excused
parents from the certification requirement if they
have religious objections.)
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled explicitly on
homeschooling, but it did rule against compulsory
school requirements in Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972).
The Supreme Court has also upheld the right,
subject to reasonable state requirements, of
parents to direct the education of their children. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">

What Does the Federal Government Do for
Homeschoolers?
</center> </font><hr><p>

Government regulation and support of home schooling
is carried out primarily at the state level.
However, the federal government also plays an
important role by disseminating research-based
information on homeschooling to policy makers and
others and by supporting research on a broad range
of issues affecting teaching and learning.
<p>
Most federal support for education is dedicated to
programs for children who have special needs, such
as low-achieving children, children with limited
English proficiency, and children with
disabilities. Generally, local districts have the
option of offering services under these programs to
homeschoolers who meet the districts' criteria for
eligibility.
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">

How Do Educators and Policy Makers View
Homeschooling?
</center> </font><hr><p>

Homeschooling is controversial. The National
Parent Teacher Association opposes the practice, as
do the National Education Association and the
National Association of Elementary School
Principals. Other groups such as the American Civil
Liberties Union maintain that parents have a
constitutional right to school their children at
home. Though they don't necessarily approve of
homeschooling, a majority of Americans responding
to the 1988 Phi Delta Kappa Gallup poll believed
that parents have a right to try it. State
legislatures agree, and over the past 20 years they
have responded favorably to homeschoolers seeking
more flexible compulsory education laws.
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">

How Well Do Homeschooled Children Do?
</center> </font><hr><p>

Homeschooling's academic worth is hotly contested
by researchers, educators, and parents. It is
difficult to obtain a representative sample of
homeschooled children, and researchers cannot say
for certain whether these children would do better
or worse in a public or private school. Scores of
homeschoolers who have taken state-mandated tests
or who have provided their results to researchers
indicate that while some homeschoolers test below
average, a larger number test above that mark.
<p>
Proponents and opponents also disagree on how
well-adjusted homeschooled children are. Although
it appears to be true that children who are
homeschooled spend less time with same-age children
and more time with adults and children of different
ages, research has not found that homeschooling
harms children's social or psychological
development. On the contrary, these children often
demonstrate better social adjustment than their
traditionally schooled peers.
<p>
Opponents argue that homeschooling is harmful to
children because it isolates them from other
children in their community. However, homeschooling
is rarely conducted in total isolation. Many
families participate in homeschool support groups,
scouting, church and recreational activities, and
other associations. 
<p>
Through these activities, homeschooled children
share experiences with people outside their
immediate families. Although some homeschoolers and
their associations emphasize affiliations only with
people who share their religious beliefs, many
actively seek religious, cultural, and racial
diversity. In fact, one national magazine, The
Drinking Gourd, is devoted to multicultural
homeschooling. 
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">

What About College Admissions?
</center> </font><hr><p>

Homeschooling teenagers should contact the colleges
and universities they would like to attend and ask
about their admission policies. In a 1994 telephone
poll conducted by the author of this brochure, a
select group of admissions officers from large
universities and colleges indicated willingness to
consider applications from homeschooled students.
In addition, all of the officers said that they
accept standardized admission test scores-along
with other material showing experience in learning
and collaborating with others-in the absence of a
regular high school transcript. Although admissions
officers do not monitor this practice, some
estimated that they admit a handful of
undergraduates each year without a transcript.
Interested teenagers should ask their local
homeschool association for the names of college
students who were homeschooled and would not mind
offering advice about the college application
process.

<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">
What Resources Are Available to Homeschoolers?
</center> </font><hr><p>

To get started, most homeschooling families join
local support groups. Families often find these
groups by word of mouth or through public or
private schools, religious groups, or state or
national associations. At least one homeschooling
association is active in every state. These groups
offer advice and information and hold conferences
at which families who school at home discuss legal,
philosophical, and teaching issues. 
<p>
Parents can also find guidance in books, magazines,
and newsletters. This brochure's companion piece,
<a href="homesc2.html"><i>Homeschooling Resources for Parents and Students</i></a>,
lists materials and Internet resources that cover a
wide range of homeschooling issues. 
<p>
Some school districts have established centers at
which families may enroll in classes or obtain
resources and instructional support. Such
arrangements are called shared schooling, dual
enrollment, or assisted homeschooling. Some
districts also allow homeschoolers to attend public
school part-time. Many private schools, some public
schools, and the state of Alaska provide
homeschoolers with texts, materials, and support.
Homeschoolers also rely on libraries, museums,
parks department programs, churches, civic
associations, and other local institutions.
<p><hr><center><FONT COLOR="66cc00">

Where Can I Get More Information?
</center> </font><hr><p>

There are many sources of information and resources
available to homeschoolers, including libraries,
local public schools and other educational
institutions, government agencies, nonprofit
institutions, and other homeschoolers. For more
information, call ACCESS ERIC at 1-800-LET-ERIC
(538-3742) and request a copy of <a href="homesc2.html"><i>Homeschooling

<title> Definition: CHN</title>

The <strong>Clearinghouse Accession Number</strong> abrivated <strong>CHN</strong>

is assigned by the ERIC Clearinghouse that indexed 

and abstacted the document or article.  After the <a href="defed.html">ED number</a> or <a href="defej.html">EJ number</a> is

<H3><A name="impact">Impact Evaluation</A></H3><P>


<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen has extensive experience in performing impact evaluations for its utility 
clients.  An impact evaluaion is designed to determine the energy and 
demand savings, as well as other benefits which result from the program.  To 
calculate program benefits, both load and energy impacts must be determined.  
Free ridership must be ascertained.  Program costs must be known or estimated.  
Aspen is expert at applying a variety of evaluation techniques, including 
statistical, engineering, simulation, and metering approaches to utility DSM 
program evaluations.</FONT>

<P><BR>

<H3><A name="process">Process Evaluation</A></H3><P>


<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen has performed numerous process evaluations for its clients.  
Process evaluations review program administrative and operational considerations.  
They assess implementation effectiveness including market efficiency, 
customer acceptance, and trade ally impact as well as program flexibility and response times.

<P>Aspen offers several innovative approaches to DSM process evaluations, 
including use of "paired" focus groups, development of specialized telephone 
survey instruments, and techniques for measuring the effects of "information 
only" programs.</FONT>
<P><BR>



<H3><A name="market">Market Evaluation</A></H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>Market evaluations generate data on customer understanding and acceptance 
of program offerings.  Market evaluations typically focus on the impacts of 
specific marketing activities on utility program objectives. They provide the 
information needed to design more effective marketing strategies and campaigns.
<P>
Aspen's full range of market research and survey services offer utilities all of 
the capabilities needed for full-service market evaluations.  Our market evaluations 
of DSM programs that we ourselves have operated have revealed 
numerous marketing and non-marketing actions that served to accelerate or reward 
customer participation.  Our experience as a DSM program operations firm gives us 
unique qualifications to perform market evaluations.

<P>Aspen is fully qualified to conduct impact, process, and market evaluations for 
all types of utility programs -- residential, commercial, and industrial.  Our 
highly skilled staff has the statistical, computer, survey, focus group, and 
engineering experience necessary to conduct all phases of evaluation research.  Aspen 
literally "wrote the book" on DSM evaluation for the utility industry (EPRI Publication

<H3><A name="data">Data Editing and Validation</A></H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P>Aspen has performed numerous projects requiring editing and validation 
of interval load research data.  Interval load research data requires 
extensive checking, especially during project startup, to ensure that the data recorded 
is reasonable and what is expected.  This is especially true of end-use data, 
for example, which may not be flagged by the software for any apparent problems, 
but may have multiplicative problems built-in due to incorrectly reported 
field information.
<P>
Aspen has written several monographs on the editing and validation of utility 
data for clients.  These monographs indicate the guidelines to use to determine if 
data can be classed as valid for analysis purposes.</FONT>
<P>

<H3><A name="analysis">Data Analysis</A></H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen has been involved in the analysis of utility load data for over 12 years.  
The data analysis of interval load data involves the use of both &quot;canned&quot; 
analysis software, as well as programming in statistical software languages for 
ad-hoc analyses.  Aspen has extensive experience in analyzing load data using 
the techniques avaliable in canned software packages, as well as writing 
computer code to analyze load data for DSM program evaluation, market research, and 
other utility functions.

<P>Aspen is fully qualified to take over the sample design, data collection, data 
editing and validation, and analysis of all types of utility load data.  Our highly 
skilled staff includes the statistical, economic, engineering, and computer 
programming skills necessary to conduct all phases of a load research program.  This 
highly skilled staff includes nationally renowned sample design experts, as well as 
former utility load research personnel available to work directly on utility load 
research projects.

<P>Outsourcing to Aspen provides complete flexibility to scale up or down the 
load research effort.  For example, utilities facing a rate case or IRP filing can call 
on Aspen to undertake extensive load data analysis activities associated with 
these efforts without the need to divert staff from other critical activities.  Aspen 
also offers a variety of other services, such as data processing systems support and 
load research hardware and software purchase recommendations.<P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen Systems Corporation provides a wide range of audit services to 
the utility industry.  These services include:
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Audit Program Design
<LI>Commercial Audits
<LI>Industrial Audits
<LI>Residential Audits
<LI>One-Stop Audits
<LI>On-Site Surveys
<LI>Pen-Based Automated Data Collection
<LI>Program Integration

</UL>
<P>Utilities recognize the value of offering energy audits to their customers as a way 
to encourage efficiency, facilitate participation in other utility programs, and 
enhance customer service and marketing.
<P>
Aspen will design, operate, monitor, and evaluate an energy audit program tailored to 
a utility's customers without the utility having to invest in additional in-house staff 
or software resources to do so.

<P>Aspen serves all of a utility's customers -- residential, commercial, and industrial.

<P>Aspen features staff experienced in all phases of energy audit programs and 
efficient technologies.  These personnel will design the energy audit program to suit a 
utility's needs.  Our philosophy is to provide a customized program the way the utility wants 
it, as opposed to forcing your program to meet a pre-determined format.

<P>Aspen's engineers are available to support the program on a day-to-day basis.  Our 
field staff are degreed engineers with experience in conducting energy audits and 
on-site surveys.

<P>Because of Aspen's extensive experience with utility rebate programs, we are 
often able to integrate audit and rebate programs.  This allows a utility to take advantage 
of the synergy between the two similar programs.  Combined reporting and tracking 
are just two of the benefits of this integration.

<P>Aspen's Program Tracking software, DSMonitor&#153; , and our companion 
product, MarketNavigator&#153; , are designed to capture all data required for evaluations 
responsive to regulatory requirements, and to provide excellent customer service.  Our data 
entry procedures ensure quality assurance checks of all data entered.

<P>Aspen also conducts on-site surveys of commercial, industrial, and residential facilities. 
 Whether collecting end-use nominal performance ratings or conducting 
thorough building surveys for complex computer simulations, Aspen engineers are trained 
for efficient and accurate data acquisition.   Our survey results range from 
simple organized site data to hourly end-use demand estimates by building type 
and geographical region.  Aspen offers the flexibility and experience for a variety of 
utility survey objectives.

<P>Aspen Systems provides a wide range of additional services to the utility industry.  
Our analytical expertise, ranging from market research to econometric 
evaluations, enhances the services we are able to offer our utility clients.  Because Aspen 
has conducted numerous evaluations of utility programs, we know which data must 
be collected in order to evaluate a program, and we understand the value of high 
quality data.

<P>At Aspen, your customers are our customers.  We provide the quality and 
customer service you demand for your valued customers.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen Systems Corporation maintains two Distribution and Fulfillment 
Centers which perform the mailing and distribution services for all of 
Aspen's clients.  The services include:
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Short-term Storage
<LI>Subscription and Mailing List  Services
<LI>Inventory Support
<LI>Messenger Services
<LI>Assembly and Collation
<LI>Shipping Services
</UL>


Aspen's Distribution and Fulfillment Centers can perform a variety of services 
for utility clients, including distribution of compact fluorescent lamps and other 
lighting products, catalogs, newsletters, and other DSM-related and utility 
marketing products.
<P>
The Centers are staffed by a team of 49 trained specialists.  The Centers have 
over 92,000 square feet of space with a storage capacity of 5,000 pallets.  In a recent 
three month period, the Centers processed more than 263,000 orders and distributed 
more than 13 million items.

<P>The Centers house employee offices and a warehouse.  The addition of 
state-of-the-art material handling equipment has produced a highly efficient 
distribution operation.  For example, the shipping area has a scissor lift that lowers the 
loading platform to accommodate delivery trucks.  Other essential equipment includes:
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>a conveyor system,
<LI>a pallet flow rack,
<LI>a weight-count scale, and
<LI>a high-speed labeling machine.
</UL>
<P>
The distribution and fulfillment process is done accurately and quickly.  The 
order entry area is where mail sorting and data entry functions take place.  Incoming 
orders arrive and are sorted and divided into batches.  The data entry specialists enter 
this information into a computer database and coordinate the production of mailing labels. 
 Once the order and labels are printed, a quality control check is performed.  
The orders are then sorted and divided for processing.
<P>
<P>When a shipment of items arrives at the receiving area, a specialist checks it by 
type of item and quantity.  The shipment is then assigned a location and stored.  A 
location card is placed with the shipment, and a copy of the card is filed in number 
sequence in a master file.  The information is also entered into a computerized record.
<P>
Order processing is done by the order processors.  To fill an order, the 
processors collect the appropriate items and place them in a bin, which is sent along 
the conveyor system to the quality control station.  (Large orders requiring 10 or 
more cartons are placed on pallets and prepared for freight shipping.)  At the quality 
control station, a processors checks the quantity and verifies the item ordered.  The items 
then continue along the conveyor to the packaging work station.

<P>Once packaged, the order continues along to the metering area.  Here 
metering experts weigh the package on a scale which determines whether U.P.S. or the 
postal service is the more economical method of shipping.  On a daily basis, the 
metering system records and summarizes  by contract the method of shipment, total number 
of packages shipped, and total costs.

<P>Aspen's Distribution and Fulfillment Centers offer utility and government clients 
a highly efficient means of distributing compact fluorescent lamps and other 
products and literature for fulfillment, marketing, customer service, or technology 
transfer purposes.

<FONT SIZE=4>The issue is not whether your company offers 
individualized programs for each customer, but how to keep track of every 
marketing activity for each individual customer, especially when you are 
outsourcing program operations.  That's what MarketNavigator&#153; does.

<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Tracks Detailed Customer Information

<LI>Coordinates Project and Program Management

<LI>Advanced Scheduling Features
</UL>


<P>

It is a fact that the best way to serve your customers would be to create 
an individual market strategy for each and every customer.  The amazing thing 
is that with the wide variety of marketing programs offered by your 
utility company, and with the possibility for customers to choose to participate 
in multiple programs, you are probably already close to doing just that.  The 
issue is not whether your company offers individualized programs for each 
customer, but how to keep track of every marketing activity for each individual customer.

<P>Aspen's MarketNavigator&#153; operates on the principle that customers are 
people -- not revenue meters attached to service sites.  Even your largest key account is 
a person on the other end of a telephone call.  Human memory is linked to 
events, and MarketNavigator&#153; operates by tracking events that people remember. 
 Aspen uses MarketNavigator&#153; to coordinate project and program 
management, and to insure that contacts with your customers are recorded in complete detail.

<P>Aspen uploads a text extract of information from your billing file 
into MarketNavigator&#153; --  things like customer name (firm or residential), 
contact name, service address and mailing address if different, telephone 
number, customer service representative and telephone number, C&ISIC code, 
C&I market segment and strata, and demand and energy information.  
Often marketing and service representatives have never even had ready access 
to demand and usage information -- now they do.  One strength 
of MarketNavigator&#153;  is that you can load customers for specific programs 
or projects -- such as annual audit projects, market surveys, or energy 
programs which makes it an excellent tool for single program management.  
However, customer events can be recorded for multiple programs and projects 
so MarketNavigator&#153; can load <I>all</I> of your customers.  You can display 
events related to programs, or view a complete history of all customer events.  
Using this information as a base record, MarketNavigator&#153; then goes to work.

<P>As a tool, MarketNavigator&#153; can summarize customer contacts for a 
quick-view chronology, print out a customer history or energy use and demand 
profile, and maintain contact information for residential, commercial, industrial, 
or agricultural accounts.  MarketNavigator&#153; can track customer enrollment 
in multiple programs.  The reports and views are all in the same familiar 
format, accessed by clicking on-screen buttons or menu items.  MarketNavigator&#153; 
can be used by project managers, program managers, marketing representatives, 
and service representatives.

<P>Aspen currently uses MarketNavigator&#153; to manage Aspen program 
operations contracts.  It is also in use at the contracting utility.  That is the key.  We 
use MarketNavigator&#153;.  As users <I>and</I> developers, we were very careful to 
make sure that MarketNavigator&#153; could perform or be adapted for everything 
we need now -- and in the future.  MarketNavigator&#153; has been adapted to 
include scheduling features to support projects.  It has mapped related 
program activity -- such as audit programs linked to equipment retrofit programs 
that utilize the audit recommendations as the basis for rebate applications.

<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen Systems Corporation is both a developer and user of computer 
based DSM and marketing program tracking and control software. 
 Aspen's DSMonitor&#153; Program Tracking and Control software is 
a proven application used for:<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>DSM Program Operations Support
<LI>Utility DSM Programs 
<LI>Rigorous Program Evaluation 
</UL><P>

<P>Aspen's DSMonitor&#153; is a computer application developed for use in 
both traditional file server and client server environments.  Running under 
both DOS-text based and Graphical (GUI) interfaces, it is a powerful tool for 
both large and small DSM programs or utility companies.

<P>DSMonitor&#153; provides program managers with the capability to 
track program participation through all stages of your program design.  A 
detailed activity log that provides participant customer and program audit trails 
is maintained through a fully normalized and relational database system. 
 DSMonitor&#153; tracks equipment incentive and direct install programs, 
audit or building characteristics surveys, and hybrid programs such as 
new construction or weatherization programs.  Customers can be sorted 
by activity with reports being generated for activities required, such 
as inspections, installations, or incentive payment, to help manage 
your program implementation.

<P>Aspen Systems developed DSMonitor&#153; to support a multi-million 
dollar commercial and industrial equipment replacement incentive program in 
the state of New York.  The system was developed in an evolutionary 
manner over a period of eight years, beginning in 1987.  As cost recovery 
incentive requirements were set in place, DSMonitor&#153; was adapted to meet the 
strict evaluation requirements for program cost justification.  Using user 
defined values for program measures, DSMonitor&#153; develops savings estimates 
from engineering algorithms that accept variables for free-ridership, 
transmission and distribution loss, and time differentiated rates. Savings 
estimates developed with DSMonitor&#153; have been used  in Public Service 
Commission filings that have resulted in the submitting utility receiving the 
maximum allowable cost recovery incentive in each year.  Statistical summaries 
for user specified periods of performance are generated on demand.

<P>Aspen Systems is an internationally recognized leader in DSM and 
utility marketing programs.  Aspen's experience in DSM led us to the 
conclusion that a better system could be developed.  We are also an 
internationally recognized leader in systems development with our client list including 
the United States Navy and Army, MCI, the Marriott Corporation, and 
many others.
<P>
<P>DSMonitor&#153; is a fully operational, customizable DSM program 
tracking application with a proven track record that boasts evaluators and managers 
as users.  Implementing DSMonitor&#153; is a viable solution to your 
program tracking needs.<P>

<P>






<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen Systems Corporation,with recognized expertise in the field 
of load research, has now combined state-of-the-art 
engineering, statistical, and programming techniques to develop REBEL&#153, 
a load research hourly end-use model, that gives clients:
<P>

<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Low Cost; Due to  the Absence of Metering Requirements

<LI>Flexibility; Written for the Commercial Sector, but Easily
Modified for Residential

<LI>Proven Track Record; Successfully Applied in the Field
</UL>

<P>Aspen's Reconciled Bills, Engineering, and Load Research (REBEL&#153) hourly 
end-use model offers several advantages over other analytical designs, including 
maximum leverage of load research data, low cost due to the absence of metering 
requirements, the accuracy of on-site engineering data and local weather conditions, and 
intelligent engineering and statistical techniques that provide defensible results.

<P><BR>
<B>Market Position</B>
<P>
Aspen markets REBEL&#153 as a powerful tool used as part of our load research 
services, rather than as a stand-alone software kit available as a commodity on the open market. 
 Written in SAS&#174;, we license the uncompiled code to customers for their future use 
if desired, unlike some of our competitors.  REBEL&#153 is written for the 
commercial sector, but can be easily modified to perform residential evaluation as well.  Aspen 
is also in a position to market the services (sample design, data collection, 
preliminary analysis) that accompany REBEL&#153 analysis.
<P><BR>

<B>Results</B>
<P>
The software has already been successfully applied to a project for a major 
North-Eastern utility.
<P><BR>

<B>Data Input</B>
<P>
The model draws upon these data resources:  (1) premise level hourly load data 
from load research buildings; (2) on-site engineering data; (3) weather data; and (4) 
billing data.  REBEL&#153 can be configured to receive either billing data alone or load 
research data alone if only one or the other is available.
<P><BR>

<B>Data Output</B>
<P>
The core output of REBEL&#153 is hourly load by end-use, fuel type, day type, and 
month for each surveyed building and building type.  Annual EUIs are a byproduct of 
the developed load shapes.  The choice of end-uses, fuel type, and day types can 
be adjusted for a particular customer.  Our current configuration includes ten 
end-uses (lighting, water heating, cooking, refrigeration, office equipment, 
miscellaneous, outdoor lighting, ventilation, heating, and cooling), three fuel types (electricity, 
natural gas, and other fossil fuel), four day types (week day, peak day, Saturday, and 
Sunday), ten building types (warehouse, office, retail, restaurant, foodstore, school, 
college, hotel, hospital, and miscellaneous), and twelve months.
<P><BR>

<B>Internal Calculations</B>
<P>
The REBEL&#153 model employs a four step computational procedure.  First, 
engineering data for each building is applied to calculate hourly demand by end-use.  Second, 
end-use level results are reconciled with premise level data for load research buildings 
in the sample.  Third, the reconcilation is performed against billed data for 
non-load research buildings in the sample.  Fourth, the data is aggregated by building type 
based on the sample design to produce building type load shapes and EUIs.<P>

<H2>Aspen's "Financing Choice Program" 
Replaces Rebates and Promotes Customer Loyalty</H2><P>


     <FONT SIZE=4>As electric utilities prepare for open competition in the 
electricity market, many are reducing or discontinuing their DSM 
rebate programs.  But they understand that helping their customers 
manage operating costs will be a critical element to retaining customer 
loyalty and attracting new customers in an era of competition.  Aspen offers 
its &quot;Financing Choice Program&quot; to give utilities a  weapon to use in 
the competitive market.
<P>         The Financing Choice Program perpetuates and attracts 
customer loyalty by perpetuating the proactive image created by utilities 
offering rebate programs.  It provides customers two services that 
a traditional loan program does not:


<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The Financing Choice Program identifies and offers the type 
of financing that best matches customers' needs.  The types of financing 
range from traditional commercial loans to energy savings performance contracts.
<P>
The Program eliminates "hassle" by handling all of the financing 
and contracting paperwork except the actual signatures, if the 
customer requests it.  Efficiency through financing is made easier than it 
was with rebates where the customer had to find a contractor and fill out 
an application.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Aspen, a turnkey operator of utility rebate programs, designed 
the Financing Choice Program using its experience as a fulfiller of 
customer rebate applications and information clearinghouses.  The Financing 
Choice Program can be tailored to your goals and budget.  Its complete range 
of services should cost much less than a tenth of the cost of a rebate 
program, and it can also be used to promote electrotechnologies.
<P>         The utility is not required to buy-down the market interest rate 
or provide loan funds.  Aspen will incorporate utility funding, however, 
if requested.  Aspen uses commercial banks in the utility's service area 
as one source of market financing.  
<P><B>For More Information

<FONT SIZE=4>Aspen operates the Financing Choice Program as a turnkey program.

<H2><A Name="load">End-Use Load Shapes From Appliance Saturation Survey Data</A></H2><P>


     <FONT SIZE=4>End-use load models that explain residential end-use 
hourly loads as functions of weather, building, appliance, and 
household characteristics were developed by Aspen as part of the 
EPRI-managed Missouri Data Transferability Project. 
 In most cases, these residential models can be applied to 
estimate end-use load shapes for any utility with available weather and 
appliance survey data.  In addition to providing accurate load shapes, 
these characteristics-based models meet the needs of utility 
marketing professionals.  The models can be used for marketing research 
and "what-if" analysis since the model variables explicitly account for 
the effects that housing and demographic characteristics have on 
appliance hourly energy use.  Knowing how different lifestyle and 
demographic characteristics affect energy use allows marketing analysts to 
perform economic analysis of the effects of marketing key end-use 
loads, identifying and targeting specific products to profitable segments.<P>

<IMG SRC="heater.gif"><BR>


<I>Water Heater Average Weekday Load Shapes for February</I>

<P>      In the Missouri project, econometric models that explain 
both the probability of an appliance being &quot;on,&quot; and the hourly load given 
that the appliance is &quot;on&quot; were 
developed for ten end-uses using end-use metered data, weather variables, and 
building, appliance, and household demographic and behavioral characteristics 
that were readily available from each utility's appliance saturation 
survey data. These models were then used to develop load shapes for five utilities 
by 
applying the models to each utility's appliance saturation survey 
and weather data. The resulting  load shapes revealed the differences 
in weather patterns, and housing, appliance, and 
demographic characteristics across the different service areas. For example, 
hourly loads were larger for those utilities with older appliance and 
housing stock and higher average occupancy levels.<P>




<IMG SRC="pump.gif"><BR>


<I>Heat Pump Predicted Average Weekday Load Shapes for August</I>



<P>      One of the most exciting features of this modeling approach is that 
it allows for intra-utility as well as inter-utility analysis. For 
instance, end-use load shapes can be developed for intra-utility 
service areas, market segments and combinations of service areas 
and segments. In conjunction with other projects and data sets, Aspen 
is continuing to refine the methodology and expand the applications of 
this important tool.

models, please contact Dr. Thomas Yoder at (423) 482-2721.</I></FONT><P>

<H2>Audits as Marketing/Customer 
Service Tool</H2><P>
         <FONT SIZE=4>Utility-sponsored audits boomed in popularity during the 
DSM era.  They were seen primarily as a mechanism to identify load 
reduction opportunities.  Over time, however, utilities have learned that 
audit programs and comprehensive large customer audits can provide 
many other valuable services as well.
<P>     <B>Market Research.</B>  Aspen has performed market research on 
customer audit data for two East Coast utilities 
to determine electrotechnology market penetration, end-use energy 
intensities, and typical gas customer floorspace 
by building type.
<P>


<B>Customer Service.</B>  In the Midwest, Aspen runs an audit program where each audited customer -- over 700 per year -- is called by a utility marketing representative to follow up, confirm customer satisfaction, and identify load growth opportunities such as heat pumps.<P>


	<B>Load Growth.</B>  At least one major southeast utility uses audits as a load growth tool.  They believe that anything they can do to improve customer efficiency will improve the chances of customer growth, expansion, or relocation of other divisions into the utility's service territory.  Audits that recommend fuel switching to heat pumps or other electric options is another more conventional load growth opportunity.<P>


	Customers believe that their utilities are experts not just at supplying power, but also on energy-using equipment.  As the market becomes more competitive, maintaining this customer trust is an important value-added service.<P>

<H2>Market Research and Competition</A></H2><P>


     <FONT SIZE=4>What are customers buying?
What do customers perceive as a value-added service?  How 
should products and services be priced?  How can we identify and 
reach customers who are willing and able to buy?  How much do 
customers know about my competitors and their products and services?  (How 
much do I know about my competitors' products, services, and prices?)
<P>     In the era of deregulation and evolving competition in the 
utility industry, these are the types of questions many industry 
executives are asking. Of course, the first part 
of the challenge was substituting the word "customer" for "ratepayer." 
 Progress has been made.  Now we ask ourselves the above 
questions about what our "customers" want 
to buy, for an old axiom of marketing is to sell customers what they want 
to buy, not what we happen to have on the shelf to sell. Therefore, 
the challenge now becomes finding out about what our customers want 
to buy and how we can position ourselves to profitably sell 
these 
products and services to them. In an era of competition, utilities will 
have to aggressively research, bring to market, and price products 
and services that customers in very different segments will be looking for. 
 Many of these products and services have not yet even been thought of 
by utility planners, but will be defined by customers.
<P>     Utilities are therefore reinventing market research, and applying it in new applications.  
For example, recent market research- related projects which Aspen has been engaged in include: developing customer desired features of two-way communications systems to deliver rate information and manage customer loads, identify threats and opportunities resulting from customer consideration of on-site generation, analyzing customer  recognition and response to multi-media promotional campaigns, and developing approaches to analyze the profitability and return on investment of marketing selected loads to different customer segments.
	<P>

If your utility is not asking the above questions and performing the associated customer research, then beware, because your competitors, both within and outside the traditional utility industry, are!

<H2>Quality Data: An Important Product</H2>

<H3>Data Collection</H3>
<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Data are collected by many health care organizations from hospitals to physician group practices, and by a wide variety of health care-related entities such as State data organizations and pharmaceutical companies. Hospitals and other health care providers collect clinical and administrative data to assess patient outcomes, identify processes for improvement, and assist in managerial decisionmaking and planning. State data organizations collect data for hospital rate setting, public health planning and assessment, and business and labor health care cost control. Recently, pharmaceutical companies have produced disease management protocols. They are now collecting clinical data to monitor and assess patient outcomes under the disease management protocols.</P></FONT></B>


<H3>The Importance of <A HREF="dqplan.html">Data Quality</A></H3>
<P>It is important to recognize that collecting data is not an end in itself. Assuring and assessing the quality of the data is part of the data collection process, but it is frequently overlooked by those who generate and collect data. The integrity and credibility of a database is dependent on the reliability, validity, and completeness of the data collected. Increasingly, organizations that collect data are realizing that objective data validation studies are needed to assure the soundness of the conclusions and the decisionmaking that results from their data collection and analysis.</P>


<H3>Assessing Data Quality</H3>
<P>Aspen's Health Information Services division has conducted data validation studies for a variety of organizations, including the Maryland and Connecticut State data agencies, the Health Care Financing Administration, and a number of hospitals and health maintenance organizations. </P>

<P>Aspen has designed studies that assess validity, accuracy, and reliability of coded or abstracted data elements, as well as the validity of diagnosis-related groups. Aspen's methodology includes a scientific sample selection that meets the unique goals of each study and uses statistical analysis to validate the results. Aspen's data collection staff are credentialed health information management professionals and certified coding specialists whose work is subject to rigorous quality controls throughout every project.</P>

<P>Aspen understands the importance of quality data as an organization's most significant product, and Aspen's methodology for assessing the quality of an organization's data assures that the significance of the product is suitably recognized.</P>

<P>See the related articles in this issue about <A HREF="surveys.html">survey design</A> and <A HREF="dqstudy.html">data quality studies</A>.</P>

<HEAD><TITLE>An Interview with Meryl Bloomrosen</TITLE></HEAD>

<H2>An Interview with 
Meryl Bloomrosen (continued from <A HREF="intrview.html">Spring 1996 issue</A>)</H2>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: How does Aspen improve the 
information management practices of a health care organization?</B></I></FONT>

<P>Aspen has helped many health care organizations evaluate their information management practices by conducting operational assessments of their information management processes. Aspen has also helped organizations with strategic information resources management planning. In addition, Aspen has helped organizations with the design, development, and implementation of enterprise-wide health information management systems.</P>

<P>Another significant way Aspen has helped health care organizations improve their information management practices is by looking at the outcomes of those practices. Those outcomes include the satisfaction of their customers with information received, and the quality and integrity of the data.</P>

<P>Aspen has conducted comprehensive user needs assessments and satisfaction surveys, and has provided independent, expert assessments of the quality and accuracy of coded and abstracted data. </P>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: How can Aspen benefit a health care organization?</B></I></FONT>

<P>Health care organizations can benefit from using our services because we offer technical support in areas where they often need additional help to meet staffing shortages or fill critical vacancies. Our health information staff include full-time and part-time employees with training and hands-on experience in ICD-9-CM and CPT coding, clinical data abstracting, business process re-engineering, and conducting coding and data quality studies. For example, with our data quality services, an organization can optimize revenues otherwise lost due to coding discrepancies or incomplete data.
We also offer interim management support for health information management departments. We have helped clients develop more efficient, effective health information departments.We have staffed entire departments or certain functional areas, streamlined operations, and completed departmental evaluations. </P>

<P>Although we are a large organization, we are committed to giving our clients individual attention and we customize solutions that meet their needs. As we are available for long- and short-term projects, clients need not feel that they have to make extensive commitments with us. In most cases, we measure our success by the fact that the client no longer needs our services in a particular area.</P>


<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: How is Aspen unique?</B></I></FONT>

<P>We offer a diverse array of services to each of our clients, including: customized data collection, survey design and analysis, clinical data abstraction, organizing and managing information resources, records management, information systems and telecommunications technical support, and technical assistance and training.

SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>The Aspen Advantage:<BR>An Interview with Meryl Bloomrosen, Vice President of Aspen's Health Information Services Division</H2><BR clear=left>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: How did Aspen get started?</B></I><P></FONT>

<A HREF = "redesign.html"><B>Aspen Systems Corporation</B></A> had its start at the University of Pittsburgh when our founders developed a means of storing and retrieving information about the legal codes of various States. So from our very beginning as a corporation, we have been an agent for change. This history reinforces a corporate culture based on finding and applying new and better means of creating, storing, analyzing, and using information. Over the past 30 years, we have pioneered many of the information management standards in use today. Since that time, Aspen has successfully served clients in all sectors of business and government. We currently have more than 1,800 employees, offices across the country, and a growing and diverse client base.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: How does Aspen work with its clients?</B></I><P></FONT>

In order to meet client expectations we take great pride in hiring seasoned professionals with the specialized skills necessary to understand and respond to our clients' unique situations. Our staff "speak the language," whatever the subject. We work as a team in relationships with our clients and in our ability to offer our clients a complete range of information management support services. We thrive on client satisfaction. Meeting our clients' expectations efficiently, quickly, and with honesty and poise is one of our main objectives. We strive to deliver the best quality service to a health care industry that is constantly changing and under increasing regulatory pressures. We recognize that many of our clients face new challenges because of changes in payment systems, economic pressures for reorganization, and just the general need to provide more and better services with fewer resources. Our people are our most important resource. This philosophy has promoted a deliberate and consistent growth in our professional staff and its capabilities. Ensuring that company services are of the highest possible quality has always been a priority at Aspen. Aspen's reputation as a firm that provides top quality work is based on the philosophy that satisfaction of client requirements is one of our most important objectives.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: What services does Aspen offer to health care clients?</B></I><P></FONT>

We offer a diverse array of services to all our clients, including: customized data collection, survey design and analysis, clinical data abstraction, organizing and managing information resources, records management, information systems and telecommunications technical support, and technical assistance and training. We also support the full range of information management and systems technologies.<P>

We make our services available as individual elements or as components of a complete package. As an ongoing service, we also provide valuable information about changing regulations, codes, and practice guidelines for our clients, making it a lot easier for them to keep abreast in today's constantly changing environment. Our relationship with our clients does not end even after we complete our formal engagement. We make ourselves available to answer client questions on an ongoing basis.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Question: What has Aspen done regarding the Internet?</B></I><P></FONT>

We also now provide a complete range of Internet support services. Our expertise in information management, publishing, systems design, and client service has been successfully applied in our provision of these Internet services, which include the design and development of World Wide Web pages, gopher and file transfer protocol (FTP) sites, and online publications. We have developed several home pages, including our own which can be reached at: <A HREF = "http://www.aspensys.com/"><B>http://www.aspensys.com.</B></A><P>

<HR align=left width=596 size=3>

<B>In the next issue of FOCUS, Meryl will discuss Aspen's uniqueness, and how Aspen can improve the information management practices of a health care organization.</B><P>

Meryl Bloomrosen, M.B.A., R.R.A., has been Vice President of Health Information Services at Aspen Systems Corporation since 1987, where she has been a Project Director on health information and health data products for the Federal Government, several State governments, and numerous health care facilities.

<H2>Surveys? Call Aspen . . . One of the Services That Makes Aspen Unique</H2>

<H3>Survey Design and Implementation</H3>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><P>The Survey and Evaluation Services (SES) Division of Aspen has been conducting multiple instrument surveys, using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and computer-assisted data entry (CADE) systems for over 15 years. Our approach to designing a survey instrument begins with a definition of the objectives of the survey and a detailed plan describing exactly how the variables will be measured. The identification of key informants is the first step in planning the data collection process. We also conduct a comprehensive literature review of survey instruments.</P></B></FONT>

<H3>Using Computers</H3>
<P>Aspen incorporates the development of software for laptop computer-assisted data entry, particularly for medical record abstractors. Computer-assisted data entry provides an opportunity to create and edit the data set simultaneously, thereby eliminating the need for retrospective editing or repeat data collection.</P>



<H3>Establishing the Methodology</H3>
<P>Aspen pretests the survey with a small group of appropriate individuals to review the content and format of the instruments, tests the procedures to be used during the survey, then tests the data that will be stored by the CATI or CADE systems.</P>

<P>Sampling statisticians design and implement the study sampling plan. Well-established procedures are used to recruit and train interviewers, and medical record abstractors are trained in the use of computer-assisted data entry. </P>

<H3>Maintaining Quality</H3>
<P>Data storage, tabulation and analysis of study data, data transmission, and documentation are subjected to the most stringent quality control procedures to ensure quality data management. Interviews and record reviews are coded directly into either CATI or CADE systems whenever possible, with a random sample from each batch reviewed by a supervisor. The CATI system will automatically track and log all calls.</P>

<H3>Assuring Confidentiality</H3>
<P>The data and information handled by SES have included Privacy Act data, government financial data, technical research data, and classified military data. SES confidentiality provisions include instructing all individuals involved in a study about the confidentiality of the responses, then providing signed confidentiality statements as required. Working files with identifiers are maintained on the computer network, thereby limiting access to the data. Aspen's SES Division also incorporates the use of automated data processing security programs and software that are in compliance with government and industry security standards.</P>

<P><I>For more information about the Survey and Evaluation Services (SES) Division, contact Meryl Bloomrosen at 1-800-395-5055.</I></P>

<H2>Data Quality Studies</H2>

<H3>Objectives</H3>
<FONT SIZE=4><B><P>There are a number of issues to be considered in performing a <a href="dataqual.html">data quality study</a>. The first consideration is the objective of the study. For example, one data quality study may be initiated to assess the accuracy of coded and abstracted data that are submitted for third party reimbursement by a health care provider, while another study may assess coded and abstracted data that are used by a health care provider for quality improvement, service or facility planning, or for medical effectiveness research. Another study may assess the accuracy of a database that is used for comparative analyses that result in some kind of public disclosure or policy that affects all the health care providers in a State.</P></B></FONT>

<P>Most data quality studies are performed by comparing the original coded and abstracted data collected from the source document (most frequently a health record) with the same data that have been recoded and reabstracted, usually by another data abstractor who is considered to be objective and is preferably an expert. </P>

<P>The ultimate objective of the data quality study and the size of the database to be assessed will help determine the study size, the sampling methodology to be used, and whether clinical, demographic, or billing data elements are assessed.</P>

 
<H3>Sampling Methodology</H3>
<P>The sampling methodology is significant in that it will determine whether the results of the data quality assessment can be reported as descriptive findings, or as individual accuracy rates. For example, if a random sample of a randomly chosen number of health records is selected (such as 100 inpatient records), the only conclusions that could be drawn from the assessment would be descriptive. For example, the assessment might say, "Of the 100 records reabstracted or recoded, 10 records or 10% of the records had errors."</P>

<P>If the study objective is to determine the accuracy of all billing data submitted by a health care provider to Medicare, or to determine the accuracy of coding myocardial infarctions in all hospitals that submit coded data to a statewide database, the sample would need to be statistically determined in order to calculate accuracy rates for the specified populations. That is, to calculate a coding accuracy rate, the selected sample would need to be statistically determined as a random sample, based on the total population. The study results could then state, for example, "Of all bills submitted, the accuracy rate for coding the principal diagnosis was 87% &#177 3.2%."</P>


<H3>Defining Data Quality</H3>

<P>Another important issue in conducting a data quality study involves defining what data quality means according to the objectives of the study. Usually data quality means accuracy. However, accuracy implies not only the attribute of correctness, but also completeness, consistency, and validity. </P>

<P>The methodology for conducting a data quality study should describe how each attribute of quality is to be assessed for each of the coded data elements and the abstracted data elements. Data element definitions used in the original data collection should also be carefully followed in the data quality study. 
</P>


<P><I>For more information about how Aspen can help you with a data quality study, call Zoe Metcalf at

<title>Data Quality Plans: Key Components</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Data Quality Plans: Key Components</H2>
<H3>In our last issue, we talked about the benefits of performing routine data quality reviews in your facility to assess and improve the quality of data being collected. We would like to now discuss the key components of a <A HREF = "dataqual.html">data quality plan</A> and how you can design and implement your own. This issue will be addressed over a series of articles during 1996.</H3>

There are several key components in a total data quality plan: coder development and training, coding policies and guidelines, data quality reviews, physician education, and information management. Here is a brief look at each of these areas and how they fit into a total data quality plan for your facility.<P>

<H3>Coder Development and Training</H3>
How much time do you spend developing and training your coding staff? How in tune is your coding staff with their role in the health care delivery system? Often, coders are well versed in their own tasks and the tasks of their department, but they lack basic knowledge of what happens after they have completed their job functions.<P>

Will your facility support the development of an in-house education and in-service program to ensure that the coding staff has access to the wealth of clinical information that is available? Educated coders make educated coding decisions that will have positive long-term effects on your facility's overall data quality.<P>

<H3>Coding Policies and Guidelines</H3>
The first question to ask about coding policies and guidelines is: "Do you have any?" If you do, then you must ask the following questions: When was the last time you updated your policy and procedure manual? Does each coding staff member have access to the manual and provide input into its contents? Do you follow nationally recognized coding guidelines such as those found in Coding Clinic and CPT Assistant, as well as your own facility-specific guidelines? Coding guidelines, developed with input from coders, coding references, and clinical staff, are key to the execution of an effective data quality plan.

<H3>Data Quality Reviews</H3>
Data quality reviews allow you to assess medical record documentation, physician education needs, and the quality and relevance of coding practices. As part of an overall data quality plan, routine random and focused reviews provide valuable information that will help direct your educational efforts.<P>

The key to effective data quality is feedback. How will you direct education and re-education efforts when needs are identified during review? How will findings be incorporated into your coding policies and guidelines?  A data quality review in a vacuum benefits no one.<P>

<H3>Physician Education</H3>
A certain percentage of the data quality issues identified result from a lack of physician understanding of the coder's needs. Obtaining medical staff buy-in for your data quality improvement efforts is very important. Developing and maintaining lines of communication with the medical staff will give you access to one of your most valuable resources.<P>

<H3>Information Management</H3>
The coordination of information dissemination in your facility is an important issue. Who is responsible for processing requests for clinical information? What is the role of the health information management (HIM) professional in your facility in this key area? Frequently, two or more people may request similar information from different sources. At times, this may result in two different interpretations of the same clinical data, resulting in questions of data integrity. As a HIM professional, you can assess user needs and help focus clinical data extraction efforts.<P>

Working with your facility's information services personnel, you can emphasize your expertise in clinical data collection and evaluation. How clinical data will be displayed as information and disseminated throughout the organization is a key component of your clinical data quality plan.<P>

<H3>Putting It All Together</H3>
You all will be asking yourselves when you will find the time to develop and implement a data quality plan.  In the changing health environment, with managed health plans scrutinizing clinical data, facilities can no longer put off looking at the quality of their clinical data and making plans for the future.  An investment in data quality in the short term will reap long-term benefits for all members of the health care team.<P>

A health information management firm such as Aspen Systems Corporation can assist you in the development and execution of a data quality plan, providing services ranging from a single data quality review to a complete evaluation of your current data quality efforts and recommendations for improvement in all component areas. Quality data is the foundation of health care services, allowing insurers, consumers, and regulatory agencies to assess the quality of care and services and make informed decisions regarding health care consumption. Start contributing now to your facility's future success through the development and implementation of a data quality plan.<P>

<title>Focus On: ICD-9-CM November Meeting</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2><A HREF = "focus97.html">FOCUS ON</A>: ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee November Meeting</H2>
<H3>The ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee met in Washington, D.C., on November 30, 1995, to discuss proposals for the 1997 fiscal year. The comment period for all proposed code changes, deletions, and additions discussed at both the May and November meetings ended in mid-January. Final recommendations will be forwarded to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in February.</H3>

Several physicians representing various specialty medical societies were on hand to give detailed presentations of proposed additions and/or changes to pediatric urological codes, mental health codes, and child and adult abuse codes, as well as to discuss the addition of one or more V-codes for patients with a terminal illness who are admitted to the acute care setting for "palliative" care in their end-of-life stage.<P>

New codes were proposed for the insertion of noncoronary stent(s), the coding of bypass grafts using arteries other than the mammary artery, the performance of endometrial ablation, and pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Multiple changes to the procedure section were introduced regarding the performance of various procedures via laparoscopic approach. The bulk of these changes were recommended in the Female Genital section, specifically relating to procedures performed for ovarian and fallopian tube conditions.<P>

In addition to the diagnosis codes recommended during the physician presentations, other recommendations include adding a code for Factitious Disorder by Proxy (Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy), a specific code identifying fetal alcohol syndrome, an addition to the postoperative complication codes to identify infected and noninfected seromas, and codes to identify mitochondrial chromosomal abnormalities. Codes were also proposed to address disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) and pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), as presented by the American Academy of Dermatology.<P>

An additional presentation was made on the proposed ICD-10 Procedures Coding System. 3M Healthcare has almost completed the design of the new system and is prepared to release it for phase II of its 3-year HCFA contract in March 1996. Year Two of the contract will involve testing the new system in the field and at 3M, as well as receiving and considering comments from health care organizations providing beta testing. During Year Three, HCFA will contract with an independent evaluator to assess the proposed software and its efficacy in the field.<P> 

Finally, announcements were made regarding staffing, and to address changes for the Coordination and Maintenance Committee members. Sue Meads has resigned her position as cochair of the committee, replaced by Donna Pickett, formerly with the American Hospital Association and <I>Coding Clinic.</I> The new mailing address for comments and suggestions regarding potential coding changes is:<P>

<title>Data Quality Studies: Some Commonly Asked Questions</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left 
hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Data Quality Studies: Some Commonly Asked 
Questions</H2>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>As the health information needs of our Nation change, there is 
increased attention on the availability of high quality information. Health care 
organizations striving to meet the challenges of generating and maintaining high quality 
data are increasingly turning to <A HREF = "chime.html">health information data quality studies</A> for help.<P>
Below are answers to some commonly asked questions about health information data 
quality studies and some facts on how they can benefit a health care 
organization.</B></FONT><P>

<H3>What is a <A HREF = "dqplan.html">data quality study?</A></H3> 

A typical health information data quality study involves either the concurrent or 
retrospective review of data maintained in a sample of an organization's medical records 
or claims. The process determines the caliber of administrative and/or clinical 
information maintained in an organization's medical records or financial/billing systems. 
The study can be conducted prior to the billing function, or after, depending on the 
specific facility goals.<P>

<H3>Why do a data quality study?</H3>

A data quality study will give managers valuable information about the reliability, 
validity, completeness, timeliness, and/or accessibility of the clinical and administrative 
data an organization maintains. Sometimes studies are undertaken because of noted 
changes in a facility's case mix, revenue, or accounts receivable.<P>

<H3>Why is this important?</H3>

Health care managers make decisions. Some of those decisions are based on information 
that evolves around the administrative and clinical data of a specific patient. Others are 
based on trends in administrative or clinical data. Either way, if health care managers 
cannot be sure whether the data on which they are basing a decision is sound, the decision 
made may not be the best one for an organization.
Furthermore, since much of a health care organization's reimbursement is based on 
clinical and financial data submitted to payers, the submission of accurate, timely, and 
complete information to those payers assures optimal reimbursement.<P>

<H3>What will the results of the data quality study tell an organization?</H3>

Depending on the particular goals of the study and the kinds of data examined, the study 
can provide an organization with valuable information on the consistency of similar kinds 
of data, on whether or not data are measuring what they intend to measure, or if all the 
data that should be present are available. In particular, depending on how samples of 
records or claims are selected, the results of a data quality study can allow the facility to 
determine the level of accuracy for all records and claims.<P>

<H3>Who should perform a health information data  quality study?</H3>

Either trained coders from the health information services department of an organization 
or outside consultants can perform the study. Although there are advantages to having an 
organization's personnel perform the study, having external, unbiased professionals 
perform the study has advantages as well. A data quality study performed by a health 
information management firm such as <A HREF = 
"http://www.aspensys.com/"><B>Aspen Systems Corporation</B></A> offers detailed, 
comprehensive information on the status of the organization's data as well as specific 
recommendations on how to improve the data, its collection process, and its usability. 
With this information, managers can have confidence that their data will not only 
optimize reimbursement for their organization, but will help them make better, more 
informed decisions. Organizations are well advised to select their sample of records or 
claims for review, according to appropriate sampling techniques. Be sure to define how 
accuracy rates will be determined.<P>

<title>Aspen's Contract Management Services: Creating "Win-Win" Solutions</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Aspen's Contract Management Services:<BR>Creating "Win-Win" Solutions</H2><BR clear=left><BR>

<H3>Why Choose Contract Management Services?</H3>
<A HREF = "contract.html"><B>Contract management services</B></A> give a health care facility access to the best of two worlds -- experienced and innovative managers to direct day-to-day departmental operations onsite, and the resources and technical expertise of a nationally recognized health care information services firm, such as Aspen Systems Corporation, to provide the analytical and evaluative services that so often get "lost in the shuffle" of hospital administration. Contract management services are clearly a viable option for health information management (HIM) departments in today's health care environment. HIM managers are looking for creative support and direction. Hospital administrators want a HIM department that is cost-effective, efficient, respected, and responsive to the diverse clinical and financial needs of its customers. Departmental employees want to see and participate in improvement efforts and not just "be improved." Can these varied outcomes be achieved in a positive and progressive way for all players? Aspen has the answer, and the answer is: Yes!<P>

<H3>Contract Management Case Study</H3>
St. Anywhere Hospital's Medical Record Services Department has developed a chronic, debilitating condition: it forgot to move into the 1990's! The director, in place for many years, couldn't understand what all the fuss was about when the American Medical Record Association changed its name to American Health Information Management Association! Although respected by peers and colleagues, this director was not well known for an innovative approach to health information management. This director did not encourage employees to interact with their "customers," contributing to a poor internal and external department image. Performance evaluations were long overdue and were cursory at best when delivered. Employees appeared to be in a rut, with no motivational activities, no continuing education, and no chance for upward mobility. Everything remained the same.<P>

Hospital administrators despaired over decreasing receivables and lack of improvements in the Medical Record Services Department's processes and outputs. Coding was routinely 10 to 20 days behind. It seemed that no one in the department understood the intertwining of clinical and financial information that is necessary in today's competitive health care market.  Even the purchase of automated equipment several years ago failed to produce expected efficiencies; it appeared that many processes continued to be carried out manually.<P>

<H3>Aspen's Contract Management Services</H3>
During negotiations, Aspen put everyone at ease about the decision to opt for contract management services. Aspen worked with hospital administrators to clearly define the expected benefits and outcomes of a contract management engagement. Together, they focused on the two key areas through which Aspen could bring about the "win-win" solution everyone sought to achieve. To call this "experiment" a success, Aspen would have to meet mandated performance standards and provide the hospital with access to our full complement of technical expertise.<P>

<H3>Meet Mandated Performance Standards</H3>
After obtaining approval, Aspen placed an extremely qualified and experienced medical records director at St. Anywhere. The director evaluated work flow and work processes. Input was solicited from all employees. Hard work, dedication, and a willingness to participate in proposed improvements resulted in a 37-percent reduction in backlogs in the department. Evaluation of services provided by outside vendors yielded a significant problem with overbilling and steps were taken to correct the situation. Finally, the director provided deserving employees with career advancement possibilities, promoting one long-term employee to a supervisory position. Job descriptions were streamlined and updated. Performance evaluations were brought up to date, and were meaningful and objective, with goal-setting opportunities and recognition of abilities. Staff members saw that efforts to improve would be well worth the time and effort. As staff began to feel better about their environment, customer service and customer perception of the department improved. All employees were trained on the department's commercial medical records abstracting system. Employees could now run ad hoc reports to aid in job performance. Responsibility and ownership, for the job and the output, were readily apparent.<P>

<H3>Provide Access to the Full Complement of Technical Expertise</H3>
An Aspen contract management engagement involves more than just the placement of a qualified director or other management personnel; our value-added services make it an extremely attractive and cost-effective option for hospitals. Aspen's information systems personnel were able to help St. Anywhere develop a fully functional interface between the department's clinical system and the hospital's financial system. Additionally, they were instrumental in the development of a 5-year Information Resources Management Strategic Plan for St. Anywhere prior to the 1995 JCAHO survey. Because Aspen is not affiliated with any commercial hardware or software vendors, hospital administrators felt comfortable that access to Aspen's highly specialized technical expertise and advice would not come with additional product purchase proposals.<P>

<H3>. . . And Then What Happened?</H3>
Now well into its second year under Aspen's contract management services, the department is moving towards updating and revising its departmental policies and procedures and continuing to further employee training and development. Data quality studies are also scheduled to commence shortly, which will more specifically assess current coding expertise and skills and enable Aspen to develop training programs targeted to unique facility needs.<P>

<H3>Where Do We Go From Here?</H3>
The case study provided is an actual account of a current contract management engagement, perhaps in a facility very much like your own.

<title>Are You Ready for APGs?</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Are You Ready for APGs?</H2>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Hospitals and other health care facilities have experienced numerous changes over the years as Congress and <A HREF = "hcfapubs.html">Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)</A> have enacted laws and regulations governing payment for health care services provided to Federal beneficiaries. The data reporting requirements and information management complexities facing physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers in the 1990's are well recognized. In particular, recordkeeping and data reporting requirements to meet the demands of insurers, attorneys, third-party payers, patients, and Federal and State government agencies have increased. And now, payment by Ambulatory Payment Groups (APGs) is expected.</B></FONT><P>

Facilities currently handle ambulatory coding in a variety of ways. In some cases, hospitals have centralized coding for outpatients (emergency room/department; outpatient ancillary services [laboratory, radiology]; outpatient clinics; and ambulatory surgery). Typically, when coding is centralized, it is often performed in the medical records or billing departments. When coding is entirely decentralized, it is performed by each outpatient care area. If coding is partially decentralized, the medical records department may be responsible for emergency room/department and ambulatory surgery coding, with the outpatient clinics and ancillary service areas responsible for their own coding. In addition, when hospitals have multiple outpatient clinics, it is often common for each clinic (i.e., internal medicine, pediatrics, OB/GYN) to perform its own coding. In these cases, the number of areas with responsibility for coding frequently depends on the number of separately administered clinics.<P>

The following questions need to be answered by health care facilities preparing for APGs:<P>

<UL><LI>Who is performing outpatient coding?
<LI>What is the volume of cases coded by each outpatient area?
<LI>What source documents are used (medical records; checklists)?
<LI>When are signs or symptoms coded?
<LI>When are V codes used?
<LI>What kinds of coding guidelines are used?
<LI>Who issues these guidelines?
<LI>How many diagnoses and procedures are coded?
<LI>What rules are used to determine the sequencing of these codes?
<LI>What are the qualifications of outpatient coders?
<LI>What kind of training is available?
<LI>What types of quality controls are used to measure coding accuracy?
</UL>

Clearly, outpatient areas should identify resources, such as the code books used for coding. The ease with which the books are updated should also be explored. Sometimes outpatient service units do not use any code books at all. They use preprinted (coded) encounter forms or have outdated code books. Often encoders or other computerized software are used to support coding; these should be identified as well. Sometimes, outpatient coding is performed as a byproduct of the chargemaster function. If so, the chargemaster must be reviewed annually for accuracy and completeness. There should also be a procedure for uniform annual updating of all coding books with official errata or addendum.<P>

It is by no means trivial to ask what is state of the art in outpatient coding. Once descriptive information about the coding process is collected and analyzed, facilities will be in a better position to look at alternatives to the current decentralized approaches. One option is to centralize some or all of the coding activities under one department. In this case, the staff's ability and qualifications to handle additional activity needs to be explored. Resources (budget considerations; training; work space; quality assurance/control mechanisms) required to appropriately address these issues should not be underestimated. Institutional politics, medical staff relationships, and administrative policies and procedures will undoubtedly also need to be considered. It may also be necessary for facilities to re-evaluate the various positions, their formal position descriptions, salary classifications, and other human resource-related issues in their assessment process.<P>

<title>Rx For Success: An Introduction to the Internet</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>RX For Success: An Introduction to the <A HREF = "shortcop3.html#onweb">Internet</A></H2>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>Health care managers use a variety of information referral sources to get answers to common every-day questions that affect their jobs and operations. The abundance of information can be overwhelming with hundreds of journals, reference books, specialty guides, and inservice training courses. If only there was one place we could all go to get the exact information we needed. With the rapid expansion of the information superhighway with literally thousands of new roads and bridges, a one-stop shopping mall is evolving that can provide health care managers with the tools and information they need on virtually any subject area: the Internet.</B></FONT><P>

However, this new technology also brings with it a certain amount of confusion and intimidation. As more and more health care managers are beginning to "get their feet wet" (surfing the net), we at Aspen thought it appropriate to take what we have learned of this vast information resource and pass it along in a three part article designed to introduce our readers to some common protocols, definitions, and road maps to assist you in your early travel adventures.<P>

Evolving from a small group of government computer hubs over 30 years ago, the Internet has expanded into a global supernetwork of services and information sources. While the Internet owes much of its recent glory to online pop culture icons like the Rolling Stones and die-hard Trekkies, health care managers, faculty, students, and executives will find more serious fare on the system. If you can find a local and cost-effective entry point to jump on, you will discover a wealth of health care information just a few keystrokes away. But let's take this journey one step at a time. First we'll offer a brief history of the Internet, with some personal insights and a few tips for first-time users.<P>

As the Internet grew, it developed its own culture and its own language. If you thought GUI, WYSIWYG, and SCSI were tough to decipher, wait until you try to interpret standard Internet road signs. We will provide a brief guide that will help demystify some of the most common terms in part two of our article. In part three of the Internet article, we'll discuss some specific stopping points for health care managers and staff as well as look at some of the Internet's social grace conventions, called "netiquette"-- a must for first time users.<P>

<H3>Some History</H3>

<IMG Align=Left hspace=6 SRC="workstn.gif">The Internet offers just about everyone unparalleled access to information on just about everything from anywhere in the world. But just what is the Internet about and how do you get a freeway pass? First of all, the Internet doesn't really exist in any one place. Instead, it is a loosely linked network of major computer hubs that crisscross the globe. It really got its start in the middle of the Cold War, when the Department of Defense sought to develop a communications system it could rely on if other systems were damaged. This need, coupled with the emerging technology that allowed computers of all types to "talk" with one another over phone lines, gave birth in the 1960's to what is now called the Internet.<P>

The Internet quickly gained favor with government researchers who recognized the benefits of exchanging information electronically. With the National Science Foundation in the lead, the Internet became a "telecommunications backbone" to enhance research and education through open data exchange. The tremendous surge in the availability and use of personal computers really spurred the Internet's growth in popularity in the 1990's. As modem-equipped PCs became common features at home and at work, users looked for ways to use this new technology to improve and enhance their lives. Commercial on-line services (Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online, and others) gained large popularity, providing millions of people from all walks of life with new information, ideas, and opportunities within a few keystrokes.<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.aspensys.com/"><IMG Align=Right border=0 SRC="aspnhome.gif"></A>Today the Internet offers just about everything from census data, government reports, and congressional bills to music reviews, on-line chats, and David Letterman fan clubs. For many corporations the Internet is becoming a primary means of communication with employees and customers via electronic mail. (Aspen's Home Page, which will be discussed in more detail in part two, can be found at the following Internet address, <A HREF = "http://www.aspensys.com/"><B>http://www.aspensys.com</B></A>) Health information managers can find their own bulletin board and information road stop at the Health Information Management-List service (HIM-L). Other places of interest to the health care community include numerous universities, the National Library of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Sciences Library. But just as in a library, it is easy to get lost and frustrated on the Internet if you do not know what you want or where to look. In the meantime, read as much as you can and look for advertisements for "front-ends" for your PC that will help you get to where you are going. Graphical interfaces, such as Mosaic (available in most computer stores) and World Wide Web Browser (offered free to Prodigy members), will help you navigate the Internet easily.<P>

<title>FOCUS ON: ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2><A HREF = "novmtg.html">FOCUS ON</A>: ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee May Meeting</H2>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>The <A HREF = "vcodes.html">ICD-9-CM</A> Coordination and Maintenance Committee met in Washington, DC on May 5, 1995 to discuss proposals for the 1997 Fiscal year. The FY 1996 recommendations have already been finalized and will be published in early June in the Federal Register.</B></FONT><P>

A detailed presentation of laparoscopic appendectomies preceded the proposal for new codes for this procedure. A fourth digit would be added to the present code to distinguish the laparoscopic approach. 47.01 & 47.11 for open appendectomy and 47.02 & 47.12 for laparoscopic appendectomy. This was the only new procedure presented.<P>

There were several diagnosis additions and revisions proposed. Two conditions were presented by the American Academy of Dermatology. The first was a new code for disseminated superficial actinic poro-keratosis (DSAP), often a precursor to squamous cell skin cancer, was proposed in the solar radiation category, 692.75.  The second was pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which is a common inflammatory skin condition late in pregnancy but has no specific code in the pregnancy category.<P>

The effects of smoking on various diseases was again discussed. Modifications to the tabular index were recommended to better capture this relationship.<P> 

The dilemma of how to code the self removal of a feeding tube was also discussed. 
Further refinement of the atherosclerosis fifth digits were proposed for internal mammary and other specified bypass grafts.<P>

Due to expanded neurological testing possibilities, new fifth digits were proposed in category 315.4 coordination disorders to separate specific syndromes.<P>

New fifth digits were also proposed with tabular modifications to specify whether or not an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery is intracranial.<P>

Code 483.1 is proposed for chlamydial pneumonia.<P>
 
A new code (079.6) and tabular modifications were suggested for respiratory syncytial virus, often the cause of bronchiolitis in children.<P>

A request was discussed for non-menopausal hot flashes. No conclusion was drawn and comments will be considered.<P>

Tabular modifications and coding guidelines were requested for the problem of redundancy in the use of concussion with head injury. Basically code 854 should not be used with any conditions classifiable to 850-853.<P>

A new code 519.5 was proposed for mechanical complication of the respiratory ventilator.<P>
 
Code 997.6 was revised to clarify the use of the amputation stump complication code. The word "late" will be deleted so the code should be used regardless of the time since the amputation.<P>

Also in the complication category a fifth digit specification has been proposed for "non-healing wound," code 997.92.<P>

<IMG Align=Right SRC="meeting.gif">A modification was presented to simplify the multiple coding of cholelithiasis of multiple sites.<P>

Further proposals will be made in December 1995 and finalized in June 1996. Detail and comments on the specifics of these proposals can be made by contacting the following:<P>

<CENTER><B>The National Center for Health Statistics</B><BR>
<B>Morbidity Classification Branch, Rm. 954</B><BR>
<B>6525 Belcrest Road</B><BR>
<B>Hyattsville, MD 20782</B><P></CENTER>

In addition to the regular agenda, a presentation was made on the proposed ICD-10 Procedures Coding System (PCS). This contract has been awarded to 3M Healthcare as a new coding system for inpatient procedures. A three year project term has begun, but no proposed date of implementation has been set. The system will be based on a seven digit alphanumeric code with each character having specific meaning such as body system, site, approach, and device.<P>

The codes will be extremely specific and require exact documentation in the record to define all digits accurately. A site specific index will likely be in table format and require precise anatomy and medical/surgical terminology skills. Because of the huge amount of codes being proposed, computerization of the system will be essential.<P>

SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Contracted Services for Medical Records Departments</H2>
<H3>It is becoming increasingly common for health care organizations 
to use outside contractors to manage their operations, especially 
their patient accounts and medical records. Contractors are also 
being used in the area of information systems. What factors have 
led to the increased use of management contractors? </H3>

One factor is that health care facilities are placing greater 
emphasis on cost containment. Administrators are under increasing 
pressure to reduce staffing levels, and as a result, personnel 
costs (salaries and associate benefits) are a likely target when 
mandates for savings are given. The shortage of qualified, 
seasoned professionals presents another staffing problem. <A HREF = "winwin.html">Contract 
management companies</A> are frequently able to attract and compete 
more successfully than individual facilities for persons with top-level expertise. Additionally, larger, more established contract 
management firms such as <A HREF = "hospbene.html">Aspen Systems Corporation</A> can provide 
backup services and additional technical support for the 
recruitment process that are often not available to a single 
facility. Moreover, Aspen is able to apply what it learns from one 
account or client to improve service to other clients.
<P>

Another reason a health care organization may decide to use a 
contractor is that a contracted management company can help the 
organization determine its information management needs. For 
example, before negotiating a contract for medical records 
services, administrators must obtain critical information about 
the existing department or functional area benefitting from the 
services. Often, having these departments managed by an outside 
contractor is justified when issues of cost and quality are 
considered. However, to make an informed decision about the true 
need for a contractor, your organization must collect objective 
information about the current volume and level of services 
provided and the costs of providing these services. It is 
important to carefully document the costs of providing existing 
medical record services in order to complete an accurate cost-benefit analysis of the option to "contract out." Additionally, 
once the decision is made to hire a management contractor, an 
analysis of alternative proposals from qualified firms should be 
conducted.
<P>

Administrators who are considering hiring a contractor to manage 
their medical records departments, or selected areas within these 
departments, should decide what the minimum services to be 
provided by the management company are; what the duties and 
responsibilities of the facility and the management firm will be; 
and what the economic limitations of the relationship are. It is 
also vital to clearly delineate cost and quality performance 
indicators. In assessing proposals, you should at the very least 
consider the reputation, performance, and resources of the 
management company and review the resumes for key onsite and 
offsite management personnel. And of course, a careful analysis of 
the financial aspects of the proposals is always necessary.<P>

<IMG Align=Left SRC="handshak.gif">At Aspen we see ourselves as a partner with each of our clients. 
When running your department or functional area, we are an 
extension of your staff. Additionally, we keep our clients 
informed of exactly what we are doing to improve medical record 
services and how we are implementing improvements.

<title>Rx For Success: Optical Imaging</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3

Getting the Right System</H2>
<H3>Is your health care organization considering purchasing an 
optical imaging system to manage its clinical or administrative 
records? If so, you must decide which system, among the many 
available, to purchase. An organization needs a proven, fail-safe 
method of finding a system that meets its information management 
needs and can accommodate or be integrated with its current level 
of automation. The structured analysis approach, the 
method Aspen recommends its clients use for choosing a system, takes these needs into consideration.</H3>

Health care organizations typically use two methods to select 
optical imaging systems: colleague recommendations and vendor 
demonstrations. While these two methods are inexpensive and easy 
to employ in the short term, they are often unreliable.<P>

The structured analysis approach is the most objective way 
for your health care organization to analyze the functional and 
economic value of the information systems available to it. When 
considering how to use an optical imaging system in a health care 
facility, the organization should ask the following questions:<P>

<UL><LI> Who needs the information?
<LI> What information is needed?
<LI> Where does the information come from?
<LI> When is the information needed?
<LI> Why is this information needed?
</UL>

It is only after these questions are answered from the 
perspective of all of the potential users of the optical imaging 
system that the organization can identify the features (referred 
to as functional and technical requirements) it needs in the 
system. Armed with this information, the organization will be 
better prepared to select the <I>right</I> system. The organization can 
then determine if purchasing a system with these features is 
economically feasible.<P>

<title>Maybe It's Time To Redesign</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Maybe It's <A HREF = "intrview.html">Time To Redesign</A></H2>
<H3>You've reengineered and restructured. You've established continuous quality improvement programs and quality circles, trained your staff in the principles of total quality management, upgraded your information systems, and studied up on change management. Yet, you still find yourself struggling with process bottlenecks, exploding costs, and incessant pressure to become "more efficient." Your hospital may be a candidate for <A HREF = "aspoffrs.html">operational redesign.</A></H3>
			
Operational redesign emphasizes the functioning of the hospital as a whole rather 
than as a set of separate, specialized departments or disciplines. By adopting this 
simple change in perspective and conducting thorough, systematic evaluations, 
hospital managers can make hospital operations more cost-effective and bring about dramatic improvements in patient and employee satisfaction.<P>

Operational redesign challenges the conventional assumption that most problems 
in the organization are caused by a lack of adequate resources. If the available 
resources are believed to be inadequate, then each department will fight for its share of them. The available resources may, in fact, be perfectly adequate to support the functions of the hospital--there may even be a surplus of some resources--but they must be distributed and managed appropriately.<P> 

Consider the typical hospital in which resources and personnel are organized 
around specialized clinical and administrative departments. In an effort to make the 
organization more cost-effective, hospital executives often "challenge" department 
managers to improve service, reduce staffing, and increase productivity, while 
cutting costs. The financial performance of each department is inevitably compared 
to that of other departments within the hospital. In this atmosphere, it is difficult to 
initiate creative solutions outside the boundaries of the department. For example, a 
manager from one department who suggests that changes should be made in other 
departments will usually get a hostile response from the managers of those 
departments. Thus, the traditional, department-focused structure of a hospital 
encourages competition for resources, but does not necessarily promote the optimal distribution of those resources.<P>

But what if there truly is not enough money, staff, equipment, space, or information 
to meet the hospital's needs? Operational redesign can help in two ways. First, by 
redistributing the available resources to maximize their impact, operational 
redesign can improve the functioning of a struggling organization. Second, by 
determining which resources are most urgently needed, operational redesign can be used to set priorities for making potential improvements or acquisitions, or to make choices between essential resources and less critical ones.<P>

<IMG Align=Right SRC="watch.gif">Some hospitals have introduced patient-focused care initiatives to shift the emphasis from the department to the patient. Decentralization of services, cross-training of staff, and point-of-care data collection and delivery systems are some of the methods used to provide patients with the best possible care. In patient-focused care models, the patient, as the customer, is the ultimate judge of the quality of the service provided.<P>

In truth, patients are not the only customers you need to be concerned about. 
Patients, third-party payors, insurance companies, employer coalitions, and 
employees each have different requirements, expectations, and perspectives that 
must be accommodated. Through an operational redesign initiative, the hospital 
staff can learn to systematically determine the true source of problems and devise 
creative approaches for handling them that take into account the needs of all 
customers.<P>

An operational redesign project may be conducted by your hospital staff or with the 
help of a redesign consultant. In the most successful redesign efforts, the consultant is a facilitator who guides the hospital staff in developing and implementing a redesign plan rather than a mysterious figure who shows up to collect data and reappears months later with a final report. Of course, operational redesign cannot solve all the problems in the hospital; some problems are confined to a single department, procedure, or system, and must be addressed at those levels. But for persistent, complex problems that seem to defy solution, operational redesign may be the strategy that enables your staff to develop the problem-solving skills they need to keep your hospital competitive.<P>

<I>For more information about operational redesign and how it can benefit your 
healthcare organization, contact Kathleen Strouse at (800) 395-5055.</I><P>

<title>Coding Corner: AMA Publishes 1995 CPT Manual</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Coding Corner: AMA Publishes 1995 CPT Manual</H2>
<H3>The American Medical Association (AMA) has released the <I>1995 
Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology Manual,</I> effective for 
most payors on January 1, 1995. The manual features a new dual 
column layout on 8 1/2" x 11" pages. It also includes additional 
clinical examples, which are located in Appendix D. More 
importantly, the editors have revised the descriptions of many 
codes in hopes of improving clarity and consistency in use. Other 
revisions reflect new technology or prevailing terminology, such 
as the change of the term "radionuclide" to "radiopharmaceutical." 
In addition, more procedures are now designated as "Separate 
Procedures" and should not be coded when carried out in 
conjunction with other more complex procedures.</H3>

Throughout the Surgical Section, terms that reflected the reason 
for a particular procedure (that is, the diagnosis) have been 
deleted or are given only as examples of diagnoses. In some cases, 
codes are designated for general use. (See, for example, code 
25000, Release of deQuervain's Disease.)<P>

Another general trend is the change in the use of key phrases such 
as "with biopsy." In this phrase, the word "for" was often 
replaced by "with." Health care providers should carefully read 
each description, noting the position of the semicolon, to 
determine what is included with some basic procedure "packages."<P>

In the Respiratory System Section, codes pertaining to sinus 
endoscopy surgery have been completely revised. The guidelines 
preceding the section remain the same, but multiple codes have 
been deleted and consolidated into single codes. Careful review of 
the operative report, thorough understanding of the anatomy of the 
nasal area, and communication with surgeons is essential for 
accurate reporting of these procedures.<P>

There are very few changes to the Radiology, Pathology, and 
Laboratory Sections this year. However, the Physical Medicine and 
Rehabilitation Section (formerly called the EEG and Physical 
Medicine Section) has major changes to reflect current practice. 
Look for new definitions and new codes for procedures that were 
not included in the old manual. For example, time variables for 
physical therapy have been revised. In addition, mislabeled 
procedures have been moved under their correct categories. 
According to presenters at this year's AMA CPT Update Workshop in 
Chicago, editors of the manual will continue to make long overdue 
revisions of this type over the next couple of years.<P>

Guidelines in several subsections (the History, Examination, and 
Complexity of Decisionmaking subsections) of the Evaluation and 
Management Section that were vague and misleading have also been 
rewritten. Details of the changes in the Preventive Medicine 
Section are included in winter 1994 volume of <I>CPT Assistant.</I> 
According to this publication, a patient's age determines how 
often he or she will make preventive medicine visits to the 
doctor. When a problem or abnormality is found during such a 
visit, two Evaluation and Management codes may be required to 
fully describe the complex process leading to the diagnosis. 
Modifier 25 has been revised to include this scenario.<P>

Without a new CPT '95, you cannot accurately bill patients, 
insurance companies, etc., for services rendered. Only a brief 
list of the additions, deletions, and revisions to last year's 
codes are provided in Appendix B of the 1994 CPT manual.<P>

When assigning codes to services you provide, read and apply the 
complete text of each guideline and code description. Coding staff 
and medical staff must work together to make sure medical record 
documentation accurately reflects the service provided, 
particularly in these first few months when the new codes are 
being implemented.<P>

The start of a new year is an ideal time to make sure your CPT 
coding staff is coding accurately and consistently. Aspen Systems 
Corporation can help you evaluate coding quality and train your 
staff in all aspects of CPT and <A HREF = "shortcopy.html#compendi">ICD-9CM</A> coding.<P>

<title>Aspen To Conduct Data Quality Reviews for CHA</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Aspen To Conduct Data Quality Reviews for CHA</H2>
<H3>Aspen was awarded a contract from the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) to conduct <A HREF = "dataqual.html">data quality studies</A> at hospitals throughout the State. Aspen will assist the CHA's Clinical Information Task Force, which is appointed by and includes Health Information Management directors of the State's hospitals, in assessing the accuracy, uniformity, and validity of coded and abstracted patient information. Hospitals submit this information to the Connecticut Health Information Management & Exchange Program (CHIME), an affiliate of CHA, where it is entered into a statewide data base.</H3>

In a "white paper" about the planned release of CHIME hospital data to the public, 
CHA's Clinical Information Task Force expressed concern about data accuracy. 
Among the issues addressed in the paper were the effects that medical record 
documentation, fiscal pressures, and institutional information systems and 
procedures have on data quality.<P>

<IMG Align=Right SRC="reports.gif">The paper outlined three CHA task force initiatives intended to improve the 
reliability of hospital discharge data:<P> 

<UL><LI>The formation of a CHIME Data Quality Task Force to recommend improvements in the procedure for editing the hospital data received by CHIME.
<LI>The implementation of a statewide external review process.
<LI>The development of a statewide coder education program to promote uniformity in hospital coding and abstracting of patient information.
</UL>

After obtaining the support of Connecticut hospitals for these initiatives, CHIME 
issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for assistance with the external reviews of data quality. Aspen responded to the RFP with a proposal outlining how it would 
conduct coding and abstracting quality reviews in Connecticut hospitals and was 
selected for the job.<P>

CHIME sent letters to the administrators of the 31 CHA member hospitals describing the project and encouraging each hospital to participate in semiannual reviews of data quality to be performed by Aspen. To date, most of the hospitals have agreed to participate and to pay for the reviews. Reviews will be conducted on a carefully selected sample of patient records, thereby permitting statistically reliable results. From these reviews, reports will be generated that describe the findings in each facility, identify any differences found between hospital-coded and Aspen-coded data, and explain the apparent reasons for those differences.
<P>

It is expected that the hospitals will use findings from the reviews to improve not 
only the quality of the data sample reviewed, but also of data submitted to CHIME in 
the future. Findings will also be used in statewide coder education efforts and may 
result in revisions to the procedure for reporting and editing CHIME data.<P>

<title>Blind Spots?</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Are There Blind Spots in Your Patient Satisfaction Data?</H2>
<H3>In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on measuring patient satisfaction with health care services. Patient satisfaction data help management determine the direction for change and encourage health care organizations to be accountable for their operations. Health care professionals in hospital settings, HMOs, and physician offices understand the need to listen to patients closely and regularly and collect data on the their perceptions about service. Surveys are the primary instrument used for measuring patient satisfaction levels and determining future needs. They may be conducted by mail, telephone, or in person immediately after the service is provided.</H3>

Health care organizations that conduct patient satisfaction surveys want to learn how patients feel about their services and staff. Satisfaction scales are frequently used to measure patient satisfaction with specific services, such as medical care, nursing care, laboratory services, and housekeeping. Surveys are also used to find out what patients think of more general services, such as how staff explain procedures and treatments and length of waiting time. <P>

<IMG Align=left SRC="handcirc.gif">In most situations, management can predict survey results. Although patient satisfaction data may provide a few "surprises," they tend to confirm and quantify what health care managers already know about the operations of their organizations. In their desire to appear informed of patient needs and opinions, health care professionals are sometimes reluctant to admit that certain aspects of the survey results were unexpected.<P>  

For this reason, and to be as accurate and objective as possible, the survey should be periodically administered to the managers--in other words, managers should be asked how well they think the organization is performing. The survey results from both parties--managers and patients--can then be compared to point out any discrepancies. If the discrepancy exceeds 20 percent, there is a "blind spot" that requires closer examination. The results of this blind spot analysis can focus the change effort on the appropriate service or staff, rather than on an inappropriate area.<P>

NAME="deptass">Department Assessment: The Key to Improvement</A></H2>
Is it time for a performance checkup? Is your department meeting 
the needs of its customers? Have you been asked to evaluate and 
analyze the performance of your department's services? Are you 
involved in setting budget and financial policy priorities that 
might lead to staffing reductions or layoffs? Is your organization 
preparing for the computerized patient record? If you can answer 
yes to any of these questions, it might be time to conduct a 
formal review of your department's operations.
<P>
Aspen provides technical support to facilities assessing the 
operations of their departments that manage medical records, 
patient accounts, and information systems. As part of our 
services, we will do the following:<P>

<UL><LI> Identify the operating procedures, data flows, reporting systems, quality controls, and productivity standards.
<LI> Analyze the department's operations.
<LI> Identify problems and set priorities for solving them.
<LI> Suggest ways to improve departmental functions and capabilities in response to expected functional changes.
<LI> Develop department business plans.
</UL>

When performing a review of the department's operations, one of 
the first steps is to evaluate the efficiency, productivity, and 
accuracy of the operation. A review of operations usually includes 
making recommended changes that relate to staffing, workflow, 
procedures, and standards. Changes to department operations may be 
necessary to continue to provide current services or to enhance 
services.<P>

To function effectively, the facility's departments cannot operate 
in isolation from the activities of the organization as a whole. 
Services are provided most successfully when 1) there is sound 
administration and information management, 2) the mission of the 
organization is understood, and 3) the lines of responsibility and 
authority are firmly established. In applying its proven 
techniques for health care management, Aspen takes into 
consideration the mission and political nature of the 
organization, as well as the dynamics of today's ever changing 
industry regulations and requirements.<P>

Cysteamine bitartrate has been approved for treatment of 
nephropathic cystinosis. About 200 children in the United States 
suffer from this disease, in which the amino acid cystine 
accumulates in kidney tubules, leading to progressive kidney 
failure, weak bones, and stunted growth. In studies early

<title>Hospitals Benefit...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Hospitals Benefit From Aspen's Management of Their 
Medical Record Departments</H2>
<H3>Housekeeping. Dietary services. Emergency rooms. These are just some of 
the hospital departments that have turned to <A HREF = "contract.html">contract management</A> to 
improve their operations and reduce costs. Even the administration of 
hospitals has been contracted out to organizations that specialize in that 
area. Medical record departments are no exception. Aspen Systems 
provides contract management to medical record departments. In some 
cases, Aspen manages the entire department; in others, only certain 
functions are managed.</H3>
<P>
Aspen has been able to improve operations and reduce operating costs in 
the medical record departments and the functional areas it manages 
because of its wide-ranging expertise in medical record operations. Aspen 
contract management provides a distinct advantage over the hiring by the 
hospital of a single individual to solve all the problems a department or 
functional area might have. While one person may have significant 
expertise in one or two areas, he or she generally cannot provide a high 
level of expertise in all required areas, and are limited also by the 
multiple demands on their time.</p>
<P>
In contrast to other medical record consulting organizations, Aspen brings 
<I>a team approach</I> to the management of medical record departments as 
well as to the management of specific department functions, such as 
coding. Our health information professionals have significant expertise 
and experience in all areas of medical record operations, including:</p>
<DIR>
<LI>information systems planning and implementation;
<LI>chart completion;
<LI>policy and procedure development;
<LI>coding and abstracting;
<LI>record system management;
<LI>utilization review;
<LI>transcription services;
<LI>microfilming; and
<LI>optical disk system selection.
</DIR>
<P>
Aspen is able to evaluate all aspects of existing department operations 
and provide both prescriptions and implementation at far less cost than a 
hospital would incur hiring permanent staff to do it. Staff with specific 
expertise are available to review each problem area in depth, and develop 
and initiate its resolution. Implementation of solutions may involve still 
other Aspen staff, when appropriate.</p>
<P>
The advantages to hospitals lie in their ability to use Aspen's staff of 
experts without having to hire permanent staff. Aspen staff are provided 
in each instance only for as long as they are needed to solve given 
problems, and implement permanent improvements. In most settings, 
Aspen provides a full-time manager or supervisor, with department staff 
either remaining hospital employees or becoming Aspen employees.
<P>
Aspen's contract management efforts in medical record departments have 
resulted in:</p>
<DIR>
<LI>Significant reductions in accounts receivable and operating costs (Aspen's charges 
have more than paid for themselves!);
<LI>Elimination of backlogs (coding, release of information, loose report filing, etc.);
<LI>Improvement in service to other departments (both internal and external 
"customers");
<LI>Improvement in turnaround time (transcription, coding/abstracting, chart deficiency 
analysis, record retrieval, etc.);
<LI>Elimination of duplicative efforts;
<LI>Development of performance standards (productivity and quality) for each 
department task;
<LI>Development of job descriptions, policy and procedure manuals;
<LI>Redefinition of documentation requirements in medical records;
<LI>In-service training sessions for department staff; and
<LI>Streamlining of file operations.</DIR>
<H4><I>If you would like to discuss the potential of contract management of your entire 
medical record department, or a functional area within it, contact Paul Gustafson, 
Director, Health Records Services, at (800) 395-5055.</I></H4>

<title>OIG Releases Report...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>OIG Releases Report on Coding Physician Services</H2>
<H3>The Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human 
Services, has recently (May 1994) released a report which "describes the 
vulnerabilities in the maintenance, use, and management of the Current 
Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4) as they relate to Medicare 
reimbursements."</H3>
<P>
The report, entitled "The Coding of Physician Services" (OEI-03-91-00920) is based on a 
two-phase inspection process. The first phase involved the compilation and review of 25 
reports on CPT-4-related topics. The second phase involved contacting 41 medical 
specialty societies, 12 Medicare carriers, the American Medical Association, the 
American Health Information Management Association, the American Hospital 
Association, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, and the Health Insurance 
Association of America. In addition, an on-line search of a data base of medical journals 
was searched to identify CPT-4-related articles.
<P>
A companion report, entitled "A Compendium of Reports and Literature on 
Coding of Physician Services" (OEI-03-91-00921), provides a detailed 
summary of each document. Some of the findings included the following: 1) 
Incorrect coding affects Medicare reimbursement and causes inequities in 
payment under the Medicare Fee Schedule. 2) The methods by which HCFA 
has incorporated CPT-4 into Medicare's coding system do not ensure 
appropriate reimbursement to Medicare providers. A series of 
recommendations were made to HCFA and AMA to address these and other 
issues identified by the OIG. Contact the OIG if you want more information 
on these reports.</p>

<title>Rx for Success...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Rx 
FOR SUCCESS: Scale Your Systems Security Level To Value and Content</H2>
<H3>The level of security established for a system or group of systems, and 
the effort and cost expended to maintain that level of security should be 
scaled to the value of the system and its contents to the organization. For 
example, it may not be cost effective to apply a security program suitable 
for a large mainframe computer room to a small, PC-based office 
automation system supporting a non-critical operation.</H3>
<P>
Therefore, one of the first elements in developing a successful security 
program is the analysis of existing systems, data, and security practices. 
After information on these components is understood, an approach and plan 
can be developed to move the system(s) to an appropriate level of 
security.
<P>
Information that may be considered during this evaluation includes: 1) the 
nature of the systems, the criticality of the data to the organization, and 
the impact of system damage or data loss; 2) the adequacy of the administrative, 
management, and technical approaches used to protect the 
systems; 3) organizational and individual responsibility, and accountability for security; 
and 4) requirements for additional security, standards, training, and updated technology. 
At this point, a list of security requirements and policies can be developed.
<P>
A second step is the evaluation of the organization, policies, system, and 
physical plant to identify and document potential vulnerabilities and 
threats. Probabilities of occurrence and impact estimate are developed for 
each risk. Recommendations can then be made and costs estimated to eliminate or reduce 
these risks.
<P>
The third step in the development of a system security plan is the 
development of an outline of tasks, objectives, and schedules required to 
meet the requirements identified and implement the recommendations to 
reduce identified risks and threats. This may include topics such as new 
programs required, security software to be implemented, as well as 
specific procedures to be implemented, such as password assignment and 
update, control of application additions, system management, network 
access, and physical security.
<P>
The results of these steps are then collected into a comprehensive 
security plan for approval, funding, and implementation. The final plan 
should also include the assignment of specific responsibilities and 
mechanisms for review, updating, and reevaluation of requirements and 
risks.
<P>
One additional aspect of system security is that of contingency planning 
and the establishment of mechanisms for continuing operations in the 
event that critical automated systems are unavailable for use. This topic 
will be discussed in the next issue of this newsletter.</p>

<title>1994 JCAHO Information Management...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>1994 JCAHO Information Management Standards 
Announced</H2>
<H3><I>Part Three: The New Information Management (IM) JCAHO 
Standards</I></H3>
<H3>In Parts One and Two of this article, we mentioned that information management 
standards are now part of Section 2 of the AHM, <i>Organizational Functions</i>, along 
with leadership and improving organizational performance. According to the Joint 
Commission's preamble and principles for this new set of standards, "the goal of 
information management is to obtain, manage, and use information to enhance and 
improve individual and organizational performance in patient care, governance, 
management, and support processes."</H3>
<P>
This set of new and newly regrouped standards describe a vision of effective and 
continuously improving information management in health care organizations. The 
objectives related to achieving this vision are:
<DIR>
<LI>more timely and easier access to complete information throughout the organization;
<LI>improved data accuracy;
<LI>demonstrated balance of proper levels of security versus ease of access;
<LI>use of aggregate data, along with external knowledge bases and comparative data, to 
pursue opportunities for improvement;
<LI>redesign of important information-related processes to improve efficiency; and
<li>greater collaboration and information sharing to enhance patient care.
</DIR>
<P>
The new IM standards focus on the key IM areas of Planning, Patient-Specific Data, 
Aggregate Data, Knowledge-based Data and Comparative 
Performance Data and Information. The standards are broken down into six 
key processes:
<DIR>
<LI>identification of the organization's information needs;
<LI>structural design of the information management system;
<LI>definition and capture of data/information;
<LI>data analysis and transformation of data into information;
<LI>transmission and reporting of information; and
<li>assimilation and use of information.
</DIR>
<P>
From these six key processes, the JCAHO has developed ten major 
standards for the Management of Information. Each of the respective 
standards are broken down into substandard categories of proficiency. The 
organization's leaders have important roles and responsibilities if an 
organization-wide approach to IM will be achieved, maintained, and 
improved. The "Improving Organizational Performance" chapter of the AMH 
will be used to design, measure, assess, and improve the organization's 
performance of the JCAHO IM standards. These standards are used to apply 
dimensions of performance which are "Doing the Right Things" and "Doing 
the Right Things Well" in the six key IM processes described above.
<P>
The management of information standards survey process will involve a 
combination of group and individual interviews, document review, 
performance outcome measurement, and observations. As the IM standards 
are focused on every aspect of health care, the interviews will take place 
in every hospital department. The majority of the new IM standards affect 
the information management and medical record departments.
<P>
The above IM processes, which are used by the Joint Commission to 
establish the new and regrouped IM standards, will require additional 
planning and preparation for the next JCAHO inspection. The new IM 
functional area will present new challenges for virtually every 
department within your health care organization.</p>
<H4><I>Aspen functional and technical experts can help your organization or hospital 
department prepare for an upcoming JCAHO inspection. For more information contact 
Len Fogelsonger at (800) 395-5055.</I>

<title>Coding Corner...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Coding Corner: Focus on V-Codes</H2>
<H3>Numerous health information statistical reports are generated in hospitals and 
government agencies across the nation on a daily basis. To the non-Medical Record 
practitioner, the <A HREF = "focus97.html">ICD-9-CM</A> codes used in these reports may look more like alphabet soup 
than statistical information. Why are there V and E's in front of some of the codes? 
Hospitals and physicians are instructed to follow "V-code" reporting guidelines for 
outpatient services yet insurance providers may or may not "accept" V-codes. What 
exactly is a V-code anyway?</H3>
<P>
Within ICD-9-CM are two supplementary classifications that are used as "diagnosis" 
codes. The first is called the "Supplementary Classification of 
Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services." Each 
code in this supplement begins with a V. The second supplement is a 
classification of External Causes of Injury and Poisoning (E800-E999). In 
this issue we will focus on the V-code definitions and basic guidelines.
<P>
The V-code classification provides codes for patient encounters or 
situations that are not injuries or diseases. The use of V-codes generally 
fall into three types of circumstance:
<DL>
<DD><P>
1. When a person is currently not ill but requires health services for another purpose such 
as to act as a donor, receive a prophylactic vaccination, well visit, counseling, or special 
screening. These services would generally be provided in the outpatient setting. Inpatient 
newborns are also categorized with a V-code.
<DD><P>
2. When a problem or circumstance impacts the patient's care in either inpatient or 
outpatient settings, but are not current diseases or injuries. Many times the presence of a 
history of certain conditions such as cancer or previous surgery may require additional 
tests, monitoring, etc. V-codes describe these health factors. Per coding guidelines, these 
codes would not be acceptable as principle diagnoses.
<DD><P>
3. When a person encounters health care services in follow-up to a current or healing 
condition for specific treatment. Examples include admission for chemotherapy, 
admission for dialysis, attention to dressings, and admission for removal of orthopedic 
devices.
</DL>
<P>
Generally, these codes are listed as principal diagnoses in either the 
outpatient or inpatient setting.
<P>
These are the most confusing V-codes because the patient's current disease or injury is 
also coded as a secondary "diagnosis" code, as well as a procedure code for the service 
provided. The codes are designed to distinguish between encounters solely for primarily 
non-surgical specialized treatment and more complex encounters to diagnose or otherwise 
medically or surgically care for the patient. For example, an admission for chemotherapy 
(V58. 1) is generally 
short and predictable in patient resource consumption and outcome. Whereas the 
admission to work-up and originally treat a cancer patient would be much more extensive 
and varied depending on the type of cancer and surgical involvement.
<P>
Reporting guidelines for V-codes are the same as for other diagnosis 
codes. The definitions of principal and secondary diagnoses apply. If a V-
code is the reason chiefly responsible for the patient's encounter it should 
be used as the principal diagnosis (exceptions are noted in code books). For 
patients receiving ancillary diagnostic services only, the appropriate V-code is sequenced 
first, such as V72.5, Radiologic Examination. For further 
use of V-codes in the outpatient setting, see <I>Coding Clinic</I>, First Quarter 
1990.
<P>
To be reported as a secondary diagnosis, V-codes must meet the criteria 
for all secondary diagnoses and impact the patient's current encounter. 
Many V-codes for previous or family history may apply to the patient, but 
not impact the current admission.
<P>
Coders may find the proper V-codes by looking in the ICD-9-CM index 
under headings such as Aftercare, Carrier, Checkup, Counseling, 
Examination, Follow-up, History, Observation, Screening, Status or 
Supervision. Generally the supplemental classification is short enough 
that the experienced coder can quickly find an applicable V-code by 
perusing the main headings.
<P>
Coders should be particularly aware of those V-codes that are 
complication/co-morbidity (CC) codes possibly impacting the DRG 
assignment. These include some of the status post organs replaced by 
transplant (V42.0-V42.8), insufficient prenatal care (V23.7), and 
respirator dependence (V46.1).</p>

particular health care setting and training needs. Contact Meryl Bloomrosen at (800) 395-

<title>1995 Coding and DRG Changes</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=5 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>HCFA Publishes 1995 Coding and DRG Changes</H2>
<H3>The <A HREF = "areyou.html">Health Care Financing Administration</A> has published its proposed rules 
for FY 1995. On May 27, 1994, the <I>Federal Register</I> included several ICD-9-CM 
coding changes for the upcoming year. These proposed codes 
typically become finalized without any major revisions and are published 
in early September with an effective date of October 1, 1994.</H3>
<H3>As in previous years, most of the new codes involve the addition of a new 
fourth or fifth digit to provide greater specificity. Examples of this type 
of change include:</H3>
<IMG SRC="hcfatabl.gif"><BR>
<P>
In an unusual change, specificity has been decreased in the coding of HIV 
disease. Code 042 will now replace code 042.0-044.9. This should provide 
greater consistency in HIV reporting. A new code, V08 has been added for 
asymptomatic HIV infection status and 795.71 for nonspecific serologic evidence of HIV. 
Look for <I>Coding Clinic</I> guidelines on the use of these new codes soon after the 
Final Rule is published.
<P>
Other conditions with new codes include: Late effect of complication of 
obstetrical conditions, Fragile X syndrome, benign shuddering attacks, 
late effect of adverse effect of drug, amputation status, prophylactic 
organ removal, and problems related to lifestyle.
<P>
Three new procedure codes have been added: Creation of pleuroperitoneal 
shunt 34.05, Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant 41.04, and 
infusion of biological response modifier 99.28.
<P>
Each year there are adjustments to the DRG classifications to reflect 
changes in treatment patterns, technology or other factors. For FY '95 only 
minor revisions have been proposed involving moving code 694.1 to DRG's 
283/284 and changing the surgical hierarchy for MDC 2 and 3. A limited 
number of revisions to the CC exclusion list involving related or new 
codes are also proposed. Lastly, a few procedures such as excision of 
lymph structures, lower limb amputations and pacemaker codes included 
in DRG's 468, 476 and 477 were shifted to more pertinent DRG's where 
indicated.</p>

<H4><I>Detailed coding changes with explanations will be published separately by 
Aspen and can be obtained by contacting Michelle Watson at (800) 395-
5055.</I></H4>

<title>Aspen Offers...</title><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG align=left hspace=3 
SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2>Aspen Offers <A HREF = "redesign.html">Operations Analysis</A> Services to Clients</H2>
<H3>Health information management departments must continually cope with 
change. As Congress finalizes what version of health care reform we will 
see, one of the first questions many will ask about the plan is how will it 
affect my job? My organization? As the Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations develops and refines its newest 
information management standards, health care facilities will wonder 
how they will respond to ever changing health data reporting 
requirements. As state health care organizations structure new 
regulations governing costs and access to health care, health care 
facilities will once again face additional demands to release patient 
information.</H3>
<P>
On top of this, today's administrators face increasing pressures to operate 
their facilities and departments with restraint. They're often faced with 
staff vacancies, budget cuts, hiring freezes, and staff reductions. <I>How to 
do more with less?</I> The demands for outstanding, client/patient-oriented 
services are evident even in the face of these pressures. The need to 
provide efficient and effective health information management services is 
strong and the consequences of failing to provide such services are 
dramatic. Consequently, many institutions are looking for guidance in 
conducting internal departmental evaluations and analysis to review and 
improve their current business practices.</p>
<P>
For health information management (HIM) departments, conducting a 
management audit and operations evaluation involves a review of all 
activities conducted within the HIM department but also requires a review 
of the records and information processing functions throughout the entire 
organization. Effective HIM departments cannot operate in isolation from 
the activities of the organization as a whole. At the very least, successful 
HIM services require sound principles of administration and information 
management, clear understanding of the mission of the organization, and 
established lines of responsibility and authority. HIM departments require 
extensive and detailed policies and procedures that govern the operations 
of the department and promote the objectives of the facility. 
Nevertheless, there are wide variations in practice in implementing the 
basic HIM functions, and the quality and productivity measures used to 
monitor compliance with standards. In this article, we address achieving 
efficiencies in the HIM department while gaining greater control and 
management of HIM functions.</p>
<P>
To begin, let's start with some basic questions:</p>
<DIR>
<LI>What is your organizational mission? Who are your clients? How can you serve 
them better?
<LI>What are the fundamental operational, functional, and performance characteristics of 
the HIM processes that can be identified as candidates for improvements? How and 
where in the process can changes be made? What are the strengths and weaknesses of 
current operations?
<li>What resources are available to help with this activity?
</DIR>
<P>
Once you have answered these questions, the next step is to identify the 
goals of your evaluation. Once you have refined your goals, you can begin to 
implement a series of activities to meet them.
<P>
Determining what you need to accomplish will help you set the scope of 
your project, given your budget and time constraints, as well as personnel 
limitations. To begin, identify any problem areas by analyzing your 
operations and the existing organization. This includes a review of 
existing operating policies and procedures, data and work flows, reporting 
systems, quality controls, and performance standards. This is frequently 
done by conducting a series of data gathering activities (such as 
observation, interviews, job analysis questionnaires, work flow 
assessments and activity reporting). Once problems are described, 
quantify and prioritize them.
<P>
The next step is to develop solutions to those problems. You must identify 
ways to improve departmental functions and capabilities in response to 
expected functional changes in order to enhance services and meet 
organizational requirements. The end result of this assessment may 
include recommendations for amendments or updates to existing policies, 
the development of new procedures, and a restructuring of work flow 
through the department.</P>
<H4><I>Aspen has compiled a selected bibliography on HIM department evaluation 
and productivity measurement. To receive your free copy of this 
bibliography, or for more information on how Aspen can help you assess 
your department, call Meryl Bloomrosen at (800)-395-5055.</I></H4>

Information Tool Provides Code Conversion</A></H2>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services has recently developed and 
released a computerized information tool which provides users with 
conversions of ICD-9-CM codes from calendar years 1985 to 1993 (fiscal 
years 1986 to 1994). The system is intended to help users track annual 
changes in diagnosis and procedure codes.
<P>
The system (the official electronic version of code changes) was jointly 
developed and approved by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The purpose of the 
system is to provide an automated and systematic approach to tracking 
code modifications. The system is updated after the publication of the 
final rule on code changes in the Federal register.
<P>
<I>The software is available on diskette for $265.00. For more information 
contact: HCFA, Bureau of Data Management and Strategy, Office of 
Statistics and Data Management, 6325 Security Blvd., 3-A-10, 7008

<IMG align=left hspace=3 SRC="aspnbug2.gif"><H2><A NAME="enterococ">Coding 
Update: Classification of Enterococcus</A></H2>
<P>
<I>Cecil's Textbook of Medicine</I> classifies enterococci to Group D streptococcus 
infections. This grouping, according to the <I>Merck Manual</I>, is based on the 
Lancefield Groups A-K and K-T. Group D consists of two major categories: enterococcus 
<I>(Enterococcus faecalis, E. durans, E. faecium)</I> and nonenterococcus <I>(S. bovis, 
S. equinus)</I>. Enterococci are inhabitants of human intestinal flora and are a major 
cause of nosocomial and community-acquired sepsis. <I>Enterococcus faecalis (S. 
faecalis)</I>, in particular, causes urinary tract infections, peritonitis, cellulitis, wound 
infection, bacteremia and endocarditis.
<P>
Although medical reference books such as <i>Cecil's Textbook</i> classify enterococcus 
to Group D streptococcus, the ICD-9-CM indexes it to 041.4 
(E. coli). A call to Delray Green at the National Center for Health Statistics revealed that 
this was an indexing error. The correct code should be 041.04. We expect that a 
correction will be made with the 10/l/94 ICD-9-CM addenda.

NAME="outsourc">Outsourcing Your Transcription Services</A></H2>
<P>
Accurate and timely documentation is vital for quality patient care and 
accurate reimbursement. Many providers have turned to contract 
management support and outsourcing some medical record functions. If 
you are currently evaluating transcription services, Aspen suggests you 
consider the following questions:
<DIR>
<LI>Do you have equipment that needs to be updated? Look at what the service has to 
offer. You can have the doctors call a number which will connect them to equipment 
outside the hospital, provided by the service.
<LI>If you have an up-to-date digital system, how will the service hook-up to it and 
manage it? Who pays for the phone lines and monthly service? Is this included in a rate?
<LI>Do you want the service to pick up cassettes? When and how will this be 
accomplished?
<LI>How will the transcribed reports be delivered? Will the proper number of copies be 
included? 
<LI>Can reports be printed in your facility? How can you get a computer hook-up?
<LI>Do we pay by the line or the page?
<LI>How often will we be invoiced?
<LI>What are the terms and conditions of the contract languages?
<LI>What constitutes a line of transcription? What is the number of characters? How 
many lines make up a page? How are they counted?
<LI>What about <I>stat</I> work? Can reports be provided within two hours?
<LI>Routine turnaround must be within 24 hours. Will this occur?
<li>How does the company monitor the quality of its work?
</DIR>
<P>
The more information you ask up front, the fewer surprises you will 
encounter once you start the service.</P>
For more information on how Aspen can help you evaluate outsourcing transcription 
services, please call Paul Gustafson at (800) 395-5055.<p>

<H2>New Correct Coding Combinations</H2>

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) recently released guidelines that define correct coding practices for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). The coding practices will be the basis of national Medicare policy for payment of physician claims using CPT, effective with claims received on or after January 1, 1996. There are two main types of coding edits/combinations that have been implemented: comprehensive and component coding combinations and mutually exclusive coding combinations that represent services and/or procedures that would not or could not be performed concurrently based on the CPT code description or standard medical practice. A copy of this information can be obtained on paper or electronically from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) at (703) 487-4650.<P>

<IMG Align=left SRC="rxpill.gif"><B>Lamivudine.</B> The FDA approved lamivudine (3TC; <I>Epivir</I> by Glaxo Wellcome) for use in combination with zidovudine (AZT; <I>Retrovir</I> by Glaxo Wellcome) under its accelerated approval process for treatment of HIV infection when therapy is warranted based on clinical or immunological evidence of disease progression. Clinical trials have shown the combination therapy to increase CD4 cell counts; however, there are no data on lamivudine's potential effects on clinical outcome of HIV, such as the incidence of opportunistic infection or survival. Lamivudine is the first HIV indication approved by the FDA for initial therapy since zidovudine monotherapy was approved in 1987. The dosage is 150 mg twice daily in combination with zidovudine.<P>

<B>Saquinavir.</B> Also approved by the FDA for HIV infection was saquinavir (<I>Invirase</I> by Hoffman-LaRoche), which received the fastest approval of any antiviral agent for HIV with only 3 months passing between the drug's NDA filing and its approval. It is indicated for use in combination with nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine (AZT; <I>Retrovir</I> by Glaxo Wellcome) and zalcitabine (ddC; <I>Hivid</I> by Hoffman-LaRoche) for the treatment of advanced HIV. Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor (it disables the enzyme protease, which is necessary for HIV reproduction). Combination therapy has proven to increase CD4 cell counts, and best results were shown when used with a nucleoside analog the patient hadn't tried before. The dosage is 600 mg 3 times daily in combination with a nucleoside analog.<P>

<B>Glimepiride.</B> The FDA approved the Type II diabetes (non-insulin-dependent) drug glimepiride (<I>Amaryl</I> by Hoechst Marion Roussel) for once-daily use as monotherapy or in combination with insulin to lower blood glucose in diabetes patients who cannot control their glucose level through diet and exercise.<P>

<B>Amifostine.</B> The FDA approved US Bioscience's cytoprotective agent <I>Ethyol</I> (amifostine) for the reduction of cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated cisplatin (<I>Platinol</I>) use in advanced ovarian cancer patients.<P>

<B>Cetirizine.</B> The FDA approved Pfizer's antihistamine <I>Zyrtec</I> (cetirizine) for treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies), seasonal allergic rhinitis, and chronic urticaria (itching and hives). Although Pfizer maintains <I>Zyrtec</I> is the most widely prescribed antihistamine in Europe, FDA approval took 7 years. The once-daily tablet will be available in 5 and 10 mg.<P>

<B>Ibutilide.</B> (<I>Corvert</I> by Pharmacia and Upjohn.) <I>Corvert</I> is approved by the FDA for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythms. Other drugs used to treat fibrillation and flutter are not rapidly effective, and treatment often requires titration and close observation for 1 to 3 days.<P>

<B>Riluzole.</B> The FDA approved riluzole (<I>Rilutek</I> by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), making it the first approved drug for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease). In one trial, riluzole patients lived an average of 3 months longer than placebo patients. The drug is neither a cure for ALS nor is it able to stop the muscle paralysis that leads to progressive nerve damage. But the drug has shown some effect on the fatal disease for which there has previously been no treatment.<P>

Since developing our first Web site in late 1994, Aspen has created quite an impressive array of Web sites for both commercial and government clients. We work closely with our customers to ensure that their Web sites are developed with a rich content base, and that the information is of the caliber that will bring visitors back to the site frequently and on a regular basis. Our capabilities include not only content development, but also graphic design, and development of interactive features such as video and audio clips, databases, online forms, surveys, and discussion forums. In addition, we can work with clients to identify business applications that will help contribute to their long-term success.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
Aspen is the leading supplier of clearinghouse services to the federal government, having provided such services to numerous agencies within the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Justice since 1974.  Clearinghouses, or information centers, are vehicles used by sponsoring agencies to help disseminate program, research, and policy information to their constituency audiences.  These audiences range from federal and state policy officials to local community leaders; from direct service providers to academicians and other researchers; and from members of the media to members of the general public.  Clearinghouses offer these audiences ready access to the information they need to make more informed decisions, identify solutions to common problems, and better understand current trends that may affect future directions.<P>

Aspen designs and manages each clearinghouse in accordance with the specialized dissemination needs of sponsoring agencies.  Most clearinghouses involve performance of the following functions:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Information collection and analysis.</B>  Aspen builds centralized repositories of information on subject areas of coverage of each clearinghouse. Types of information collected may include documents, program descriptions, funding sources, and names and contact information of subject experts. We identify materials to collect by screening internal and external information resources and acquire those most relevant to clearinghouse user interests.<P>

<B>Database development and management.</B> Information collected is synthesized and organized in databases that facilitate access and use.  We apply the latest technologies to create easy-to-use databases that enable individuals to search and retrieve the precise information being sought, whether it is a publication date of a particular study, a telephone number of a local organization, or a statistic from a recently released research report.<P>

<B>Reference and library services.</B>  Individuals seeking information assistance most often contact Aspen's clearinghouses via toll-free 800 lines.  Reference specialists, who are subject matter experts, help callers locate the information they need by reviewing clearinghouse resources maintained and offer a range of responses that match specific needs.  Responses may include providing results of a database search, sending a publication, or making a referral to an external organization. Many of Aspen's clearinghouses also offer library services, including public reading room access, interlibrary loan, and copy reproduction services, which further enhance the identification and acquisition of needed information. <P>

<B>Networking and outreach.</B>  Aspen conducts extensive networking and outreach activities to promote agency initiatives and to inform individuals of clearinghouse products and services. We routinely attend professional conferences and represent client agencies at conference exhibitions.  These exhibitions enable staff  to meet with conference participants, discuss their issues of concern, and direct them to the publications and other resources available that may help resolve concerns.  We also conduct targeted promotional mailings, conduct special marketing to intermediary groups such as professional associations and media organizations, and host clearinghouse briefings and tours. <P>

<B><A HREF = "servcomm.html">Publications and product development</A>.</B> Aspen provides editorial, graphics, and production support in the development of publications distributed by the clearinghouses.  These publications include research reports, program evaluations, journals, bulletins, and newsletters that describe agency sponsored initiatives.  We also create promotional brochures, catalogs, fact sheets, conference exhibits, audiovisual presentations, and other materials that highlight clearinghouse resources and capabilities.<P>

<B><A HREF = "servdist.html">Mailing list management</A>.</B> To support dissemination needs of each clearinghouse, Aspen maintains comprehensive mailing lists composed of audiences served by the sponsoring agencies.  We typically compile mailing lists of registered users, who are individuals who have completed registration forms indicating interest in receiving materials distributed by the clearinghouse. We also develop targeted mail lists, which reflect specific audiences (i.e., state legislators or local community leaders) that sponsoring agencies wish to reach. We have developed sophisticated methods for acquiring, maintaining, and updating mail list information in automated database systems that facilitate access and generation of mailing labels and help to ensure accuracy and currency.<P>

<B><A HREF = "servdist.html">Document distribution</A>.</B>  Each Aspen clearinghouse has extensive document distribution requirements, including publication receipt and storage, inventory management, order processing and fulfillment, and performance of targeted mailings. <P>

<B>Electronic dissemination services.</B>  Increasingly, Aspen is using new information technologies to enhance access and expedite delivery of information available from our clearinghouses.  We design and manage bulletin board systems that enable users to learn of new resources available, order publications, and establish electronic forums or discussion groups with other users.  We offer fax-on-demand and fax broadcasting technologies that facilitate dissemination of time sensitive materials. We also provide a range of <A href="isdhome.html">Internet services</A>, including gopher, World Wide Web, and listservs.<P>

<H3>Legal Information Management Services Group</H3>

<a href="http://www.legaltechcpi.com/NewYork97/index.html"><img width=50 height=80 border=0 align=left src="tech.gif"></a>

On January 27-29, stop by Aspen's booth (#220-224) at New York Legal Tech in the New York Hilton & Towers, 1335 Avenue of the Americas. We will be demonstrating and discussing various strategies to control the cost of litigation, and presenting our many internet services capabilities.<p>

Aspen's Legal Information Management Services (LIMS) Group is unparalleled in supplying litigation support services to both commercial and Federal Government clients. The LIMS 
professionals offer specialized skills in discovery and document processing as well as database creation and online retrieval to meet the unique requirements of our customers.<P>

LIMS understands and is prepared to deliver the broad spectrum of services that organizations involved in litigation require: evidentiary document file management, legal analysis and research, and customized database products. The division also conducts needs assessments and statistical analyses; designs integrated databases; and develops alternative ways to collect, process, and disseminate information.<P>

Two divisions offer specialized services for LIMS clients. The Federal Litigation Services Division as well as the Commercial Division provide customers with information management services, including project planning and management, document acquisition 
management, document screening, document imaging/optical character recognition processing, document indexing and coding, and document center management.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Federal Litigation Services Division
</H3>

For a decade, we have provided Federal Government agencies with incomparable information management and litigation support. Our team of trained and experienced professionals work in partnership with the Government to streamline document processing and information management activities and to help reduce the costs of litigation. Our extensive experience has encompassed some of the largest and most complex matters ever contested, including cases involving the Bank of Commercial and Credit International (BCCI) and the South Florida Everglades.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Commercial Division</H3>

Aspen's team of litigation professionals within the LIMS Commercial Group has successfully provided legal support for many of the major law firms and corporations in the United States. Our staff has worked in virtually every area of the law, including breach of contract, negligence, antitrust, securities, pharmaceuticals, insurance, and many others. We realize that our clients have a broad range of litigation requirements and are prepared to work very closely with them throughout the entire project, either onsite at 
their offices or in our own facilities. The LIMS Commercial Group offers superior service, including project planning and system design, discovery management, document screening, document optical/imaging character recognition processing, document 
indexing and coding, and depository and facilities management.<P>

In addition, Aspen offers extensive database and image retrieval support through AspenView, the industry's first litigation software to use image management technology to bring the full power of
imaging to the computer desktop. Our staff designed AspenView specifically to meet the unique requirements of litigating attorneys and their support staff. With AspenView, users have total
control over the thousands of documents involved with the discovery process. Users can locate key documents, add value to them, continually access them, track their use, and print them quickly and at low cost.<P>

<H3>Health Information Services</H3>

Aspen's Health Information Services (HIS) division assists Federal Government agencies; health care providers, users, and employers; and third-party payers with maintaining health information systems. Aspen ensures that the systems accurately reflect the quality of care provided and the costs of services rendered and that they are in full compliance with reporting requirements. In addition, the HIS Division, through the  <!-- Link Tag -->
Program Management Integration Contract, provides technical, administrative, and managerial support to the Health Affairs community.<P>

Our highly skilled staff provide a broad spectrum of services, including coding and abstracting of health records or claims data, auditing previously coded records or claims, assisting with the management of accounts receivables, and developing medical information systems and health care databases. Moreover, through the identification of coding mistakes or incomplete data, we assist our clients with recapturing revenues otherwise lost due to these errors.<P>

Other services that Aspen offers its health provider clients include the development of programs and approaches to improve employee and organizational productivity;  implementation and evaluation of health information systems; and the identification and implementation of cost-efficient state-of-the-art systems, such as optical disc technology.<P>

<H3>Health Communication and Patient Education</H3> 

Communication plays an essential role in disease prevention and health promotion. Health communication programs can raise awareness of a health issue, problem, or solution; increase demand for health services; and reinforce knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. However, effective communication is a challenge for many reasons. Information about health issues is often complex and technical in nature. Many diseases arouse fear in patients and interfere with their ability to receive messages. Health information may be inconclusive, controversial, and subject to change as new research findings are released.<P>

<B>Twenty years of health communications experience.</B> More than two decades of working in the health communication and information dissemination fields has helped Aspen Systems develop sharp technical skills and a keen sensitivity to the information needs of users. Aspen's approach to print and electronic publishing emphasizes the company's experience in translating research results and health promotion messages into user-friendly information products for patients and health professionals. Use of state-of-the-art technology allows Aspen to respond to new research findings by rapidly creating new products or modifying existing ones.  In the past 5 years, Aspen has collected 10 top awards for writing, layout and design, achievement of purpose, and cost-effectiveness of products developed for Federal health agencies. Recently, our World Wide Web (WWW) sites have begun to garner awards as well. The Aspen-developed Web site for the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse was judged to be among the top 5 percent of sites reviewed by Point Communications.<P>

<B>Aspen's experienced and talented staff of communication professionals.</B> Health information projects constitute one of Aspen's major lines of business, employing seasoned WWW designers, writers, editors, and graphic artists. These professionals work closely with other Aspen staff, including physicians, nurses, public health workers, and case managers, to produce materials that bring tailored health promotion messages to a wide variety of audiences. Complementing their academic training, these subject experts gain valuable knowledge by answering questions posed by patients and health professionals over the phone and through the mail. Through this experience, they learn about patients' information needs at different stages in their disease process and determine their preferred channels of communication. This awareness has immeasurably enhanced the patient education materials developed by Aspen. In addition, Aspen's multicultural, multilingual staff bring their understanding of the cultures of various population groups to bear on health communication tasks, ensuring that printed and electronic materials will speak to targeted audiences in the most convincing way. <P>

<B>Partnerships strengthen project results.</B> Aspen staff work in close partnership with health-related organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association, National Black Nurses Association, National Council of La Raza, American Cancer Society, Kaiser Family Foundation, and American Red Cross as well as many State and local groups. These working alliances result in the enhancement of projects by drawing upon the strengths of each partner.<P>

<B>Examples of Aspen's health communication and patient education projects.</B> The print- and electronic-based projects described below illustrate Aspen's range and depth of experience in the health communications arena. <P>

</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4>
We offer full-service order fulfillment, storage, inventory management, and mailing services in support of both government and commercial clients. We operate three state-of-the-art distribution
centers in the Baltimore-Washington corridor that combined represent more than 160,000 square feet of storage and operations space. Each year these facilities distribute more than 41 million printed and other product materials.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Order Fulfillment Services</H3>

Our experienced distribution management team will work with clients to implement an order fulfillment process that is tailored to your specific needs and provides a cost-efficient alternative to handling order processing and customer service support within your organization.<P>

Aspen's telephone support operations are supported by a state-of-the-art call management system, complete with reporting capabilities to analyze call volumes. We offer experience in
handling payment processing for orders received by phone and mail. Our fulfillment operations are supported by integrated order fulfillment/inventory management systems that can be customized and scaled to a particular organization's needs.<P>

The order fulfillment staff are experienced in handling a variety of product types, including books, pamphlets, newsletters, maps, audio and video tapes, and CD-ROM's. Work flow management procedures ensure that orders are filled in an accurate and timely manner. Packing procedures ensure that products are received by customers without damage.<P>

We use all major carriers including the United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service, Roadway Package Systems, and Federal Express for small package shipments, and a variety of air freight and common carriers for volume shipments. Aspen's shipping operations

<HR>
<H3>Storage and Records Management</H3> 

Aspen's distribution operations have more than 160,000 square feet of high-density storage space for bulk storage of printed and other information products. This space is also used for storage in support of our records management services. Aspen has developed highly sophisticated inventory management procedures supported by automated inventory management systems to track and accurately store materials in a cost-efficient environment. The inventory management processes include the use of bar coding technologies for efficient updating of inventory records.<P>

Our records management and retrieval services provide timely storage of materials, accurate maintenance of inventory records, and quick turnaround of retrieval requests. In addition to our storage of physical paper records, Aspen can provide complete imaging capability for <A HREF = "servscan.html">electronic storage of information</A>.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Mailing Services</H3>

Aspen also provides mailing support services that include materials development through our <A HREF = "servcomm.html">Communication Services</A>, insertion and collation of mailing packages, labeling, and bulk mailing support. Our labeling services are processed using a state-of-the-art computerized ink jet labeling system.

<HR>
<H3>Electronic Dissemination Support</H3>

Aspen has developed extensive capabilities to supplement traditional paper product distribution through use of electronic dissemination vehicles. These services include interactive voice response order taking, fax-on-demand, print-on-demand, and online distribution through the Internet. Each of these services provides opportunities for cost savings in distributing information.<P>

<B>Interactive Voice Response Ordering.</B> Aspen has developed an order-taking system that enables customers with a touch-tone phone to place an order for materials without talking to a customer
service representative. This service is ideal for providing 24-hour/7-day-a-week access to customers who wish to place an order for materials at their convenience. This system helps reduce the costs associated with staffing a customer service response operation.<P>

<B>Fax-on-Demand.</B> We can provide fax-on-demand services for organizations that wish to provide an alternative to traditional hard-copy distribution of a paper product. Our fax-on-demand services enable a customer to call into a user-friendly menu and to select materials to be faxed automatically to their own fax machine. This greatly increases response time for the customer. The system has payment processing options through use of credit cards, including card number validation capabilities.<P>

<B>Print-on-Demand.</B> Aspen can assist your organization in cutting storage costs for printed materials by providing print-on-demand services. Print only the copies of a paper document or pamphlet that you actually need rather than paying the costs for storing excess or used copies. The print-on-demand services provide high-quality black and white reproductions using high-speed laser printing capabilities. This service is ideal for low-demand products or for creating an archive of older materials that you would like to keep available but don't want to continue to pay storage costs for. Through our <A HREF = "servscan.html">Image Processing Center</A> we can assist you in converting your current inventory from paper to image files for long-term storage and use with our print-on-demand services.<P>

<B>Internet Distribution.</B> In today's environment, dissemination of printed material through the Internet has been an increasingly attractive alternative to traditional distribution processes. Aspen is well positioned to assist organizations in developing an Internet dissemination program that meets each organization's specific distribution requirements and expands its reach internationally through the Internet. Our <A HREF = "isdhome.html">Internet Services Division</A> provides a full range of Internet-related services, including site development, hosting services, and technical systems support for organizations interested in tapping into this new media for information dissemination, marketing,
and product distribution support.<P>

<H2>Corporate Communications Support and Publishing</H2><BR>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4>
The staff of Aspen's Communications Services Department are accomplished professionals. Over nearly two decades, they have honed the skills needed to create and effectively disseminate a
wide range of information products -- from developing media kits, newsletters, brochures, technical reports, resource directories, and conference materials, to creating CD-ROM's and interactive computer products.<P>

Working within established publishing industry guidelines, 80 communications specialists provide Aspen's clients with full-service communications and publishing services. Supported by a state-of-the-art computerized desktop publishing network, the editorial and graphics staff approach publications and product development as a team experience. In support of its clients, this unit creates more than 1,500 products annually.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Editorial Services</H3> 

Our editors offer a full range of writing and editing services tailored to each client's specific needs. Matrix staffing allows correlation between project-specific demands and editorial subject-area expertise.  This staffing approach enables our editorial services staff to work in close conjunction with the substantive knowledge represented within Aspen's program divisions. We can also draw on our well-established consultant and freelance editorial pool to address specific project needs.<P>

Writing and editing capabilities include:<P>

<UL>
<LI> original writing and research<P>

<LI>substantive editing for organization, structure, sense, comprehensiveness, readability, and polish<P>

<LI>proofreading and copyediting for grammar, consistency, and compliance with U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) and other appropriate styles
</UL><P>

Tailoring editorial output to specific product needs, the group follows established quality control routines that allow for client input as a product progresses.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Graphics Services</H3> 

Aspen's award-winning design staff provide design solutions for a broad array of information materials. In addition to traditional materials such as newsletters, journals, books, and reports, our graphics staff creates logos, videos, banners, room-size full-color exhibits, and other conference materials such as signs, overheads, tabletop displays, and name badges. We can also draw on graphics experts in our freelance and consultant pools to augment our inhouse graphics talent.<P>

Aspen's approach to design development demands the involvement of our clients at all stages. Particularly on major projects, the design group follows a sequence of steps beginning with thumbnail sketches for client review and selection and ending with full-color design comprehensives that approximate the finished published piece. Because of the range of artistic skills on staff, we can provide clients with hand-drawn illustrations as well as sophisticated computer-generated graphics. All print products are produced on an integrated desktop publishing network that supports both the editorial and graphics functions.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Special Projects</H3>

A separate creative group within Aspen's graphics staff, the Special Projects Unit, also uses multimedia software to create products integrating graphics, animation, sound, and video. The Special Projects Unit is responsible for the creation of all nontraditional products including exhibits, packaging, videos, and interactive multimedia products.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Production Services</H3>

Aspen's Communication Services is rounded out by its production group, which provides traffic control for the 1,500 products produced annually by the department. As part of our support for our clients, the production group vends over $2 million annually of printed or manufactured products from full-color brochures to silk-screened banners and exhibits.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Desktop Publishing System</H3>

Our integrated desktop publishing system offers the capabilities to produce a wide range of sharp, visually attractive information products. Working in both PC and Macintosh environments, we have the capability to send and receive files and messages via e-mail; transfer files to disks, videotape, or CD-ROM; convert software between PC and Macintosh platforms; and produce a wide variety of traditional and electronic publications using dozens of software packages.<P>

<H2>Document Scanning</H2><BR>
</CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=4>
We operate an image scanning facility in our headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. This state-of-the-art facility has the capacity to scan up to 200,000 pages per day and to provide quality control, document indexing, OCR/ICR, and CD-ROM burning functions. We can provide image scanning or microfilming services at our conversion facility or onsite. We can also convert microfilm to image format, and with our production capacity printers, we can generate paper blowback from image and/or microfilm.<P>

Drawing on our experience with imaging systems, we work with you to select the vendors, applications, and products most suited to your project needs. We can also recommend scanning, printing, and storage subsystems; and network components required to support your applications.<P>

Aspen offers extensive experience in advanced optical imaging technology. For example, for one of our clients, more than 1.7 million pages were scanned in 6 months, including 400,000 pages converted from microfilm.<P>

<B>Onsite scanning and scanning to ASCII file.</B> Aspen's 3,000-square-foot Imaging Center located at corporate headquarters allows Aspen to meet extremely tight deadlines with comprehensiveness and accuracy. Aspen has significant experience converting source documents to full-text ASCII file format using high-speed scanning systems. When performing scanning services, Aspen uses document control procedures developed and refined over many years of experience reproducing evidentiary materials.<P>

Aspen-owned hardcopy scanning equipment includes two Photomatrix 6000 scanners, one high-speed Kodak Imagelink 900 scanner, and three Ricoh IS-400 flatbed scanners. Aspen-owned film digitizing equipment includes a Mekel scanner with specialized enhancement technology from IPT.<P>

In terms of image storage, Aspen currently has 45 Gb of magnetic media storage on its optical imaging LAN. Aspen either archives the stored images to a 4-mil digital audiotape or "burns" or writes the stored images to WORM disks or CD-ROM's.<P>

<B>Offsite scanning.</B> Aspen also has the capability to scan source documents at field locations nationwide and overseas. Source document images are captured at offsite locations, and the resulting image files are sent to Aspen's image processing facility in Rockville for subsequent processing that includes optical character recognition conversion, editing, and loading of ASCII files to output media.<P>

<B>Digital image printing.</B> The Imaging Center includes a Xerox Docutech, a Ricoh laser printer, and a Hewlett Packard printer. This system, which can be placed on our existing optical imaging LAN, is a combination high-volume laser printer and xerography machine with the capability to accept the originals in paper or electronic form.<P>
